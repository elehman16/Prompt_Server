temporomandibular joint function and swallowing function of stroke patients presenting
limited mouth opening. [Subjects] Fourteen subjects with post-stroke hemiparesis
presenting limited mouth opening were randomly assigned to either the experimental group
or the control group, with 7 subjects in each group. [Methods] Subjects in the
experimental group participated in a stomatognathic alignment exercise program that
consisted of mobility exercises of the TMJ and neck and postural correction. Main outcome
measures were neck mobility, the active maximum range of mouth opening, the
craniomandibular index (CMI), and the Mann assessment of swallowing ability (MASA) score.
[Results] The changes in the values of the range of mouth opening, CMI, MASA, and all the
parameters of neck mobility were significantly different between the groups. Furthermore,
post-test values appeared to be significantly different for the range of mouth opening,
the craniomandibular index, and the MASA scores between the groups (p&#x0003e;0.05).
[Conclusion] Stomatognathic alignment exercise may improve TMJ function and swallowing
function of patients with post-stroke hemiparesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Exercise therapy</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Temporomandibular joint</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Approximately 50% of patients with post-stroke hemiparesis present with disabilities in
facial control, and impairment of orofacial and mandibular functions is frequently involved.
Clinical observation of stroke patients indicates they have greater variability and lower
temporomandibular joint (TMJ) muscle activity on the affected side with a decreased bite
force<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, representative of a reduction in
TMJ function. Various functional tasks such as chewing, swallowing, and speaking are carried
out by the coordinated action of the stomatognathic system, which includes skeletal and
dental components, orofacial soft tissues, the TMJ, and the masticatory muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Functional adaptation of the TMJ may be
essential to break down food into small pieces by chewing and swallow them, as it is
involved in mouth opening and mastication during the initial stages of oral function.
Swallowing abnormalities are often observed in patients who are recovering from stroke, and
are likely to result in malnutrition and pulmonary complications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Secondary changes in the early presentation of stroke have been attributed to neurological
and biomechanical changes including hypertonus, excessive muscular co-activation, muscle
weakness, contracture, and increased muscle stiffness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Increased muscle tonus in the flexors of the neck and upper body
could result in shortening of the flexors, which would further result in mechanical
impairment of their actions, consequently altering body alignment and movement range.
Furthermore, general symptoms of muscle weakness in patients after stroke can influence the
postural alignment of the head and neck, resulting in asymmetrical positioning of their
bodies due to postural changes and muscle shortening<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Postural abnormalities may influence the mandibular position<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, which may lead to result in changes in
proprioceptive and periodontal input, affecting movement patterns and postural
stability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Postural and movement faults
in the craniocervical regions and impairments in their control may be the primary reason for
the decline in the function of the stomatognathic system, including the TMJ, and resultant
swallowing problems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. An apparent
relationship between poorly aligned posture and TMJ dysfunction suggests that the initiation
of active exercise to achieve postural correction is a valid treatment option for minimising
these symptoms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although there are many therapeutic approaches for managing TMJ dysfunction, invasive
methods cannot be used for stroke patients with poor health; therefore, conservative
treatment should be considered first. Active exercises have been used alone and in
combination with other treatments. Along with behavioural interventions (e.g., sensory
stimulation of orofacial and pharyngeal structures, the use of modified food consistency,
and postural changes to affect bolus flow)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, specific exercises to normalise the swallowing reflex,
strengthening exercises for the orofacial and pharyngolaryngeal muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, active and passive range of motion exercises of the TMJ
and neck, and postural correction exercises may be more appropriate for improving swallowing
function. These exercises have also been commonly used as a therapeutic solution for the
recovery of TMJ function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>During the rehabilitation of stroke patients, it is important to consider TMJ function and
swallowing function because of the negative impact of their impairment on the functional
performance of daily activities. Thus, therapeutic knowledge about impairments in TMJ
function and swallowing function are well known, and further research should focus on
exploring specific treatment approaches that can be easily applied instead of elucidating
the effects of the therapeutic methods previously reported. However, to our knowledge, data
have not been published on the effectiveness of exercise therapy for improving TMJ and neck
mobility and correcting postural alignment to promote TMJ function and swallowing function
of hemiparetic stroke patients. In the present study, we investigated the effects of
stomatognathic alignment exercise on TMJ function and swallowing function of stroke patients
presenting limited mouth opening.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> General characteristics of subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EG</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male / female)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 / 2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 / 2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.71 &#x000b1; 12.46</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.14 &#x000b1; 12.31</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Onset duration (months)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">43.00 &#x000b1; 27.90</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.57 &#x000b1; 16.53</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stroke type (hemorrhage / infarction)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 / 2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 / 3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Paretic side (right / left)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 / 3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 / 2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MBI</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">47.14 &#x000b1; 15.90</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48.14 &#x000b1; 19.87</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMSE-K</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.86 &#x000b1; 5.43</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.14 &#x000b1; 5.90</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>EG, experimental group; CG, control group; MBI, modified Barthel index; MMSE-K,

participate in this study, 17 subjects failed to meet the inclusion criteria and 2 subjects
(one in each group) were excluded from data analysis due to irregular participation in the
experimental intervention and drop out following grouping. Prior to participation in the
study, subjects were provided with a detailed description about all of the experimental
procedures and their safety, and they signed a written informed consent form. The general
characteristics of the subjects are summarised in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table
1</xref>.</p><p>We measured neck mobility (flexion, extension, rotation, and lateral flexion), TMJ function
(mouth opening range and CMI), and swallowing function using the Mann assessment of
swallowing ability (MASA) score. Measurements of neck mobility were performed using a tape
measure (Hoechstmass, Sulzbach, Germany), with a modification of the method suggested by
Norkin and White<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. All measurements of
neck mobility were performed with patients in a sitting position with back support. During
the measurements, the head and neck were placed in the anatomical position, and the thoracic
and lumbar spines were supported by a backrest. To avoid compensation through scapular and
spinal motions, the subjects were asked to stabilise the shoulder girdle by holding the
bottom of the chair. Neck flexion and extension were determined by measuring the distance
between the suprasternal notch and the lower tip of the chin at maximal flexion and
extension of the neck, respectively. The measurements of rotation and lateral flexion were
performed on the affected side and the unaffected side, respectively, thus reflecting the
restriction of cervical movement due to soft tissues in the neck region on the affected
side. Neck rotation on the affected side was determined by measuring the distance between
the tip of the chin and the suprasternal notch of the sternum at maximal neck rotation, and
the lateral flexion of the neck on the unaffected side was measured using the distance
between the acromion process and the mastoid process of the skull of the affected side at
maximal lateral flexion of the neck. The values obtained from 3 trials were averaged to
obtain the final value.</p><p>The range of mouth opening represents the interincisal distance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup> in the active maximum range, and can be measured using
vernier calipers (Dial-15, Tajima, Tokyo, Japan) with a precision of 0.01&#x02005;cm. TMJ function
was assessed using the CMI, which consists of the dysfunction index (DI), which evaluates
the extent of TMJ dysfunction and the palpation index (PI), which evaluates the tenderness
severity of the orofacial and neck muscles. The total CMI score is the sum of the DI and PI
scores divided by 2. The scores of all 3 indices range from 0 to 1, and a high score
indicates a greater dysfunction in the TMJ and the surrounding muscles. The CMI shows good
inter-rater and intra-rater reliabilities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, swallowing function was assessed using the MASA,
which is a comprehensive clinical assessment of dysphagia in a bedside setting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The MASA has 24 clinical items that assess oral sensory and motor
aspects of swallowing, cooperation and auditory comprehension, tongue function, and
functional assessment of swallowing. Each item is scored according to severity, and
swallowing impairment is determined by a composite score out of a total of 200. A higher
score indicates better swallowing function. The MASA has been found to be valid and reliable
for the assessment of patients with post-stroke hemiparesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Subjects were randomly assigned to either the EG or CG group. For randomization, they were
asked to blindly draw a card from an envelope containing 2 cards. All subjects received a
daily 1-hour functional training in their routine rehabilitation schedule, which consisted
of mat exercise and therapist-guided practice of functional activities, such as sit-to-stand
exercise and stepping to reinforce normal movement pattern. In addition, the subjects in the
EG group participated in the stomatognathic alignment exercise program, with an average
duration of 1 hour, three times a week for 4 weeks (12 sessions in total). The outcome
measurements were performed before and after the 4-week training. The stomatognathic
alignment exercise program consisted of exercises to increase the mobility of the neck and
TMJ (active range of motion [ROM] exercises for the neck and TMJ) and to correct head and
neck posture (chin tuck exercise and anterior chest stretching exercise), as recommended by
Oh et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the chin tuck exercise,
the chin was pulled backwards over the upper part of the sternum to position the patient's
ears in line with the tips of the shoulders. This was repeated 10 times with a 10-second
hold in supine, and 5 times with a 2-minute hold in standing against a wall. In the anterior
chest stretching exercise, the head and shoulder blades were pressed back against a wall
while maintaining the chin tuck position and standing against the wall with a straight back;
the arms were maintained at 45&#x000b0; shoulder abduction, with the elbows fully extended and the
forearms supinated. This exercise was performed 10 times with a 10-second hold. In the
active ROM exercises for the neck and TMJ, flexion, extension, and lateral flexion and
rotation of the neck were performed on the affected and unaffected sides, followed by
maximal mouth opening, protrusion, and lateral excursion on the sides for the TMJ while
sitting on a chair with a backrest. These exercises were performed with a 10-second hold at
the end of the range of motion for each motion, with 2 sets of 10 repetitions performed for
each motion.</p><p>Data were analysed using SPSS 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All values are expressed
as medians and inter-quartile ranges. Because our sample size was small, we used
non-parametric analysis in order to determine the effects of the exercise program on TMJ
function and swallowing function of patients with post-stroke hemiparesis. Within-group and
between-group comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test, respectively. The significance level for identifying statistical
differences was chosen as 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Comparison of pre- and post-test neck mobility between the experimental and

both TMJ dysfunction and swallowing problems of post-stroke patients. This study was
designed to elucidate an easy and appropriate treatment approach for TMJ dysfunction and
swallowing disorders by eliminating possible factors that induce these symptoms. Our
findings demonstrate that stomatognathic alignment exercise may be beneficially used to
improve TMJ function and swallowing function of patients with post-stroke hemiparesis.</p><p>Clinical observations indicate that many patients with post-stroke hemiparesis generally
have poor posture. Their sitting postures are typically characterized formed by a backward
pelvic tilt, flexed trunk, and forward head position with a tendency of lateral trunk
flexion and lateral pelvic tilt with consequent asymmetrical weight bearing on the
buttocks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Forward head posture
results from the shortening of the posterior neck muscles (including the suboccipital,
splenii, semispinalis, and upper trapezius muscles) and the sternocleidomastoid muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscular and ligamentary connections of
the TMJ with the cervical region form a functional complex in the craniocervical and
mandibular regions, and postural abnormality in these regions is often associated with TMJ
dysfunction. In the present study, the main focus of the stomatognathic alignment exercise
included enhancement of the mobility of the neck and the TMJ, and restoration of postural
alignment of the head and neck, with the aim of achieving functional improvement of the
stomatognathic system.</p><p>We found that the range of mouth opening and the CMI score, which reflects TMJ function,
appeared to be significantly improved after stomatognathic alignment exercise. Furthermore,
the improved CMI score met the requirement for the average score of healthy individuals
(i.e., &#x0003e;0.13 points on the CMI)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
These findings suggest that stomatognathic alignment exercise, with a focus on improving the
flexibility of the TMJ and neck as well as postural correction, is essential for managing
general symptoms of impaired TMJ function after stroke and can be used clinically. The
effectiveness of exercise therapy is supported by previous studies that have investigated
specific methods for treating individuals with TMJ dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>TMJ dysfunction is reported to be strongly associated with a decrease in chewing function,
which is probably a factor contributing to dysphagia and malnutrition, and has an important
impact on the quality of life related to oral health of patients with post-stroke
hemiparesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Limitations in TMJ and
neck mobility may decrease the ability to chew by repetitive mandibular depression and
elevation, and may negatively influence lingual mobility as well as anterosuperior movement
of the hyoid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. This indicates the
importance of mobility exercises for the TMJ and neck regions in the achievement of airway
closure, for decrease of aspiration risk, by facilitating hyoid-laryngeal elevation.
Therefore, it is important to encourage this type of exercise to improve orofacial and
pharyngolaryngeal movements during swallowing by patients presenting TMJ and neck stiffness,
enabling them to re-learn the use of the swallowing-related muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the MASA score for swallowing
function was &#x0003e;170 points, which indicates the absence of aspiration risk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. This finding indicates that
stomatognathic alignment exercise, which promotes TMJ and neck mobility and postural
correction, can be used to improve swallowing function in a clinical setting. Previous
studies have recognised the importance of muscular efforts in the pharyngolaryngeal regions
and postural adjustment in maintaining a normal swallowing pattern after stroke<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Swallowing disorders that may develop after stroke can result in repeated aspiration and
altered eating habits and patterns, which may subsequently contribute to an impaired
physical condition, including the development of pneumonia, dehydration, and
malnutrition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, swallowing
disorders may increase the length of hospital stay and the risk of re-admission to
hospital<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The initiation of
therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing serious medical complications and ensuring safety
in swallowing is essential in the treatment of post-stroke patients. During the swallowing
process, the extrinsic muscles, such as the suprahyoid, infrahyoid, and sternocleidomastoid
muscles, control vocal cord vibration and promote the contraction of the vocal cords, which
then move forward on the larynx, thereby protecting the airway by laryngeal closure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, deviations in the head and neck
posture alter the length-tension relationship of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles that
are located in the pharyngolaryngeal regions affecting control of the action of these
muscles. Therefore, normalising the function of the pharyngolaryngeal muscles and
maintaining appropriate muscular compliance should be performed first to optimise swallowing
function after stroke. Thus we attribute the improvement in TMJ function and swallowing
function seen in the present study to the improved neck mobility.</p><p>Another explanation for our findings requires an understanding of the linkage between the
muscular and fascial components and the influence of body posture on the function of the
stomatognathic system including chewing and swallowing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The fascial system passively distributes tension, induced by
mechanical stimulation, to the body muscles, and plays an important role in the effective
transfer of tension induced by muscle contraction, which is essential for maintaining the
contractile ability of muscles, suggesting that the actions of the muscles in the linkage
can be mutually dependent, and may work as if they form a single system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The mechanisms underlying TMJ function and swallowing
function may have a similar pattern, because orofacial and pharyngolaryngeal muscles of the
stomatognathic system are closely related with muscle groups of the head and neck region.
Moreover, impaired mobility of the extrinsic cervical muscles often disrupts the
length-tension relationship of intrinsic pharyngolaryngeal and TMJ-related muscles, thereby
reducing TMJ function and swallowing functions.</p><p>The present study had certain limitations. First, this study was a pilot trial with a small
sample size; thus, it may be difficult to generalise the findings of this study beyond our
group of patients. Second, the results of this study do not indicate the long-term effects
of stomatognathic alignment exercise as the results of follow-up sessions were not included
in the analysis. Finally, the present study aimed to evaluate TMJ function and swallowing
functions, primarily focusing on clinical relevance (clinical assessment of the TMJ function
and swallowing functions) rather than using specific equipment for quantitative
measurements. Therefore, quantitative aspects of TMJ function and swallowing function are
not reflected in the results of the present study. Nevertheless, this study describes a
structured, exercise program for enhancing TMJ function and swallowing function that can be
adopted for clinical use and is feasible for research use with larger sample sizes. However,
the benefits of stomatognathic alignment exercise should be evaluated in greater detail in
better designed clinical studies.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Iwatsuki</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Ikuta</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Shinoda</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Deep friction massage on the masticatory muscles in stroke
