Responders (Physician Global Assessment [PGA] score of &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; or better at Week 12) could continue efalizumab for a further 8 weeks (continuous-treatment period). Nonresponders transitioned to alternative anti-psoriasis medication or stopped treatment. Responders who discontinued efalizumab could restart treatment if symptoms worsened. PGA response was evaluated at Weeks 12 (primary endpoint) and 20, as were the proportions of patients achieving an improvement from baseline of &#x02265;50%, &#x02265;75% and &#x02265;90% in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) (PASI 50, PASI 75 and PASI 90, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 1,255 patients were included in the intention-to-treat population.

Plaque psoriasis is the most common form of the disease, accounting for more than 90% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>].</p><p>Efalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 antibody that binds to the CD11a subunit of leucocyte function-associated antigen type 1 (LFA-1). It targets multiple stages in the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis: initial T-cell activation, migration of T-cells into dermal and epidermal tissues, and T-cell reactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>].

Systemic anti-psoriasis treatments were discontinued before starting study treatment with no washout period. Investigational or biological treatments for psoriasis (other than efalizumab) were also stopped at least 3 months before study treatment. Patients were not to receive any primary vaccinations within the 14 days before trial entry. Women of childbearing potential were required to use adequate contraception both during the study and for 3 months afterwards. Patients were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: the sole or predominant form of their psoriasis was guttate, erythrodermic or pustular; they had a history of severe allergic reactions to humanized monoclonal antibodies; they had withdrawn from previous efalizumab treatment as a result of lack of efficacy or an adverse event; they were pregnant or breastfeeding; they had a history of opportunistic infections or ongoing uncontrolled infections; they were seropositive for HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C; they had been hospitalized for cardiac disease, stroke or pulmonary disease within the last year; they had a malignancy within the past 5 years (other than fully resolved basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer). Patients with active tuberculosis (TB), a positive chest X-ray or those who had received treatment for TB within 1 year before entry were also excluded; a chest X-ray within 3 months of study treatment was required for patients considered to be at high risk for TB.

Rebound in patients who were identified as responders at Week 12 was defined as either worsening psoriasis symptoms (&#x02265;125% increase in PASI score from baseline) or the occurrence of new pustular, erythrodermic or more inflammatory psoriasis within 2 months of stopping therapy. Disease relapse was defined as a 50% reduction in the PASI improvement achieved after the initial 12 weeks of treatment with efalizumab.</p><p>Disease exacerbation was defined in nonresponders (i.e., patients with PGA ratings of &#x0201c;fair&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;slight&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;unchanged&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;worse&#x0201d; either during or after treatment) as worsening of disease to a more inflammatory state than at baseline, and that occurred within pre-existing plaques, at previously uninvolved sites, or as new morphologies of the disease.</p><p>Adverse events were assessed at every study visit throughout the trial (Weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 20). Adverse events were coded using MedDRA (version 8.1). Reported adverse events were classified as pre-first-treatment period, first-treatment-emergent or post-first-treatment period events based on their onset dates and the dates of first and last &#x0201c;first-treatment period&#x0201d; treatment administration. The severity of adverse events was assessed as mild (the patient was aware of the event or symptom but it was easily tolerated), moderate (the patient experienced sufficient discomfort to interfere with, or reduce, his or her usual level of activity) or severe (the patient experienced a significant impairment of functioning and was unable to carry out his or her usual activities). A serious adverse event was defined as an event resulting in death or that was life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, was a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or was a medically important condition (the event did not have to be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but was clearly of major clinical significance).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Considerations</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was PGA response at Week 12, with outcomes also assessed at Week 20.

Analyses for the safety population, which included all patients who received at least one dose of trial treatment, included analyses of adverse events, safety laboratory outcomes and vital signs. Patients on continuous treatment who received efalizumab in accordance with the protocol (i.e., those who had achieved a PGA response of &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; or better at first-treatment Week 12) were evaluated as a subset of the whole continuous-treatment population. Analyses for this trial were primarily descriptive in nature and no formal hypothesis testing was performed. Exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for proportions were obtained using the PROC FREQ procedure from SAS. The PROC LIFETEST procedure from SAS was used to generate Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimates of time to rebound and disease relapse.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>The trial was conducted at 170 centres across 18 European countries.

The main strengths of this study were the large patient cohort and the unique study design, which enabled a more accurate reflection of routine clinical practice by allowing patients receiving other anti-psoriasis drugs, those not receiving any treatment, and those restarting treatment to continue follow-up.</p><p>Results obtained from the initial continuous-treatment section of the trial show that over two-thirds of patients had responded by Week 12 of efalizumab treatment and this high response rate was maintained in responders who continued treatment for up to 20 weeks. These findings are consistent with data obtained from previous pivotal clinical trials, the open-label LATAM trial and longer-term studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>].</p><p>Following this initial 12-week treatment period, the findings from this study indicate that efalizumab treatment can be discontinued, if alternative therapy is initiated in its place. Of the responders who stopped efalizumab treatment at the end of the initial 12-week period and did not transition to an alterative therapy, 11% experienced rebound. Responding patients who had discontinued and then restarted efalizumab treatment were found to achieve a similar (but slightly reduced) efficacy and tolerability as attained during the initial treatment period.</p><p>This trial also explored treatment options for patients who do not initially respond to efalizumab therapy. More than half of the nonresponders who entered the transition-treatment period subsequently achieved a response after changing to another anti-psoriatic therapy.</p><p>The major limitation of this study was the open-label, noncomparative trial design. Indeed, the range of anti-psoriatic therapies permitted across the transition-treatment period, while an accurate reflection of real-life clinical experience, complicates the analysis of treatment effectiveness during this time. It is also difficult to interpret the data obtained during the observation period, since few nonresponders entered this section of the study.</p><p>The incidence of psoriasis exacerbation in nonresponders was carefully monitored, but found to be lower after the initial 12-week treatment period, indicating that the discontinuation of efalizumab in these patients was not associated with psoriasis-related adverse events. Due to the immunomodulatory mechanism of action of efalizumab, the incidences of infections and malignancies in treated patients were also followed closely. During this trial the safety of efalizumab was found to be acceptable and consistent with previous results. No new safety issues were identified. The incidence of TEAEs was lower in the continuous-treatment period than in the initial-treatment period, with influenza-like symptoms being the most frequent TEAEs in the first-treatment period, as observed in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>]. Unlike trials examining tumour necrosis factor blocking agents, no increase in the risk of TB with treatment with efalizumab was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>]. Four malignancies were reported during the first-treatment period but the number of cases in this study was not sufficient to draw any firm conclusions regarding the risk of malignancy with this drug.</p><p>No TEAEs related to opportunistic infections were observed during this trial. However, opportunistic infections have been reported in the post-marketing surveillance in patients with psoriasis receiving efalizumab. In particular, cases of JC virus infection resulting in progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy have been reported in patients receiving efalizumab continuously for more than 3 years. After evaluating all available safety data, the European Medicines Agency concluded that the benefits of efalizumab treatment no longer outweighed the risks associated with the drug and recommended suspension of marketing authorization on 19 February 2009.</p><p>This study addressed important questions relating to the appropriate management of both responding and nonresponding psoriasis patients in real-life clinical situations, beyond the initial 12-week treatment period. Efalizumab was found to provide effective control of psoriasis in two-thirds of patients within 3 months of treatment. Of 127 evaluable patients who entered the observation period, more than half relapsed and 11% (N = 14) experienced rebound during the observation period. However, the greatest therapeutic benefit was obtained by initially responding patients who were given continuous efalizumab-treatment for the full 5-month trial period.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was sponsored by Merck Serono S.A.&#x02014;Geneva, an affiliate of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.
