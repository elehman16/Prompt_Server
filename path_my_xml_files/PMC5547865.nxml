Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as rivastigmine, have been studied for improving cognitive performance in these patients.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Rivastigmine (uptitrated to 6 mg/day) was given as an add-on therapy to risperidone-treated stable schizophrenia patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Of 67 patients who met eligibility criteria, 55 were recruited into the study. Twenty-eight were assigned to rivastigmine and 27 to placebo. These patients completed tests of attention, executive functioning, verbal skills, verbal and visuospatial working memory, and psychomotor speed on five occasions: at baseline, and at the end of the 1<sup>st</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, and 12<sup>th</sup> months.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The groups were similar in terms of sociodemographic profile and baseline clinical characteristics (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Clinical Global Impression-Severity).

It is reasonable to speculate that increasing cholinergic activity at muscarinic and nicotinic receptors may alleviate some of the cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia.</p><p>Rivastigmine is classified as an intermediate-acting or pseudo-reversible agent due to its long inhibition of AChE (up to 10 hours) relative to tacrine and donepezil, both of which are classified as short-acting or reversible agents (binding to AChE and hydrolyzed within minutes).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In Alzheimer's disease, rivastigmine has been found to improve daily activities, cognitive functioning and psychopathology, with effects occurring as early as 12 weeks.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Recent trials with rivastigmine showed improved cognitive performance in schizophrenia patients.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>There are reports of robust increase in the activation of brain regions associated with spatial attention and visual processing with adjunctive rivastigmine treatment in schizophrenia.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Negative results also have been reported.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The inconsistent results may be due to differences in the samples studied, in relation to variables like tobacco use (associated with nicotinic tolerance). Other explanations include differences in the tools used to evaluate cognition as well as relative nonspecificity of usual neuropsychological measures in relation to cognitive processes.</p><p>This study sought to determine whether rivastigmine augmentation of risperidone in patients with schizophrenia would improve secondary memory and attention relative to placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Setting</title><p>Patients were recruited from outpatient department of the hospital after getting approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Patients</title><p>All participants met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-4<sup>th</sup> Edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, based on the structured clinical interview schedule for DSM-IV Text Revision.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Patients aged 18&#x02013;55 years who had been receiving a stable dose of risperidone as their primary antipsychotic treatment for at least the past 4 weeks were eligible for recruitment. Patients also needed to demonstrate symptom stability for a minimum period of 4 weeks, defined as no more than 20% change on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Patients with substance abuse (with nicotine, amphetamines, ecstasy, phencyclidine, cocaine, tetrahydrocannabinol, or alcohol), in the previous 6 months, those with other Axis 1 or Axis 3 diagnoses, those at suicidal risk, those with medical diagnoses, and those receiving medications that could affect cognitive performance were excluded from the study. The following psychotropic medications were not allowed for the duration of the study: anticholinergics, sedating antihistamines, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, or a second antipsychotic. Benzodiazepine use was limited to lorazepam and was withheld for 24 hours before cognitive testing. All patients provided written informed consent for participation in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Experimental design</title><p>This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (randomized controlled trial [RCT]). Patients were randomly assigned to one of the following two groups for 12 months &#x02013; rivastigmine plus risperidone or risperidone plus placebo group. Rivastigmine, available as 1.5 mg and 3 mg capsules, was dosed at 1.5 mg/day twice daily in the 1<sup>st</sup> month, 3 mg/day twice daily in the 2<sup>nd</sup> month, 4.5 mg/day twice daily in the 3<sup>rd</sup> month, and 6 mg/day thereafter. Placebo was dosed similarly using identical, starch-filled capsules. Patients who did not tolerate a particular dose were allowed to drop by one level in dosing. Ongoing treatment with risperidone was continued unchanged unless the clinical status required dose adjustment; this was permitted, as required. Lorazepam up to 2 mg was allowed as the only rescue medication for anxiety, agitation, or insomnia.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Clinical assessments</title><p>Cognitive functioning was assessed with digit-span test &#x02013; digit forward and digit backward.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Digit-span task is used to measure working memory.

Other studies have also failed to find significant cognitive benefits with rivastigmine augmentation in schizophrenia.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Contrary to previous reports,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] rivastigmine was also associated with more psychological and neurological adverse effects including tardive dyskinesia.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] However, rivastigmine improved the core psychopathology outcomes as measured by total PANSS score, negative score, and CGI-I score. Similar findings have been reported in other studies.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Lenzi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] observed cognitive improvement after treatment with rivastigmine (12 mg per day for 12 months) in patients with schizophrenia. In that study, the patients had mild impairment of cognition at baseline. Hussain <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] also reported improvements in attention, memory, and problem-solving with improved social and vocational functioning in a small group of seven patients receiving rivastigmine. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging study revealed that rivastigmine treatment in schizophrenia increased cerebellar activity and influenced attentional processes.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Other AChE inhibitors also needed to be focused in future studies. Unlike Sharma <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] who did not find a beneficial cognitive effect with rivastigmine, Schubert <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] reported improvement in cognition (i.e., attention and memory) with galantamine treatment in schizophrenia patients.</p><p>Nonadherence to the medication cannot be considered a possible reason for our negative results, as the drug compliance was fairly good. There was no worsening of clinical symptoms in both the groups. In addition, in the rivastigmine group, drug-related adverse effects were more than the control group.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Strengths</title><p>This study had several strengths. The sample was homogeneous for the nature and dose of the antipsychotic used in the study; therefore, confounds related to drug and dose were eliminated.

We did not preselect patients for baseline cognitive impairment. It is possible that rivastigmine may have helped patients who did have baseline disturbances in cognitive domains. However, we consider this possibility unlikely because patients actually deteriorated in the rivastigmine group. The 1-day withholding of lorazepam before cognitive assessment may have produced a state of relative withdrawal that may have compromised cognitive outcomes more in rivastigmine patients than in placebo patients because lorazepam use was greater in the rivastigmine group. Whereas this is a definite possibility, to have continued the lorazepam would have risked the known cognitive deficits related to benzodiazepine use. We believe that lorazepam was unlikely to have been a significant confound because very few patients used the drug (six patients).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The present study does not support the use of rivastigmine (12 mg/day) augmentation of risperidone as a strategy to improve cognitive functioning in stable patients with schizophrenia who have not been preselected with regard to baseline cognitive performance.
