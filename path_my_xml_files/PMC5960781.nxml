Current vaccination programs allow the use of live attenuated vaccines in the field to protect against the disease, which alone is inefficient and requires repeat booster doses. Toll-like receptor agonists (e.g., lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) as adjuvants are the ones, most extensively studied and have shown to be very promising in delivering a robust balanced immune response. In the present study, we have evaluated the potential of LPS to elicit a strong immune response with respect to the elicitation of both Th1 (cell-mediated) and Th2 (humoral) immune arms.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 72 apparently healthy 1-day-old indigenous unvaccinated chicks were randomly divided into six experimental Groups A to F (n=12). At 8-week of age chicks in Group A, C, and E were vaccinated with live attenuated La Sota strain ND vaccine along with LPS, bovine serum albumin, and normal saline solution, respectively, and those in Group B, D, and E were kept separately without vaccination. Sampling was done on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 35, and 60 after vaccination. After vaccination and respective adjuvant application, Th1 and Th2 cytokine expression were measured in mRNA of both blood and tissue samples.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results</title><p>The results were validated by, hemagglutination inhibition and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests, to check for the humoral as well as cell-mediated immune response in blood serum levels. The results showed an increase in mRNA expression of the Th1 biased cytokines in Group A (LPS+NDV) as compared to the control groups. Similar mRNA expression pattern was seen in blood as well as tissue samples. Validation of results also indicates an increase in Cell-mediated Immunity as well as a humoral immune response in Group A (LPS+NDV).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the study provided enough evidence to consider LPS as a potential vaccine adjuvants candidate against ND in chicken.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adjuvants</kwd><kwd>Aseel</kwd><kwd>lipopolysaccharide</kwd><kwd>Newcastle disease</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Host defense against invading microbial pathogens is elicited by the immune system which consists of two components: Innate and acquired immunity. To date, the main research interest in the field of immunology has been confined to the acquired immunity to analyze the mechanisms by which the antigen receptors recognize foreign antigens and exercise the response accordingly (namely, diversity and memory of adaptive immunity). The non-specific, innate immune system that lays the foundation of the overall immunological processes outranks the acquired immunity due to its wide range action against all sorts of invading pathogens as well as dictating the correct acquired immune response. However, till date, the former has not been well studied with respect to its response to different vaccine adjuvants [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Recent development in knowledge on the functioning of innate immunity has made the toll-like receptor (TLR)-based adjuvants to emerge as one of the promising candidates in representing a physical link between the innate and adaptive immunity. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an innate immune response element and also the best-characterized sensor of TLR4, is responsible for the inflammatory response and other important events required for the initiation of innate immune responses and also a potent elicitor of Th1 biased immune response [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A Viral disease like Newcastle disease (ND) (or Ranikhet) causes huge economic losses to the poultry sector all over the world and must be headed with immediate concern. Therefore, vaccines providing strong cell-mediated immune response apart from humoral response are required [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Currently available ND virus (NDV) vaccines can provide the necessary humoral immune response boost but lack considerably in providing a cell-mediated response. TLR-ligand plays a crucial role here as they combat infectious diseases by providing both inflammatory and antigen-specific immune responses [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, LPS has come up as a useful tool in the immunomodulatory studies against NDV as it provides a rapid action force required for immediate action. Various studies show the immunomodulatory potential of LPS as adjuvants in mice models, but studies on the use of LPS as a potential immunomodulator in combination with ND vaccine in live animal experimentation are not available. An adjuvant which is a constituent of vaccine is an immunological agent which modifies the immune response by acting as a depot that provides a slow and prolonged release of antigen. The traditionally used adjuvants (e.g., aluminum salts, microbial components, synthetic polymers, emulsions, and complex surface-active compounds) are relatively toxic, suffer from weak adjuvant activity, sometimes causes severe inflammatory reactions at the site of injection and also fail to induce a strong Th1 biased (cell-mediated) immune response which limits their use. This limitation mentioned above particularly necessitates the development of novel adjuvant systems, which can elicit a strong directed immune response.</p><p>The present study evaluates the immunomodulatory potential of LPS in combination with <italic>La Sota</italic> vaccine in specific pathogen-free chicken by studying the mRNA expression of various Th1 and Th2 biased cytokines in both blood and tissue samples. Further, validation of the results was done by studying their serum level concentrations using ELISA, to find out as to which arm of immune response is favored.</p><p>The research plan was designed in a way to minimize the concept of booster dosages by evaluating the maximum potential of the adjuvant under study. The results obtained, contrary to the current practices, provide a valid proof of the use of adjuvant only once along with the NDV vaccine to provide a heightened as well as long lasting Th1 and Th2 biased immune response. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever report of the evaluation of LPS as vaccine adjuvant against ND in indigenous chicken model <italic>per se</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Ethical approval for the study was obtained from Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) (IAEC/2015/30-63; Dated: 26/02/2015).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Experimental birds</title><p>1-day-old indigenous (Aseel) unvaccinated chicks (n=72) were procured from the Hatchery Punjab Agricultural University and were maintained in the GADVASU University Poultry Farm (Ludhiana, Punjab, India).

Till date, no such report of similar experimentation in indigenous chicken has been documented. In Avians, the adjuvant potential of ligands such as CpG oligonucleotides against NDV as well as avian influenza virus has been well documented in layers and another commercial flock [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, LPS is a popular candidate for vaccine adjuvants in other non-avian models like mice [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the study of the effect of adjuvants in the indigenous chicken is still lacking, with almost no reports of LPS being used as an effective vaccine adjuvant in chicken models. The results obtained from our study shows a significant upregulation of both TLR4 (LPS sensor) as well as other cytokine genes (IL-12, IFN-&#x003b3;, and IL-4) in both blood and tissue samples (spleen and cecal tonsils). A similar study evaluating the adjuvant potential of resiquimod (TLR7 agonist), against ND vaccine, was done which was in complete agreement to our current research work showing a similar expression pattern in IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-4 cytokines in spleen [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Our study conducted an evaluation of the importance of LPS along with live-attenuated <italic>La Sota</italic> strain vaccine, which predicts the excess of Th1 biased immunity, out of the two arms of the immune response. The results obtained showed an increase in expression of Th1 biased cytokine genes (IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3;). Furthermore, the Th2 biased immune arm was significantly (p&#x0003c;0.05) altered after positive stimulation by both adjuvant and vaccine combination. Although IL-4 gene expression was limited in Group-A (LPS+NDV) because of the presence of LPS, which is a potent Th1 elicitor as it directs the na&#x000ef;ve helper cells (Th0) toward the Th1 biased. Taylor <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], conducted the study demonstrating the importance of LPS as a vaccine adjuvant as it promotes the Th1 biased immunity through recruitment of na&#x000ef;ve T helper cells toward Th1 biased response. The absence of LPS from the vaccine results in strong Th2 biased immunity with significantly more IL-4 than IFN-gamma. Therefore, from the mRNA expression studies, we can deduce that LPS is responsible for eliciting the Th1 biased immune response but also a heightened response is seen when LPS is given in combination with NDV vaccine. The groups without NDV vaccine (Group-B, -D, and -F), showed no significant increase in either the mRNA gene expression as well as serum protein concentration of any of the cytokine under study.</p><p>The comparison of the mRNA level gene expression and serum protein concentration of IFN-&#x003b3; provides an insight of the molecular machinery working after adjuvant and vaccine administration. The IFN-&#x003b3; serum estimation depicts the rise of the IFN-&#x003b3; at both the mRNA as well as at the serum level. There was an increase in both mRNA fold change as well as serum protein concentration on day 3 in treatment Group-A (LPS+NDV). Later, a decline in mRNA expression was seen in Group-A on day 7 and day 21. The serum IFN-&#x003b3; value provides a relevant explanation for the drop in mRNA expression levels. The excess amount of IFN-&#x003b3; serum concentration causes a negative feedback type of signaling response which causes a temporary shutdown of the mRNA machinery for the IFN-&#x003b3; gene. The mRNA synthesis resumes as soon as the serum level concentration is reached back to normal level. The clear correlation seen in the protein and mRNA levels of IFN-&#x003b3; can be certainly backed up by a similar study of comparison of protein abundance and mRNA expression levels on a genomic scale. The study provides validation of our current hypothesis of the possibility of some correlation between the level of mRNA and that of the protein [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, we can clearly validate our mRNA expression study with that of serum protein concentration.</p><p>The main objective of our current experimental plan was to find the best possible adjuvant and vaccine combination to minimize the booster dosage as well as maximize the immune response. The fold change increase in both Th1 and Th2 biased cytokine expression predicts the elicitation of both cell-mediated as well as a humoral immune response in treatment groups (Group-A and -B) with only a single dosage of adjuvant and vaccine combination. The use of LPS to reduce the vaccine dosage as well to incorporate the cellular immunity proved out to be a dual advantage. The results obtained by our study were favored by a similar study which used Monatanide&#x02122; for cellular immune response in poultry and also emphasized on its capability to increase the cellular immune response that could help to extend the cross-protection against different viral strains or serotypes with reduction of injection doses of inactivated ND poultry vaccines [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, there was a greater inclination toward Th1 biased immunity as compared to that of Th2 biased, as LPS, as discussed above, is a strong Th1 elicitor. The cell-mediated immunity has an advantage over the humoral immune response as it provides better protection as well as clearance of intracellular pathogens like viruses. Therefore, an adjuvant which provides a strong cell-mediated immune response is beneficial for viral diseases like ND. The results are in complete agreement with another study of <italic>H. pylori</italic> challenge in mice which depicts that Th1 biased immunity is responsible for providing a stronger systemic as well local immune response [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Another, usage of bacterial cell-wall component for vaccine potentiation of the viral disease can be seen in a similar well-known vaccine of viral origin, the live-attenuated yellow fever vaccine. It activates multiple subsets of dendritic cells through the incorporation of TLR2 agonists (bacterial cell wall components) to deliver robust immune responses [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>LPS, when administered in combination with ND vaccine, elicits significant (p&#x0003c;0.05) TLR4 expression. TLR4 is an innate immune response element, protects against Gram-negative bacteria and LPS recognition has been very well studied and TLR4 is its best-characterized sensor [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, increase in TLR4 expression can also be correlated with that of innate immune elicitation. Furthermore, the high cytokine production at mRNA and serum level predicts the elicitation of the adaptive immune arm by LPS administration. A recent study conducted by Abu-Baker and Masoud (2016) where the importance of LPS based vaccine was evaluated to provide high cross-protection against various strains of pathogen in mice, supports our hypothesis of LPS being able to deliver a combinatorial protection to both NDV and other Gram-negative bacterial infection by eliciting both innate as well as adaptive immune response when given in combination with ND vaccine [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Administration of LPS with ND vaccine caused an upregulation of expression of IL-12, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-4, and TLR4 in both blood and tissue sample. Furthermore, the serum antibody levels and HI test validated the cytokine upregulation pattern. The adjuvant potential, thus, was confirmed by elicitation of both antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses only in a single dosage of vaccine and adjuvant in indigenous chicken.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>Author&#x02019;s Contributions</title><p>RB, CSM, RV, and DD: Conception and design of the study.
