The rise in the pulse rate and blood pressure is usually transient, variable, and unpredictable. Usually, these changes are well tolerated by healthy individuals. However, these changes may be fatal in patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, or intracranial hypertension. To blunt this pressure response, various methods have been tried.</p><p>In the present study, we had observed cardiovascular responses following laryngoscopy, intubation and compared efficacy of different doses of intranasal nitroglycerine spray with groups belonging to normotensive ASA grade I, II risk surgical patient.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was conducted in a total of 60 patients with 20 in each group [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. The present study was undertaken to observe the various cardiovascular responses to laryngoscopy and intubation in normotensive patient undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia. It was undertaken to observe the attenuating effects of different doses of nitroglycerine spray administered intranasally before laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in normotensive patient. To compare the heart rate changes in three groups treated with intranasal nitroglycerine during laryngoscopic manipulation. To observe the systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure changes in groups treated with intranasal nitroglycerine spray during laryngoscopic maneuver. Doses of intranasal nitroglycerine used are 400, 800, and 1200 micrograms given five minutes before laryngoscopy and intubation and observed till ten minutes after laryngoscopy and intubation every minute. Patients were watched for any complication like tachycardia, hypotension, arrhythmias, bronchospasm during intra-operative and post-operative period.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Age distribution of cases</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-8-59-g001"/></table-wrap><p>After obtaining approval from the institutional review board, 60 patients of ASA I and II scheduled for elective surgeries under general anesthesia were subjected to the study.

The procedure was explained to the patient, and patients were preloaded with crystalloid fluid, 8-10 ml/kg. All the patients were pre-medicated with inj. glycopyrolate 0.04 mg/kg.i.v, inj. ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg i.v., and inj. fentanyl 1 microgm/kg. Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were recorded before pre-medication and 10 minutes after pre-medication in patients.</p><p>With patient in supine position, nitroglycerine spray was administered intranasally five minutes before laryngoscopy and intubation. Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were recorded after 1.5 minutes of nitroglycerine spray administration in patient. Patients were induced with inj. pentothal (6-7 mg/kg) i.v. and inj. suxamethonium (2 mg/kg) i.v. followed by laryngoscopy and intubation. Variables to be monitored were heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, spo<sub>2</sub>, and ECG morphology.</p><p>All parameters were recorded at following stages:</p><p>Before pre-medication (BPM);</p><p>After pre-medication (APM);</p><p>30 seconds after endotracheal intubation (AEI).</p><p>And then, every one minute to up to 10 minute (AEI).</p><p>All intubation were accomplished within 15 seconds by an expert anesthesiologist. Only one attempt of intubation was accepted in the study. Patients who had coughed or bucked during procedure were excluded from study. After intubation, patients were maintained with isoflurane (0.4% v/v) or sevoflurane (0.8% v/v), O<sub>2</sub> (50%), N<sub>2</sub>o (50%), and non-depolarizing muscle relaxant. At the end of surgery, patients were reversed with inj. glycopyrolate and inj. neostigmine.
