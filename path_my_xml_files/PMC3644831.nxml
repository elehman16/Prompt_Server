Amongst them, 118 were goldsmiths who have been engaged in the jewelery industries for at least 1 year. According to experience in that particular sector, they were categorized in 3 subgroups; exposure having less than 5 years (ETA<sub>1</sub>), more than 5 years but less than 10 years (ETA<sub>2</sub>) and more than 10 years (ETA<sub>3</sub>). 66 persons were taken as a reference group for subjective analysis purpose. They were mainly the storekeepers, managers, and front desk office workers of the same industry. The Departmental Research Committee of the University of Kalyani approved the study, and all subjects signed written consent form before participating in the study. All the reference subjects were non-smokers, and only 11 of the goldsmiths were smokers.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Measurement of physiological profiles</title><p>Height (in cm) and weight (in kg) of the subjects were measured using anthropometric rod and weighing machine, respectively.

Guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) were followed during spirometry. All the participants were thoroughly informed about the processes of spirometric tests. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory flows of 4 intervals (FEF<sub>25%</sub>, FEF<sub>50%</sub>, FEF<sub>75%</sub>, and FEF<sub>25-75%</sub>) of the subjects were measured. Peak expiratory flow rate was measured using Peak expiratory flow meter (Medicare Equipments, India). Every test for each participant was performed 3 times, and the best value was taken. The values of forced vital capacity and forced expiratory flow of different percentages were expressed as the percentage of their respective predicted values.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Assessment of the components of workplace fumes and gases</title><p>Concentrations of sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), suspended particulate matters (SPM), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) of the workplaces were measured using a portable air monitoring kit (LaMotte, USA).

Lack of proper knowledge about workplace environment makes the workers affected more and the tendency of work-related injuries and accident increases.</p><p>The assessment of workplace fumes indicated that there were apparently higher concentrations of SOx and NOx than the proposed limit in the workplaces. According to the proposed permissible exposure levels of the Pollution Control Board of the Government of West Bengal, the concentrations of SOx and NOx were higher in the workplaces than the recommended values (PEL for SOx- 60 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>; PEL for NOx- 60 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Sulfuric and nitric acids when come in contact with high temperature and various metals, various oxides of sulfur and nitrogen are produced in gaseous forms and as those acids and fumes are very hygroscopic, they produce mists in the workplaces. The concentration of SPM was less in the workplaces (PEL: SPM- 140 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>) because those places were free from dusts and other associated particles. Carbon monoxide, which is produced during incomplete combustion of carbon, was also much less in the manufacturing sectors (PEL: 2 mg/m<sup>3</sup>) although a very small amount of coal is used in those units.</p><p>Data reported that decrease in forced expiratory flow could diagnose reduced pulmonary efficiencies, and it was also reported that altered value FEF<sub>25-75%</sub> could be a marker for identifying obstructive type lung diseases. According to the results, peak expiratory flow rate and forced expiratory flow of different percentages decreased significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) with the exposure duration. In recent days, the concept of vital capacity no longer exists, and concept of measuring forced vital capacity has come.</p><p>The fumes of various metals, acids, and gases were associated with the deterioration of the pulmonary efficiencies of the goldsmiths, and the results obtained were similar with that of the findings of other authors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] In this study, the mean ages of the workers were not related with the differences of exposures because the workers of more exposure joined the industry at very young ages and the workers with less exposure joined the industry relatively later. As there were no significant differences in ages and the body mass indices between the workers and the control subjects, it could be stated that the alterations of the pulmonary variables were neither mediated by malnutrition nor by age of the workers. Assessment of the secondary exposures of the total study population revealed that there were no significant risk factors, which could lead to malfunction of the respiratory system of the workers. Apart from the work stress, no factor was observed, which could make any influence over the normal functions of the lung. So, a clear conception can be obtained that secondary exposures were not much associated with the altered outcomes of lung function tests.</p><p>The inter-group analyses showed that the alteration of respiratory indices were dependent upon the duration of exposure to the hazardous fumes and gases. As the exposure increased, the tendency of respiratory obstructions also increased. The study found that a total of 56 goldsmiths had percent predicted values of FEF<sub>25-75%</sub> lower than 70% of the predicted and amongst them, 12 were suspected to be suffered from airways obstructions. Chattopadhyay <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] showed that constant exposure to fumes and gaseous pollutants were associated with reduced forced vital capacity and peak expiratory flow rates, which could cause an alteration of respiratory health. The validity of assessment of PEFR over the other standard PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) indices lies in the context that the other indices (e.g. FEV<sub>1</sub>) are more sensitive in assessing bronchoconstriction of the airways while PEFR can be an effective measure for home monitoring of lung function,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] and Litonjua <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] showed that FEF<sub>25-75%</sub> could be an effective way to identify the pulmonary health, and alteration of FEF<sub>25-75%</sub> was associated with obstructive types of pulmonary diseases.</p><p>Alteration of peak expiratory flow rates showed significant changes with the duration of exposure, and the results were similar with that of the percent predicted values of forced expiratory flow rates of 25-75%. For long-term exposure to the polluted environment, the lung tissues of the goldsmiths faced great challenge as cytotoxicity due to fumes and gases could alter the proportionate growth of the lung tissues. Sheel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] launched a term &#x0201c;dysanaptic,&#x0201d; which they meant the disproportionate growth. They reported that restriction to the alveoli and parts of the upper respiratory tracts might be caused by disproportionate growth of the airways and the lung parenchyma and that dysanaptic growth could lead to the development of different types of lung diseases. Alteration of the FEF<sub>25%</sub>, FEF<sub>50%</sub>, FEF<sub>75%</sub>, FEF<sub>25-75%</sub>, FVC, and PEFR henceforth might indicate reduced &#x0201c;cross-talks&#x0201d; between the lung parenchyma and the airways, which could lead to the development of complicated pulmonary diseases.</p><p>Our study had some limitations. First, the main restriction of this study was that there were no available data about the workplace environment and status of the air qualities in the unorganized sectors so as in the jewelery industries. It also varies from one workplace to another. In the jewelery industries, smoke and fumes generate by various means. So, it was not possible to evaluate the effect of single identity on respiratory health. Second, the study population was from the unorganized sectors where there is no proper maintenance of work schedules and assessment of hazardous substances of the workplaces. Therefore, it is necessary to be cautious when generalizing our results. Finally, as the workers rarely work in a specific workplace for a long period, understanding the pulmonary status of the workers working at a constant location for a long time (e.g. more than 25 or 30 years) were not possible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In conclusion, long exposures to workplace gases and fumes were significant risk factor for pulmonary fitness amongst the goldsmiths of Indian unorganized sectors. Our results suggested that long exposure to those pollutants abruptly altered the lung functions of the workers. Some measures that can be adopted are as follows:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Regular investigation of the workplaces should be performed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The workers should use preventive measures such as masks as many times as possible.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The use of chimneys and other exhaust techniques should be provided to the workers.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Regular check-up of the workers should be encouraged for their health education.</p></list-item></list>
