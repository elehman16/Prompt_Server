In addition, subjects who perceived greater improvement in their CFL at Day 30 tended to have a greater duration of response to onabotulinumtoxinA than did those who reported little or no improvement, suggesting that patients' perceptions of treatment results may be directly associated with duration of effect. These perceptions may determine whether benefits of treatment translate to improvements in patients' well-being and may potentially influence patient behaviors, such as returning for follow-up treatments to maintain long-term effects.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>The estimates of response duration for onabotulinumtoxinA were somewhat longer in Study 1 versus Study 2, particularly on the subjects' assessments. The difference in median duration between studies ranged from 6 days in the investigators' assessments of dynamic CFL to 28 days in the subjects' assessments of static CFL. Multiple factors may account for the observed differences in response duration. First, subjects were followed for 150 days after receiving onabotulinumtoxinA in Study 1, whereas those in Study 2 received a second treatment on Day 120. Thus, duration data for 33% of subjects in Study 2 were censored while they were still responding to onabotulinumtoxinA, leading to a ceiling effect for response duration in Study 2. In addition, the cohort enrolled in Study 2 was generally older and included a greater proportion of subjects with severe CFL at maximum smile at baseline versus Study 1. These differences likely reflect the selection criteria for these studies; specifically, subjects in Study 2 were required to have moderate or severe CFL and GL at maximum smile/frown to qualify for entry, whereas subjects in Study 1 were required to have only moderate or severe CFL. It is also notable that subjects in Study 2 had more severe resting CFL at baseline compared with those in Study 1; greater baseline severity of resting CFL has been associated with a shorter duration of response to onabotulinumtoxinA.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>Subjects perceived that the duration of response with onabotulinumtoxinA was longer than that based on the investigators' assessments in Study 1, particularly for dynamic CFL (median duration, 144 and 125 days based on subject and investigator assessments, respectively). This difference may reflect how subjects and investigators evaluate CFL: namely, subjects generally observe their CFL area from a frontal perspective in the mirror and may be less able to observe a return of activity to that area, whereas physicians can look directly at the lines, from an oblique or lateral view, when making assessments. This explanation may also account for the lower subject-assessed responder rate at Day 30 compared with the investigator-assessed responder rate in Study 1 in that subjects may also be less able to observe a loss of activity in their CFL area. A 1-grade change is considered clinically meaningful in that it is the minimum response for observable benefit of treatment effects and is of relevance to clinicians and subjects. In Study 2, subjects did not perceive a difference in treatment response duration versus investigators. Again, the shorter 120-day follow-up may have limited sensitivity for detecting any differences in duration perceived by subjects and investigators in the second study. The shorter 120-day follow-up may also explain why the higher response rates in the onabotulinumtoxinA 44 U group versus response rates in the onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U group did not translate into a longer median response duration.</p><p>The median duration of 4 months or longer with onabotulinumtoxinA in these phase 3 studies is consistent with several smaller studies in subjects treated for CFL. In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in 162 subjects with CFL followed for up to 180 days, the median time to return to baseline severity was 120 days for subjects receiving a total dose of onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Notably, in an open-label study involving 25 women who were followed for 9 months after a single treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA, improvement in static CFL was maintained through 6 months, based on observations by trained observers and 3-dimensional profilometry skin imaging.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>Response duration for onabotulinumtoxinA for CFL is similar to that observed in the treatment of GL. In a meta-analysis of 4 GL registration trials, median duration of response to onabotulinumtoxinA in subjects with moderate to severe GL was 125 days for responders, defined by a 1-grade improvement on the FWS at maximum contraction.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The corresponding median duration of response for FWS at rest was 131 days. Subject follow-up in these studies was 120 days (with the exception of 1 study for which follow-up was 4 weeks), potentially limiting the response duration. Furthermore, results of a single-center study of 60 women suggest that, after simultaneous injection of onabotulinumtoxinA for treatment of CFL, GL, and forehead lines (total, 16 injections), the median response duration (defined as &#x02265;25% improvement from baseline on a 9-point patient global assessment scale) for subjects receiving 4 U per injection site (as in the present studies) was approximately 12 to 16 weeks (i.e., 84&#x02013;112 days). Overall, these findings suggest that onabotulinumtoxinA provides a long duration of clinical response when used for treatment of CFL, GL, or multiple upper facial rhytids.</p><p>Subject perception of improvement provides guidance regarding retreatment of CFL and, when considered with duration of response, may influence overall satisfaction with treatment.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Thus, examining the relationship between patient-reported outcomes and clinical outcomes can lead to a more complete understanding of the benefits of treatment. Greater subject-reported improvement on the SGA-CFL at Day 30 in both studies (scores 1 and 2) was associated with a longer response duration on the investigator's FWS at maximum smile. In Study 1, the relatively longer median duration of response for subjects with an SGA-CFL score of 3 compared with subjects with a score of 2 may be due to the small sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 44) for subjects with a score of 3. As discussed below, additional limitations in study design may have precluded the detection of a significant relationship between SGA-CFL ratings and response duration after treatment of CFL with onabotulinumtoxinA 24 U.</p><p>Several factors limit interpretation of the current analyses. As previously discussed, the duration analyses were capped at Day 150 in Study 1 and Day 120 in Study 2, when a significant proportion of subjects were still responding to treatment, thereby potentially underestimating the median response duration. Future studies permitting a return to baseline status of all subjects may yield a longer observed duration of efficacy. In addition, differences in baseline CFL severity between trials may confound comparison of results. Assessments of responder rates and, subsequently, duration of clinical response were based on assessments at maximum smile and at rest: despite the clear instructions on the desired smile, the magnitude of the dynamic expression may have varied across visits based on each subject's effort, and static CFL may vary based on factors such as hydration. Finally, subjects with deep CFL or GL were not included in these studies, and results therefore cannot be extrapolated to those populations.</p><p>Dosing and results reported in this study are specific to onabotulinumtoxinA. This formulation is not interchangeable with other botulinum toxin products, and units cannot be converted using a dose ratio. Therefore, the results of this study cannot be extrapolated to other formulations of botulinum toxins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>OnabotulinumtoxinA produced treatment responses in most subjects with CFL, and duration of response was &#x02265;4 months in both studies. The lower responder rate and shorter duration of response in Study 2 compared with Study 1 is most likely explained by the higher baseline CFL wrinkle severity and shorter follow-up period. Patterns were observed suggesting that duration of clinical response to onabotulinumtoxinA may be related to subject perceptions of CFL improvement after treatment. Further comparisons between clinical efficacy measures and patient-reported outcomes are warranted in assessments of esthetic treatments.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This study was funded by Allergan plc.
