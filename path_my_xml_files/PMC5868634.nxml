The plasma concentration&#x02013;time profiles of glycopyrronium were similar following treatment with GFF MDI or GP MDI, both after single dosing and at Week 12. Accumulation at Week 12 relative to Day 1 was up to 2.30-fold for glycopyrronium. The plasma concentration&#x02013;time profiles of formoterol were similar following treatment with GFF MDI or FF MDI, both after single dosing and at Week 12. Accumulation at Week 12 relative to Day 1 was up to 1.62-fold for formoterol.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, the results have characterized the accumulation of glycopyrronium and formoterol associated with GFF MDI, GP MDI, and FF MDI, and indicated that there were no meaningful PK interactions, whether drug&#x02013;drug or due to formulation, between glycopyrronium and formoterol following treatment with GFF MDI formulated using co-suspension delivery technology.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COPD</kwd><kwd>glycopyrronium</kwd><kwd>formoterol fumarate dihydrate</kwd><kwd>metered dose inhaler</kwd><kwd>co-suspension delivery technology</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Monotherapy or dual therapy with long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist (LABA) bronchodilators is central to the maintenance treatment of COPD.<xref rid="b1-copd-13-945" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Combined LAMA/LABA therapy has been shown to improve bronchodilation to a greater degree than LAMAs or LABAs alone, with a similar safety profile.<xref rid="b2-copd-13-945" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-copd-13-945" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Delivering dual LAMA/LABA therapy as a fixed-dose combination (FDC) in a single device may improve adherence and, therefore, also improve outcomes compared with multiple devices.<xref rid="b7-copd-13-945" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-copd-13-945" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The dual bronchodilator therapy glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate dihydrate (GFF) is a LAMA/LABA FDC delivered by metered dose inhaler (MDI) using innovative co-suspension delivery technology.

Since relative bioavailability among formulations was based on between-patient information, demographic and baseline covariates were evaluated for inclusion in the model using backward elimination. For glycopyrronium, additional covariates used in the final AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12</sub> model were race (Caucasian, Black, other), weight, height, and smoking status, and in the final C<sub>max</sub> model were race (Caucasian, Black, other), age, inhaled corticosteroid use, weight, and smoking status. For formoterol, additional covariates used in the final AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12</sub> model were age, weight, and height, and in the final C<sub>max</sub> model were race (Caucasian, Black, other), weight, and height. For each visit, the ratios of geometric LSM and the corresponding 90% CI for GFF MDI relative to GP MDI and FF MDI were determined by exponentiating the mean differences between treatments and 90% CI on the logarithm scale. Also, because of between-patient assessment, high variability was anticipated and bounds for equivalence evaluation were not pre-specified.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Ethics approval and informed consent</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice Guidelines including the International Conference on Harmonisation, the US Code of Federal Regulations, and the Declaration of Helsinki.

However, the study population included many elderly patients from whom it was difficult to draw blood samples, and a number of patients had samples with formoterol concentrations below the LLQ over the 12 h timeframe. In addition, no samples were obtained between 20 min and 1 h when the mean formoterol plasma concentration reached its peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-copd-13-945">Figure 1B</xref>). These factors are likely to have impacted the individual concentration&#x02013;time profiles, and as a result, t<sub>max</sub> values of 12 h were obtained for some patients irrespective of the analyte, which would have affected the overall median t<sub>max</sub> values. In the mean plasma concentration&#x02013;time profiles, the time to peak formoterol plasma concentration was consistent between the formulations at Day 1 and Week 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-copd-13-945">Figure 1B</xref>), and therefore the difference observed based on individual concentration&#x02013;time profiles was not considered to be clinically relevant.</p><p>Limitations include that in this setting of a PK sub-study, dosing prior to the Week 12 assessment could not be controlled as tightly as in shorter, clinic-based PK studies; however, patients were only included in the PK population if they had not missed a dose in the 2 d prior to testing. Furthermore, the time to steady state for glycopyrronium and formoterol in patients receiving GFF MDI could not be estimated during this study, as the PK parameters were assessed only at Day 1 and Week 12.</p><p>Importantly, the safety and tolerability profiles of GFF MDI, GP MDI, and FF MDI have been established in patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD during the full 24 wk period of this study (PINNACLE-1).<xref rid="b4-copd-13-945" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Of the patients treated with GFF MDI, GP MDI, FF MDI, or placebo MDI, 58.8%&#x02013;62.9% reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), and 6.4%&#x02013;8.4% reported serious TEAEs. The incidence of cardiovascular events of special interest was low (stroke, 0%&#x02013;0.4%; cardiac ischemia, 0.4%&#x02013;2.3%; cardiac failure, 1.3%&#x02013;2.5%; arrhythmia, 1.3%&#x02013;3.2%), and no important trends in clinical laboratory results, vital signs, or electrocardiograms were observed.<xref rid="b4-copd-13-945" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Furthermore, these safety and tolerability results were confirmed in a similar 24 wk, randomized, controlled study (PINNACLE-2).<xref rid="b4-copd-13-945" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A 28 wk extension of both studies confirmed the long-term safety of the study treatments over 52 wks (PINNACLE-3).<xref rid="b13-copd-13-945" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Overall, our results consolidate similar findings of a Phase IIb study that evaluated the PK of a higher dose of GFF MDI (28.8/10 &#x003bc;g) versus monocomponent MDIs after a 7 d treatment period, and found no significant PK interactions for glycopyrronium and formoterol when delivered as an FDC MDI using co-suspension delivery technology.<xref rid="b14-copd-13-945" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The FDC GFF MDI and the individual components GP MDI and FF MDI were well tolerated and there were no safety concerns.<xref rid="b4-copd-13-945" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b13-copd-13-945" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In this PK sub-study, the AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12</sub> accumulation of glycopyrronium delivered from GFF MDI and GP MDI was 2.30-fold and 1.99-fold, respectively, and the AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12</sub> accumulation of formoterol delivered from GFF MDI and FF MDI was 1.52-fold and 1.62-fold, respectively, after 12 wks of treatment. The systemic exposure (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12</sub> and C<sub>max</sub>) of glycopyrronium and formoterol was similar when delivered in the FDC GFF MDI compared to when the individual components were delivered in separate inhalers (GP MDI and FF MDI) after single and chronic dosing (12 wks), indicating that there were no meaningful PK interactions, whether drug&#x02013;drug or due to formulation, between glycopyrronium and formoterol when administered in the FDC GFF MDI with co-suspension delivery technology.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank all the patients and their families and the team of investigators, research nurses, and operation staff involved in PINNACLE-1.
