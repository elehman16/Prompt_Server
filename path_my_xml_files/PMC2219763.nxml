The IAT operationalizes unconscious bias by hypothesizing that subjects will match a group representative to an attribute more quickly if they connect these factors in their minds, regardless of their awareness of this connection. For instance, the more strongly subjects associate pictures of <italic>white persons</italic> with <italic>good</italic> concepts and pictures of <italic>black persons</italic> with <italic>bad</italic> concepts, the more quickly they will match them, and vice versa. The computerized IAT measures the aggregate time required for these matching tasks under two conditions (pairings). A difference in average matching speed for opposite pairings (e.g., <italic>black</italic>+<italic>bad</italic>/<italic>white</italic>+<italic>good</italic> vs <italic>black</italic>+<italic>good</italic>/<italic>white</italic>+<italic>bad</italic>) determines the IAT score (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Subjects are typically aware that they are making these connections but unable to control them given the rapid response times and structure of the test. To understand the IAT procedure, readers can sample the test at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.implicit.harvard.edu">www.implicit.harvard.edu</ext-link>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref><fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Implicit Association Test (IAT) sample screens and stimuli.

Given questions about the source of observed disparities in health service use, the IAT might provide insight into the contribution of implicit biases among physicians. In this study, we used a race preference IAT to measure implicit biases among emergency medicine and internal medicine residents. We also developed two new tests to measure stereotypes about general cooperativeness and specific cooperation with medical procedures. We tested whether both preferences and stereotypes affected physicians&#x02019; clinical decisions for white and black patients. More specifically, using a case vignette with patient race assigned randomly, three IATs, and a questionnaire, we sought to determine whether implicit or explicit race biases predict physicians&#x02019; decisions to give thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants and Study Procedures</title><p>In April and May 2005, we e-mailed a study invitation and three weekly reminders to all 776 internal medicine and emergency medicine residents in four academic medical centers in Boston, Mass, and Atlanta, Ga. The emails included a link to the research web site and a login code. Using an honor system administered by the chief residents, we offered participants a $10 gift certificate and entry into a lottery ($200 and $100 prizes for each site) for completing the 20-minute, anonymous, web-based study. Of the 776 residents, 393 (50.6%) participants completed the randomized vignette questionnaire and explicit bias section of the study. We excluded 25 participants who were not residents in an eligible program (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) or had previously completed part of the study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;23). Fifty-seven participants failed to complete the IATs or had unusable IAT results, as described elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref> Twenty-four participants failed to complete the demographics section. This left 287 participants (37.0% of 776) who completed all aspects of the study. On a posttest question, 67 of these 287 participants reported some awareness of what the study was about through discussions with colleagues who had completed it. Because this awareness may have biased their responses to the case vignette, we omitted these participants from the analyses. All results (unless otherwise specified) are based on the 220 participants (28.4%) who completed the study and were unaware of the nature of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design</title><p>We created a web-based survey instrument that randomly assigned participants to see a picture of a black or white patient while reading a clinical vignette. From hundreds of shareware photographs, we chose 58 whose facial expressions appeared neutral. We created new patient images by morphing together these photographs using Photo Morpher Software (Morpheus Software, LLC, Santa Barbara, Calif, USA). The 21 best quality images were chosen and 19 independent evaluators (physicians, research assistants, and graduate students of various racial/ethnic backgrounds and not involved in the study) reviewed these. We chose four (two black and two white) that were most closely matched on apparent age (approximately 50&#x000a0;years) and attractiveness (7-point scale). The vignette (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="App1">Appendix</xref>) describes a 50-year-old male presenting to the emergency department with chest pain and an electrocardiogram suggestive of anterior myocardial infarction. It is stated that primary angioplasty is not an option and no absolute contraindications to thrombolysis are evident.</p><p>We asked participants to rate the likelihood that the chest pain was because of coronary artery disease (CAD) (5-point scale, <italic>very unlikely</italic> to <italic>very likely</italic>), whether they would give the patient thrombolysis (yes/no), and the strength of their recommendation (5-point scale, <italic>definitely</italic> to <italic>definitely not</italic>). To assess <italic>explicit bias</italic>, the software then asked participants several questions about whether they preferred white or black Americans (5-point scale with preference expressed as <italic>somewhat</italic> or <italic>slightly</italic> prefer black or white Americans, and 10-point <italic>thermometer</italic> scale of warm feelings toward each group separately). We also asked about their beliefs about patients&#x02019; cooperativeness in general and with regard to medical procedures such as thrombolysis (5-point scale&#x02014;black patients somewhat less cooperative, slightly less cooperative, equally cooperative; white patients slightly less cooperative or somewhat less cooperative). Finally, the online survey included queries about respondent demographics, effectiveness of thrombolysis, and pre- and posttest opinions on unconscious bias and IATs. The vignettes and survey are available upon request.</p><p>Participants also completed three IATs corresponding to the explicit bias questions. The <italic>Race Preference IAT</italic> measured implicit association of white and black race with good and bad terms. We created the next two IATs specifically for this study. The <italic>Race Cooperativeness IAT</italic> measured implicit associations between race and general cooperativeness. The <italic>Race Medical Cooperativeness IAT</italic> measured implicit associations between race and cooperativeness with medical recommendations. All IAT scores are expressed as normally distributed continuous variables. For efficiency we used a 5-block structure for the IATs, with the specific pairing received first (e.g., black-bad/white-good) counterbalanced across participants. We scored IATs according to published guidelines with zero representing no racial bias, positive values representing prowhite bias, and negative scores representing problack bias (range typically &#x02212;0.6 to 1.2).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref> Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the faces representing white or black race and the terms used as stimuli for the concepts of <italic>good</italic>/<italic>bad</italic> and <italic>cooperativeness</italic>/<italic>uncooperativeness</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Analysis</title><p>We examined differences in demographic characteristics, likelihood of CAD, and decisions to treat with thrombolysis between participants assigned to black versus white patients using chi-square and <italic>t</italic> tests as appropriate. We compared mean IAT scores for various demographic groups using <italic>t</italic> tests. To look for relative disparity by race between diagnosis and treatment, we compared participants&#x02019; ratings of the likelihood that the chest pain was because of CAD (the <italic>diagnosis</italic> variable, 1&#x02013;5 scale as above) with the likelihood of treating the patient with thrombolysis (the <italic>treatment</italic> variable, yes/no). To do this we put both the diagnosis and treatment variables on the same scale using <italic>z</italic>-scores. We then subtracted the treatment variable from the diagnosis variable to create a <italic>delta</italic> variable. A delta score of zero indicated that treatment was commensurate with diagnosis. A negative score indicated that treatment was more likely than diagnosis, and a positive score indicated that diagnosis was more likely than treatment. We used a one-way ANOVA to test whether diagnosis-treatment delta was different for black versus white patients.</p><p>To test whether bias predicted physicians&#x02019; use of thrombolysis for black and white patients, we used moderated multiple linear regression analysis with thrombolysis decision as the dependent variable, bias (implicit or explicit) as the independent variable, and patient race (black or white) as the moderator, adjusting for analysis-relevant covariates (e.g., physician race, sex, socioeconomic background, explicit race bias, implicit race bias, and belief in the effectiveness of thrombolysis). We then added the 67 physicians who were aware of the nature of the study back into the dataset and used moderated multiple linear regression to examine the potentially moderating impact of physician awareness on the relation between bias and thrombolysis decision. We performed all analyses using SPSS statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill, USA). The study received approval from the Institutional Review Boards at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Partners HealthCare System, and Emory University.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> describes demographic characteristics of the participants stratified by whether they were randomly assigned a black or white patient. Participants assigned black vs white patients did not differ significantly, except that first- and second-year residents were more likely to be assigned white patients. Year of residency did not have any significant effect on either likelihood of recommending thrombolysis (chi-square <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.98) or on IAT scores however. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows mean IAT scores for all three IATs by participants&#x02019; demographic characteristics. Physician race was the only consistent demographic predictor of IAT scores. Black physicians had mean scores on all three IATs near zero, whereas all other groups had scores in the positive, prowhite range. Emergency medicine residents also had somewhat less prowhite IAT sores on the general cooperativeness IAT. There was no difference in the IAT scores of participants randomized to black versus white patient vignettes.

It is a new method in its application to studying health care provider bias as a potential root cause of racial/ethnic disparities in health care. This is the first study to use a sociocognitive measure of bias among physicians, and to correlate this with treatment decisions according to patient race. It also represents the first time that the IAT, first published in 1998,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref> has been modified to measure and demonstrate an implicit stereotype specific to medical care (i.e., that black patients are less willing to undergo medical procedures).</p><p>Not surprisingly, most physicians did not admit to any racial biases <italic>explicitly</italic>. However, on the implicit measures of bias (IATs), most nonblack physicians demonstrated some degree of bias favoring whites over blacks. Participants&#x02019; scores on the race preference IAT showed a range of implicit race bias similar to previous experiments on nonphysicians.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref> The new <italic>cooperativeness IATs</italic> were normally distributed and somewhat correlated with the well-studied race preference IAT, suggesting that they measure different but related components of race bias.</p><p>Findings of implicit bias and its effects on clinical decisions may surprise physicians who tend to view their work as both altruistic and evidence-based.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref> Implicit race biases are prevalent in the United States in general,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref> and as such it should not be surprising that they are prevalent among physicians as well. The neural and cognitive processes underlying these biases are assumed to reflect both evolutionary bases and socially acquired orientations. The content of implicit biases(e.g., that black Americans are less cooperative than white Americans) are assumed to derive from sociocultural learning (e.g., explicit instruction and implicit messages) that accumulate over time. Implicit biases are primarily unconscious and do not imply overt racism. This is supported by the strong dissociation in the average level of expressed, explicit preferences and elicited, implicit ones, as well as the low correlation between explicit and implicit preference observed in this study. Critics of implicit measure of social cognition have asserted that such preferences and beliefs may reflect messages about the state of social groups in the larger culture but cannot be said to reflect an individual&#x02019;s own preferences. If that were the case, doctors&#x02019; own decisions should not have been predicted so clearly by their implicit biases. The fact that they do remind us that implicit biases may affect the behavior even of those individuals who have nothing but the best intentions,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref> including those in medical professions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref> The IAT is but one method for detecting implicit social cognition and it is the first to be put to use in the present study in a medical context. As such, the meaning and significance of implicit biases in health care deserves much greater investigation.</p><p>We found no difference in the crude rate of thrombolysis between study participants assigned a black patient versus those assigned a white patient. However, this race equality in treatment occurred in the presence of greater diagnosis of CAD in black than white patients. Equal treatment in the face of unequal diagnosis between the two groups constitutes a disparity.</p><p>The result of interest did not depend on demonstrating disparities in treatment. Rather, this study was designed to determine whether physicians&#x02019; implicit biases (IAT scores) predicted different patterns of thrombolysis recommendation for black and white patients. We found that implicit bias against blacks (as measured by the race preference IAT) was negatively correlated with likelihood of recommending thrombolysis for black patients and positively correlated with likelihood of recommending thrombolysis for white patients. This finding suggests that unconscious race biases among physicians may influence their decisions about important interventions such as thrombolysis for suspected myocardial infarction. Whereas several studies have pointed to unconscious biases as one potential root cause for racial and ethnic disparities in health care,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref> this is the first evidence directly supporting this link. We were encouraged to find most resident physicians open to the idea that unconscious biases could affect their clinical decisions, and that learning more about these biases could improve their care of patients. After completing the IATs, residents acknowledged greater vulnerability to unconscious bias than they did at the start, suggesting that the experience heightened their awareness. Also, those physicians who were aware that the study had to do with racial bias, and who had higher levels of implicit prowhite bias, were more likely to recommend thrombolysis to black patients than physicians with low bias&#x02014;the opposite of the study&#x02019;s main effect. This suggests that implicit bias can be recognized and modulated to counteract its effect on treatment decisions. These finding support the IAT&#x02019;s value as an educational tool.</p><p>There are several limitations inherent in this study. Response rates were relatively low and the sample size smaller than ideal, making it difficult to detect smaller effects that may exist. Resident physicians, particularly those at large academic health centers in Boston and Atlanta may differ from physicians who typically make thrombolysis decisions, so it remains to be seen if those with greater experience show the same pattern. Nevertheless, our primary findings are based on an experimental manipulation involving randomized assignment of the physician to a black or white patient vignette, which provides confidence in the causal interpretations that are drawn. A second limitation derives from the use of a computerized presentation of a patient, which may, for reasons that may not be obvious, have contributed to an outcome that may not occur in a typical in-person encounter. The result of predictive validity we report may be an overestimation, but equally likely an underestimation of the role of implicit bias in clinical decision making.</p><p>Future studies might do well to examine actual patient-physician interactions, introducing such dimensions as communication, rapport, and other nonverbal behaviors that are known to be related to implicit discrimination. It may in fact be the subtleties of interracial interactions that lay the foundation for differential treatment to occur.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref> IATs can be developed to provide a broader range of clinically relevant stereotypes, in addition to the tests we used. Studies should continue to obtain detailed measures of participant awareness because this did show impact on treatment decisions in our study.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that physicians, like others, may harbor unconscious preferences and stereotypes that influence clinical decisions. Further study is needed to confirm our findings, and to determine the extent to which unconscious racial biases contribute to health care disparities. Given the potential existence of these biases, new approaches to addressing disparities might include confidential feedback mechanisms to make physicians aware of disparities in their own cohort of patients, securely and privately administered IATs to increase physicians&#x02019; awareness of unconscious bias, and targeted education to mitigate its effects on clinical decision making. We cannot and do not suggest that unconscious bias among health professionals is the largest or most important factor leading to disparities in health care. However, the fact that it is, by its very nature, hidden from conscious awareness suggests that it receive explicit attention.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We are grateful to Joseph Betancourt at Massachusetts General Hospital and to Ron Walls and Tom Stair at Brigham and Women&#x02019;s Hospital for support and mentorship; to Elizabeth Donahue at Massachusetts General Hospital for assistance preparing the manuscript; and to Elizabeth Mela at Harvard University for help with all stages of this research and manuscript preparation.
