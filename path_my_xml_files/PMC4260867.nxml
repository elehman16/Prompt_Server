In this phase II multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the safety and immunogenicity of the novel H1/IC31 vaccine, a fusion protein of Ag85B-ESAT-6 (H1) formulated with the adjuvant IC31, was evaluated in HIV-infected adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>HIV-infected adults with CD4+ T cell counts &#x0003e;350/mm<sup>3</sup> and without evidence of active tuberculosis were enrolled and followed until day 182. H1/IC31 vaccine or placebo was randomly allocated in a 5&#x02236;1 ratio. The vaccine was administered intramuscularly at day 0 and 56. Safety assessment was based on medical history, clinical examinations, and blood and urine testing. Immunogenicity was determined by a short-term whole blood intracellular cytokine staining assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>47 of the 48 randomised participants completed both vaccinations. In total, 459 mild or moderate and 2 severe adverse events were reported. There were three serious adverse events in two vaccinees classified as not related to the investigational product. Local injection site reactions were more common in H1/IC31 versus placebo recipients (65.0% vs. 12.5%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.015). Solicited systemic and unsolicited adverse events were similar by study arm. The baseline CD4+ T cell count and HIV viral load were similar by study arm and remained constant over time. The H1/IC31 vaccine induced a persistent Th1-immune response with predominately TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-2 co-expressing CD4+ T cells, as well as polyfunctional IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-2 expressing CD4+ T cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>H1/IC31 was well tolerated and safe in HIV-infected adults with a CD4+ Lymphocyte count greater than 350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. The vaccine did not have an effect on CD4+ T cell count or HIV-1 viral load. H1/IC31 induced a specific and durable Th1 immune response.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pactr.org/ATMWeb/appmanager/atm/atmregistry?_nfpb=true&#x00026;_windowLabel=BasicSearchUpdateController_1&#x00026;BasicSearchUpdateController_1_actionOverride=%2Fpageflows%2Ftrial%2FbasicSearchUpdate%2FviewTrail&#x00026;BasicSearchUpdateController_1id=289">PACTR201105000289276</ext-link>

<xref rid="pone.0114602-Ottenhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop safe and effective TB vaccines to accelerate progress towards TB elimination.</p><p>Vaccination campaigns may administer TB vaccines to persons without knowing their HIV status. It is therefore essential to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of TB vaccines in HIV-infected persons. Furthermore, HIV-infected individuals have an increased risk of developing active TB, which may be decreased by an effective TB vaccine that reduces the risk of reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI) or prevents TB infection or reinfection.</p><p>The Statens Serum Institut Hybrid (H1) recombinant fusion protein (antigen (Ag)85B- Early Secretory Antigenic Target (ESAT)-6) TB vaccine, adjuvanted with IC31, has been shown to be safe and immunogenic in BCG unvaccinated, TB uninfected participants and in BCG vaccinated and latently TB infected participants <xref rid="pone.0114602-VanDissel1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> In this phase II trial we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of H1/IC31administered to HIV-infected adults with CD4+ lymphocyte counts greater than 350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and without evidence of active TB disease (PACTR Identifier: PACTR201105000289276).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Regulatory approval</title><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and approved by the following local and national ethics committees and regulatory authorities: Medical Research Coordinating Committee of Tanzania, Institutional Review Board of the Ifakara Health Institute, Tanzanian Food and Drug Authority, South African Medicines Control Council and the Human Research Ethics Committee, University of Witwatersrand.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design and sites</title><p>This was a phase II, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were eligible if they were between 18 and 55 years of age, HIV infected with CD4+ lymphocyte counts greater than 350/mm<sup>3</sup>, antiretroviral therapy na&#x000ef;ve, generally healthy, had no evidence of active TB, had no history of receiving immunosuppressive medication, immunoglobulins, blood products or known hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components. Women of child bearing potential were eligible if pregnancy was excluded and they agreed to use at least two forms of acceptable contraception from 21 days prior to administration of the study vaccine through to the end of the study.</p><p>The trial took place at two African research facilities, the rural Bagamoyo Site of the Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania and the urban Tembisa Site of the Aurum Institute in South Africa. It was carried out between 19th of December 2011 (first participant first visit) and 10<sup>th</sup> of September 2012 (last participant last visit); the first participant last visit was on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of July 2012. Written informed consent was obtained from all literate patients. In case of illiteracy, informed oral consent was attested by an impartial witness and documented with the patient&#x02019;s fingerprint according to ICH GCP guidelines (E6 (R1); 4.8.9), as approved by the above mentioned ethics committees and regulatory authorities.

The pharmacist prepared the vaccination according the pre-prepared study randomisation list. The unequal randomisation was employed to maximise exposure to the H1/IC31 vaccine thereby increasing the chance of detecting a serious adverse event to the vaccine. The study monitors, investigators, and participants were blinded to study product. The study pharmacists prepared the investigational product. Syringes were masked with red tape in order to conceal a slight difference in the appearance of the H1/IC31 and placebo.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Investigational product and vaccination</title><p>The Hybrid 1 (H1) vaccine is a recombinant fusion protein of the antigens Ag85B and ESAT-6 (Ag85B&#x02013;ESAT-6), developed and manufactured by the Statens Serum Institut (Denmark). The adjuvant IC31 was developed by Intercell AG (Austria) and consists the cationic polyaminoacid KLK, which is composed of the amino acids lysine (K) and leucine (L), and ODN1a, a single stranded oligodeoxynucleotide with alternating sequences of the nucleic acids inosine and cytidine. A volume of 0.5 mL was administered providing a dose of 50 &#x000b5;g Ag85B-ESAT6 (antigen) and 500 nmol KLK +20 nmol ODN1a (adjuvant) or 0.5 mL Tris buffer (placebo).</p><p>The H1/IC31 vaccine or placebo was administered intramuscularly with a 22 to 25-gauge needle at study day 0 and 56, after confirming eligibility criteria. The first injection was given into the right and the second into the left deltoid muscle.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Safety</title><p>All solicited local (pain, tenderness, erythema, induration, nodules) and systemic adverse events (AEs) (malaise, myalgia, headache, nausea, vomiting, athralgia, fatigue, chills, fever) and unsolicited AEs were coded by the Aurum Institute according to the MedDRA Dictionary Version 15.1. AEs and laboratory measures of safety were graded using the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (version 1.0, 2004) as mild, moderate, severe or potentially life-threatening and assessed for their relationship to study product. CD4+ T cell count and HIV-1 viral load were measured pre and 14 days post vaccination and at the study end.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>IFN-&#x003b3; release assay</title><p>QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay (QFT) (Celestis) was performed at screening and at day 182 to identify whether H1/IC31 induced a false positive result. The assay was carried out according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions with a cut-off value of 0.35 IU IFN-&#x003b3;/mL to either antigen (ESAT-6/CFP-10).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Immunological assays</title><p>All immunological assays described below were performed by the South African TB Vaccine Initiative (SATVI) laboratory in Cape Town, South Africa.</p><p>
<bold><italic>The whole blood intracellular cytokine staining assay</italic></bold> was used to quantify antigen specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses (interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-17) after stimulation with peptide pools of Ag85B and ESAT-6 peptides (each consisting of 15-mer peptides, overlapping by 10 amino acids, final concentration of 2 &#x000b5;g/mL, GenScript) and recombinant H1 fusion protein (final concentration of 5 &#x000b5;g/mL, Satens Serum Institute). CD4+ and CD8+ T cell expression of IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-2 was measured to assess the polyfunctional characteristics of H1/IC31 induced T cells. The primary immunogenicity endpoint was assessed at day 70 (14 days post 2nd vaccination).</p><p>Processing of whole blood started within 75 minutes after phlebotomy. One mL whole blood from each study participant and time point were either left unstimulated (negative control) or stimulated with peptide pools of Ag85B, ESAT-6, the H1 fusion protein and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (positive controls). The co-stimulatory antibodies anti-CD28 and anti-CD49d (BD Biosciences, at 0.5 &#x000b5;g/mL each) were included in all assay conditions. The whole blood was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 7 hours and Brefeldin-A (Sigma-Aldrich, 10 &#x000b5;g/mL) was added thereafter. The blood sample was transferred to a waterbath at 37&#x000b0;C and incubated for a further 5 hours. Thereafter the waterbath was switched off and allowed to reach room temperature. Within the following 10 hours the blood was harvested with EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, at 1.8 mM), red blood cells were lysed and white cells fixed with 9 ml of FACS lysing solution (BD Biosciences). Thereafter, white cells were pelleted and cryopreserved in cryosolution containing 50% RPMI (Lonza), 40% fetal calf serum (BioWest) and 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich). The specimens were shipped to SATVI ensuring that the cold chain was maintained.</p><p>The subsequent intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) procedure was performed as follows: the stimulated, fixed and frozen white cells from whole blood were thawed in a water bath at 37&#x000b0;C. The thawed cells were transferred to labelled tubes containing phosphate buffered saline (PBS, BioWhittaker) and washed. Next, the cells were permeabilised using Perm/Wash solution (BD Biosciences). Cells were then stained with the following anti-human antibodies: CD3 BV421 (BD Biosciences, MOPC-21), CD4-QDot605 (Invitrogen, S3.5), CD8-Cy5.5PerCP (BD Biosciences, SK1), CCR7-PE (eBioscience, 150503), IFN-&#x003b3;-Alexa 700 (BD Biosciences, B27), TNF-&#x003b1;-Cy7PE (eBioscience, Mb11), IL-2-FITC (BD Biosciences, 5344.111), IL-17-Alexa 647 (eBioscience, SCPL1362) and CD45RA BV 570 (eBioscience, H1100). Results of CCR7 and CD45RA staining are not presented here. Samples were stained, acquired and analysed in batches. For every ICS assay experiment, compensation controls (single stained positive and negative mouse kappa compensation beads) were included. These controls were processed in parallel with the study samples during the staining and acquisition process to allow post acquisition flow cytometry data compensation. After the samples were acquired on the BD LSRII cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), flow analysis was performed using FlowJo software (TreeStar version 9.6.2).</p><p>
<bold><italic>Anti-Ag85B-ESAT-6 specific IgG antibody assay</italic></bold> was used to measure antibodies specific to antigens of H1/IC31 as an indicator of humoral reactivity. Plasma was collected and frozen from ex vivo whole blood.</p><sec id="s2g1"><title>IFN-&#x003b3; EliSpot assay</title><p>Prior to the start of the study both sites laboratories were trained on specimen processing and storage. Both sites passed their proficiency tests for PBMCs cell viability and number and were IATA certified for shipping specimens. IFN-&#x003b3; EliSpot assay was not possible to conduct on PBMCs collected from the Tembisa site because the cell recovery upon thaw was too low (less than 100,000 cells). The cell recovery and yield was excellent for PBMCs from Bagamoyo. However, on Elispot assay, these PBMCs showed high level of spot forming units in the negative control wells that was indistinguishable from the response detected with the assay&#x02019;s positive control (stimulation with PHA). Therefore, we could not reliably report the IFN-&#x003b3; EliSpot assay results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical considerations</title><p>A sample size of 40 vaccine and 8 placebo recipients was adequate to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine. Assuming an incidence of adverse events in the vaccine and placebo arm of 10 and 15 per 100 person years, the probability of observing at least one adverse event was 0.87 and 0.95, respectively. The sample size for immunogenicity response rates were based on the phase I study results where 100% responded by the 2nd vaccination. The sample size was adequate to show an immune response in 70&#x02013;90% of vaccine recipients and an absolute difference of 66% in the proportion of vaccine and placebo recipients with an immune response with 90% power.</p><p>Laboratory and immunogenicity parameters were summarised by study arm and visit. The baseline is defined as the measurement at day 0. Comparing cytokine responses (magnitude of response using all participants) between study arms was conducted using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and between time points using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. The CD4 and log10(HIV-1 viral load) change over follow-up was estimated for each individual using linear regression and the estimated slopes compared by study arm using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. All AEs were summarised by system organ class and preferred term by treatment group and visit. The statistical analysis was performed using software STATA version 13.0.</p><p>The study protocol and the CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study population</title><p>In total, 167 adults were screened and 48 volunteers were enrolled (24 in Tanzania and South Africa respectively); 47 participants completed both vaccinations.

H1/IC31 vaccination of HIV-infected participants with a high CD4 count (&#x0003e;350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) induced a specific Th1-type response to the H1 antigen, and its Ag85B and ESAT-6 subunits. We observed some CD4+ T cell IFN-&#x003b3; responses to the vaccine antigen H1 at enrolment - prior to vaccination. The responses were most prominent in the QFT positive individuals, and probably due to latent TB infections or possibly cross reacting environmental mycobacterial infections. Despite these baseline responses, H1/IC31 vaccination induced significantly higher CD4+ T cell responses that were durable. These results are encouraging and suggest that latent TB infection will not mask an H1/IC31 specific immune response. The magnitude and durability of the Th1 responses in HIV-infected participants, and the lack of humoral response, has similarly been observed in HIV-uninfected participants <xref rid="pone.0114602-VanDissel1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>

The protective role of polyfunctional CD4+ T cells against tuberculosis infection is still debated.

This predominance of the TNF-&#x003b1;/IL-2 subset seems to be characteristic for the IC31 and CAF01 adjuvant.

<xref rid="pone.0114602-LerouxRoels1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>As formerly reported, H1/IC31 vaccination can lead to conversion of the QFT result because of its ESAT-6 component <xref rid="pone.0114602-VanDissel1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0114602-VanDissel2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In our study, this phenomenon occurred in one third of initially QFT negative participants. However, reversions suggest that some of the observation might also be attributed to within-subject variability of the QFT assay <xref rid="pone.0114602-VanZylSmit1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The concern that H1/IC31 can interfere with IFN-&#x003b3; release assays (IGRA) such as QFT for detection of LTBI has becomes less important since the WHO does not recommend IGRA to replace tuberculin skin tests in resource-constrained settings <xref rid="pone.0114602-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, where the vaccine would be broadly used. Furthermore, new tests using diagnostic markers other than ESAT-6 for disease screening are under development and have the potential to eliminate the issue of interference with the vaccine for low- and high-burden countries <xref rid="pone.0114602-Millington1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>New subunit TB vaccines should boost the efficacy of BCG and prevent TB infection and prevent latent TB infection from progressing to active disease. Both mechanisms are essential for the control of the TB epidemic. In order to achieve a better post-exposure protection, the Statens Serum Institut has added a latency-associated antigen (Rv2660c) to the H1/IC31 backbone, to create a multistage vaccine, H56 (Ag85B-ESAT-6-Rv2660c) <xref rid="pone.0114602-Aagaard1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Our trial of H1/IC31 provides valuable information to support the clinical development of the novel multistage vaccine H56. Particularly important is that H1/IC31 induces multifunctional T cells expressing TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-2, markers of central memory T cells, which are required for long-term protection against both reactivation and infection <xref rid="pone.0114602-Lindenstrm2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. This is critical for the vaccination of vulnerable populations such as HIV-infected individuals who often have a high level of exposure to TB and a relatively high prevalence of latent TB infection. Inevitably, the multistage H56 vaccine should also be evaluated in HIV-infected individuals to ensure that it confers durable immune protection in this target group.</p><p>The present study had a number of limitations. The study was not powered to show difference between subgroups, particularly by baseline QFT status. The whole blood intracellular cytokine staining data from one site and IFN-&#x003b3; EliSpot assay data from both sites did not meet the internal quality control standards, which limits comparability to other TB vaccine trials. The restriction to HIV-infected individuals with CD4+ lymphocyte counts greater than 350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> was necessary because of safety concerns, but limits the generalizability of the results.</p><p>In conclusion, the intramuscular injection of the adjuvanted TB subunit vaccine H1/IC31 was safe and immunogenic in HIV-infected adults, with CD4+ lymphocyte counts greater than 350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, from TB endemic areas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0114602.s001"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><p>
