Corticosteroids are known to be effective, but with modest results. Although simvastatin has been reported to be effective for immunorelated dermatologic disorders including vitiligo, controlled trials are lacking. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of topical betamethasone valerate 0.1% cream (as a standard method of treatment for vitiligo) versus a combination of betamethasone valerate plus oral simvastatin in the treatment of vitiligo.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Eighty-eight subjects with symmetric vitiligo who had body surface involvement up to 20% were divided randomly into two groups. Group A were treated with betamethasone valerate 01% cream twice daily and Group B with betamethasone valerate 01% cream twice daily and oral simvastatin 80 mg daily for 12 weeks. Finally, 46 patients completed treatment after 12 weeks in both groups. The results were evaluated by a blind dermatologist using Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI) score at baseline, 4<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, and 12<sup>th</sup> week of treatment. In a similar way, subjective assessment performed by patients based on photo evaluation at the end of the study.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Despite a continuous reduction in VASI score in both groups, according to both physician (<italic>P</italic> = 0.13) and patient (<italic>P</italic> = 0.374) assessment oral simvastatin was not statistically more effective than conventional treatment of vitiligo.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>This study indicates that oral simvastatin is not associated with significant impacts in the treatment of vitiligo as compared to other inflammatory dermatologic conditions such as psoriasis. Indeed, other studies should be initiated regarding exact molecular and cellular effects of statins in the treatment of vitiligo.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Betamethasone valerate</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>simvastatin</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>therapy</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>vitiligo</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vitiligo is an acquired pigmentary disorder, with a word wide distribution.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Although it commonly affects 0.5&#x02013;2% of the population,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] based on the epidemiologic reports from Gujarat, India, prevalence up to 8.8% has also been recorded.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The average age of onset is around 20 years, but any age may be affected.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Although men and women are equally involved,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] the mean peak of involvement in female patients occurs in younger ages.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In its common form, vitiligo presents as uniformly depigmented macules or patches with convex borders surrounded by normal skin.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The cutaneous macules of vitiligo commonly affect normally hyperpigmented areas of the body, including the face, the dorsal surface of the hands, nipples, axillae, umbilicus, sacrum, and genital regions, but can occur anywhere.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Developing of lesions in areas of friction indicates koebnerization is common.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Despite the fact that the exact etiology of vitiligo is unknown, the more accepted idea is that vitiligo represents a group of various pathophysiologic etiologies.

In fact, nonsegmental vitiligo as the more common form of the disease is primarily affected by the autoimmune factors.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In this model, the main effector cell is CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell that depends on the action of both interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) and chemokine receptors, especially CCR3.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Other than inhibiting of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl CoA, another convincing mechanisms by which statins are therapeutic, are anti-inflammatory properties.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] By means of flow cytometry, it was shown that simvastatin are direct inhibitors of IFN-&#x003b3;. Furthermore, statins downregulate the Th1-type chemokine receptors including CCR5 and CCR3.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>In the present study to our knowledge, we provide the first clinical evidence that measures quantitatively the effectiveness of oral simvastatin in the treatment of vitiligo. Considering the effectiveness of topical corticosteroids according to current data in vitiligo, betamethasone valerate cream as class III corticosteroid, was given to all patients.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Topical corticosteroids included among the most compelling approaches for small, localized vitiligo.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Despite the primary recommendations on the use of Class III and IV of corticosteroids, recent publications propose that even Class I can be used with good results in an intermittent manner to minimize side effects.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The reported efficacy of corticosteroid varying from one study to another (ranging from 30% to 80%) indicating a different response.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] In cases that there was not response after 2 months of therapy, to minimize the possible side effects, treatment should be halted.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>In our study, 26.3% (5 out of 19) of our patients in Group A (reflecting only the effect of corticosteroid) revealed &#x0003e;50% regimentation, which is near to the lower limit of response in the statistics of literature. The lower response rate may reflect the small number of subjects in our study. Moreover, by eliminating children from the study, a population group with better responses in comparison with adults, was excluded.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Despite the greater number of patients with improvement more than 50% greater in subjects of Group B (37% vs. 26.3%), by statistical analysis no significance difference between two groups at the end of study was detected. In other words, oral simvastatin was not accompanied by remarkable effects in the treatment of vitiligo.</p><p>Following explanation relevant documents on the immunomodulatory effects of statins in the treatment of dermatologic disease,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Wolkenstein <italic>et al</italic>. has noticed the diminished risk of psoriasis associated with statin intake.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In another study Naseri <italic>et al</italic>., evaluated the efficacy of oral simvastatin on improvement of psoriasis.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] This paper has shown significantly more reduction of Psoriasis Area Severity Index score in the group received oral simvastatin compared to group who did not (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001).</p><p>Concerning vitiligo, only in one case study by No&#x000eb;l <italic>et al</italic>., a clear regression of skin's depigmentation was observed in a 55-year-old man with vitiligo who received simvastatin. After the cessation of simvastatin, his vitiligo lesions relapsed. He was retreated with simvastatin which resulted in reallevation of his disease.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>In comparison to aforementioned studies on the beneficial impact of simvastatin in psoriasis and inflammatory conditions, the number of patients with remarkable response in our study was much less. This difference in response could be because of some limitations. It is now proven that vitiligo represent a group of heterozygous pathophysiologic disorders with the same characteristics. Despite the fact that autoimmune mechanisms are considered the main cause of generalized vitiligo, the role of neurohumoral, cytotoxic, and genetic factors is not insignificant.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In other words, considering autoimmune factors as the only underlying cause of all forms of generalized vitiligo is not logical. Furthermore, pathway alteration of the Th1/Th2 balance and inhibition of lymphocyte migration are the conjectural actions of simvastatin in vitiligo. However, inhibition of Th17 cell induction and interleukin-17 production, inhibition of mast cell degranulation, and induction of angiogenesis which are attributable to statins,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] are not considered to be involved in improving vitiligo.</p><p>In addition, childhood vitiligo better responds to therapy compared with the adult.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Excluding children from the study thus have affected the results, and underscores the clinical relevance of the pigmentory induction capacities of the treatment protocol. In determining the limitations of study, if we excluded subjects with rapidly spreading vitiligo, and those with lesions on areas known to be recalcitrant to therapy, fewer subjects would drop out of the study. Moreover, most of the studies regarding evaluation the effectiveness of a given therapy defined for 8 weeks. Considering that lesions unresponsive to corticosteroids after 8<sup>th</sup> week of treatment should be excluded, if we defined the study for 8 weeks, more subjects would remain at the end of the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, despite the continuous improvement of disease by therapy, adding of simvastatin was not statistically associated with significant effects. With regard to the discovery of immunomodulatory effects of simvastatin through studies of organ transplant patients, caution should be performed when considering definite immunorelated disorders such as vitiligo.
