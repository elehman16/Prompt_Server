These are a part of a broad category of practices called Kriyas that offer mastery over the mind in conformity with the definition of yoga and also have a therapeutic role.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In our pilot studies during the routine yoga therapy courses for CLBP at the residential health home, many patients had reported a good feeling with pain reduction and better flexibility soon after clearing the bowel through a colon cleaning technique called <italic>Laghu Shankha Prakshalana</italic> (LSP).[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Although, studies have shown the beneficial effects of selected <italic>Asanas</italic> combined with relaxation[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or integrated yoga[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in reducing chronic pain or anxiety or depression, there is no study to date that has looked at the effect of yogic cleansing techniques on LBP. Hence the present study was planned with the objective of comparing the immediate effect of LSP with an active session of back pain specific asanas in patients with mechanical CLBP with the hypothesis that, immediately after the practice of LSP, the spinal flexibility would increase with reduction in pain, disability and anxiety.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of 40 CLBP patients were admitted to a yoga therapy health home for in-patient treatment who satisfied the selection criteria were recruited for the study.

Numbered opaque envelopes were used to implement the random allocation to conceal the sequence until the day of the intervention was assigned. All 40 subjects were assessed on two occasions (3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> day) before and after the practice of either LSP or the active control intervention, the BST (Back pain Special Technique) Two groups (group A and B) randomization table was used to allocate subjects to the two interventions on the 3<sup>rd</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> day after admission to ensure random distribution of the hang over effect of the two sessions.

If the participant gets the urge to empty the bowel in between the practices he/she is permitted to rush to the toilet and empty the bowel. If he/she does not get the sensation, the cycle of drinking water followed by the practice of five asanas is repeated (a total of three cycles only) until he/she gets the urge. If they failed to get the urge within three cycles then the practice is abandoned and planned to try the next day. Although it was planned that those who did not succeed on the first attempt would be dropped out of the study, there were no drop outs as all of them succeeded in completing the procedure with a good feeling of clearence of the bowel.

It is known that the conscious awareness of pain involves cortical, limbic and autonomic systems.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] At the cortical level, evidence suggests that yoga helps in pain reduction due to production of endorphin resulting from alternate stretch and relax procedures of physical postures done with awareness.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] At limbic level, yoga offers mastery over the emotional surges through controlled and need based physiological responses to stressfully demanding situations instead of uncontrolled overtones of (HPA axis) hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis during chronic pain.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Studies also point to reduction in sympathetic arousal following yoga based relaxation techniques.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Yoga changes the physiological responses to stressors by improving autonomic stability with better parasympathetic tone and reduction in sympathetic arousal with improved performance.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>Peripheral factors that are responsible for CLBP include muscle spasm and local inflammatory responses. Leask and Abraham observed that mechanical, emotional, behavioral and motor dysfunction in CLBP may result in inflammation and fibrosis in addition to spasm and wasting, that could be traced to tissue hypoxia, lowered Ph and release of cytokines such as transforming growth factor beta-1.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] It is proposed that yoga reduces paraspinal muscle spasm and inflammation during BST and LSP through deep local rest and relaxation that follows safe stretches done with awareness.</p><p>Yoga considers mechanical CLBP to be a mind-body disease (<italic>Adhija Vyadhi</italic>).[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Accordingly, CLBP is the end point in the chain of events that starts in the mind (<italic>Manomaya Kosha</italic>) as an uncontrolled persistent emotional response to demanding situations of life. Yoga conceptualizes existence of a subtle energy (<italic>Prana</italic>)[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] in all living systems that intervenes between mind and body, that flows along different channels (<italic>Nadis</italic> or meridians), to promote all physiological functions. <italic>Prana</italic> flow increases on demand by the heightened activity in that zone and returns to base level during rest, i.e., as soon as one decides to sit or stand erect which demands continued contraction of the paraspinal muscles, <italic>Prana</italic> rushes to those muscles to keep it active as long as required. There are two subtle channels or nerves (<italic>Nadis</italic>) situated on either side of the spinal column from which thousands of branches spread all over the body to supply prana to different organs.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Based on the descriptions in traditional texts, some authors[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] propose that these meridians may correspond to the two sections of the autonomic outflow (left meridian (<italic>Ida</italic>) to the parasympathetic and the right (<italic>Pingala</italic>) to the sympathetic); a controlled flow of prana through both these channels maintains health; imbalance due to uncontrolled flow results in ill- health; the aim of therapy is to restore balance. Hence it is hypothesized that all yoga practices (including BST, <italic>Pranayama</italic>, LSP) help in restoring this balance, which can be seen as sympathovagal balance that has been observed in many physiological studies.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>How does bowel cleansing work? The clinicians of yoga and ayurveda (5000 years ago) observed that LBP is usually associated with disturbed bowel functions (constipation or IBS Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and proposed that this is a manifestation of uncontrolled excessive locked up flow in the local <italic>Prana</italic> control structures called <italic>Chakras</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] <italic>Chakras</italic> are vortices of <italic>Prana</italic>, which seem to operate through the major nerve plexi,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] that monitor and control the flow of Prana in six zones of the body starting from vertex (<italic>Sahasrara Chakra</italic>) to sacrum (<italic>Muladhara Chakra</italic>). The lowest of the seven vortices, the &#x0201c;root center,&#x0201d; situated at the base of the spine (<italic>Muladhara Chakra</italic>) controls the physiological functions in the lower zone of the trunk including all involuntary (e.g., defecation) and voluntary functions (Paraspinal and perennial muscles). Thus, it is proposed that CLBP is a manifestation of dysfunction of <italic>Muladhara Chakra</italic>. LSP clears the bowel by activating the peristaltic reflex by a combination of specific physical postures (<italic>Asanas</italic>) that are designed to release the locked up <italic>Prana</italic> in this <italic>Chakra</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The DRT that follows the practice of LSP (essential component after any <italic>Kriya</italic>) contributes to mastery over the local neuromuscular reflexes through internal awareness and releases the spasm of para-spinal muscles.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] BST also has similar balancing effect on the <italic>Prana</italic> and uses safe movements to develop this mastery. Thus, it appears that LSP offers a greater degree of pain relief than BST by the added bowel clearing effect.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Both yoga practices, namely yoga based physical postures (BST) and yoga based colon cleansing (LSP) have beneficial effects immediately after the practice in patients with CLBP. The LSP is better than BST in reducing pain, disability and anxiety and also in increasing flexibility.</p><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Strengths</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has looked at the immediate effect of LSP in CLBP and shown significant results in all variables including subjective (pain and disability) and objective measures (spinal flexibility). The novel aspect of the design of this study was: (a) the self as control design, and (b) incorporation of randomization and blinding.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-15"><title>Limitations</title><p>There were a few limitations of the study: (a) The study compared two specific yoga practices and there was no neutral control session. (b) As the study was planned to observe only the immediate effects on CLBP, it does not answer the question of long term effect of LSP on CLBP. (c) Although we did not observe any subject with aggravation of pain after the practice during our study, it may be argued that the yoga practices used during the standard way of performing LSP have the potential to aggravate the pain. Hence, we had to select only those patients with moderate to mild pain in an indoor setting of a yoga university and monitored the practices carefully by expert trainers with medical supervision. Therefore, the conclusion from this study may not be universally applicable to all cases of LBP. There is a need to evolve simplified versions of LSP.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-16"><title>Suggestions for future research</title><p>Future studies may be designed to look at the long-term benefits of LSP. Considering that this is the first study that has pointed to the beneficial effects of LSP in pain management, it is necessary to design studies to compare LSP with simpler methods of bowel cleansing through enemas or simpler laxatives as control interventions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-17"><title>Implication and recommendations</title><p>This study is a pointer to the immediate analgesic effect of LSP. When the result of this study gets established through more RCTs with larger sample sizes by other researchers, it would be very important evidence to the knowledge that cleansing the bowel is essential in pain management, which is strongly recommended in most CAM therapies such as yoga and Ayurveda. Based on the observation of this study, we recommend that &#x0201c;regular bowel clearing&#x0201d; may be included as an important vital parameter in the daily nursing procedures in all cases of acute and chronic pain.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>We are grateful to Dr. Pradhan B and Amrit R who helped with data management and statistical analysis.
