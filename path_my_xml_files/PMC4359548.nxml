Sample size is estimated to include 37 children, aged between 7 and 11&#x000a0;years, and their guardians, randomized for an intervention or a control group. The intervention will consist of 11-weekly group meetings of nutritional education and distribution of explanatory material, with orientation about healthy food and family habits and physical activity. Recreational, simple and low cost resources, carefully designed for the presentation of contents to the children and parents, will be used in all meetings. The control group will receive standard outpatient care based in individual clinical practice guidelines. The primary outcomes will be changes in dietary habits, knowledge and physical activity of children and adults.

Although this incidence has plateaued in many developed countries, it is still increasing in many parts of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Children with excess weight are at a greater risk of obesity in adult life. In a cohort that included 1709 overweight 5&#x02013;12 year-olds, almost half of the girls and a third of the boys became obese adults before the age of 40. Of those with more than 12&#x000a0;years old, 60% remained obese in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A systematic review showed that overweight children had twice the risk of becoming overweight adults, compared with healthy weight children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Poor lifestyle habits, such as consuming processed foods, with high sugar, fat and sodium content; reduced consumption of fruits and vegetables; sedentary activities such as long periods spent watching on TV or at the computer; all contribute to the continuing increase in the prevalence of overweight among children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the habit of watching more than two hours of TV a day is associated with an unfavorable body composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and may affect physical and psychological health. Decreased levels of physical fitness, low self-esteem, social behavior change and lower levels of academic achievements have been related to screen time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Conversely, changes in lifestyle, including decreasing screen time, reducing consumption of fat-rich foods and reducing physical inactivity may lead to decreased body mass index (BMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Childhood is considered as a critical period, during which the patterns of dietary habits and lifestyle are learnt and rooted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The fact that, in this age group, the control over eating habits is still largely dependent on the parents makes the treatment more complex, since success depends on involving the family in the whole reeducation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Results of a meta-analysis revealed that interventions that included family members produced larger effects than interventions focusing only in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Therapeutic groups represents another important option, since they promote and enhance the process of health education. Problems are divided among the group components and solutions are sought collectively, helping to achieve the bigger objective which is the change in behavior, both for the family and the child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>There is evidence that social support helps to improve lifestyle habits. Many patients find the motivation and energy required to maintain healthy eating plans through the support of their peers. Group support is one of the most valuable ways of support, especially regarding motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Preventive interventions, including health education strategies to reduce obesity and other cardiovascular risk factors in children, are important tools for the reduction of the epidemics cardiovascular diseases in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Educational programs focusing in food habits are being implemented in various countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], but studies on interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk factors in childhood in the routine pediatric ambulatory are still scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by our group showed that education and physical activity interventions in children have good results on blood pressure control and biochemical parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], however, there is little effect an antropometric measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Individuals develop theories to explain experiences and discuss concepts from observations and analyzes, thus systematizing their knowledge. The information in itself is not enough to change habits and attitudes; only when the individual gives sense to the information that it becames knowledge, which can lead to an attitude change. Knowledge is processed and acquired from several ways, depending on the context, the time, the emotional status and motivation of individuals. It is noteworthy that perception is influenced by socio-cultural habits and by the personality of the perceiver, which determine how the individual sees, hears, thinks, acts and feels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Scholars in the field of education explain the construction of knowledge in several ways. In accordance with the Swiss educator Jean Piaget, the development of intelligence in children is based on an approach that considers knowledge a result of subject-object interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The subject learns by his actions, as he/she builds his knowledge from interactions with the environment. Development is an ongoing and always expanding process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Russian neuropsychologist Lev Vygotsky believed that education and knowledge building take place within a cultural-historical context. Thus, knowledge building occurs through experiences and habits, attitudes and values of those who interact with the child in his family group and in their living group. Therefore, it is in the intra- and interpersonal relationships that the subject will internalize the knowledge of social roles and functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. For the researchers Maturana [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and Varela [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], life is a continuous process of knowledge. Educating constitutes a process during which the individuals live with one another, constantly adjusting this coexistence in a way in which makes progressively more congruent with each other in the living space. Learning happens, therefore, all the time and in a reciprocal way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. For Freire, the maturation of new possibilities and new challenges occurs through the exploitation of the environment; the subject builds new answers, and the construction of knowledge occurs through interaction with the world. The knowledge of the child in early childhood is based on the observation of the attitudes of adults. Bridging this concept to health education in childhood, playful activities are very effective in the teaching-learning process, arousing curiosity and facilitate the child&#x02019;s understanding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The pedagogical workshops can serve as catalysts for construction of collective/individual creative knowledge. Every workshop needs to promote search, action and reflection, combining individual and collective work and ensuring the unity of theory and practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>A study developed in Brazil with children 5 &#x02013; 10&#x000a0;years-old and their teachers showed that, after nutritional interventions, there was an increase in students&#x02019; knowledge from 61.1% to 73.6%; teachers also showed a significant increase in their knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The same was found in the 464 children, with the use of a Cognitive Theory based programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Studies based in interventions designed to increase knowledge of patients with chronic diseases showed increased knowledge and improved self-care of these individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Thus, increasing knowledge may help to improve self-care related to life habits changes.</p><p>In this context, the present study aims to present a differentiated proposal that includes technological resources that are already part of the lives of young people. The target population is formed by schoolchildren, also called &#x0201c;digital natives&#x0201d;. The construction of learning in a healthy education should involve attractive tools, in accordance with the reality of the world in which they live, in order to reach a more effective practical modification of life habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>This proposal aims to work with a mixture of low cost and innovative materials, associating recreational activities with everyday knowledge of the participants and scientific knowledge of professionals involved, through the formation of a group (children and parents) in which participants can share experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It is a proposal involving collective construction of healthy habits, with the potential to reach a large number of people, thus reducing expenses with the consequences of future chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>In addition, the use of a multidisciplinary educational intervention protocol for prevention of chronic diseases, guiding the child and family toward the construction of a critical, conscious and healthy thinking, can allow the individual to multiply the knowledge among family, school, work and community as a whole. After validation by the present study, this protocol may be used in different settings (school, family health strategy, community centers), allowing the prevention of chronic diseases through an educational program.</p><p>Thus, our hypothesis is that an educational program with playful activities for children and families, including text message reminders and social media composed of recreational activities is effective to increase the knowledge, physical activity and improve cardiovascular risk in children with risk factors, when compared to usual outpatient management. The objectives of the study are evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative, simple and cost-effective educational program in improving eating habits, physical activity and the knowledge of healthy habits in children, as well as their families, compared to routine ambulatory medical care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The study is planned as a randomized controlled, outcome evaluator-blinded parallel prospective clinical trial. This protocol is based in the CONSORT and SPIRIT statements for reporting of clinical trials and protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. A total of 74 children will be recruited. After the initial assessment, children will be randomized to either the intervention or the control groups with 1.1 allocation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The meetings will be practical and playful, including culinary workshops, games and homework assignments. All materials were developed targeting this specific cultural environment, based on our 10-year work with children in the Public Health System in Brazil. We have researched materials from other countries, but we felt that developing our own materials would benefit other groups in similar situations. We also plan to involve the children in the creation of materials during the workshops. Materials are fun and playful because they are mostly based in popular games and ludical activities. Workshops will be held in 3 different days of the week, from 6&#x000a0;PM to 7:30&#x000a0;PM. The setting is a health school located in the complex of Instituto de Cardiologia, with an ample room to accommodate children and families. All the members of the family that wish to participate together with their children will be invited. Children and caretakers will attend the workshops together, except in the days when the cooking workshops will take place at the cooking lab (days 3 and 8). During the 9&#x000a0;weeks of workshops, text messages will be sent twice a week, on Mondays and Saturdays (total of 18 messages). Message content will be related to practical tips for a healthy lifestyle.

In this context, early childhood education and care represents an special opportunity for prevention. Small changes in risk factors can have a considerable impact in improving the quality of life of the population.</p><p>The knowledge, attitudes, behaviors and skills developed through effective health programs may result in a better quality of life and empower children to make correct choices to promote the health of the individual, the family and the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. To motivate participants and improve their adherence to these programs, some authors suggest the use of text messages (SMS) or phone calls prior to scheduled meetings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Another important point to be considered is the relationship between health professionals and patients that help to ensure the adherence of patients to the proposals and guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The establishment of a relationship between patient and the professional team is important in helping the process of change, the awareness and capacity of resilience, even in the adoption of a new lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p>Various methods are used to improve habits of children; however, studies show that educational alternatives, with recreational intervention strategies, are more efficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Recreational resources should be encouraged as supporting actors in the process, since during play the child acquires experience and knowledge, concepts and values. Playful activities, including games and toys, are effective instruments that facilitate the learning process, improving the child&#x02019;s performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. An innovative, low-cost protocol that can be easily applied in educational interventions for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases, using resources appropriate for the age group, can be used in multiple contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p><p>The Happy Heart Study offers a playful and differentiated approach for the prevention and control of obesity and cardiovascular disease in children. Although this program is being planned for implementation in Brazil, the method can be adapted to many other countries. In developing countries, it is even more important to learn to prevent instead of dealing with the consequences of an established epidemics, and prevention depends on the implementation of health educational programs and healthy living habits.</p><p>Children are capable of quickly internalize what they learn, establishing a healthy lifestyle. They are also very able to spread this practice to the familiar context and to the society, as a whole increasing both short and long term results of preventive public health programs. The inclusion of the family in the intervention procedures was due to evidence that children&#x02019;s treatment programs in which several members of the family participate are more successful than programs consisting only of food restriction. In addition, educational materials in the form of manuals will be provided for parents in some of the meetings.</p><p>The present protocol for prevention of chronic diseases is a simple and low cost tool, and can be incorporated into the school curriculum, in the community and in different contexts. It has the potential to produce beneficial health effects and thus considerably reduce public spending with health problems triggered in adulthood by overweight and physical inactivity in childhood, representing an important prevention strategy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>VM and LCP wrote the project and designed the education materials.
