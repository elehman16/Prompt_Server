                            <p><italic>Objective:</italic> To compare the compliance, side effects and efficacy of amoxicillin and azithromycin for the treatment
of <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> infection in pregnancy.</p>

<p><italic>Methods:</italic> This is a randomized single-blind trial of women diagnosed with <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> before 33 weeks
gestation.Women were randomly assigned either 500 mg amoxicillin orally three times per day for 7 days or a single
dose of 1 g azithromycin orally. Patientswere interviewed by telephone approximately 3&#x02013;7 days following therapy
to assess compliance and side effects. Test of cure was performed at a follow-up visit 4&#x02013;6 weeks following completion
of therapy.</p>
<p><italic>Results:</italic> Thirty-nine patients were randomized with 19 receiving amoxicillin and 20 receiving azithromycin. There
were no differences in baseline data between the two groups, and there were no statistically significant differences
in side effects, compliance or efficacy. In the amoxicillin group 84% of women took all pills, while 100% completed
the single 1 g dose of azithromycin. Side effects were common in both groups (38% overall), with 40% of the
azithromycin group reporting moderate to severe gastrointestinal side effects compared to 17% in the amoxicillin
group (<italic>p</italic>  = 0.11). Of patients who returned for follow-up test of cure, 3 of 15 (20%) in the amoxicillin group were
positive compared with 1 of 19 (5%) in the azithromycin group (<italic>p</italic>  = 0.3).</p>
<p><italic>Conclusions:</italic> Side effects of therapy for <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> in pregnancy are common. Amoxicillin was slightly better
tolerated than azithromycin. Compliance and cure rates with both regimens was high.</p>
