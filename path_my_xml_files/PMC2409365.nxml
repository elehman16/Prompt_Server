Administration of NP 06-1 was also associated with weight loss.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, is characterized by degradation of articular cartilage which manifests as joint pain followed by reduced mobility. The origin of the disease is unknown but obesity, joint injury, metabolic diseases, bone and joint malfunctions, genetic factors and age have been implicated. Therapies for osteoarthritis include weight control, physiotherapy and pharmacological agents. Conventional drug treatments include analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, disease modifying therapies, hyaluronic acid, intra-articular glucocorticoids and topical analgesic/anti-inflammatory agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. More recently there has been a focus on nutritional support. Recent systematic reviews highlight the scientific evidence for potential nutritional and herbal preparations for those with osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>A systematic review of the literature covering obese subjects diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the knee concluded that osteoarthritis related disability could be significantly improved with a loss of over 5.1% body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Besides osteoarthritis related disability, increased body weight is associated with higher incidence of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. This array of potential disease risks associated with excess weight has been termed metabolic syndrome. Individuals with three or more of the components of central obesity (excess fat mainly in the abdominal area), hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension are considered to have metabolic syndrome. Treatment involves lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, as well as intervention with prescription drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The subject of this study, NP06-1 (Flavoxine&#x02122;/Citrofen&#x02122;, Next Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Salinas, CA), is a proprietary product consisting of a blend of extracts of <italic>Phellodendron amurense </italic>tree bark and <italic>Citrus sinensis </italic>(orange) peel standardized to berberine and polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs), respectively. NP06-1 was formulated with the goal of combining the beneficial effects of both the phellodendron and orange peel extracts. There are indications in the literature, as well as preliminary unpublished studies conducted by Next Pharmaceuticals, that this combination might reduce inflammation as well as have beneficial effects on lipid levels.</p><p>The objective of this clinical study was to study the effects of NP 06-1 compared to placebo on biomarkers related to cardiovascular health. Both overweight and normal weight subjects were studied to determine whether or not there might be a difference in benefits to these two groups. The effects of NP06-1 compared to placebo in the management of joint pain and mobility caused by osteoarthritis of the knee will be the subject of another publication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>The clinical trial was designed as a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study with four groups. Forty overweight and forty normal weight subjects were enrolled into either treatment or placebo groups, with twenty subjects in each group as shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Subjects were recruited via advertisements at the University of Yaounde I Teaching Hospital, the Djongolo Baptist Hospital and through the public media. The IRB of the Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences of the University of Yaounde I in Cameroon approved the study and all subjects provided informed consent. Dr. Julius Oben, Associate Professor of Nutritional Biochemistry at the University of Yaounde I, Cameroon was the principal investigator.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Study Groups. </p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>Group</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>BMI Category</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Treatment</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Subjects</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><bold>OP</bold></td><td align="left">Overweight*</td><td align="center">Placebo</td><td align="center">20 (13)</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>OT</bold></td><td align="left">Overweight*</td><td align="center">Active</td><td align="center">20 (14)</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>NP</bold></td><td align="left">Normal weight&#x02020;</td><td align="center">Placebo</td><td align="center">20 (7)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">NT</td><td align="left">Normal weight&#x02020;</td><td align="center">Active</td><td align="center">20 (11)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*BMI 25 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>&#x02013; 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup></p><p>&#x02020; BMI 18.9 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>&#x02013; 24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup></p><p>The number of subjects initially enrolled is listed; with the number that completed the study in parenthesis.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>To be included in the study, participants needed to be men or women, 25 to 60 years of age, diagnosed with primary osteoarthritis of the target knee using the American College of Rheumatology guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] by the treating physician and confirmed by the clinical investigator, and with a BMI between 25 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>to 40 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>(Overweight Groups) or 18.9 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>to 24.9 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>(Normal Weight Groups).</p><p>The exclusion criteria were: morbid obesity BMI &#x0003e; 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, joint replacements in any one of the knees, unable to walk without assistance, enrollment in another clinical study in the past 6 months, pregnancy, active infection, autoimmune disease, AIDS, HIV, active hepatitis, active malignancy, or diabetes requiring daily insulin management.</p></sec><sec><title>Administration and Dosage</title><p>NP 06-1 is a proprietary product of Next Pharmaceuticals, Salinas, California.

NP06-1 also contains a <italic>Citrus sinensis </italic>(orange) peel which contains bioflavonoids, including polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs). Both berberine and PMFs have demonstrated beneficial effects on lipid levels as well as glucose tolerance.</p><p>Berberine has been shown in human clinical studies to have beneficial effects on lipid levels: reducing triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol and in one study increasing HDL-cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Berberine may affect lipid levels by increasing expression of hepatic low density lipoprotein receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In a hamster model, citrus PMFs caused significant reductions in total cholesterol ranging from 19 to 27%; and in very low density cholesterol (VLDL-C) and low density cholesterol (LDL-C), ranging from 32 to 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>NP 06-1 generally improved lipid levels in this study, which is consistent with literature reports for berberine and PMFs. In this study, the overweight and normal weight treatment groups had significant reductions in triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol compared to their matched control groups. For HDL-cholesterol, there was a significant increase compared to placebo for both treatment groups. The greatest change in lipid levels was observed for LDL in the overweight treatment group, which decreased by an impressive 44.6%. These results indicate that NP06-1 may have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk factors. High triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels, along with low HDL-cholesterol levels, have been established as indicators of risk for cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Another risk factor for cardiovascular disease is high blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. NP06-1 caused significant decreases in blood pressure in both overweight and normal weight treatment groups compared to the start of the study and compared to their respective placebos. There was also a significant decrease in fasting glucose levels in the overweight treatment group compared to the start of the study and to the overweight placebo group. There was no change in fasting blood glucose for either normal weight group.</p><p>Both overweight and normal weight treatment groups lost a significant amount of weight compared to the start of the study and to their respective placebo groups. The overweight treatment group lost an average of 5.1% body weight after 8 weeks. Weight loss has previously been reported to decrease fasting glucose levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Thus weight loss may have influenced the decrease in fasting glucose levels observed in this study. The weight loss appears to be due to NP06-1 as participants were instructed not to change their exercise or diet regimens. Further, berberine has been shown to reduce body weight and to improve glucose tolerance. A mechanism for this is suggested to be an increase in AMP-activated protein kinase activity in adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>PMFs have also been shown to decrease insulin levels and improve glucose tolerance in hamsters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Research is ongoing on the potential antiatherogenic effects of citrus flavonoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In a placebo-controlled pilot clinical study, NP06-1 offered several potential health benefits in normal and overweight subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee. These potential benefits include significant improvements in cardiovascular risk factors; namely lipid levels and blood pressure. There appears to have been additional benefits to the overweight group compared to the normal weight group in decreases in fasting glucose. Treatment-induced weight loss was also observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>This study was sponsored by Next Pharmaceuticals. Mr Garrison was President and CEO.
