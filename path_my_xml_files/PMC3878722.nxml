It is associated with functional disability, and 10 to 20% of sufferers fall because of their symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although spontaneous remission is possible, many patients experience delays in vestibular compensation, which lead to chronic symptoms that interfere with everyday functional tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Over 66% of dizzy patients also experience psychological distress, often resulting in a vicious cycle of fear, avoidance of symptom-provoking movements, and increased handicap, retarding recovery even further [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Dizziness can be produced by peripheral vestibular disorders, central nervous system disorders, or combined lesions, as well as other conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Treatment typically consists of reassurance and antivertiginous and antiemetic drugs to relieve symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, several reviews of the management of dizziness have concluded that no medication in current use has well-established curative or prophylactic value or is suitable for long-term palliative use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Unconventional remedies, such as acupuncture, should be considered and scientifically evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Acupuncture, which is one of the main treatment modalities of traditional Chinese medicine, has been used for both the prevention and treatment of chronic dizziness for over three thousand years. The rapid development of acupuncture both within and outside China over the last few decades has itself led to great innovations in practice. Many studies, including clinical reports and systematic reviews, have investigated the benefits and success of acupuncture in relieving symptoms for various chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, there has been relatively little evidence in randomized controlled clinical trials on acupuncture to treat chronic dizziness.</p><p>The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in patients with dizziness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a randomized, controlled prospective study. We will perform the study according to common guidelines for clinical trials (Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmonisationand WHO Good Clinical Practice standards, including certification by an external audit). The trial protocol has been approved by the Research Ethical Committee of Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated to Capital Medical University (ref: 201316). This trial was registered with ISRCTN at Current Controlled Trials (ISRCTN52695239).</p><sec><title>Population</title><p>Patients will be recruited in the acupuncture clinic at Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, affiliated to Capital Medical University, with a target sample size of 100 subjects. Our trial will be promoted by a poster at this hospital. All candidates will go through a standardized interview process and receive more information about the study and the treatments. Patients will be informed in a manner suggesting that two different types of acupuncture treatment will be compared. One type will be traditional acupuncture and the other will be a new type of acupuncture, and the efficacy of both types is uncertain. Terms such as &#x02018;placebo&#x02019; or &#x02018;sham&#x02019; will not be mentioned. The participants&#x02019; written consents will be obtained.

Dizziness is difficult to define, impossible to measure, and a challenge to diagnose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Most patients with chronic symptoms are not relieved by medical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Chronic dizziness is a major public health concern. There are millions of patients with chronic dizziness. However, neither the mechanism nor safe and effective treatment methods have been clarified. Any treatment method that reduces chronic dizziness would be an important intervention. Our study will indicate that, despite the difficulty of diagnosis, practitioners can identify patients who can safely benefit from acupuncture. A number of patients with dizziness would prefer acupuncture over pharmacotherapy when our study demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture to treat chronic dizziness. This will be especially relevant for patients who do not respond to medical therapy or who experience adverse side effects to drug therapy.</p><p>In our study, the acceptability of acupuncture will be reported by patients. Our findings provide insight into a key factor related to effectiveness, namely acceptability of treatment. Acceptability is an important factor because it will impact on the take-up of the treatment offered and the compliance or willingness to see the course of treatment through [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We will report on patients&#x02019; experiences of acceptability, whether the outcomes from acupuncture are beneficial or not.</p><p>However, our study has several limitations. One limitation concerns the fact that we will recruit patients with various types of chronic dizziness, although all the patients referred to acupuncture department will be eligible for the study. However, effectiveness of acupuncture for different types of chronic dizziness is not evaluated. Another limitation is that the therapist is not blinded in the present trial. A blinded study of acupuncture would be challenging to conduct because it is almost impossible to blind acupuncturists to the treatments they are delivering. Therefore, a bias due to unblinding cannot be ruled out.</p><p>The results of this study will provide a new evidence-based treatment option for patients suffering chronic dizziness.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is currently in the recruitment phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>DHI: Dizziness handicap inventory; HAD: Hospital anxiety and depression scale; SF-36: Short form-36 quality-of-life questionnaire; VSS: Vertigo symptom scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CZL conceived the study and prepared the initial protocol.
