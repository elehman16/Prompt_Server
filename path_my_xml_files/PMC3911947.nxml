Rituximab is a chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibody that depletes CD20+ B cells and has been shown to be an effective therapy in patients with RA <xref rid="pone.0087379-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0087379-RubbertRoth1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Pooled analysis of long-term safety data from patients receiving rituximab within a global clinical trial program indicated that rituximab is well tolerated over time and during multiple courses of treatment <xref rid="pone.0087379-vanVollenhoven1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087379-vanVollenhoven2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, as with all chimeric antibodies, immunogenicity may be a potential concern. A safety analysis showed that 11% of patients with RA developed a titer positive for human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA) on at least one occasion during treatment with rituximab <xref rid="pone.0087379-vanVollenhoven1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The presence of HACAs was not associated with the development of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) or loss of efficacy on retreatment. Thus, the clinical impact of HACA directed at rituximab remains unclear.</p><p>Ocrelizumab (rhuMAb 2H7, [OCR]) is a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. In vitro characterization of OCR demonstrated enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and reduced complement-dependent cytotoxicity compared with rituximab (unpublished data), although the clinical implications of these differences remain unclear. The efficacy and safety of OCR in RA has been evaluated in a robust phase III clinical trial program in a broad spectrum of patients <xref rid="pone.0087379-Rigby1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0087379-Huffstutter1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In May 2010, OCR development in RA was terminated as a result of the overall risk-benefit assessment from the 2 pivotal phase III studies STAGE and SCRIPT. The efficacy and safety profiles of the OCR 200 mg (OCR200) and OCR 500 mg (OCR500) dosing regimens led the sponsors to conclude that OCR did not demonstrate an additional benefit over existing therapies, including rituximab for patients with RA, and that an application for regulatory approval of OCR in RA was not warranted. This paper presents the key safety outcomes of the 4 phase III OCR trials in RA to provide an overview of the safety of OCR in patients with RA and background methotrexate (MTX) treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The CONSORT checklist is available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087379.s001">Checklist S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>These studies were conducted at 686 sites across more than 20 different countries in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

At the end of the DBPC period in FEATURE (Week 24), all patients were re-randomized to receive either OCR200 &#x000d7;2+MTX or OCR 400 mg (OCR400) +MTX for a 24-week double-blind (but not placebo-controlled) treatment period. After completion of the double-blind period (48 weeks [SCRIPT, STAGE and FEATURE] and 104 weeks [FILM]), patients entered an open-label extension, where they were treated with OCR500 &#x000d7;2+MTX (SCRIPT, STAGE and FILM) or OCR400+MTX (FEATURE) at the discretion of the investigator. At the time that FILM was terminated, all patients had completed 52 weeks of DBPC treatment and only a few had completed 104 weeks and entered the open-label extension. Therefore, analysis of the DBPC period for FILM included only the Week 52 data. At the time that FEATURE, SCRIPT and STAGE were terminated, all patients had completed the double-blind 48-week period.

Malignancies were identified using the wide standard MedDRA query Malignant or Unspecified Tumors. Serious infectious events (SIEs) also included those requiring intravenous antibiotics. IRRs and symptoms were recorded on a specifically designed page of the case report form.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Immunogenicity and Pharmacodynamics</title><p>The primary pharmacodynamic (PD) marker for OCR is the presence of CD20+ B cells in the blood. Because the presence of OCR in serum could confound assays of CD20+ cells, CD19 was used to measure the levels of peripheral B cells following treatment (limit of detection, 0.05&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> cells/l in conventional flow cytometry). In each trial, serum samples were collected at prespecified time points for the determination of human anti-human antibodies (HAHAs) and B-cell levels (CD19+ cells). A bridging format enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine HAHA titers. All positive samples were further confirmed by competitive binding to anti-IgM, followed by implementation of an additional decision tree to confirm or reject true positivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Safety and PD analyses were conducted on the safety population, which included all patients in each trial who were randomized, received any part of an infusion of study drug, and underwent at least one assessment of safety. Evaluation of the safety data for each study led to the conduct of a fixed-effects meta-analysis of SIEs. The incidence rate difference in SIEs from placebo (PBO)+MTX during the DBPC period, weighted by study size was calculated for both dose groups using data from all four studies (STAGE, SCRIPT, FEATURE and FILM). An exploratory, hypothesis-generating analysis of risk factors for SIEs was performed on STAGE, SCRIPT and FILM DBPC pooled data sets. The multivariate approach (COX regression models) investigated treatment group as a risk factor, with baseline covariates that included but were not limited to age, body mass index, body surface area, weight, race, region, previous use of biological and nonbiological DMARDs, MTX dose, corticosteroid use, RA disease duration, presence of selected comorbid conditions and study.</p><p>All available malignancy data from baseline to long-term SFU (up to 5 years of follow-up) in the 4 trials were pooled.

Grade 3 AEs were relatively infrequent, occurring in approximately 5% to 10% of patients across the treatment groups, with no clear differences between the PBO+MTX and OCR+MTX groups. The incidence of grade 4 AEs was 0% to 2.5%. AEs leading to patient withdrawal were infrequent; the most common in all 4 trials were IRRs and infections. Patients who received OCR500+MTX in FILM had a higher incidence of AEs leading to withdrawal than did patients who received PBO+MTX (5.9% vs 1.0%). Although the incidence of SAEs varied across the trials, there were no clear differences in general between the PBO+MTX and OCR+MTX groups or between the different dose groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087379-t003">Table 3</xref>); the percentages of patients reporting &#x02265;1 SAE were approximately 8% to 14% (OCR200+MTX) and 11% to 14% (OCR500+MTX), compared with 8% to 12% (PBO+MTX). The most common SAEs overall were infections and infestations. In STAGE and FEATURE, the occurrence of SAEs in other system organ classes was infrequent and comparable across treatment groups. In SCRIPT, serious musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders were reported more frequently by patients in the PBO+MTX group (4.3%) compared with the OCR200+MTX (2.5%) and OCR500+MTX (2.5%) groups; this difference was mainly driven by an increased reporting of &#x0201c;exacerbation of RA.&#x0201d; The occurrence of SAEs in other system organ classes in SCRIPT was infrequent and comparable across treatment groups. In FILM, SAEs classified as respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders occurred more frequently with OCR500+MTX (2.5%) than with OCR200+MTX (0.5%) and PBO+MTX (0%); the most common SAE in this body system was interstitial lung disease, which was reported in 3 patients in the OCR500+MTX group.

The highest incidence of IRRs occurred during and following the first infusion of the first course; the second infusion was tolerated better, and IRRs became less frequent with subsequent infusions. The most common symptoms were pruritus, pyrexia, flushing, laryngeal/throat irritation, headache, nausea, rash, chills/rigors, hypertension, urticaria and dizziness. IRRs were reported slightly more frequently with OCR500+MTX than with OCR200+MTX in both STAGE and SCRIPT but at a similar frequency with both OCR+MTX doses in FILM. Only 2 patients in STAGE and 1 patient in FILM reported a serious IRR. The 2 serious IRRs that occurred in STAGE were recorded for 1 patient in each of the 2 OCR+MTX groups. Both occurred during the first infusion of the first course and resolved following symptomatic treatment.

The reaction resolved without sequelae following symptomatic treatment. One patient in the OCR500+MTX group of FILM reported a serious IRR, which occurred approximately 12 hours after the second infusion of the second course.

The majority of the population studied included patients with long-standing RA, who had been using numerous immunosuppressive treatments in the past and at least one immunosuppressive agent in combination with OCR during participation in the studies. Approximately one-third of the population studied previously received biological DMARDs and more than one-half of the patients were concomitantly receiving systemic corticosteroids. These factors have to be taken into consideration when interpreting safety data from the OCR clinical trial program in RA.</p><p>Although the overall safety profiles were generally comparable between the PBO+MTX and both OCR+MTX dose groups, an imbalance in the incidence of SIEs during the DBPC periods was observed in the OCR500+MTX group. A meta-analysis of SIEs in the DBPC treatment periods indicated a significantly higher rate of SIEs among patients who were treated with OCR500+MTX when compared with PBO+MTX. This was not observed with the lower dose studied. Other factors associated with risk of SIEs were prior cardiac disease, use of oral corticosteroids at baseline, and history of diabetes. Patients recruited in Asia were also at a higher risk of SIEs than were those recruited outside of Asia. Because nearly all Asian patients were recruited in the Asian region, we were unable to distinguish between geographic effects and ethnicity. In addition, the low number of SIEs in the DBPC period meant that we had limited statistical power in the analyses of interactions of risk factors, such as Asian region with treatment.</p><p>Confounding factors may have contributed to the higher incidence of opportunistic infections (9 cases across the OCR+MTX groups: 5 cases in the OCR200+MTX group and 4 cases in the OCR500+MTX group compared with a single case in the PBO group) such as endemic areas for histoplasmosis in the United States, tuberculosis in Mexico, and hepatitis B in Japan. In addition, the patient with <italic>Candida</italic> infections was receiving high-dose steroid treatment for concurrent medical conditions.</p><p>The clinical development of OCR was initiated in part with the aim of evaluating the potential safety advantage of a humanized molecule over chimeric antibodies. Humanization may be expected to reduce the incidence of anti-drug antibody responses. The incidence of HAHAs was low across the 4 trials (&#x0003c;5%) and, in general, comparable between the pooled OCR+MTX and PBO+MTX groups. There was no association between IRRs and development of HAHAs. In addition, there were no clear differences in the incidence of HAHAs when single-infusion and dual-infusion OCR were compared, although, because the patient numbers in FEATURE were small, the question of whether a difference exists between single- and dual-infusion OCR remains open. In a previous pooled analysis of approximately 2500 patients in the rituximab RA clinical trial program, 11% of those treated with rituximab developed human anti-chimeric antibodies <xref rid="pone.0087379-vanVollenhoven1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>As expected, both doses of OCR rapidly depleted B cells shortly after infusion. The question was whether the higher rates of serious infections seen in patients treated with OCR500+MTX could have been explained, in part, by differences in B-cell depletion/repletion profiles between the higher and lower doses. It should be noted that evaluation of B-cell levels in clinical trials is limited by measurement of peripheral CD19 counts only; however, the analyses suggested that there was no difference in time to peripheral B-cell repletion between the OCR500 and OCR200 doses. Moreover, the number of repeat treatment courses also did not seem to have a clinically meaningful effect on time to B-cell repletion.</p><p>The conclusion that the two doses of OCR, in combination with MTX tested in the RA clinical trials did not demonstrate a superior benefit-risk profile compared with available treatments led to the termination of the clinical development program of OCR in RA. OCR500+MTX demonstrated clinical benefit by improving signs and symptoms of RA and radiographic outcomes <xref rid="pone.0087379-Rigby1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0087379-Huffstutter1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>; however this dose was associated with an increased incidence of SIEs. OCR200+MTX did not show superior efficacy compared with existing therapies, but was safe and well-tolerated.</p><p>The clinical development of OCR is continuing in multiple sclerosis, for which there remains an unmet need for more effective therapies and background immunosuppressant therapy is not used. A phase II study in multiple sclerosis reported good efficacy and safety data, with no imbalance in serious infections between PBO and OCR (maximum dose up to 1000 mg&#x000d7;2 for 24 weeks) <xref rid="pone.0087379-Kappos1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Phase III studies are continuing and, because of the low prevalence of multiple sclerosis in Asia, no investigational sites in that region have been included.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0087379.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
