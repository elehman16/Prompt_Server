We sought to determine whether the administration of diluted lemon juice or full-fat milk would be effective in reducing interfering infra-cardiac activity and therefore result in an improvement in image quality. We compared the administration of full-fat milk and diluted lemon juice to a control group that had no intervention.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was carried out prospectively. All patients referred to our institution for myocardial perfusion imaging from November 2009 to May 2012 were invited to be enrolled in the study. A total of 630 patients were randomised into three groups. Group 0 (G0), 246 patients, were given diluted lemon juice, group 1 (G1), 313 patients, were given full-fat milk, and group 2 (G2), 71 patients, had no intervention (control group). A routine two-day protocol was used and the patients were given the same intervention on both days. Raw data of both the stress and rest images were visually assessed for the presence of infra-cardiac activity, and quantitative grading of the relative intensity of myocardial activity to infra-cardiac activity was determined. The physicians were blinded to the intervention received and the data were reviewed simultaneously.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results</title><p>The overall incidence of interfering infra-cardiac activity at stress was 84.1, 84.5 and 96.6% in G0, G1 and G2, respectively (<italic>p</italic> = 0.005). At rest it was 91.7, 90.1 and 100% in G0, G1 and G2, respectively (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0063). The visual and quantitative results favoured both milk and lemon juice in reducing the amount of interfering infra-cardiac activity versus no intervention.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The administration of milk or lemon juice resulted in a significant decrease in the intensity of infra-cardiac activity compared to the control group.

In most African countries, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is now the second commonest cause of death after infectious disease, accounting for 10% of total deaths, and it is estimated that this burden will double from 1990 to 2020.<xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> It also presents an enormous burden due to morbidity and health care expenses.</p><p>Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is a valuable tool in the management of patients with CVD and is currently used in Africa.<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The use of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging, with technetium 99m-labelled radiopharmaceuticals [<sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi (methoxy isobutyl isonitrile) and <sup>99m</sup>Tc tetrofosmin] in conjunction with either exercise or pharmacological stress is an established tool for both the diagnosis and prognostication of patients with ischaemic heart disease.<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>The basis of the non-invasive approach is that physiological changes in regional myocardial blood flow or systolic contraction of the myocardium caused by stress may be more predictive of outcome than a knowledge of coronary anatomy alone. Patients with normal perfusion on <sup>99m</sup>Tc SPECT MPI had an excellent prognosis, whereas patients with abnormal scans had an increased rate of cardiac death and non-fatal infarction during follow up.<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>For perfusion imaging with SPECT, thallium 201 (<sup>201</sup>Tl) and <sup>99m</sup>Tc-labelled radiopharmaceuticals are commonly used. The major metabolic pathway for clearance of sestamibi is the hepatobiliary system, therefore infra-cardiac activity from the liver and bowel may impact on the interpretation of the inferior wall after reconstruction. The presence of infracardiac activity leads to artifacts, reducing the desired targetto- background ratio, which creates difficulty in both visual and quantitative interpretation of myocardial perfusion.<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Activity may also be present in the stomach due to reflux of tracer into the gastric lumen from the duodenum, or because of uptake of free pertechnetate by the gastric mucosa. Infra-cardiac activity is less common with exercise and is more common with pharmacological stress and/or in rest studies.<xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Several different protocols, including a fatty meal, drinking milk, milk and water, lemon juice, milkshake, carbonated drinks, iodinated oral contrast, intravenous injection of cholecystokinin, and the administration of metoclopramide or erythromycin have been described as a means to reduce the artifacts arising from abdominal activity.<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Depending on the protocol used, the mechanisms for these interventions include one or more of the following: expansion of the stomach by the volume effect, displacing it caudally, thereby increasing the distance between the heart and the bowel; increased gastric emptying; stimulation of liver clearance and peristaltic movement; and acceleration of bile secretion and gallbladder emptying.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of lemon juice or milk administration compared to a control group, to decrease infra-cardiac activity and to assess any resultant effect on image interpretation of myocardial perfusion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2a"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a prospective study.

Patients were stressed on day one and a rest study was done on day two. Patients were fasted for at least four hours prior to stress testing (usually overnight) and were required to abstain from caffeine-containing beverages and methylxanthine-containing medications for at least 24 hours. Caffeine and methylxanthines block the adenosine receptors on arterial smooth muscle cells, thereby limiting the effectiveness of vasodilator agents. Our department&#x02019;s protocol is that we withhold caffeine in all patients, even if exercise stress is planned, in case there is a necessity to switch to pharmacological stress. Beta-blockers and calcium channel antagonists were withheld, where appropriate. The patients were haemodynamically and clinically stable for 48 hours prior to the test.</p><p>The stress modality (treadmill, dipyridamole or dobutamine) was chosen and implemented in accordance with the recent EANM guideline.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Routine imaging for stress is carried out 30&#x02013;45 minutes post tracer injection, however in our study some patients were imaged later due to the longer acquisition times with the addition of prone imaging, which is also a routine protocol in our department. All patients were imaged supine with their arms raised. Gated prone images were acquired after the gated supine stress images. The routine rest images were acquired 45&#x02013;80 minutes post injection.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Imaging protocol</title><p>SPECT imaging was performed using a double-head, rotating, large field-of-view gamma camera (GE Medical Systems Infinia hybrid system), equipped with a low-energy, highresolution collimator.

Filtered backprojection was performed with a low-resolution Butterworth filter and no attenuation or scatter correction was applied. Transaxial tomograms were reconstructed and the images were re-orientated into three sets of orthogonal slices, including short axis, horizontal long axis and vertical long axis for each study.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Two experienced nuclear medicine physicians (total experience 30 years) evaluated the raw data of the anterior (Ant) and left lateral (LLAT) views of both the stress and rest studies for the presence or absence of interfering infra-cardiac activity. Slice numbers 15 and 45 of the planar display from the SPECT acquisition were used in all patients to increase reproducibility. Slice 15 was chosen because of the best visualisation of the inferior wall of the left ventricle in the anterior projection, and likewise, slice 45 displayed the best projection for the inferior wall of the left ventricle in the lateral view. Observers evaluated the images simultaneously and were blinded to the clinical information as well as the protocol details.

Infra-cardiac activity arises predominantly from the liver, hepatobiliary system, bowel and/or gastro-duodenal reflux and can result in either an apparent increase or decrease in radiotracer uptake in the myocardium, especially in the inferior and infero-septal walls after reconstruction.<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Previous studies have been carried out, using both sestamibi and tetrofosmin MPI, with various agents used to reduce infracardiac activity, including the oral administration of various fluids or solid meals, and the use of pharmacological agents.<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The proposed mechanism of action is to fill the stomach, increasing the distance between the left ventricle and interfering infra-cardiac activity, or to increase liver clearance of radiotracer via gallbladder contraction.</p><p>In our study, the rationale for using lemon juice was that physiologically, acid-rich food or drink has the potential to facilitate hepatobiliary clearance of the bile by increasing the secretion of secretin, as was demonstrated by Peace <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Milk was administered in the other group, as it was demonstrated by Hofman <italic>et al</italic>. that milk resulted in a significant decrease in the intensity of infra-cardiac activity.<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The mechanism of action is thought to be that administration of a fatty meal delays gastric emptying, resulting in increased volume in the stomach, and also that milk stimulates gallbladder contraction, resulting in movement of tracer from the liver to the duodenum.<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The reason for using milk and lemon juice in our study was the ease of availability, as well as the simplicity with regard to performing the study.</p><p>Our study, to our knowledge with the largest number of patients, compared whether the administration of full-fat milk or diluted lemon juice would improve the activity in the infra-cardiac region, and these interventions were compared to a group with no intervention.

Also it was noted that the image quality in the groups that had received an intervention (milk or lemon juice) was better in a greater percentage of patients, with images showing absent or infra-cardiac activity less than bowel activity (50% in G0, 55% in G1 vs 34% in G2).</p><p>It is known that infra-cardiac activity is more common in rest myocardial perfusion images,<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> as was shown in our study, therefore our current protocol for rest MPI includes administration of 250 ml full-fat milk immediately after injection of the radiotracer.

He randomised 198 patients into two groups. One group had 150 ml chilled water and the other group had 150 ml milk five minutes after completion of the stress, and again five minutes before image acquisition. Patients also received 150 ml chilled water or milk five minutes after the rest injection, and again five minutes prior to image acquisition (total 600 ml of fluids for stress and rest images). There was a significant decrease in the intensity of infra-cardiac activity with milk compared to water. However the reduction in the intensity of infra-cardiac activity in the milk or water group did not translate into a statistically significant benefit in the image quality (<italic>p</italic> = 0.563 at stress and <italic>p</italic> = 0.502 at rest).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Study limitations</title><p>By excluding almost a third of the recruited patients (274) from the original number (904), the powers in each group were not the same. There are numerous studies that have looked at interventions carried out together with the time of imaging to reduce interfering infra-cardiac activity. We did not look at the effect of time in addition to the interventions carried out. Also, even though the acquisition of prone images was part of our protocol, we did not analyse the raw data, therefore in the absence of prone analyses, the overall effect on a stress study with regard to the interventions carried out is not known.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>When using <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi, the infra-cardiac activity causes significant artifacts after reconstruction and may lead to errors in visual and quantitative assessment of myocardial perfusion, especially in the inferior and infero-septal walls. Our study demonstrated that the administration of milk or lemon juice resulted in a significant decrease in the intensity of infra-cardiac activity compared to a control group. There was a trend towards greater improvement in the group that received milk for the resting part of the study compared to the group that received lemon juice. However, we are not sure of the impact of the amount of either milk or lemon juice, as well as the timing of their administration on the study outcomes. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine the ideal amount and timing of administration of these interventions. Also, further studies should be done with regard to prone acquisition with these interventions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the staff at the Nuclear Medicine Department at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic and Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospitals for the practical implementation of this study.
