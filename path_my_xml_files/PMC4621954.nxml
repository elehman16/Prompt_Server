The objectives are as follows:</p><p>This study aims to assess the effects of intervention strategies that reduce exposure to household air pollution from burning solid fuels on episodes of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in children under the age of 15 years.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Description of the condition</title><p>Respiratory infections may occur anywhere in the respiratory tract: the nose, throat, trachea, bronchi or lungs. They can be caused by viruses, bacteria or fungal agents. Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) are infections that affect the airways below the epiglottis and encompass bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia, while upper respiratory infections include those diseases occurring above the epiglottis such as pharyngitis, laryngitis or rhinitis (Simoes <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Knowledge of the specific location of a respiratory infection can affect the suspected aetiologic agents, prognosis and treatment.</p><p>ALRIs are the leading cause of death in children worldwide, with pneumonia alone killing an estimated 1.4 million children below the age of five annually (WHO <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2014b</xref>). It has also been estimated that 99% of the deaths due to severe or very severe ALRIs occurred in low-income countries (Nair <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Risk factors for ALRIs include decreased immunity due to conditions such as malnutrition, pre-existing illnesses such as measles or HIV, and environmental factors that include overcrowding, parental smoking and household air pollution (WHO <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2014b</xref>).</p><p>Household air pollution is most commonly due to burning solid fuels, including coal and biomass fuels such as wood, animal dung, crop residue and charcoal. Half of the world's population rely on burning these fuels for essential everyday activities such as cooking, heating and lighting (Desai <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Burning these fuels in an inefficient manner can lead to incomplete combustion and the release of various substances such as carbon monoxide, respirable particles of various sizes (particulate matter), nitrogen oxides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other health-damaging pollutants (Naehrer <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Burning these fuels indoors can repetitively expose individuals to levels of pollutants at much higher levels than those that have been recommended with respect to health and ambient air quality (von <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">Schirnding 2000</xref>).</p><p>Exposure to household air pollution from the burning of solid fuels for cooking is the cause of approximately 5% of the global disease burden overall (Smith <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Many of the world's poorest people do not have access to cleaner fuels, such as gas or electricity, and often cook on open fires in poorly ventilated homes. This exposes those who are cooking on the fire, usually women, and their young children who may be carried on their back or playing nearby, to levels of indoor air pollution many times higher than internationally recommended safe levels and often for extended periods of time (estimated at three to seven hours per day for years) (Ezzati <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; WHO <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). This exposure to household air pollution from the burning of solid fuels is a recognised risk factor for ALRIs in children, with a recent meta-analysis calculating an overall pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.78 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45 to 2.18) (Dherani <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). There is also good evidence for correlations between the products of combustion, such as carbon monoxide and particulate matter, and the occurrence of ALRIs. For example, an exposure-response correlation between particulate matter and child ALRI was described in the World Health Organization (WHO) <italic>Indoor air quality guidelines</italic>, which show a relative risk of 3.12 (95% CI 2.30 to 4.28) at higher levels of particulate matter exposure (WHO <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>). A 50% exposure reduction in carbon monoxide (as a surrogate for particulate matter) has also been shown to be associated with a significant decrease in severe pneumonia (but not physician-diagnosed pneumonia) in an intervention trial in Guatemala (Smith <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Although the effects of household air pollution exposure are notable, the association between household air pollution and ALRI is clear and interventions have the potential to reduce the risk by 20% to 50% (WHO <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>), the value of specific interventions in decreasing ALRIs in children is less clear. The reasons for this are likely multifactorial, but may relate to proper diagnosis of ALRI, inability to decrease exposure to necessary levels, insufficient sustainability and adoption of interventions, or difficulties with the implementation of interventions within various low-income settings.</p><p>From an epidemiological perspective, the term 'ALRI' focuses on bronchiolitis and pneumonia, which are potentially more severe diseases, with less emphasis on bronchitis. A diagnosis of acute bronchitis centres on cough and it tends to be mild and self limited (Laopaiboon <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Bronchiolitis is often defined by the presence of a wheeze in conjunction with other respiratory symptoms, such as cough or rhinorrhoea. Pneumonia is a more severe form of ALRI that leads to inflammation of one or both lungs with consolidation.</p><p>Application of these diagnoses in a real world setting can be variable, depending on access to resources and location (Lanata <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Rudan <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Less developed sites may have to rely solely on the clinical signs and symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease, such as fast or difficult breathing, chest wall indrawing and abnormal auscultation, while more developed clinical settings can utilise additional criteria such as pathogen diagnostics and cultures or radiographic findings for a more definitive diagnosis. Although the 'gold standard' for a diagnosis of pneumonia remains a finding of a new infiltrate on a chest radiograph or a positive culture plus a consistent clinical scenario, due to the lack of access to these diagnostic modalities the WHO have developed a clinical case definition for pneumonia that is widely used. It is described in the <italic>Integrated Management of Childhood Illness</italic> (IMCI) criteria as cough or difficult breathing in addition to the respiratory signs or symptoms of fast breathing (as determined by age), lower chest wall indrawing, stridor or selected danger signs (such as cyanosis or an inability to drink) (WHO <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">Handbook 2005</xref>). Application of the IMCI criteria has allowed greater uniformity in the terminology, diagnosis and treatment of ALRIs, but there remains a great deal of variability between research studies performed in differing settings that utilise ALRI outcomes. For the purposes of this review, ALRI includes pneumonia and bronchiolitis, as determined by locally trained medical personnel, as these are considered to be the primary contributors to the burden of disease associated with respiratory infections in children.</p><p>The goal of this review is to consider the current state of interventions dedicated to reducing household air pollution and the subsequent effects on ALRIs in children. These interventions can include decreasing the source of fuels, altering the environment of exposure, changing the behaviour of those being exposed or intervening at a regulatory level to affect overarching changes within communities. By evaluating activities at all levels, greater emphasis can be placed on the most effective mechanisms to reduce preventable deaths and disease in children, while recognising that cultural, societal and economic factors may influence the effect of any single type of intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Description of the intervention</title><p>Strategies for reducing exposure to household air pollution are urgently needed and the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves has recently been established in recognition of this (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cleancookstoves.org">http://www.cleancookstoves.org</ext-link>). Factors affecting exposure to household air pollution are varied, giving rise to many potential opportunities for interventions to reduce exposure. Such intervention strategies include:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>using improved cookstoves, which aim to burn fuel more efficiently and therefore produce fewer waste combustion products;</p></list-item><list-item><p>using cleaner or drier fuels, which produce fewer waste combustion products when burnt;</p></list-item><list-item><p>improving ventilation, to avoid air pollution inside the household;</p></list-item><list-item><p>changing behaviour, to reduce the amount of time an individual spends in proximity to a fire or stove; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>altering regulatory or financial policies, with intent to improve access to advanced cookstoves or fuels, and provide incentives for changes within communities or towards community development.</p></list-item></list></p><p>No single intervention is likely to be successful globally, due to differences in cooking practices, fuel availability and housing structures between communities. We will therefore consider a variety of different interventions in this review, but they are likely to have different impacts in different populations.</p></sec><sec><title>How the intervention might work</title><p>Although household air pollution is preventable, the challenge of reducing the exposure of children to it is substantial. Since it is a known risk factor for health outcomes, decreasing exposure, quantification of exposure and ensuing health outcomes have been initiated in a number of studies. The questions that remain are which interventions might be most useful and valuable for decreasing the indoor air pollution exposure frequently encountered in the 0 to 15 years age group and which interventions are sufficiently effective at subsequently decreasing the risk of ALRIs.</p></sec><sec><title>Why it is important to do this review</title><p>Practical, behavioural and cultural complexities surrounding exposure mean that studies evaluating the effects of a given intervention are challenging. Furthermore, current methods for measuring exposure, such as by monitoring airborne particulate matter, are not without limitations (Fullerton <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>As the urgent requirement for practically viable and cost-effective strategies for household air pollution becomes increasingly recognised, funding opportunities to identify and evaluate potential interventions are also increasing, but remain limited. It is imperative that available resources are directed towards the most effective solutions. Summarising the available literature will help to ensure that research gaps are identified and subsequently addressed, and that investment in new interventions is based on the best available evidence.</p><p>Although a previous Cochrane review has summarised the effects of household improvements on health (Thomson <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), this review did not examine the effects of reducing exposure to indoor air pollution using the interventions described above. Since the publication of a meta-analysis in 2008 on the effects of indoor air pollution on pneumonia in children under five (Dherani <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), further intervention studies have been published (Schilmann <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), therefore an updated review of the literature is warranted.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>This study aims to assess the effects of intervention strategies that reduce exposure to household air pollution from burning solid fuels on episodes of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in children under the age of 15 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Criteria for considering studies for this review</title><sec><title>Types of studies</title><p>We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before-and-after studies and interrupted time series studies. As noted in the guidance provided by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Review Group (EPOC <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), controlled before-and-after studies will be eligible only if there are a minimum of two interventions and two control sites. Interrupted time series studies will be eligible only if there is a clearly defined point in time when the intervention occurred and if there are a minimum of three data measurement points before and after the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Types of participants</title><p>The outcome of interest will be measured in children (up to and including 15 years of age) who live in those households. We will not exclude participants due to other demographic factors including race, ethnicity, gender, religion, poverty or location of household (e.g. rural or urban). We will include studies from all geographical regions, including high-income and low-income countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Types of interventions</title><p>Recognising that interventions in many arenas may affect a child's exposure, we will include studies of any strategy that aims to reduce a child's exposure to household air pollution from burning solid fuels. These interventions may be characterised as those that affect the sources of pollutants, those that improve the indoor environment, those that alter exposure through behavioural interventions and those of a financial or regulatory nature.</p><p>This will include interventions that aim to reduce the production of air pollution, such as:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>the use of improved cookstoves;</p></list-item><list-item><p>the use of cleaner or drier fuel;</p></list-item><list-item><p>behavioural interventions to reduce the amount that a stove/fire is used or to make stove/fire use more efficient.</p></list-item></list></p><p>We will also include interventions that aim to reduce the build-up of air pollution inside a household, such as:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>using stoves that have flues attached;</p></list-item><list-item><p>changes to improve the ventilation of the house (such as chimneys, windows or ventilation holes);</p></list-item><list-item><p>behavioural changes to avoid using a stove or fire inside the house.</p></list-item></list></p><p>We will include behavioural interventions aimed at reducing a child's exposure to indoor air pollution, such as keeping the child away from the fire whilst the food is cooked.</p><p>In addition, we will consider policy interventions that function at a national level, including supply and distribution of alternate fuels such as electricity or gas, or at a local level, including altering community access to fuels or cooking options. This may include financial incentives for alternative practices.</p><p>We also recognise that interventions may have more than one area of influence, such as the use of cookstoves that utilise cleaner fuels in combination with financial inducements for use.</p><sec><title>Comparison<italic>s</italic></title><p>Standard practices in that setting, for example, comparing an improved cookstove with using a traditional open fire. We will also include studies that compare different interventions, for example, studies that compare two different types of improved cookstove.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Types of outcome measures</title><sec><title>Primary outcomes</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Frequency of ALRIs</p></list-item></list></p><p>This includes pneumonia and other bacterial and viral ALRIs, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection/bronchiolitis. Physician-made diagnosis, diagnosis made by the report of key symptoms by the caregiver and direct observation of signs by trained healthcare providers or staff trained under WHO guidelines, or diagnosis made by recall of key symptoms by the caregiver within the previous two weeks is required for the study to be included in this review.</p><p>A chest X-ray confirming pneumonia and/or positive culture of a typical organism from blood/nasopharyngeal aspirate/sputum/bronchoalveolar lavage, in addition to any of the above, will add weight to the diagnosis but are not required criteria for inclusion in the analysis. We will consider those with a radiographic or culture-confirmed diagnosis in a separate subgroup analysis.</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Level of exposure</p></list-item></list></p><p>Ideally, studies included in this review will have quantified reduction in exposure by either household or individual monitoring of air pollution, such as particulate matter or carbon monoxide measurement. We will also include other forms of monitoring such as measurement of biomarkers of smoke exposure, exhaled carbon monoxide, reported or measured stove use, measured fuel use, measurement of time spent in the proximity of a fire (for example, Global Positioning System monitoring) or time-activity diaries completed by the caregiver.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Acceptability of interventions to household members; we will review any qualitative data regarding the acceptability of an intervention to members of the household in the study although we will only seek quantitative data as part of the search process.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Severity of ALRI in children, as determined by referral for access to increased intensity of medical care, hospital admission or referral, inpatient status, use of intravenous antibiotics or clinical presentation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>All-cause childhood mortality.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Burns, including severity of burns as determined by size, location or percentage of area affected.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The secondary outcomes listed are not required as part of the eligibility requirements for a study to be included in this review.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Search methods for identification of studies</title><sec><title>Electronic searches</title><p>We will search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, latest issue), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1946 to current date), EMBASE (1974 to current date), CINAHL (1981 to current date), LILACS (1982 to current date), Web of Science (1985 to current date), Scopus (no date limit) and Global Health (no date limit).</p><p>We will use the search strategy described in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref> to search CENTRAL and MEDLINE. We will combine the MEDLINE search with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for randomised trials (Lefebvre <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). We will adapt the search strategy to search the other databases. We will not use any limits for publication type, language or dates.

At each stage of the selection process, we will compare the two independently selected lists of studies and we will discuss any discrepancies. Where consensus is not reached, we will consult a third review author (LP).</p><p>In the first stage of the selection process we will review titles for eligibility. At this stage, we will adopt an inclusive approach. We will only reject studies if the title unequivocally indicates that the study does not examine relevant exposures or outcomes. In the second stage we will review the abstracts of the remaining studies, again taking an inclusive approach. We will then review the full-text articles of the remaining studies for eligibility. We will keep a record of which stage any excluded studies were rejected and for studies rejected after a full-text review, we will record a reason for rejection.</p></sec><sec><title>Data extraction and management</title><p>Two review authors (DH, HJ) will independently extract data using pre-defined data extraction forms (to be piloted on a small subset of studies first) and then cross-check for discrepancies. We will discuss any unresolved issues with a third author (LP). We will contact trial authors to obtain complete data sets in the case of missing data. We will extract the following data:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Study overview (study design, location of study, single-centre or multi-centre, length of study/follow-up period, year of publication, randomisation methods).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Characteristics of participants (sample selection, sample size, age range, gender, urban versus rural living, details of other sources of smoke/pollution exposure, details of co-morbidities).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Number of ALRI events.</p></list-item><list-item><p>ALRI details (definition, type of ALRI, severity, use of radiology or microbiological tests).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Air pollution exposure (type of exposure, type of fuel, measurements made, level of exposure as determined by format of assessment).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Intervention (type, duration, adherence, acceptability).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Number of deaths.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Number of burns.</p></list-item></list></p><sec><title>Cluster-randomised trials</title><p>For cluster-randomised trials, we will record the unit of randomisation (e.g. household or village), the number of clusters and the average size of clusters. Where possible, we will record the methods used for analysing the trial, including any adjustments made for clustering. If reported, we will document estimates of the intra-cluster correlation (ICC) coefficient.</p></sec><sec><title>Controlled before-and-after studies</title><p>We will extract and note the study methodology and details of the analysis method, including adjustment for covariates.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</title><p>Two review authors (DH, HJ) will independently use The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing 'Risk of bias' (with any discrepancies discussed and referred to a third review author (LP) if not resolved) and we will produce a 'Risk of bias' table and a 'Risk of bias' summary figure (Higgins <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). We will assess selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias and reporting bias. We will contact trial authors to clarify any unclear information. We will summarise the risk of bias for each outcome for each study. We will assess the impact of risk of bias on effect estimates using forest plots. We will restrict meta-analyses to studies with a low risk of bias.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures of treatment effect</title><p>We will extract the number of people allocated to each intervention group and the number of cases with the event for dichotomous outcomes. We will extract the number of people allocated to each intervention group and we will extract outcome means and standard deviations (SD) for continuous outcomes. We will calculate odd ratios (ORs) for dichotomous data. We will calculate mean differences (MDs) for continuous data. We will present the measures with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</p><sec><title>Cluster-randomised trials</title><p>Where analysis has been adjusted for clustering, we will take the reported point estimate and CIs. If not adjusted, we will calculate the OR or mean difference (MD) as above. If the number of individuals in each group is not reported, we will extract percentages or measures of effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Controlled before-and-after studies</title><p>We will extract adjusted measures of effect where they have been reported.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Unit of analysis issues</title><p>We will pay attention to the unit of analysis for each study, whether it is an individual or cluster-RCT, and we will analyse each study accordingly. For studies that have used a cluster-RCT design (e.g. randomisation occurs at a village or household level), when the analyses have not adjusted for clustering, we will attempt to adjust the results by multiplying the standard errors of the estimates by the square root of the design effect, where the design effect is calculated as DEff=1+(m-1)*ICC. This requires information to be reported, i.e. the average cluster size (m) and the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC).</p></sec><sec><title>Dealing with missing data</title><p>In the case of missing data, we will contact the trial authors to complete missing data sets. We will analyse studies by a complete case analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of heterogeneity</title><p>If studies of different interventions are included in the review, we will analyse each different intervention and present them separately. We will also consider different study designs separately.</p><p>We will evaluate statistical heterogeneity by visually inspecting the forest plots to detect overlapping CIs, applying the Chi<sup>2</sup> test (P value &#x0003c; 0.10 considered statistically significant), and also by using the I<sup>2</sup> statistic (where an I<sup>2</sup> statistic of greater than 50% represents substantial heterogeneity). We anticipate a fair amount of heterogeneity and we will apply a random-effects meta-analysis model.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of reporting biases</title><p>We will consider separately different study designs and studies of different interventions. If there are sufficient studies (approximately 10) we will construct a funnel plot to assess potential reporting bias, although an asymmetrical plot may also indicate other forms of selection bias, poor methodological quality or true heterogeneity.</p></sec><sec><title>Data synthesis</title><p>We will analyse data using Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>We will stratify analysis by intervention type and study design, with cluster-RCTs that adjust for clustering and individually RCTs combined.</p><p>If substantial heterogeneity is detected (I<sup>2</sup> statistic = 50%), we will not perform a meta-analysis and we will report a narrative synthesis. If there is evidence of moderate statistical heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> statistic 30% to 50%), we will use a random-effects model for meta-analysis. In the absence of statistical heterogeneity we will use a fixed-effect model.</p><p>We will analyse controlled before-and-after studies separately.
