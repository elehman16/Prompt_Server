Thus, <italic>Panchakarma</italic> therapy has a direct reference to both the health as well as the ailing. <italic>Vamana Karma</italic> is considered as the first, major and arduous procedure of <italic>Panchakarma</italic> therapy. Literally, <italic>Vamana Karma</italic> means to induce therapeutic vomiting or to expel out the contents of the stomach including vitiated <italic>Doshas</italic> through oral route, which is indicated for the purification of <italic>Urdhwa Bhaga</italic> (upper part) of the body.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The main place of <italic>Kapha</italic> is <italic>Urdhwa Bhaga</italic> and <italic>Amashaya</italic> (stomach). It is a general principle to expel vitiated <italic>Doshas</italic> from the nearest route, while the oral route is the nearest route for expelling <italic>Kapha Dosha</italic> in the form of <italic>Vamana Karma</italic>. So the removal of vitiated <italic>Kapha Dosha</italic> from <italic>Amashaya</italic> is the best way to cure a disease. According to <italic>Charaka</italic>, it is meant for purification of upper part of the body. But according to <italic>Sharangadhara</italic> and <italic>Bhavaprakash</italic> the word <italic>Vamana</italic> is used to denote the removal of &#x0201c;<italic>Apakwa Kapha</italic> and <italic>Pitta</italic>&#x0201d; forcibly outside.</p><p>It is important to understand that the <italic>Vamana Karma</italic> is indicated for elimination of <italic>Kapha Dosha</italic> not only in diseased states but also in healthy individuals in different physiological states where <italic>Kapha Dosha</italic> is aggravated e.g., in <italic>Vasanta Ritu</italic> (Spring) for preservation of health and prevention of disease. <italic>Vamana Karma</italic> is foremost procedure in management of <italic>Kaphaja</italic> disorders, where Kapha is predominant.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p><italic>Acharya Charaka</italic> and <italic>Sushruta</italic> have advocated various procedures for <italic>Vamana Karma</italic> known as classical methods, whereas some traditional methods are also being followed.

Considering the need of standardization of <italic>Vamana Karma</italic> and to produce firm data to support efficacy of <italic>Vamana Vidhi</italic> (procedure) comparing both the classical and traditional methods, the present study had been planned to standardize the <italic>Vamana</italic> procedures critically with the help of certain biophysical and biochemical parameters.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Aims and Objectives</title><p>

The average specific gravity of the total vomitus was 1018.18 in group A and 1014.54 in group B.</p><p>As <italic>Antiki Lakshanas</italic>, due to appearance of <italic>Pitta</italic>, maximum, i.e., 54.54% individuals in group A and 50% in group B tasted bitterness (<italic>Tiktasyata</italic>), 81.82% of group A and 100% of group B felt lightness in the abdomen (<italic>Udara Laghava</italic>), 50% of group A felt both pain and burning sensation of throat (77.27% of group B), while appearance of <italic>Acchapitta</italic> was observed in vomitus by 27.27% of group B and 13.64% of group A and 40.91% individuals of group A and 18.18% of group B realized lightness in the whole body (<italic>Gatra Laghava</italic>) with an increase in freshness (<italic>Indriya Prasannata</italic>). Maximum, i.e., 68.18% peoples of group A and 59.1% of group B followed <italic>Samsarjana Krama</italic> for 7 days, 18.18% of group A and 27.27% of group B followed it for 5 days and 13.64% each of group A and B for 3 days. Regarding pathological values, Neutrophil count was reduced upto 7.91%, which is statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in group A and upto 9.66% in group B, which is highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Total Leucocyte Count (TLC) was decreased by 8.4% in group A, which is also highly significant and by 6.87% in group B, which is insignificant. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) level was highly decreased upto 39.57% in group A, which is insignificant at the level of <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05. Regarding biochemical values, no significant difference was seen in total protein, blood urea and SGPT level. But serum cholesterol is reduced by 4.99% in group A, which is insignificant at the level of <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05. Reduction by 21.66% in serum triglycerides and by 15.28% in levels of HDL was observed in group A, which are statistically significant at the level of <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05. Whereas 14.39% and 0.73% reduction was found in the levels of S. Triglycerides and HDL respectively in group B, are insignificant statistically at the level of <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05. FBS level was reduced by 4.31% in group A and only 0.98% in group B. Both are statistically insignificant at the level of <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05 in group A. The plasma cortisol level was raised by 39.53% in group A just after <italic>Vamana</italic> process. As it was only one sample, the value is statistically not significant. In group A, Maximum, i.e., 50% individuals had marked improvements (Score = 3) followed by 36.36% who got rescued with moderate relief (Score = 2), while only 4.54% individuals were found with mild improvement (Score = 1) and 9.10% individuals had complete relief (Score = 4). Likewise in group B, maximum, i.e., 63.63% individuals alleviated moderately (Score = 2) followed by 27.27% personnel who got rescued with markedly relief (Score = 3), while 9.10% individuals found mild improvement (Score = 1) and no one got complete relief in this group, which is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Overall effect of <italic>Vamana Karma</italic> by both methods</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="Ayu-33-517-g002"/></table-wrap><p>As a comparative effect, <italic>Vamana</italic> by the classical method is clinically more effective by 17.11% than traditional methods in getting relief from signs and symptoms.

Because <italic>Vega</italic> had come out easily from deeper part of the stomach with viscous matter in group A than the group B as the particles of <italic>Madanphal Pippali</italic> were present in <italic>Yashtimadhu Kashaya</italic> (decoction) till end, for which individual had felt more exertions earlier but got more relief later on. The average quantity of every <italic>Vega</italic> in traditional method was measured more as compared to classical method, as more <italic>Kshudra</italic> or <italic>Madhyama</italic> and <italic>Khandit Vega</italic> had come in this method may be due to less intake of <italic>Vamana Kashaya</italic> (probably due to more thickened solution). Maximum percentage (i.e., 68.2%) of <italic>Pravara Shuddhi</italic> was observed in group A as compared to group B (i.e., 59.1), whereas more percentage of <italic>Madhyama</italic> and <italic>Avara Shuddhi</italic> were seen in group B most probably due to earlier expulsion of <italic>Vamana Yoga</italic> with vomitus. As MSI of group B (i.e., 2.86) was lesser than group A (i.e., 4.91) more drug output (more <italic>Dosha Shuddhi</italic>) were there in group B as compared to group A. Furthermore, more mucous (i.e., <italic>Kapha</italic> like viscous matter) were expelled in group A than group B, whereas <italic>Pitta Darshan</italic> was seen easily with a lesser time in group B as compared to group A. The average time taken to complete the <italic>Vamana</italic> (vomiting) by the classical method (58.36 min) was lesser than the time taken for traditional method (64.91 min), may be due to quick expulsion of vitiated matter, as <italic>Madanaphala Pippali</italic> was properly diluted in the <italic>Vamana Kasaya</italic> or may be due to quick appearance of <italic>Antiki Lakshanas</italic>, which leads the procedure to an end point. Clinically more percentage of individuals had marked improvement in group A, whereas more percentage of individuals got moderate improvement in group B, most probably because of more <italic>Shuddhi</italic> obtained by the classical method than the traditional. As we know that <italic>Vamana Karma</italic> is a stressful work, which is done in early morning (i.e., <italic>Kaphaja Kala</italic>). Likewise, according to modern science the plasma cortisol level also rises in early hours of morning and in any stressful stimuli. So Plasma Cortisol level was tested just before and after <italic>Vamana Karma</italic>, where a rise in Cortisol level was observed in classical methods. By physical analysis of vomited material, acidic pH was found in earlier stage and alkaline pH was seen in last stage (i.e., when <italic>Accha Pitta</italic> comes). More value of Specific gravity was found in vomitus of classical method as compared to the vomitus of traditional method. By biochemical quantitative analysis of vomitus (i.e., Hexosamine Test); mucopolysaccharide content of vomitus was found more in group A (669.64 &#x003bc;g/ml) in comparison to group B (480.68 &#x003bc;g/ml), as more viscous matter was expelled during <italic>Vamana</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-8"><title>Conclusion</title><p>From the present clinical study, it can be concluded that the method mentioned in the classics are very much beneficial from every point of view in comparison to the method which has been used traditionally as it is very easy, safe, less time-consuming, and clinically as well as statistically the most effective method. <italic>Madanphala Pippali</italic>, which was taken in <italic>Antarnakha Musti Pramana</italic> (By patient's own hand) in case of the classical method measured about average 13.51 g, which should be mixed in 4 l of <italic>Yastimadhu</italic> decoction for proper dilution. So this proportion can be taken as a standard ratio for <italic>Vamana Karma</italic>. In concern to <italic>Vaigiki Shuddhi</italic>, it indicates that more no. of <italic>Vega</italic> and <italic>Upavega</italic> come by the classical method as compared to the traditional methods. Measurements of drug inputs and drug outputs (i.e., vomitus) are necessary as <italic>Maniki Shuddhi</italic> may guide towards proper judgment regarding purification and provide some clues regarding the results obtained. By physical analysis of vomited material, &#x0201c;pH&#x0201d; of the vomitus can be used as an indicator to guide oneself towards &#x0201c;end point&#x0201d; (as <italic>Antiki Shuddhi</italic>). As acidic pH was found in earlier stage and alkaline pH was seen in last stage (i.e., when <italic>Accha Pitta</italic> comes), it may help to cease the <italic>Vamana</italic> at particular point. According to <italic>Laingiki Shuddhi</italic>, more <italic>Pravara Shuddhi</italic> is achieved in <italic>Vamana</italic> by the classical methods in comparison to traditional methods. However, all the <italic>Shuddhi</italic> have equal role in assessing the proportion of purification and predicting any type of result from it. Regarding the duration of <italic>Vamana</italic>, it can be said that the time taken to complete the <italic>Vamana</italic> by the classical method is lesser than the time taken for traditional method. Significant more reduction in FBS and lipid profile test (S. Cholesterol, HDL and S. Triglyceride level) by the classical method (despite of the consumption of a huge amount of Ghee during <italic>Snehapana</italic>) indicates that classical <italic>Vamana</italic> improves the internal homeostasis more easily in comparison to traditional method. By comparing the improvements in the symptoms obtained after <italic>Vamana</italic> with the purification done earlier, it can be said that more expulsion of vitiated matter might be there in the classical method in comparison to traditional method, as significant values were obtained during unpaired &#x02018;<italic>t</italic>&#x02019; test of various factors. More value of mucopolysaccharide content (hexosamine) in the classical method as compared to traditional method indicates that biochemical analysis of the vomitus can open a new door toward the better understanding of humors and assessment of the process provided vomitus should be analyzed in more sophisticated ways as well as in more individuals.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Agnivesha</surname></name></person-group><source>Charaka, Dridhabal Charaka Samhita, Kalpa Sthana, Madankalpa Adhyaya, 1/4, Bramhanand Tripathi, Charaka Chandrika Hindi Commentary</source><year>1999</year><volume>II</volume><edition>6th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Varanasi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Chaukhambha Surbharati Prakashan</publisher-name><fpage>1072</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Agnivesha</surname></name></person-group><source>Charaka, Dridhabal Charaka Samhita, Sutra Sthana, Yajjahpuruseeya Adhyaya, 25/40, Bramhanand Tripathi, Charaka Chandrika Hindi Commentary</source><year>1997</year><volume>I</volume><edition>5th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Varanasi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Chaukhambha Surbharati Prakashan</publisher-name><fpage>453</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Agnivesha</surname></name></person-group><source>Charaka, Dridhabal Charaka Samhita, Kalpa Sthana, Madankalpa Adhyaya, 1/14, Bramhanand Tripathi, Charaka Chandrika Hindi Commentary</source><year>1999</year><volume>II</volume><edition>6th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Varanasi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Chaukhambha Surbharati Prakashan</publisher-name><lpage>1080</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sushruta</surname></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Kaviraj Ambikadatta</surname><given-names>Shastri</given-names></name></person-group><source>Sushruta Samhita, Sutra Sthana, Vamana Dravya Vikalpa Vigyaneeya Adhayaya, 43/5</source><year>1997</year><volume>I</volume><edition>11th Ed</edition><publisher-loc>Varanasi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Chaukhambha Sanskrit Sansthan</publisher-name><fpage>160</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>P.
