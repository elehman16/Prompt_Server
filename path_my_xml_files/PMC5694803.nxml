These patients were randomized to specific or unspecific exercises. After 3 months of exercises the patients were asked if they still wanted surgery and this was also assessed at the present 5-year follow-up. The 1-year assessment included Constant&#x02013;Murley score, DASH, VAS at night, rest and activity, EQ-5D, and EQ-VAS. All these outcome assessments were repeated after 5 years in 91 of the patients.</p><p><bold>Results &#x02014;</bold> At the 5-year follow-up more patients in the specific exercise group had declined surgery, 33 of 47 as compared with 16 of 44 (p = 0.001) in the unspecific exercise group. The mean Constant&#x02013;Murley score continued to improve between the 1- and 5-year follow-ups in both surgically and non-surgically treated groups. On a group level there was no clinically relevant change between 1 and 5 years in any of the other outcome measures regardless of treatment.</p><p><bold>Interpretation &#x02014;</bold> This 5-year follow-up of a previously published randomized controlled trial found that specific exercises reduced the need for surgery in patients with subacromial pain. Patients not responding to specific exercises may achieve similar good results with surgery. These findings emphasize that a specific exercise program may serve as a selection tool for surgery.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>In 2 previous publications we have demonstrated that a specific exercise program was more effective than an unspecific control exercise program in reducing the need for surgery in subacromial pain patients at 3- and 12-month follow-ups (Holmgren et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">2012b</xref>, Hallgren et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The patients treated with specific exercises responded with reduced pain and improved shoulder function despite long-standing symptoms and previous physiotherapy in primary care. Patients were continuously offered arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD) until the final follow-up. After 1 year 41 of 95 chose ASD because of persistent symptoms, 12 of 50 in the specific exercise group and 29 of 45 in the unspecific exercise group. These results are in line with other studies concluding that specific exercises should be the first-line treatment for patients with subacromial pain (Brox et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>, Haahr and Andersen <xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>, Coghlan et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, Ketola et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>The present study is a 5-year follow-up of the original cohort. We investigated whether the previous results were maintained and compared the outcomes of surgery and non-surgical treatment. We also included a structural assessment of the rotator cuff.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="s1a"><title>Participants, previous interventions, and outcome measures</title><p>In the original, single-assessor blinded, controlled trial, 97 patients recruited from the waiting list for ASD were randomized to either a specific exercise program or to an unspecific exercise program (control) (Holmgren et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">2012b</xref>, Hallgren et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). All patients had long-standing subacromial pain and no clinical signs of major rotator cuff dysfunction defined as weakness in external and internal rotation and pathologic infraspinatus and subscapularis tests. All had undergone previous exercise therapy in primary care with an unsatisfactory result. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="TB1">Table 1</xref> (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17453674.2017.1364069">Supplementary data</ext-link>). The specific exercise program focused on eccentric exercises for the rotator cuff and both eccentric and concentric exercises for the scapula-stabilizing musculature. The control exercise program included unloaded range of motion exercises for neck and shoulder without progression. The programs are described in detail in previous publications (Holmgren et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">2012b</xref>, Hallgren et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). At the 3-month follow-up a shoulder surgeon blinded to the type of exercises asked the patients if they wanted to go through with surgery and in that case an ASD was performed as soon as possible. Surgery was performed by 1 of 2 experienced shoulder surgeons not involved in the study and included arthroscopic inspection of the glenohumeral joint and subacromial space, bursal and acromion resection. A supervised exercise program commonly used after ASD was performed postoperatively (Holmgren et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>). The patient&#x02019;s choice of surgery or not resulted in 4 groups of patients after the 3-month assessment: specific non-operated, specific operated, control non-operated and control operated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="TB1">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002 F0003">Figures 2, 3</xref>). A second follow-up was performed 1 year after inclusion. At all follow-ups (3 months, 1 and 5 years) the same shoulder surgeon, blinded to group assignment, recorded the Constant&#x02013;Murley (C&#x02013;M) score, Disability of the Arm Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH) Score (Swedish version), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0&#x02013;100&#x02009;mm) assessing pain intensity at rest, at night and at arm activity during the last 24&#x02009;hours, EQ-5D, and EQ-VAS.</p><table-wrap id="TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Patients participating in the 5-year follow-up</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non-operated</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Operated</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patients</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">91</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">49</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">42</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Specific/Control exercises<sup>a</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">47/44</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">33/16</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14/28</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sex: Men/Women</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">60/31</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">31/18</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">29/13</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age at follow-up, mean (range)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">58 (38&#x02013;69)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">57 (38&#x02013;69)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">58 (39&#x02013;69)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patients lost between</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;1-year and the present</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;5-year follow-up</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TF1"><p><bold><sup>a</sup></bold>Previous randomization</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>5-year follow-up</title><p>All 95 patients who participated in the 1-year follow-up were invited to a 5-year follow-up performed by a shoulder surgeon blinded to the initial group randomization.

The patients also filled in a questionnaire asking for use of health care, present shoulder symptoms, recurrence, and shoulder exercise habits during the past 4 years. Ultrasound examinations of the rotator cuff were performed by an experienced assessor, blinded to the findings at inclusion. A Siemens Acuson Sequoia 512 (Acuson, Mountain View, CA, USA) with a variable 8&#x02013;10&#x02009;MHz linear array transducer was used at all examinations. The status of the rotator cuff was divided into: intact, partial-thickness tear (PTT), or full-thickness tear (FTT) referring to the depth of the tendon (Bjornsson et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Tear size in mm was not measured. Tear progression was defined as progression from intact tendons at baseline to a partial- or full-thickness tear or from an initial partial- to a full-thickness tear at the 5-year follow-up. A full-thickness tear at inclusion that had enlarged to affect an adjacent, previously intact, tendon was also considered a progression.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Statistics</title><p>Pearson&#x02019;s chi-square test was used to compare the proportion of patients choosing surgery in the originally randomized group, and also for the proportions of patients with progression of a cuff tear.

Supervised exercise as the first line of treatment for subacromial pain is supported by results from other randomized trials and this study adds further evidence to the current recommendations (Brox et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>, Haahr and Andersen <xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>, Ketola et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, Haik et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Our exercise program included both eccentric and concentric exercises for the rotator cuff and the scapula-stabilizing muscles. Pain was allowed to a certain limit and progression of load was guided by a pain-monitoring model (Thomee <xref rid="C25" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). The rationale was that an increased range of motion, strength, and endurance would help to normalize the scapulohumeral kinematics and centralize the humeral head in the glenoid fossa during movement (Kromer et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, Maenhout et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, Struyf et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Exercises are also hypothesized to have an inhibitory effect on central sensitization that may occur in many of the unilateral subacromial pain patients&#x02019; symptoms (Sanchis et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C22" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Since subacromial pain has a multifactorial origin it is impossible to know which one of the components, or a combination of them, could explain the positive outcome after our specific exercise strategy (Lewis <xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Reasons for the remaining effect in the current study, 5 years after a 3-month specific exercise intervention, are unclear. Patients may have learned to correct their shoulder kinematics to use their shoulder more functionally over the years (Curry et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Also, a likely positive effect of the program was the &#x0201c;vocal treatment&#x0201d;, including information on their shoulder disorder, ergonomics, and posture correction (Adolfsson <xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, Lewis <xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The mean age in the cohort was 58 (38&#x02013;69) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="TB1">Table 1</xref>). The mean C&#x02013;M score of the cohort was 86 which corresponds well with age and sex-adjusted C&#x02013;M scores in the healthy population (Katolik et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). This reflects that the patients in the present study, on a group-level, reached a very good outcome.</p><p>Brox et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) compared surgery, supervised exercises, and placebo, and found that 25% of the patients in the placebo group reported a satisfactory result and contributed this to the natural course of the disease. In our study 16 of the 44 patients in the control exercise group chose not to be operated despite previous long-standing symptoms and an unsatisfactory result of physiotherapy in primary care. The positive result in this third of the group might be explained by multiple factors, the natural course being one (Arroll and Goodyear-Smith <xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>, Crawshaw et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>When considering the other objective of this study, to compare surgical and non-surgical treatment, we found that the change over time in mean C&#x02013;M score was well above the level for clinical relevance, reported to be between 17 and 24 points, in both operated and non-operated groups (Holmgren et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). These results are also in line with the clinically relevant pain reduction displayed in the VAS recordings and the overall patient satisfaction in both groups (Tashjian et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C24" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The operated group showed a similar clinical improvement but this occurred after the surgical intervention.</p><p>The presence and progression of cuff tears was more often found in the operated group, a result that is in line with our previous study, where we found that patients with full-thickness tears and the lowest baseline scores were more prone to choose surgery (Hallgren et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). A structural cuff pathology may in part explain the inferior result in the operated group as rotator cuff disease may be the leading cause of prolonged shoulder pain and disability (Adler et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Also the non-operated group included patients with progression of structural lesions that may be the result of natural aging, despite which they had an excellent 5-year result measured with several different outcomes. Multiple factors not related to pathoanatomy, such as mental health, age, genetics, comorbidities, and female sex, are found to influence outcome after treatment of subacromial pain with or without cuff tears (Curry et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, Lewis <xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The multifactorial cause of symptoms may explain why a specific exercise strategy addressing several mechanisms is successful for the majority of patients.</p><p>As a result of the growing body of evidence supporting structured exercises as treatment of subacromial pain, ASD has become questioned (Brox et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>, Haahr and Andersen <xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>, Ketola et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, Haik et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Ketola et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, <xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) concluded that patients without satisfactory symptom relief after non-operative treatment did not do any better after surgery. These conclusions are in conflict with our findings that patients treated with ASD improved substantially and with the same magnitude as the non-operated. Comparison between previous controlled studies is, however, difficult because of difference in inclusion criteria and baseline scores. The cohort in the study by Ketola et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) may have included patients with other disorders not responsive to any of the treatments used. We used strict inclusion criteria and we believe that our study group was homogeneous in terms of symptoms and all patients rated low baseline values on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD), a screening tool for depression and anxiety (Zigmond and Snaith <xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>, Holmgren et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">2012b</xref>). Understanding of the individual pathomechanisms is difficult but the results from other and our studies appear to confirm that a specific exercise strategy should be the initial treatment for subacromial pain with or without small rotator cuff tears (Holmgren et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">2012b</xref>, Ketola et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, Hallgren et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Acromioplasty can be recommended for patients without clinical signs of major cuff dysfunction and with unsatisfactory relief from specific exercise treatment.</p><p>A limitation of our study is the lack of an observational group to follow the natural course, but since all patients had been recommended some kind of exercises in primary care before inclusion in the original randomized trial we could not study the natural course. Since the investigation is based on a sample of patients with similar symptoms and radiological findings, performed at 1 hospital in a trial setting, the generalizability to all subacromial pain patients may be limited. Further, ultrasound is reportedly more accurate in detecting full-thickness tears than partial thickness tears (Cole et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). To handle this potential insecurity, we used experienced ultrasound assessors and the same equipment at all assessments. Strengths are the 5-year longitudinal data, both clinically and structural, on 91 of the 97 patients in the original cohort, making this study unique.</p><p>In summary, this 5-year follow-up supports the hypothesis that a specific exercise strategy should be the initial treatment of patients with subacromial pain. Patients not responding to specific exercises and those with more pronounced pathology may need surgery to reach a similar good result and the specific exercise program may serve as a selection tool for surgery.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Tables 1 and 3 are available as supplementary data in the online version of this article, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17453674.2017.1364069">http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17453674.2017.1364069</ext-link></p><p>HB, TH, B&#x000d6;, KJ and LA conceived and designed the study protocol.
