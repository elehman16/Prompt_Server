In general, the use of medication promotes only a modest weight loss in the range of 2 to 10 kg, usually most effective during the first 6 months of therapy; however, studies have shown positive effects on other risk factors such as blood pressure and serum glucose levels, but there are fewer studies in patients with diabetes. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of topiramate on weight reduction patients with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This was a 32-week randomized clinical trial study of 69 subjects during 2008-2010.

The percentage change in body weight and Body Mass Index (BMI) at the end of the study was the primary efficacy endpoint and secondary indicators were changes in blood pressure (BP), proportion of subjects who achieved 5% or 10% weight loss, changes in lipid profile (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides); and changes in glycosylated hemoglobin (HgA1c).

All individuals were referred to a single endocrinologist (blinded to drug administration) and the study was fully introduced to the participants (Also blinded to drug administration).

All subjects participated in a non-pharmacologic lifestyle intervention program, designed and performed by the nutrition counselors of the Institute during the study. The emphasis of the program was a diet composed of low-salt (1,500 mg/day) with a maximum of 30% fat and an energy content that was 300 kcal less than the patient's daily energy. The goal population was stratified into different life-style and medication, then the samples were randomly selected split into two groups; one to receive the placebo and the other topiramate at a doses of 150 mg/day,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] 100 mg each morning and 50 mg every evening. The 3-week titration phase began with administration of 25 mg topiramate once every morning to subjects assigned to that group. In the second week, topiramate was administered at 25 mg twice daily (50 mg/day). The dose was thereafter increased to 100 mg/day (50 mg in the morning and 50 mg in the evening). The maintenance phase begun in the 4<sup>th</sup> week with the dose of 150 mg/day. During the maintenance phase, the dose remained constant (placebo and 150 mg/day, divided in to twice daily doses as stated above).

This weight loss was accompanied by significant reduction in HbA1c. In different studies, it has been demonstrated that a modest reduction in body weight will considerably improve glycemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] In our study, weight changes from baseline (&#x0003e;5%) were seen in 25% of subjects in the topiramate group compared with the placebo group (&#x0003c;5% of cases). This may account for improvement in HbA1c. All participants were matched for medication, diet and daily physical activity. Blood pressure and lipid profiles were predominantly normal at baseline. This may explain the relatively modest changes in these factors. Although the effect of topiramate on systolic blood pressure and cholesterol were statistically significant, triglyceride changes, that can be more dependent on body weight, did not differ significantly.</p><p>In the current study, the effect of topiramate was less compared with other studies that had used higher doses of topiramate for longer durations. Some studies suggest that topiramate can be more effective with longer treatment; hence, in subjects who did not show any persistent or adverse side effects, it could be used for longer periods.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>In a study conducted by Wilding <italic>et al</italic>., the mean decrease in body weight with topiramate 192 mg/day was 9.1% and 61% of these subjects lost at least 5% of their baseline body weight at week 60 of the treatment. Hence, there were no statistically significant differences in weight loss between the groups treated with doses of 256 and 192 mg/day.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Additional weight loss was observed in this study compared with our study; the difference could be attributed to the longer treatment duration, but the results are comparable at month 6 (near 5.5% weight loss). In another randomized placebo-controlled study, a total of 111 subjects were studied for 16 weeks, which demonstrated (2.5 vs. 6 kg, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) weight loss and 0.4% vs. 0.7% lowering effect in HgA1C, concluding improvements in diabetic patients, however, the authors did not recommend it due to central nervous system and psychiatric adverse events.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Recently, combination of topiramate with phentermine has been evaluated in two big studies for weight loss which demonstrated near 10% weight loss and 0.3-0.7% reduction in HgA1C.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>Even more significantly, Eliasson <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated a 6.6% weight loss with 9 months topiramate treatment in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes. Specifically, reduction in HbA1c in this study was comparable with the current study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>The mechanisms underlying the effect of topiramate on lowering HbA1c and FBS of diabetic patients are not clear yet. Several studies have demonstrated whole-body insulin sensitivity following topiramate treatment although this would have been expected considering the over-all effect on glucose control. However, &#x0201c;a similar discrepancy between insulin-stimulated glucose uptake during a clamp and fasting glucose levels has also recently been shown in DM2 patients following 3% reduction in body weight&#x0201d;, shown in Eliasson <italic>et al</italic>. study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>The most common adverse responses to topiramate were paresthesia and amnesia: Side effects that were realized early on in the study. Most of the patients stated that these effects are not much a problem and tried to comply with the study. These results were unique and have not been seen in any studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>The main limitations of this study were its short duration and the small sample size due to the non-co-operation state of some subjects. We recommend more studies with narrower inclusion criteria and larger sample size with different conditions with a long duration of follow-up in Iran and other middle to low income counties.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Treatment of obese diabetic patients with 150 mg/day topiramate can be suitable for near 5% weight loss.
