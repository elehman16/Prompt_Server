As vitamin E is a potent antioxidant, with the ability to decrease the serum levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) in atopic patients, we aimed to evaluate the effect of oral vitamin E on treatment of AD.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comprised seventy participants with mild-to-moderate AD, based on the Hanifin and Rajka diagnostic criteria. The patients were randomly selected from teaching skin clinics in Isfahan, Iran. They were randomly assigned to two groups of equal number, receiving vitamin E (400 IU/day) and placebo for four 4 months. Each month, the extent, severity, and subjective symptoms including itch and sleeplessness were measured by SCORAD index. Three months after the end of intervention, the recurrence rate was assessed.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The improvement in all symptoms, except sleeplessness, was significantly higher in the group receiving vitamin E than in controls (&#x02013;1.5 vs. 0.218 in itching, &#x02013;10.85 vs. &#x02013;3.54 in extent of lesion, and &#x02013;11.12 vs. &#x02013;3.89 in SCORAD index, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Three months after the end of intervention, the recurrence rate of AD was evaluated. Recurrence rate between all 42 individuals, who remained in the study, was 18.6%. Recurrence ratio of the group receiving vitamin E compared to the placebo group was 1.17, without significant differences between the two groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>This study suggests that vitamin E can improve the symptoms and the quality of life in patients with AD. As vitamin E has no side effects with a dosage of 400 IU/day, it can be recommended for the treatment of AD.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Atopic dermatitis (AD)</kwd><kwd>SCORAD index</kwd><kwd>treatment</kwd><kwd>vitamin E</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD) remains to be studied but recently a possible change in the immune system with production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) is proposed.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] This disease is known with pruritus, eczematous lesions, dry skin, skin thickening, and prominent ridges of the skin. AD may be related to other diseases such as asthma, hay fever, and hives. The disease epidemic is growing and, 15-30% of the children in the developed countries and 10-20% of adults suffer from AD.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The prevalence of the disease is high in immigrant people from developed to developing countries.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] There are two hypotheses regarding the pathophysiology of this disease. In healthy people, there is a balance between T helper 1 and T helper 2. In patients with AD, the T helper 2, increases and the result is high levels of IgE and interferon-gamma, which are low.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The second hypothesis is the stratum corneum skin barrier dysfunction associated with AD. In this case, it makes the entry of antigen and the production of inflammatory cytokine.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>AD is often triggered by following stressful life events.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Compared with healthy controls, adults with AD are more anxious and depressed. Children with AD have more behavioral and psychological problems than the healthy children.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Living with AD has a profound effect on the quality of life for these children and their families. In turn, improper quality of life in these children is reported equally or more frequently compared to the people with asthma and diabetes.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Persistent itching and the absence from work in adults cause a large economic burden,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and due to their resistance to conventional therapies, AD patients face recurrence of clinical and social problems.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Most people are discouraged after trying various treatments, including antihistamines, steroids, and cyclosporine A. Vitamin E is known for its antioxidant properties and is found to have a protective effect on common health problems as heart disease, cataracts, cancer, and stroke. Recent studies have also shown that vitamin E can reduce the level of IgE antibodies in patients with AD.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Given that the treatment with vitamin E is safe and cost-effective, the aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of vitamin E on the treatment of AD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted as a double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) (trial registry code: IRCT201105016350N1). A total number of 70 known cases of AD were randomly selected from those patients were referred to the dermatology clinics of two teaching hospitals (Alzahra and Noor) affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran. The trial was approved by the Research and Ethics Committee, Skin and Leishmaniasis Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants.</p><p>Those cases were selected that were aged 10-50 years, and their disease was confirmed based on Hanifin and Rajka diagnostic criteria.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The patients who matched the following criteria were not recruited to the trial: Severe disease with a SCORAD score of more than 50, requiring hospitalization, pregnant women, nursing mothers, coagulopathies, using anticoagulant medications, systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressant, as well as having a history of allergy to vitamin E, and living in long distances from Isfahan city. Those patients who showed severe allergic symptoms to vitamin E and those who became pregnant during the therapy were excluded from this trial, and they received standard treatment.</p><p>All the patients received the usual treatment for AD, including Children Vaseline (Firooz Company, Iran), Glycerin Soap (Ejhe Company, Iran), hydroxyzine tablets (Daroopakhsh Company, Iran) and topical hydrocortisone cream 1% (Tehran Daroo Company, Iran). The selected 70 patients were assigned in two groups of equal number (simple randomization): One group received vitamin E 400 units (Nature Company) and the other group received placebo. The placebo had no active ingredient and was without smell; it was packed in the same package as vitamin E.</p><p>Clinical evaluation was conducted by the SCORAD index[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which is a combined index consisting of the observable objective criteria, the extent and severity of injuries, as well as subjective criteria as itching and loss of sleep.</p><p>The lesion extent was composed of six measures as follows: Redness (erythema) edema/papules (solid lesion, leading to less than 5 mm in size), rash symptoms (excoriation), prominent ridges and thickening of skin horny layer of epidermis lichenification), serous fluid secreted from the epidermis (oozing), or curd made (crusts), which were scored from 0 to 3. SCORAD index formula is defined as: A/5 + 7B/2 + C, in which: A is the lesion extent of the area and considered from 0 to 10, B is the intensity of the lesion and considered from 0 to 18, and C is the subjective symptoms counted from 0 to 20. The total score is 103.The extent of the lesion is ranked 0-100 and for assessment, in the area of measurement we draw the line and after that, the size of the involved surface area is calculated with the help of the Rule No. 9 and then the results are collected. For assessing the severity of the lesion, the surface that is the main cause and the reason of referring patients, is considered and to measure the subjective symptoms, a ruler scaled from 0 to 10 is used in order to determine the severity of the symptoms.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Types of eczema, are defined as follows:</p><p>

</p><p>Each month, the severity, extent of lesions, and the overall subjective appearance of the patients (insomnia and pruritus) were measured by using the SCORAD index, and recorded daily. Also every two weeks, the patients telephone were followed up to check out any unusual symptoms, side effects, worsening of symptoms, and how to use oral vitamin E, were performed and recorded. Three months after the treatment, rates of relapse (return of at least 50% of the eczematous lesions on the SCORAD index) was evaluated. During the treatment period, two people from the group receiving vitamin E and three from the placebo group quitted the trial because of personal reasons.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis was conducted by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 12 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) by using linear regression and chi-square tests.

The results of this study suggest efficacy of vitamin E supplementation and improvement of some clinical symptoms in patients with AD.</p><p>Topical corticosteroids are usually a main component of treatment protocol for acute phase of AD. The most common complications of these medications are burning, itching, and dryness, which are due to a steroid carrier molecule. Topical corticosteroids are associated with local and systemic side effects. Telangiectasia, purpura, stretch mark, and skin atrophy are some of their local complications. Atrophy may improve with discontinuation, but sometimes irreversible damage happens.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Other local side effects include rosacea, acne, folliculitis, and perioral dermatitis. Increased intraocular pressure, cataract, and glaucoma may result from long-term use of topical corticosteroids around the eyes. Topical corticosteroids may be systemically absorbed and systemic side effects including suppression of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis are major concerns.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Vitamin E is an essential nutrient with antioxidant activity. Human body cannot produce this vitamin and the skin levels of vitamin E depend on its oral or topical use.</p><p>Natural sources of vitamin E are vegetables, vegetable oils, and nuts. A nutritional survey conducted on 10,000 people in US showed that most women and men do not get the recommended amount of vitamin E.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Isomeric form of alpha-tocopherol that is naturally found in foods, also called natural alpha-tocopherol (<italic>RRR</italic>-alpha-tocopherol), is biologically active.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The most important action of alpha-tocopherol in the body is its antioxidant property.</p><p>Alpha-tocopherol prevents oxidative stress of free radicals on cell membrane. Furthermore, vitamin E is involved in activation of some molecules and enzymes in immune and inflammatory cells.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Vitamin E protects the macrophage membrane against oxidative damage and reduces production of prostaglandins through affecting the immune system.</p><p>Oxidative stress and altered antioxidant activity may be involved in acute exacerbations of AD in children.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Gueck <italic>et al</italic>. reported significant decrease of prostaglandins and histamine release from mast cells.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Noh <italic>et al</italic>. found that serum IgE levels could be a predictive factor for prognosis of dermatologic diseases and demonstrated that serum IgE levels has declined significantly in patients treated with gamma interferon.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Tsouri-Nikita <italic>et al</italic>. studied 96 patients with AD and found a significant association between vitamin E and serum IgE levels; moreover, the clinical symptoms improved after treatment with vitamin E.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Few side effects have been reported in adults taking &#x0003c;2,000 mg/day of alpha-tocopherol; however, long-term side effects have not been studied.
