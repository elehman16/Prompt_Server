Unfortunately, preventive treatment is often insufficient to substantially reduce migraine frequency or it is not well tolerated. Antiepileptic drugs are increasingly used in migraine prevention. However, data on efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin in patients with migraine are still lacking. Our aim was to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin in patients with migraine. We recruited 47 patients who started pregabalin at 75&#x000a0;mg/day, which was titrated to 300&#x000a0;mg/day as tolerated. A total of six patients (13%) reported one or more side effects during the intake of pregabalin; however, three of them discontinued pregabalin, because side effects were intolerable and persistent. Statistically significant reduction in migraine frequency compared to baseline (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) was evident after 1 and 3&#x000a0;months of treatment. A greater frequency reduction was observed in those patients who increased the dosage within the first month of therapy. Our data suggest that pregabalin may be well tolerated and may represent an alternative preventive treatment in migraneurs. Limitations of the present study were a small sample size and an uncontrolled, open-label design; further randomized case&#x02013;control studies are warranted to confirm our findings.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Migraine</kwd><kwd>Pregabalin</kwd><kwd>Prophylaxis therapy</kwd><kwd>Disability</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Migraine is a common neurological disorder that affects approximately 12% of adult population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Epidemiological studies have documented a high impact and the profound effect that the disorder can have on an individual&#x02019;s quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although migraine is a highly prevalent and disabling condition, it is underdiagnosed and undertreated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Recent advances have been made in the management of migraine, but pharmacologic treatment options are still far from optimum, leaving many patients without pain-free treatments or with unpleasant side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Nowadays, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are increasingly used in migraine treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; in general, these agents are considered both effective in reducing attack frequency and reasonably well tolerated, although few robust trials are available for AEDs other than divalproex sodium and topiramate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These are favored by Level 1 evidence and clinical experiences as first-line preventive drugs for migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Recently, other different AEDs such as pregabalin are emerging in the prophylaxis of migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Pregabalin is currently recommended for the treatment of partial seizures, pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia and spinal cord damage, as well as in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Pregabalin, through binding to the alpha2-delta subunits of hyperexcited, voltage-gated calcium channels, reduces the calcium influx at neurons terminals and subsequently reduces the synaptic release of several excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate, noradrenaline and substance P. Therefore, pregabalin restores the hyperexcited calcium channels to a normal state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Pregabalin mechanism of action is coherent with the available data concerning glutamatergic mechanism in migraine physiopathology.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of pregabalin in reducing migraine frequency; secondarily, we aimed to investigate the safety and the tolerability of pregabalin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Outpatients with a diagnosis of migraine according to International Headache Criteria (ICHD II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and regularly attending the Neurological Headache Centre of S.

The exclusion criteria included an age younger than 18&#x000a0;years, medical or neurological disorders capable of causing headache, pregnancy, breast-feeding, and rescue medications overuse. An informed consent was obtained from each participant.</p><p>Following a 6-month period of wash-out after the last assumption of preventive agents, each eligible patient started pregabalin on a 75&#x000a0;mg/day dosage, which was titrated up to a maximum of 300&#x000a0;mg/day with a 75&#x000a0;mg increase per week, as tolerated.</p><p>Patients were allowed to use acute pain medications during the evaluation period, including triptans, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and antiemetics, but not other preventive therapies. They were allowed to take only 15 acute pain medications per months to avoid medication overuse.</p><p>Clinical data and the frequency of migraine (measured as days with headache per month) were collected for a 3-month period before starting the therapy, and after 1 and 3&#x000a0;months of pregabalin treatment, by means of patient diaries or during the 1-month scheduled interviews. The occurrence of side effects or adverse events were also recorded at first and third month of pregabalin intake.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin, we performed an intention-to-treat analysis. All values are expressed as a mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;standard deviation (&#x000b1;SD), or interval, as appropriate. Statistical differences over time in days with headache per month were analyzed using the univariate analysis of the variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. Response rate in terms of proportion of patients with a 50% frequency reduction was also presented.</p><p>All <italic>p</italic> values less than 0.05 (two-sided) were considered as significant.

According to the ICHD-II criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], 21 patients (45%) had a diagnosis of migraine without aura and 26 patients (55%) had a chronic migraine (i.e., patients with &#x02265;15&#x000a0;days with headache per month) without overuse of symptomatic drugs. Seven (15%) patients (six chronic and one episodic migraneurs) had a psychiatric comorbidity according to DSM-IV criteria (three affected by depression, four affected by anxiety).</p><p>Only seven patients (15%) had never used prophylactic treatment, while forty (85%) tried at least one drug for migraine prophylaxis (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) before starting the pregabalin therapy.

These different dosages were achieved according to the pregabalin tolerability and the compliance of the patients.

Roughly, the one quarter of our study population had a response rate equal or more than 50% in terms of reduction of number of days with headache per month with respect to the baseline values.

In our sample the dose or titration of pregabalin did not seem to be related to the occurrence of side effects, which occurred in only six (13%) patients assuming &#x02264;150&#x000a0;mg/day. Calandre et al.

This explains the mean age range (20&#x02013;83&#x000a0;years) of the sample studied higher than that of trials about other preventive therapies.</p><p>Being an observational study, our findings suffer from some limitations, including an uncontrolled and open-label design and the small sample size. Moreover, there was no evaluation of indirect measures regarding the efficacy of pregabalin, such as quantification of headache severity, or the number of rescue medications intake during the follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite limitations due to a small sample size and an uncontrolled, open-label design, the present study suggests that pregabalin may represent an efficacious and safe anti-migraine agent in both episodic and chronic migraine patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None.</p><p><bold>Open Access</bold> This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits any use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lipton</surname><given-names>RB</given-names></name><name><surname>Scher</surname><given-names>AI</given-names></name><name><surname>Kolodner</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Migraine in the United States.
