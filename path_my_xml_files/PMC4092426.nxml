A significant reduction of the duration of ventilation by rhDNAse has been reported in children following cardiac surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To investigate whether rhDNAse is able to reduce the duration of ventilation in adult mechanically ventilated intensive care patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>After approval of the local ethics committees we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, multicentre national trial. Patients were stratified into two subgroups depending on their status as surgical or nonsurgical. The trial was started within 48 hours after the start of mechanical ventilation and lasted until weaning was successful. Patients in the active treatment group received 2.5 ml rhDNAse endotracheally twice a day. Patients in the placebo group received the same amount of normal saline. This interim analysis reviewed 98 nonsurgical patients. Data from 85 patients were included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Forty-four patients in the study group and 41 patients in the placebo group were analysed. Factors such as gender, weight, smoking habit, chronic pre-existing diseases and prevalence of COPD were distributed equally in both groups. Three patients died in the rhDNAse group versus eight in the placebo group. The median duration of ventilation was 140 hours (CI 120&#x02013;200 hours) in the rhDNAse and 324 hours (CI 178&#x02013;442 hours) in the placebo group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This interim analysis suggests that rhDNAse may have the potential to reduce the duration of ventilation in adult nonsurgical intensive care patients. This confirms results obtained in paediatric patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Data from surgical patients will be presented as soon as the interim analysis in that group is completed.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><name><surname>Fuchs</surname></name><etal/><source>N Engl J Med</source><year>1994</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>637</fpage><lpage>642</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1056/NEJM199409083311003</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7503821</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><name><surname>Riethmueller</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/><source>Pediatr Pulmonol</source><year>2005</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>61</fpage><lpage>66</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1002/ppul.20298</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
