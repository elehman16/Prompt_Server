Previous trials of the effect of wound dressings on the risk of developing a SSI are of poor quality and underpowered.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">This study is a feasibility and pilot trial to examine the feasibility of a full trial that will compare simple dressings, no dressing and tissue-glue as a dressing. It is examining the overall acceptability of trial participation, identifying opportunities for refinement, testing the feasibility of and validating new outcome tools to assess SSI, wound management issues and patients&#x02019; wound symptom experiences. It is also exploring methods for avoiding performance bias and blinding outcome assessors by testing the feasibility of collecting wound photographs taken in theatre immediately after wound closure and, at 4&#x02013;8 weeks after surgery, taken by participants themselves or their carers. Finally, it is identifying the main cost drivers for an economic evaluation of dressing types. Integrated qualitative research is exploring acceptability and reasons for non-adherence to allocation. Adults undergoing primary elective or unplanned abdominal general surgery or Caesarean section are eligible. The main exclusion criteria are abdominal or other major surgery less than three months before the index operation or contraindication to dressing allocation. The trial is scheduled to recruit for nine months. The findings will be used to inform the design of a main trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This pilot trial is the first pragmatic study to randomise participants to no dressing or tissue-glue as a dressing versus a simple dressing. Early evidence from the ongoing pilot shows that recruitment is proceeding well and that the interventions are acceptable to participants.

At the end of each procedure the skin edges of the wound are approximated using sutures or clips. Closing a surgical incision in this way creates what is called &#x02018;a closed primary wound&#x02019;. Following most surgery in adults, it is standard practice to cover closed primary wounds with a dressing. However, it is rare to apply dressings to closed primary wounds in children and in some specialist areas of adult surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There are many different types of dressing available. They range from simple (basic) to complex (advanced) dressings; the latter may have absorbent or low adherence properties and some may interact with the wound to improve healing. The costs of different dressings vary too, from a few pence for basic wound contact dressings to over &#x000a3;15 for advanced antimicrobial dressings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Evidence about the effects of wound dressings on surgical wound healing in both adult and paediatric practice has been systematically reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The review found no evidence to suggest that covering surgical wounds with dressings reduces the risk of a surgical site infection (SSI) or that one wound dressing is more effective than another in reducing scarring, controlling pain, promoting patient acceptability or ease of dressing removal. However, the review authors also found that the available evidence was of poor quality; most studies were small and judged to be at high risk of bias. They acknowledged the logistical challenge of conducting a sufficiently large randomised controlled trial (RCT) to detect a small target difference in the frequency of SSIs with adequate power; a small target difference is likely to be required because of the high cost of a SSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The authors suggested that choices between wound dressing strategies (between dressing versus no dressing as well as between different dressings) could be based instead on their effects on dressing costs and patient acceptability issues, such as managing exudate and symptoms.</p><p id="Par24">SSIs complicate up to 25% of surgical procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Many SSIs resolve with simple antibiotic treatment but the more serious SSIs cause morbidity and pain, discomfort and inconvenience for patients. SSIs are costly for health services; the average cost of a SSI has been estimated to be at least &#x000a3;4600 (lower 95% confidence limit) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. After some operations, a SSI can threaten the principal outcome of the operation, the future health of the patient and possibly even their life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, every effort is made before, during and after surgery to minimise the risk of developing a SSI.</p><p id="Par25">A key challenge in designing a RCT to evaluate the effect of an intervention on SSI is choosing a method to assess SSI that is feasible for a large RCT and satisfies a wide range of stakeholders likely to have an interest in the findings. Definitions of a SSI have been described in another review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], which concluded that SSI definitions varied between surveillance programmes and hospitals and lacked good agreement. The authors recommended that future research should focus on developing a SSI measure with satisfactory psychometric properties; the measure should be formulated with the objective of detecting SSIs that are important to patients and health services, include post-discharge surveillance, and be suitable for application in everyday settings.</p><p id="Par26">The Bluebelle study has been funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme with the aim of establishing whether it is possible to carry out a large RCT to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of wound dressing types or no dressing on participant outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

Patients aged 16&#x000a0;years or older undergoing primary elective or unplanned open or laparoscopic abdominal general surgery (including, but not limited to, gastrectomy for benign or malignant disease, cholecystectomy, anti-reflux procedures, hepatic resection, small or large bowel resection for benign or malignant conditions, abdominal wall hernia surgery [inguinal, femoral, incisional, epigastric and para-umbilical]) or elective or unplanned obstetric surgery (Caesarean section) are eligible. Patients undergoing simultaneous abdominal and chest surgery are eligible but only the abdominal wounds are allocated to one of the study interventions. At the time of recruitment, research nurses emphasise the need to attend a follow-up clinic 4&#x02013;8 weeks after surgery and do not recruit patients who are unable to do so.</p><p id="Par47">Patients meeting the above criteria but with any of the following characteristics are ineligible:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par48">abdominal or other major surgery less than three months before the index operation;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par49">the surgeon intends to &#x02018;close&#x02019; the wound with tissue adhesive (glue);</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par50">any contraindication to one of the dressing allocations including allergy to dressings;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par51">surgery where no skin incision occurs;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par52">lacking capacity to consent;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par53">inability to complete patient-reported outcome questionnaires;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par54">detained in the prison service.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par55">All reasons for ineligibility are being recorded in the trial screening log, allowing the trial results to be reported in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines.</p><p id="Par56">Eligible patients are provided with written information (invitation letter and participant information leaflet [PIL] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), reviewed by the REC) and given as long as possible to consider the study before being approached for participation (usually more than 4&#x000a0;h for elective surgery and usually more than 1&#x000a0;h for unplanned surgery). Those having elective surgery may also be given these documents at a clinic visit before the operation or be sent them in advance of admission. Research nurses or surgeons, who are responsible for approaching potential participants, do not request consent if a patient asks for longer thinking time and do not approach any patient who appears visibly distressed.</p><p id="Par57">Participants are also asked to consent to four optional aspects of the trial, designed to explore feasibility (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The first relates to an interview about the acceptability of, and adherence to, the allocated dressing type (objectives 3 and 4). The second allows a local member of the research team to take a photograph of the wound(s) in the operating theatre, immediately after wound closure (objective 2). The third relates to the participant&#x02019;s willingness to take a photograph of their wound(s) themselves 4&#x02013;8 weeks after the operation and to send it to the research team (described to participants as a &#x02018;wound selfie&#x02019;, a term which was readily understood; objective 7). The fourth covers consent for a skin transfer to be applied after the operation to remind staff that the participant is in the study.</p><p id="Par58">Surgery is carried out according to local protocols for the operation. Apposition of wound edges and the method of closure of the skin is at the discretion of the surgeon and may include sutures, clips, wound closure strips or combinations of these wound closure methods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomisation</title><p id="Par59">Participants are randomised to one of three dressing groups. Participants are also randomised to disclosure of the dressing group allocation to the surgeon before wound closure or after wound closure. These two randomisations create six groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Both randomisations are in blocks of varying size and stratified by hospital Trust and specialty (abdominal surgery/obstetric surgery). The sequences of random allocations were generated by computer in advance of starting to recruit. Local research team members access a participant&#x02019;s allocation via the Internet. The allocation is concealed until a participant&#x02019;s eligibility and consent have been documented and information to identify the participant uniquely has been entered.</p><p id="Par60">At the beginning of the operation, a member of the local research team (trainee or consultant surgeon/research midwife or nurse) logs on to the randomisation website (within the study database) using a secure password-protected computer system and enters the information needed to proceed to randomise the participant. Depending on the randomisation result, the dressing group allocation is disclosed immediately or the user is advised to log back into the website after the wound has been closed and enter the time of wound closure, after which the allocation is disclosed.</p><p id="Par61">The second randomisation, the disclosure of allocation before or after wound closure, relates to objective 2. During preliminary discussions about the trial, the trials unit proposed that randomisation should occur after wound closure, to prevent surgeons closing the wound in different ways depending on the allocation, but surgeons considered that this would be problematic. The second randomisation allows the trial to test the feasibility of randomising after wound closure to be tested. Moreover, if photographs of the closed wound can be obtained in the operating theatre and subsequently assessed for the quality of wound closure, the effect of timing of randomisation on wound closure can be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par62">It is not possible to blind surgeons, participants or staff caring for participants to the dressing allocation. However, we plan to blind research staff assessing outcomes 4&#x02013;8 weeks after randomisation and methods to achieve blinding are being piloted to test their feasibility and acceptability for the main trial. These include requiring the reference SSI assessment and the WHQ to be completed by healthcare professionals who have not been involved in a participant&#x02019;s care during the index admission. (The study also requires these assessments to be done by different people, in order to validate the WHQ.) The success of blinding among assessors of SSI 4&#x02013;8 weeks after randomisation (healthcare professionals completing the reference SSI assessment or the WHQ) is being assessed by asking them which study group they think that the participant is allocated to.</p><p id="Par63">If the occurrence of an SSI can be assessed from a photograph after a dressing has been removed, the assessment of the photograph could be blinded. For this reason, the trial is testing the feasibility of participants submitting wound selfies securely to the trial database.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Integrated qualitative research</title><p id="Par64">A qualitative study is integrated into the pilot study, to provide insights into the feasibility and potential design of a main trial. The study uses semi-structured interviews to explore participants&#x02019; experiences and the acceptability of participating in the trial, staff experiences of delivering trial processes/follow-up, and participant/staff perspectives on reasons for protocol deviations. All patients who agree to participate in the pilot RCT are also asked if they are willing for their contact details to be shared with the qualitative research team. Patients who provide written consent to be contacted form the sampling frame for the interviews. Potential interviewees are purposefully sampled from this frame, with the intention of including a range of individuals based on the following criteria:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par65">surgical specialty (upper GI, lower GI, or obstetric);</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par66">surgical approach (laparoscopic or open procedures);</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par67">nature of hospital admission (elective or unplanned);</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par68">Bluebelle study allocation (simple dressing, &#x02018;no dressing&#x02019; or &#x02018;glue-as-a-dressing&#x02019;).</p></list-item></list>

Interviews will be conducted face-to-face or via telephone by members of the qualitative research team (LR and CM).</p><p id="Par71">Interviews with participants explore the acceptability of trial interventions and trial processes, reasons for withdrawal (if appropriate) and sources of non-adherence (i.e. instigated by staff or participants themselves). Participants may be interviewed at two time points: soon after surgery (within a week); and around their 4&#x02013;8 week follow-up visit/assessment. A major finding from the qualitative research during Phase A was that clinical staff anticipated challenges in delivering the trial in practice. Therefore, interviews with healthcare professionals are exploring their experiences of implementing study protocols in practice and perceived reasons for non-adherence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Trial interventions</title><p id="Par72">Participants are randomised to one of three standard dressing groups: simple dressing (the comparator, believed to represent usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]), no dressing or glue-as-a-dressing.</p><p id="Par73">A simple dressing is defined as a covering (opaque or transparent) that is applied directly to an already closed wound, over the entirety of the wound, adherent around its entire perimeter or surface in contact with the skin. It may or may not have absorbent properties. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows examples of commonly available simple dressings.

</p><p id="Par74">Tissue adhesives are topical skin adhesives. In this trial, they are applied according to the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions and must be applied only to the surface of an already closed primary wound, acting as a dressing (not to close the wound, i.e. below skin level). A recent survey found that glue-as-a-dressing is a dressing strategy that is often used by general surgeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] but it is considered here as one of the two interventions, compared with a simple dressing (the comparator). Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> shows examples of commonly available tissue adhesives that can be used.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Examples of commonly used types of tissue adhesive</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Dermabond ProPen&#x000ae;</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Epiglu&#x000ae;</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Histoacryl&#x000ae;</td><td/></tr><tr><td>LiquiBand&#x000ae;</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
</p><p id="Par75">In the no dressing group, at the end of the operation when the skin has been closed, no simple dressing or tissue adhesive is applied to the wound.

For the former, a simple gauze swab can be applied to the area that is oozing; this is allowed in the no dressing group as well as the other groups. The swab should be taped in place temporarily and not around its entire perimeter. Examples of swabs that can be used are listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. If oozing continues, the clinical team may apply any dressing to the wound (or re-suture it if necessary); where this represents deviation from the allocated dressing, the action is documented in the case report forms (CRFs);<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Example of swabs that can be used to manage wound exudate</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Gauze swabs</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Filmated gauze swabs</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Non-woven fabric swabs</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Filmated non-woven fabric swabs</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Knitted viscose</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Paraffin gauze dressings</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

A member of theatre personnel, or research team, records: (1) the time taken to close the wound; (2) use of laparoscopic or open surgical methods; and (3) the method of wound closure. A member of theatre personnel or research team may also take one or more digital photographs of the wound(s). If randomised to disclosure of allocation after wound closure, the time of completing wound closure must be entered into the database to obtain the allocation. A range of methods are being used to promote adherence to the randomised dressing allocations in hospital, adapted to the circumstances of participating hospitals.

First, the participant needs to complete a copy of the EQ-5D-5L and the WHQ; these questionnaires can be given to participants at discharge from hospital or posted shortly before they fall due. Around this time, participants who have agreed to send a photograph may also be sent an email or text message including a web-link that allows them to upload a photograph securely. Then, a blinded health professional needs to complete the WHQ; this can be done face-to-face, typically at the same clinic attendance but before the reference SSI assessment, or administered by telephone. Finally, the face-to-face reference SSI assessment is completed by a blinded health professional, who must be different to the one completing the WHQ; this assessment includes eliciting information about potential wound-related complications. Whenever possible, the face-to-face clinic visit is arranged to coincide with a usual care clinic appointment. When this is not possible, travel expenses are offered to the participant.

The time constraints for the overall study (both Phase A and Phase B), combined with the time needed to obtain REC approval, made it inevitable that an amendment would be required after Phase A ended. This amendment included: changing the trial population to include patients having unplanned operations; substituting the intervention of a complex dressing with glue-as-a-dressing; and addition of the WMQ and WEQ as secondary outcomes.</p><p id="Par137">The need for a second amendment (v3 to v4, then to v5 to accommodate a change requested by the REC) arose from initial difficulties in recruiting patients having unplanned surgery and obtaining patient-reported follow-up questionnaires. This amendment (approved 6 September 2016) substituted a 4-h period between giving the PIL to a potential participant and requesting consent by the statement &#x02018;as long as possible&#x02019;, qualifying this as &#x02018;usually more than 4&#x000a0;hours for elective surgery and usually more than 1&#x000a0;hour for unplanned surgery&#x02019;. We justified this on the basis of feedback from trainee surgeons and research nurses that potential participants did not require &#x02018;thinking time&#x02019; in order to decide whether to take part. We also revised the protocol to allow the 4&#x02013;8-week WHQ to be administered over the telephone by a health professional, as well as face-to-face. We applied for the trial to be adopted by the Health Research Authority shortly after submitting the amendment, in order to obtain approval for another NHS Trust to recruit patients having abdominal surgery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par138">The short duration of the pilot trial, constrained by the length of the overall research contract, has been a challenge. The design of pilot trial depended on the findings of Phase A and the design was finalised shortly before starting to recruit. Despite this, final preparation and the two site initiation visits took place in just ten weeks, after notification that the first amendment had been approved. Development of the trial database was split into two releases, one to allow recruitment and randomisation, and the second for entry of data captured on paper CRFs.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Status of the pilot trial</title><p id="Par139">Recruitment is ongoing and is on target to achieve at the pre-specified sample size in the scheduled time. The interventions appear to be acceptable to potential participants and over 50% of those who have been approached to take part have given written consent. After some initial deviations, adherence has also been good; in particular, members of local research teams have reported that the skin transfers are an acceptable and effective way to promote adherence. Qualitative interviews have also indicated that the interventions are acceptable and that there have been few issues with adherence. Further details about the feasibility outcomes will be reported fully in due course.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec26"><p>
