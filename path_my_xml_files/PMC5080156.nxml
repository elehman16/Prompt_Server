sternocleidomastoid muscle and scalenus anterior muscle, which are agonists of neck and
breathing accessory muscles, by implementing breathing exercises. [Subjects and Methods]
Thirteen subjects were selected for the experimental group, which performed feedback
respiratory exercises with McKenzie exercises, and 12 subjects were selected for the
control group, which performed McKenzie exercises alone. The intervention program was
performed for 30 minutes a session, once a day, four times a week, and for 2 weeks before
conducting the experiment. Before intervention, muscle activity was measured using surface
electromyogram, and the neck disability index was evaluated. [Results] There were
meaningful differences in activities of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the scalenus
anterior muscle, craniovertebral angle, and neck disability index within both the
experimental group and control group after intervention. There also were meaningful
differences in sternocleidomastoid muscle and neck disability index changes between
groups. [Conclusion] Neck flexors as accessory respiratory muscle can affect inefficient
respiratory imbalance of forward head posture patients. Multimodal intervention method
should be studied continually and not be exposed to upper chest breathing patterns by
preventing such phenomenon.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Feedback respiratory exercise</kwd><kwd>Forward head posture</kwd><kwd>Neck disability index</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The number of people who use imaging equipment in a fixed posture for long hours is
increasing in modern society. The typical posture of such people is forward head posture
(FHP)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. FHP means that head is anterior
to an imaginary vertical line on a horizontal plane penetrating the body&#x02019;s center of
mass<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such posture is largely
associated with muscle length and changes in muscle strength as well as weakness of deep
cervical flexors, tightness of the suboccipital muscle, and abnormal sternocleidomastoid
(SCM) and scalene muscle function<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
cervical curve interacts with thoracic vertebrae and lumbar vertebrae. Increased kyphosis of
lumbar vertebrae correlates with FHP, and when lumbar vertebrae flex, extension of cervical
vertebrae increases<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. SCM and scalene neck
flexors play a role in neck posture function and also act as accessory inspiratory muscles.
During inspiratory respiration, they act on the chest wall to affect breathing movement,
causing cranial displacement<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, SCM
and scalene muscles are associated with functional neck movement and respiration. Because
respiration correlates with neck pain, preventing compensation is necessary to not cause
improper contraction and to exercise effectively<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Neck pain occurs when FHP decreases neck muscle strength, and FHP
also decreases respiratory muscle strength. Such correlation means motor control injury of
cervical part. If McKenzie exercises are conducted to recover function that was weakened by
neck postural changes, they will help relieve symptoms by correcting posture. Feedback
respiratory exercises can help inhibit use of accessory muscles by adding visual factors
that prevent compensation during breathing because FHP correlates with disability of
respiratory function. Therefore, this study aims to implement respiratory exercise in
patients suffering from FHP and to investigate the muscle activities of SCM and scalene
muscles, which are agonists of neck and breathing accessory muscles. This study also aimed
to suggest intervention methods to be used in the clinic by analyzing the neck disability
index (NDI).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study included 24 patients who visited a medical institution located in Jeollanamdo,

(Approval number: 2015-13). Study subjects understood the purpose of this study very well
and agreed to participate in this study voluntarily, and written informed consent was
obtained from each subject.</p><p>Thirteen subjects were selected to undergo feedback respiratory exercise as the
experimental group, and 12 subjects were selected to undergo McKenzie exercises as the
control group. The intervention program was conducted for 30 minutes a session, once a day,
four times a week, and for two weeks. The percent maximum voluntary isometric contraction
(%MVIC) was measured by surface electromyogram (sEMG), and neck disability index (NDI) was
measured using the NDI evaluation form prior to intervention. These measurements were
obtained again and analyzed two weeks later.</p><p>The Surface EMG MP100 system (Biopac, USA) was used to collect sEMG data to investigate SCM
and scalene activities. The sampling rate for sEMG signal collection was set to 1,000&#x02005;Hz,
and the frequency band pass filter was set to 20&#x02013;450&#x02005;Hz. Electrodes were attached to each
muscle, and before attaching electrodes, the skin of each subject was swabbed with
alcohol-soaked cotton to minimize resistance. Electrodes were attached at regular 2-cm
intervals. Electrodes were also attached to the midpoint between the mastoid process and
clavicle along the SCM muscle. The anterior scalene electrode was attached parallel to the
direction of the muscle fiber of the anterior upper trapezius away from the SCM muscle<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. To normalize the signal for muscle
contraction, the root mean square (RMS) was collected while subjects lifted their heads
maximally and maintained the position for 5 seconds. While resistance was applied to the
head in a sitting position for 5 seconds, the RMS of maximum voluntary isometric contraction
was collected. The %MVIC was assessed using these results. The RMS for seconds 2&#x02013;4 was used
for all RMS signals. All measurements were repeated three times, and the average values were
calculated. Subjects rested after every measurement.</p><p>The craniovertebral angle (CVA) is the angle formed by the line connecting the seventh
cervical vertebra and tragus and a horizontal line. Subjects with FHP have a smaller CVA and
show increased flexion of lower cervical vertebrae<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The neck disability index (NDI) was assessed via a questionnaire. Subjects answered one of
six questions related to 10 items, including pain intensity, daily life, lifting, reading,
headache, concentration level, work, driving, sleep, and leisure life, that were scored 0&#x02013;5
points. Higher scores indicate larger functional disability related to neck abnormality<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Feedback respiratory exercises were performed using SPIROTIGER<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Idiag AG,
Switzerland). Subjects sat down with stretched bodies and held a mouthpiece in their mouth.
When the therapist pressed the start button of the coupling device, subjects inhaled when
the orange gradation faced the &#x0201c;in&#x0201d; side, and they exhaled when it faced the &#x0201c;out&#x0201d; side.
Feedback respiratory exercises were performed for 30 minutes and were composed of warming up
and main exercises. Warming up was performed for 2 minutes by breathing 26&#x02013;27 times a minute
and then resting for 2 minutes. The main exercise consisted of 7 total sets of 29&#x02013;30 breaths
per minute for two minutes. After performing 1 set, subjects rested for 2 minutes<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>McKenzie exercises consist of seven exercise motions performed for 10 seconds at static
maximum muscle strength and repeated 15&#x02013;20 times. Enough explanation and demonstration were
given for subjects to perform the exact exercises, and they were supervised by a
researcher<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study used SPSS 18.0 to analyze data, and the Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test the
normality of general subject characteristics. Paired t-tests were used to analyze changes
within groups, and the covariance was set using examination before performing the experiment
to control for examination values when comparing changes between groups. An ANCOVA was
performed using examination values between groups after performing the experiment. The
significance level was set as p=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were significant differences in SCM muscle and scalenus muscle activities, CVA, and

because excessive SCM activation compensates for this weakness<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Terret et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported excessive SCM activation in their study, and Koh and
Jung<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> investigated %MVIC of SCM and
scalene muscles in FHP and neutral position in their study. Both muscles showed higher
muscle activities when subjects were in FHP than when they were in the neutral position.
Such long-term activation can elicit poor respiratory habits by facilitating the action of
accessory respiratory muscles. Borisut et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that SCM, anterior scalene, and erector spine muscle
activities increased in all groups except for the control group as a consequence of
mediating extensional movement and endurance exercise for 12 weeks for 25 patients with
chronic neck pain. They showed that conducting neck exercises is useful to improve the
activities of muscles around the neck. Jang<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that running while performing breathing exercises is
effective in improving function for patients with FHP. This study suggested that SCM and
anterior scalene activities increased in both groups when comparing the changes within
groups. However, feedback respiratory exercises more effectively induced activity changes in
the SCM when comparing changes between 1groups. Excessive tension and contraction of neck
muscles happens by compensation for patients with FHP. This leads to decreased frequency of
contraction and relaxation of muscles as muscle activities due to stiffness of neck flexors
increase. However, inhibition of compensation is effective if a proper load is applied
during inhalation and exhalation using feedback respiratory exercises. It is more effective
to prevent stiffness by activating SCM contraction and relaxation. FHP causes twisting of
the alignment from the head to the trunk by increasing kyphosis of the thoracic vertebrae as
well as the neck bone. Neck posture alignment to maintain balance of the neck muscles is
important to prevent musculoskeletal disorders<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Jung<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> analyzed
CVA by mediating McKenzie exercises 4 days a week for 4 weeks in patients with chronic neck
pain, and CVA increased in those patients. Kim et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> mediated sling exercises for 4 weeks for patients with FHP to
reveal a meaningful difference in CVA, and there was a correlation with neck muscle
activity. This study supported the results of the previous research within groups, but there
was no significant result between groups. Cho<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that CVA increased meaningfully when applying orthotherapy
along with accessory muscle breathing exercises in 18 patients with FHP. Kang<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> mediated flexion exercises for deep neck
flexor muscles using feedback equipment for 10 minutes a day, three times a week, for 6
weeks. As a result, the range of motion and CVA increased. This was inconsistent with the
results of this research. This could be because advanced research targeted selective
respiratory accessory muscles, and the period of mediation was longer than that of this
study by over 6 weeks. Gong<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that CVA positively correlates with NDI as a consequence of performing correlation analysis
between CVA, the range of motion of deep neck flexors, and NDI using data from 24 normal
people. Iqbal<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> showed improvement of NDI
after mediating neck flexion exercises using biofeedback equipment for 4 weeks for 30
teachers complaining of neck pain. This study showed that NDI was more effective in the
experimental group. Katayama et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that proper breathing can release the body by stimulating activity of the
sympathetic nervous system, and Kim et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that neck pain and NDI improved after mediating active
release techniques for 3 weeks for 24 patients with chronic neck pain. based on these
studies, when breathing exercises are mediated, they are effective in releasing the body.
Exercises are thought to effectively improve the NDI, which is a subjective functional
scale. This study suggests that is more efficient in SCM activity, neck flexor, and NDI by
mediating feedback respiratory exercise than those in control group. Such results can affect
inefficient breathing imbalances of patients with FHP, as neck flexors are accessory
respiratory muscles. Active intervention methods should be studied continually in order to
not affect upper chest breathing patterns by preventing such phenomenon in future.</p><p>This study limited subjects to patients with FHP within one medical institution. Therefore,
the ability to generalize about all patients with FHP is limited, and other variables may
exist due to the difficulty of controlling drugs and daily life habits.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by the Sehan University Research Fund in 2016.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>RY</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The effect of the forward head posture on postural balance
