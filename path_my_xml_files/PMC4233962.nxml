The current brief report investigates the effect of UTI on health and costs and whether the preventive use of cranberry capsules in LTCFs is cost-effective.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This economic evaluation was part of a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled multicenter trial.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Residents from LTCFs (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;928, median age 84, 703 female) were randomized to receive cranberry or placebo capsules twice daily for 12&#x000a0;months. The cranberry capsules contained 500&#x000a0;mg of the product with 1.8% proanthocyanidins (9&#x000a0;mg). Participants were stratified according to UTI risk (including long-term catheterization, diabetes mellitus, &#x02265;1 UTIs in the preceding year). Main outcomes of the trial were incidence of UTI according to a clinical definition (following clinical practice guidelines for residents in LTCFs) and a strict definition (with confirmation by a positive dipslide or culture).<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><sec><title>Cost-Effectiveness and Cost-Utility Analysis</title><p>The economic evaluation consisted of a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) from a narrow perspective and a cost-utility analysis (CUA) from a lifelong societal perspective for high- and for low-UTI-risk participants.</p><p>The CEA from a narrow perspective was based directly on the trial data during follow-up, to prevent modeling assumptions. Effectiveness was measured according to the number of clinically defined and strictly defined UTIs (first and recurrent). Costs included only cranberry use.</p><p>The CUA was performed from a lifelong societal perspective. Costs, survival and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated using a non-Markovian state-transition model, with parameters estimated from the trial data. In this model, the cranberry and placebo groups differed in their clinically defined UTI infection rate but not in the consequences per UTI. Thus, it was implicitly assumed that prevented UTIs are comparable with nonprevented UTIs and that cranberry use has no relevant effects other than cranberry costs and UTI prevention. These modeling assumptions were made beforehand because it was clear that the study would have insufficient power for a direct randomized economic comparison.</p><p>In the CUA model (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>), participant time was categorized into five model states: during the initial 2&#x000a0;months and before the first UTI, after the initial 2&#x000a0;months and before the first UTI, during the first month after the first UTI, after the first month after the first UTI, and death.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The state-transition model used in the economic evaluation.

Infection rates in the cranberry and placebo groups were different after the first 2&#x000a0;months and before the first UTI (State 2). No effect of cranberry use was seen in the initial 2&#x000a0;months (State 1) or after the first UTI (States 3 and 4). Occurrence of a first UTI was associated with greater mortality during the subsequent month (State 3) and after the subsequent month (State 4). Annual mortality was estimated in a combined Poisson regression analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Utilities</title><p>Utilities represent the valuation of the quality of life of the participants on a scale anchored at 1 (perfect health) and 0 (as bad as being dead). Utility was measured using the EQ-5D classification system, which is a brief questionnaire with five domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression), each with three levels (no, some, or extreme problems).<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Utility values were assigned to the EQ-5D using the Dutch tariff.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Valuations were also obtained using a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 100 (perfect health) to 0 (worst imaginable health), which was transformed to a utility scale using a power transformation.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> EQ-5D and VAS measurements were obtained from the participants (11%) or from well-informed nurses or caregivers (89%).</p><p>Utility before and after the first UTI (parameters <italic>U</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>U</italic><sub>2</sub>) was estimated from EQ-5D and VAS measurements obtained at baseline and after 6 and 12&#x000a0;months (correcting for time). In addition, UTIs were assumed to have a short-term effect on utility for 2&#x000a0;weeks. Additional EQ-5D and VAS measurements were obtained in 123 participants with a clinically defined UTI (from 17 different LTCFs) every 3&#x000a0;days over 3&#x000a0;weeks after the UTI to estimate this effect. The utility decrement during the UTI was estimated as the difference between the average over the first 2&#x000a0;weeks and the average over the third week (parameter &#x00394;<italic>U,</italic> attributed to State 3 with parameter <italic>U</italic><sub>1</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;<italic>U</italic><sub>2</sub>&#x02212;&#x00394;<italic>U</italic>&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;14/30).</p></sec><sec><title>Costs</title><p>The economic model included two types of costs. The first was the costs of cranberry use (parameter <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub>). These costs were estimated at &#x020ac;439 annually (&#x020ac;0.62 per intake) based on one capsule twice a day, a market price of &#x020ac;44 for 180 capsules, on average 45&#x000a0;seconds of nursing time per capsule (estimated using time registrations), nursing time valued at &#x020ac;30 per hour,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and 97% adherence (1.00 euro&#x000a0;= 1.37 U.S. dollar).</p><p>The second type of costs were the costs associated with each UTI (parameter <italic>c</italic><sub>2</sub>, Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>), including costs of UTI diagnostics and antibiotic treatment, additional care by the elderly-care physician, additional nursing care, and hospitalizations. Costs of UTI diagnostics and antibiotic treatment per UTI were calculated from actual costs in patient records for each UTI (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;548). Additional care by the elderly-care physician was estimated at on average &#x020ac;25 per UTI (10&#x02013;30&#x000a0;minutes of time, valued at &#x020ac;111 per hour<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Additional nursing costs during the 2&#x000a0;weeks after a UTI were estimated in proportion to the Care Dependency Scale,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> which measures 15 items of basic care needs, each rated on a 5-point scale (1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;completely dependent; 5&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;completely independent). Hospitalizations costs were recorded for six UTIs (1% of n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;548), all in high-UTI-risk participants. Costs per hospitalization ranged from &#x020ac;3,000 (for 6&#x000a0;days of normal hospital care) to &#x020ac;15,000 (for 7&#x000a0;days of normal care and 5&#x000a0;days of intensive care).<xref

In high-UTI-risk participants, there were fewer clinically defined UTIs. Moreover, there was a significant, but moderate, short-term effect of those UTIs on quality of life and care dependency. Most of the QALY gain was due to the prevented UTI mortality, resulting in a gain in life expectancy of approximately 2&#x000a0;weeks. This relative 1.5% improvement in life expectancy is consistent with the estimated mortality attributable to UTI (7.7%) combined with the 26% treatment effect.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Savings on prevented UTIs partly compensate for the costs of the cranberry capsules, but using a lifelong perspective, those savings added up to approximately &#x020ac;50. As a result, the overall cost difference is about equal to the costs of the cranberry capsules, estimated at &#x020ac;439 per year or at &#x020ac;3,800 per prevented clinically defined UTI. The health gain in terms of QALYs was small in comparison with the costs, so use of cranberry capsules was not likely to be cost-effective (22% for a WTP threshold of &#x020ac;40,000 per QALY).</p><sec><title>Options to Improve Cost-Effectiveness</title><p>Cranberry use does not constitute a low-cost strategy to prevent UTIs.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The estimated price for the capsules was lower than the price estimated previously (&#x020ac;0.24 vs CAN$0.73 &#x02248; &#x020ac;0.61),<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> but the overall costs per capsule were somewhat similar because of the added nursing time in the current study. The previous study estimated the costs per prevented UTI at CAN$1,890, which was acknowledged as quite high.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> That study suggested that cranberry use could be cost-effective if the strength or size of the cranberry product could be reduced without reducing effectiveness. In the current study, a preventive effect was seen with the cranberry capsules after 2&#x000a0;months. It is unknown whether lowering the frequency after those 2&#x000a0;months would change not only the costs, but also the effect.</p><p>Second, the cost-effectiveness of cranberry use would also be more favorable in settings in which the savings per prevented UTI were higher. In the current study, these savings would need to be eight times as high to make cranberry and placebo equally cost-effective. This seems unrealistic for the Dutch LTCF setting, although in other healthcare systems, residents with UTIs may more frequently be referred to a hospital than the 1% in the current study population. Similarly, in noninstitutionalized vulnerable older persons, the savings associated with prevented UTIs may be higher because of the need for additional formal and informal care during and after a UTI.</p><p>Third, the high-UTI-risk criteria included diabetes mellitus, long-term catheterization, and UTI in the preceding year. Better identification of older persons at high UTI risk may also improve cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>There are several complicating factors in analyzing cost-effectiveness in vulnerable older persons in LTCFs. The first is how to value the residents&#x02019; health. According to the EQ-5D, health during the 2-week life expectancy gain was valued at approximately 40%, whereas according to the VAS, this gain would be valued at approximately 70%. In accordance with the study protocol, the EQ-5D was considered to be more appropriate than the VAS because the EQ-5D provides a societal valuation and because the descriptions it requires are less subjective than the valuations that the VAS requires.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Consistent with the high percentage of participants with dementia (76%) and the high percentage of participants for whom family provided informed consent (84%),<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> nurses mostly provided the utility measures (89%), and little is known about the validity of proxy VAS valuations in a LTCF context. Considering the often poor health of LTCF residents, the VAS valuations appear high.</p><p>Another factor is the high costs of standard LTCF care, amounting to approximately &#x020ac;80,000 annually in the Netherlands.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Including these high costs in the analysis would make any life-prolonging treatment too expensive, even if the treatment itself was cost free. In the analysis, the 2-week life expectancy gain would add approximately &#x020ac;1,500 to the costs associated with cranberry use, confirming the conclusion that use of cranberry capsules is not likely to be cost-effective. Dutch guidelines for economic evaluations in health care recommend including costs associated with additional life time only if they are related to the primary intervention, which was not the case in the current analysis.</p><p>Third, it was decided beforehand that the economic state/transition model would be based on the clinical definition, because it was expected that it would be more predictive of outcome. Had the strict UTI definition been used for the model, the estimated effectiveness and cost-effectiveness would have been less favorable to the use of cranberry capsules, confirming the conclusion that use of cranberry capsules is not likely to be cost-effective.</p><p>Finally, this study was performed in Dutch LTCFs, where elderly-care physicians provide medical care.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The results are not automatically generalizable to vulnerable older persons living at home. In LTCFs, medication prescription and distribution are well organized. Because the study capsules were added to the existing drug-dispensing system, participants rarely missed taking a capsule, reflected in a high adherence rate. For other settings, not only differences in vulnerability and infection rates are expected, but also in adherence. Moreover, at home, cranberry capsules can be taken without the help of nurses, which would halve the costs of cranberry use.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In high-UTI-risk residents, taking cranberry capsules may be effective in preventing UTIs but is not likely to be cost-effective in the investigated dosage, frequency, and setting.
