The efficacy and safety of lifitegrast ophthalmic solution 5.0%, when administered twice daily for 84 days in participants with DED, have been demonstrated in 3 randomized controlled studies. These are 1 phase 2 study<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and 2 phase 3 studies (OPUS-1<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and OPUS-2<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In OPUS-1, the coprimary sign endpoint of change from baseline to day 84 in inferior corneal staining score was significantly improved in patients with DED treated with lifitegrast compared with placebo. However, the coprimary symptom endpoint of change from baseline to day 84 on the visual-related function subscale was not met.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The results of the OPUS-2 study were recently published; they showed that in lifitegrast-treated patients with DED with a recent history of artificial tear use and at least moderate baseline symptomology (eye dryness score &#x02265;40), there was a significant improvement in the coprimary symptom endpoint of eye dryness score compared with placebo. The coprimary sign endpoint of inferior corneal staining score was not met in OPUS-2.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In the phase 2 study, and in OPUS-1 and OPUS-2, lifitegrast was generally well tolerated, and no serious ocular adverse events (AEs) were reported.</p><p>Lifitegrast is designed to target the inflammation associated with DED by blocking the binding of the integrin, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), to its cognate ligand, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). Inflammation at the cellular level of the lacrimal gland and ocular surface plays a major role in DED and is associated with symptoms of eye dryness and discomfort.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> T-cell activation is critical in the inflammatory process and is influenced by LFA-1/ICAM-1 binding.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The interaction of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 is important in T-cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and cytokine release at sites of inflammation.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Infiltration of T-cells in the conjunctiva<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and increased expression of ICAM-1 in lacrimal and conjunctival epithelial cells<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> have been demonstrated in patients with DED. Taken together, this evidence suggests that LFA-1/ICAM-1 binding is a logical pharmacological target in the treatment of DED. Lifitegrast has been shown in vitro to block the interaction between ICAM-1 and LFA-1, inhibiting T-cell activation and recruitment and reducing inflammation.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>The objective of the SONATA (Safety Of a 5.0% coNcentrATion of lifitegrAst ophthalmic solution) study was to examine the longer term safety profile of lifitegrast.

Individuals with secondary Sj&#x000f6;gren syndrome were eligible to participate if they were not immunodeficient/immunosuppressed, were not taking systemic steroids, and met all other inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p><p>The following individuals were excluded from participation in the study: women who were pregnant or nursing an infant, those with contraindications or hypersensitivity to the investigational product, previous treatment with lifitegrast, use of any topical medication or antibiotics for the treatment of blepharitis or meibomian gland disease, ocular herpes or any other ocular infection within the last 30 days, blood donation or significant loss of blood within the last 56 days, ocular conditions or chronic illness that could affect study parameters, a disorder causing immunodeficiency, history of laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis or similar surgery within the last 12 months, history of neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet laser posterior capsulotomy within the last 6 months, known history of alcohol/drug abuse that might interfere with study participation, and those with DED secondary to scarring or destruction of conjunctival goblet cells. Prohibited medications during the study were topical ophthalmic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, topical ophthalmic cyclosporine, and systemic steroids.</p><p>After day 14 (visit 3), the use of the following was allowed: artificial tears (&#x02264;4 times daily, as needed), contact lenses (daily disposable lenses only), topical ophthalmic/nasal antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, and steroids (only loteprednol etabonate for &#x02264;4 weeks at a time); information on their use was collected beginning at day 90 (visit 4).</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Study Design</title><p>The investigational product was supplied as a sterile liquid solution containing lifitegrast at a concentration of 5.0% with &#x0223c;0.2 mL in each dose vial. During the treatment period (days 0&#x02013;360; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), participants received twice-daily doses (in the morning and the evening just before bedtime) of either lifitegrast ophthalmic solution 5.0% or the vehicle as a placebo administered to the ocular surface as a single eye drop in both eyes. Compliance with treatment was assessed by reconciliation of used and unused investigational product vials collected from participants.

AEs were considered treatment emergent if they occurred after the first dose of the investigational product; definition of AEs included intercurrent illnesses or injuries that represented an exacerbation (increase in frequency, severity, or specificity) of preexisting conditions, for example, the worsening of dry eye. TEAEs were assessed by the investigator for severity (mild, moderate, severe) and relatedness (not related, possibly related, probably related) to the investigational product. The secondary study objective was to evaluate ocular safety measures (including corneal fluorescein staining, drop comfort, BCVA, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and intraocular pressure) over 7 visits in 360 days.</p><p>Investigator verbatim terms were coded using the Preferred Terms of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (version 14.1). For example, the verbatim terms of decreased visual acuity, worsening visual acuity, decreased vision, logMAR change &#x02265;22 from visit 2, decreased vision (lost glasses), and decreased visual acuity of 30 letters from baseline were coded to visual acuity reduced. A number of verbatim terms involving ocular burning upon instillation of study drug were coded to the Preferred Term of instillation site irritation. Blurred/blurry vision, ocular discharge, or ocular pressure sensation upon instillation were coded to instillation site reaction. Verbatim terms for dysgeusia (change in taste) included but were not limited to taste perversion or bitter or metallic taste in the mouth.</p><p>Exploratory objectives included the number and percentage of participants with TEAEs after using lifitegrast in conjunction with other topical eye drops, including artificial tears, steroids, mast cell stabilizers, and/or antihistamines, and after using lifitegrast in conjunction with contact lenses. Additional exploratory objectives included plasma lifitegrast concentration and whole-blood lymphocyte (CD3, CD4, and CD8) counts, which were collected from participants (n = 75) at selected study sites for each measure, and were obtained before administration of the investigational product at days 0 [visit 2 (baseline for lifitegrast levels and lymphocyte counts)], 180 (visit 5), and 360 (visit 7). Also in this category were clinical laboratory values (hematologic, renal, and liver panels) at days &#x02212;7 [visit 1 (baseline for safety clinical laboratory tests)], 180 (visit 5), and 360 (visit 7). Participants were discontinued from the study if they requested to be withdrawn or at the discretion of the investigator and/or sponsor in accordance with their clinical judgment.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Randomization and Masking</title><p>An interactive web response system was used to randomly assign participants to receive lifitegrast or placebo based on a 2:1 ratio (lifitegrast:placebo).

Because this was a safety study, it was not powered for hypothesis testing to compare outcomes between the lifitegrast and placebo groups; statistical analyses were descriptive in nature. The study sample size was not based on statistical calculations or statistical assumptions, but on guidance provided by the US Food and Drug Administration and is consistent with the International Conference on Harmonisation guidance on exposure for drugs intended for long-term treatment of nonlife-threatening conditions (International Conference on Harmonisation 1995). The method for assaying plasma samples for lifitegrast was linear over the range of 0.500 to 100 ng/mL, with a lower limit of quantification of 0.500 ng/mL. Samples below the lower limit of quantification were treated as 0 in the calculation of summary statistics.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>The study was conducted between October 2012 and March 2014.

In SONATA, no serious ocular TEAEs were reported, and the rate of discontinuations because of &#x02265;1 TEAE was low in participants receiving lifitegrast (12.3%), albeit slightly higher than among those receiving placebo (9.0%). Approximately one-half of the participants who received lifitegrast reported &#x02265;1 ocular TEAE across the 1-year study period; however, most TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. Findings for the ocular safety measures of corneal fluorescein staining, drop comfort, BCVA, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and intraocular pressure were comparable between the lifitegrast and placebo groups.</p><p>The safety profile observed in SONATA was consistent with that reported previously in shorter term studies of lifitegrast (84 days).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The most common ocular TEAEs attributed to lifitegrast were instillation site irritation, instillation site reaction, and visual acuity reduced, occurring in 15.0%, 13.2%, and 11.4% of participants, respectively. Importantly, discontinuation because of burning (coded under instillation site irritation) occurred in only 2 participants receiving lifitegrast, or 0.9% of the lifitegrast treatment group. Ocular TEAEs for lifitegrast seemed to be transient given that the most common ocular TEAEs were related to administration of the drug and that drop comfort improved within 3 minutes of instillation.</p><p>As with SONATA, the most commonly reported ocular TEAEs in earlier studies were administration site symptoms (instillation site irritation, pain, and reaction) and visual acuity reduced, and the most common nonocular TEAE was dysgeusia (change in taste).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> No new safety signals were identified in this 1-year study.</p><p>Visual acuity reduction was reported by participants in both lifitegrast and placebo groups. Visual acuity changes have been reported previously in studies of topical ophthalmic agents, including over-the-counter artificial tears.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The tear film constitutes a critical component of the refractive properties along the visual axis,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and instillation of eye drops may cause transient disturbances of the tear film, which may account for some of the visual acuity reduction in this study, although it should be noted that a slightly higher proportion of participants experienced visual acuity reduction in the lifitegrast group compared with the placebo group (11.4% vs. 6.3%, respectively).</p><p>The most commonly reported nonocular TEAE was dysgeusia (change in taste), which occurred in 16.4% of participants in the lifitegrast group and 1.8% of the placebo group. Clinically, this is a relatively common AE associated with instillation of some topical ophthalmic medications, because of normal tear drainage through the nasolacrimal duct into the nose and then into the oropharynx. The event is usually self-limited and short in duration. In the present study, discontinuations because of dysgeusia (change in taste) occurred in 4 participants receiving lifitegrast, or 1.8% of the lifitegrast treatment group. Fifteen participants (6 placebo, 9 lifitegrast) experienced serious nonocular TEAEs, which was consistent with medical complications in an older population.</p><p>There was no evidence of accumulation of lifitegrast in plasma over the course of the study, with most concentrations below the limit of detection on days 180 and 360. The very low plasma levels of lifitegrast in this study suggest that systemic side effects would not be expected after topical ophthalmic administration of lifitegrast. Indeed, there was no evidence of systemic toxicity or localized infectious complications secondary to chronic immunosuppression.</p><p>Artificial tear substitutes augment the tear film and are commonly used as a first-line therapy for DED. In the United States alone, artificial tears are used by &#x0223c;7 to 10 million people.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In this study, although TEAEs were more frequent in participants using artificial tears (in both treatment groups) than those who did not, concomitant use of artificial tears with lifitegrast did not result in a higher frequency of discontinuations because of TEAEs. Interestingly, a lower proportion of participants receiving lifitegrast used artificial tears compared with those receiving placebo, suggesting that the perceived need for artificial tears was lower in the lifitegrast group.</p><p>A limitation of this study was that patients with at least moderate baseline symptomology were enrolled, as inclusion criteria included corneal fluorescein staining score of &#x02265;2, eye dryness score &#x02265;40, and use and/or desire to use artificial tears in the past 6 months. Therefore, milder cases of DED would not have been studied. In addition, patients with a history of corneal surgery, such as laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis, within the past year also were excluded from this study, so the safety of lifitegrast in this group was not evaluated.</p><p>In conclusion, the use of twice-daily lifitegrast ophthalmic solution 5.0% for 360 days seemed safe and well tolerated, with no unexpected TEAEs, and a safety profile that was similar to previous 12-week studies. The incidence of drug discontinuation was low, with 0.9% of participants withdrawing because of instillation site irritation (burning). In addition, there was no evidence of systemic toxicity or localized infectious complications secondary to chronic immunosuppression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="cornea-35-741-s001.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e510" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="cornea-35-741-s002.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e511" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>E.
