LA provides patients safety and analgesia, control intraoperative and postoperative pain, and decrease demand of intravenous sedation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Preemptive analgesia is defined as a treatment that is initiated before surgery to prevent the establishment of central sensitization evoked by the incisional and inflammatory injuries occurring during surgery and in the early postoperative period.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] As a consequence, preemptive analgesia can reduce immediate postoperative pain and also prevent the development of chronic pain by decreasing the altered central sensory processing.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Local anesthetic adjuncts such as opioid, tramadol, clonidine, and neostigmine have been studded previously in an attempt to prolong the duration of analgesia after peripheral nerve block with varying degree of success.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] A preliminary human studies investigating the analgesic efficacy of dexamethasone added to local anesthetic agent has been encouraging.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] We hypothesized that the addition of dexamethasone 8 mg to ropivacaine would prolong the duration of analgesia and decrease postoperative nausea and vomiting after ankle block in patients undergoing foot surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>P<sc>ATIENTS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This study was performed at university hospitals from June 2015 to December 2015 after approval from the local Institutional Ethical Committee and obtaining written informed consent form the patients. Forty patients American Society of Anesthesiologists physical Status I and II undergoing elective foot surgery were involved in this study. The exclusion criteria were uncontrolled diabetes, liver and renal diseases, peptic ulcer, circulatory instability, hemostatic disorders, infection or edema at the site of block, and hypersensitivity to local anesthetics. Patients were randomly divided using the closed envelope technique into two groups, twenty patients each. Group assignment was performed by a nurse who did not share in the study. Observation and follow-up of the groups were performed by blinded specialists. Group I (ropivacaine group) received local injection of 20 ml of ropivacaine 0.75% (18 ml) and 2 ml normal saline, and Group II (dexamethasone group) received local injection of 18 ml of ropivacaine 0.75% plus 2 ml of 8 mg dexamethasone. On arrival to the operating room, an intravenous line was inserted, intravenous Ringer solution was infused, and routine patients&#x02019; monitors were attached in the form of pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, and noninvasive blood pressure. Because a great number of our patients refused any awake needle injection, all patients received the same technique of general anesthesia. Laryngeal mask airway was inserted under the deep plane of anesthesia without the use of muscle relaxant and the patients were left to breathe spontaneously. Anesthesia was maintained using inhalational anesthetic and increments of fentanyl 50 &#x003bc;g to keep stable hemodynamics and optimum depth of anesthesia. The entire foot was cleaned with disinfectant, and block of the two deep nerves was started first because subcutaneous injection of superficial nerves deforms the anatomy. The block was done as following:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Deep peroneal nerve block: A finger was positioned in the groove just lateral to extensor hallucis longus, the needle was inserted under the skin and advanced until stopped by bone, at this point, the needle was withdrawn back 1&#x02013;2 cm and 3&#x02013;4 ml of solution were injected</p></list-item><list-item><p>The posterior tibial nerve was anesthetized by injection just behind the medial malleolus. The needle was inserted in the groove behind the medial malleolus and advanced until contacted the bone, then withdrawn 1&#x02013;2 cm and 3&#x02013;4 ml of solution were injected</p></list-item><list-item><p>The three superficial nerves (superficial peroneal, sural, and saphenous nerves) were blocked using simple circumferential injection of solution subcutaneously. The three nerves are cutaneous extensions of the sciatic and femoral nerves. Because they are positioned superficially to the deep fascia, an injection of local anesthetic in the territory through which they descend to the distal foot is adequate to achieve their blockade. To block the saphenous nerve, a 1.5 inch, 25-gauge needle was inserted at the level of medial malleolus and a &#x0201c;ring&#x0201d; of local anesthetic is raised from the point of needle entry to the Achilles tendon and anteriorly to the tibial ridge.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This was performed with one or two needles insertion; 4 ml of local anesthetic suffices. To block the superficial peroneal nerve, the needle was inserted at the tibial ridge and extended toward the lateral malleolus. Four milliliter of local anesthetic were injected subcutaneously. To block the sural nerve, the needle was inserted at the level of the lateral malleolus, and the local anesthetic was injected toward the Achilles tendon. Four milliliter of local anesthetic was deposited in a circular fashion to raise a skin &#x0201c;wheal.&#x0201d;</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Evaluation of the nerve block under anesthesia depends on eliciting the motor response to electric nerve stimulation, and this was present here in stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve and the deep peroneal nerves which have sensory and motor fibers. The tibial nerve is located posterior to the posterior tibial artery at the level of the medial malleolus. The artery was palpated, and the needle was inserted posterior to the artery. The deep peroneal nerve runs lateral to the dorsalis pedis artery at the level of the foot, the needle was inserted lateral to the artery and nerve stimulation was performed with an electric current of 0.5 mA of 2 Hz frequency and 100 ms pulse width. The absence of all motor responses to electric nerve stimulation indicated success of the block.</p><p>Surgery was started in 30 min after the block.</p><p>After recovery from anesthesia and shift to the recovery room, patient-controlled analgesia was started when the patient was fully awake; it was in the form of 1 mg morphine delivered in response to the patient request with a lockout time of 15 min without background morphine infusion. No other reuse analgesics were given. The following were measured by an observer who was blinded to the group of patients and material used:</p><p>

The duration of pain relief and pain intensity was markedly prolonged in dexamethasone group. These results were similar and in agreement with Shrestha and coworkers,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] who reported that addition of dexamethasone for brachial plexus block prolongs the duration of analgesia without any unwanted effects. Another study done by Vieira <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] showed that the addition of dexamethasone to bupivacaine increased the duration of analgesia, but there was no evaluation for intensity of pain and analgesic dose after surgery.</p><p>The mechanism of action of corticosteroid in prolonging peripheral nerve blockade is not completely understood. There are several theories to explain this effect, among those theory is upregulation of K<sup>+</sup> channels in excitable cell and local action on nociceptor C-fiber mediated by glucocorticoid receptor.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Another theory refers to anti-inflammatory action of dexamethasone and blocking transmission on nociceptive fiber.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In contrast to our study and to the previous studies that showed beneficial effect of dexamethasone in prolongation of postoperative analgesia when added to local anesthetic, Parrington <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in a study done to evaluate adding dexamethasone to mepivacaine in supraclavicular brachial plexus block, they were unable to demonstrate augmentation or prolongation of postoperative analgesia, this difference may be attributed to difference in the study methodology, type of local anesthetic, and volume of local anesthetic. For the purpose of our study, we did not use epinephrine because of its intermediate duration of action, which would likely mask any pharmacodynamics effect of adjunctive dexamethasone.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The present study showed that the addition of dexamethasone to ropivacaine reduced overall pain scores and analgesic requirement in postoperative period without any serious adverse effects. Adverse effects with a single dose of dexamethasone are rare and minor in nature and the previous studies have demonstrated that short-term use of dexamethasone is safe.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Dexamethasone is also known to reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting, and its antiemetic is due to anti-inflammatory property of dexamethasone which are in agreement with our study. In this study, a nonsignificant incidence of side effects was observed in the two studied groups.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Limitation</title><p>The limitation of this study may be the nonuse of
