Various combinations of steroid and antibacterial agents as combination product are available in the market. Halometasone, fusidic acid, and betamethasone are frequently used by dermatologists in the management of eczema.</p></boxed-text><p>Eczema is a pruritic, papulovesicular skin condition, categorized to acute phase which is associated with erythema and oedema, and chronic phase in which lichenification and scaling are the main features.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] It reflects morphological changes in the skin occurring due to a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors, inducing immunological and biochemical changes, resulting in pruritic, inflammatory lesions. With damaged protective skin function and disturbance of quantity and quality of skin lipids, patients with eczema may develop secondary bacterial infections.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] In 90% of patients, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is the infecting organism.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Changes in the environment are one of the leading causes resulting in an increase in the incidence of eczema in developing countries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] In developed countries, 15 to 20% of the population is affected by eczema.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Religious,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] environmental factors, variation in structure and function of skin in different geographical regions, and personal hygiene can affect the clinical presentation and also determine the chance of secondary infection. Due to the increasing emergence of methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic>, treatment of secondary infection of eczema is challenging.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Data on the disease impact of eczema on Indian population and health reforms are not available. Chougule and Thappa[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] have reported the frequency of eczema in lower leg and foot as 2.5 per 1000 out patients and infected eczema in 5% patients in their study population. Early recognition and treatment is crucial to prevent further complications. Topical corticosteroids, topical and systemic immunosuppressants, emollients, and antihistamines are used frequently in the management of eczema.</p><p>Halometasone 0.05% is a well-tolerated synthetic tri-halogenated corticosteroid with pronounced anti-inflammatory, anti-exudative, anti-epidermoplastic actions along with anti-allergic, and anti-pruritic properties which has been utilized in the management of various clinical conditions. It is often used in the symptomatic treatment of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. It is well tolerated and its good safety profile[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] allows long-term use.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Treatment with halometasone and antibacterial agent (triclosan) was found to be superior with higher success and cure rate along with good safety profile; an early cure (in less than 20 days) compared to other steroid and antibiotic combination.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Safety, efficacy, and tolerability of Halometasone in Indian patients with acute and chronic eczema have been documented.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>Fusidic acid is a potent antibacterial agent, either bacteriostatic or bactericidal depending on the size of inoculum and inhibits nearly all strains of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Topical application of fusidic acid was safe and effective in bacterial skin infections.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Resistance to fusidic acid is low and short lived. Fusidic acid has been successfully used along with other corticosteroids (betamethasone 1% and hydrocortisone 1%) wherein the antibacterial effect of fusidic acid was not being affected even in the presence of steroids.
