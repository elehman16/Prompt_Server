Each year, 7 million people are diagnosed with the disease, and every 10s, a person dies from diabetes-related causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Diabetes is a chronic disease requiring lifelong medical and nursing intervention and lifestyle adjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The National Survey of Risk Factors for Non-Communicable of Iran, which was conducted in 2005, demonstrated that the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in Iranian citizens aged 25&#x02013;64 years was 7.7% (2 million individuals) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], among whom half are undiagnosed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. An additional 16.8%, or 4.4 million, of Iranian adults have impaired fasting glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. If current trends continue, based on the World Health Organization forecast for Iran, there will be 5.2 million Iranians with diabetes mellitus in 2025[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].This high prevalence of diabetes in working aged adults is an ominous sign for this developing nation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. As the relatively young Iranian population ages in the future, and urbanization continues or accelerates, the prevalence of diabetes will likely escalate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial showed that for every 1% reduction in the HbA1c levels, there was a 40% to 50% reduction in risk for microvascular and neuropathic complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has recommended that all persons with diabetes should attempt to achieve near normalization of blood glucose levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Algorithms for diabetes care exist but may be complex and difficult for physicians to follow, given the patient load, diversity of patient seen, lack of information systems, and time constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, economic and technical barriers to providing diabetes care in the community health system are recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Since control of diabetes has been shown to decrease mortality and prevent long-term complications, it is critical that healthcare systems develop innovative ways to improve diabetes management, and provide timely care to patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Several research studies have shown that various telemedicine approaches can have a positive impact on patient blood glucose control and that over the long term; these approaches can result in reduction or elimination of the complication related to diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Telemedicine has, in particular, caught the attention of patients and caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. For patients, it has the advantage of providing a quick, efficient way to communicate with their providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Especially, for those patients living in rural areas, it is potentially invaluable to have access to their caregiver from the comfort of their homes, thus sparing them the time and cost of traveling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Although the magnitude of the impact of telemedical support on diabetes care remains debatable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Telemedicine cannot replace patient visit and direct interaction with providers, but it can supplement between-visit care and improve &#x02018;quality of care&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Patient suffering from chronic diseases in general and diabetes in particular, have benefited from support systems and telephone education with improved clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], a telephone care program has been shown to be a viable strategy for bringing diabetes management services into patients&#x02019; homes, improving their glycemic control and provide timely care to patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. To maintain normal range of blood glucose and prevent diabetic complications, patients ought to contact more frequently with their health care providers, but this will in turn increase health care expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. And the telephone intervention was more time- consuming than an Internet-based blood glucose monitoring system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Recently mobile phones as a new delivery system can provide medical recommendations and prescriptions at the appropriate time and to accommodate for patients&#x02019; behavioral changes and to normalize of blood glucose levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Mobile phones are an integral part of everyday life, although mobile phone technology is a relatively new and innovative methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This method is becoming an important way of encouraging better nurse-patient communication and will undoubtedly increase in application over coming years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Because of widespread usage and ubiquitous availability of mobile phones these devices may be can maximize the efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] Using short message service enables users to send and receive text messages to and from mobile phones up to 160 characters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. SMS allows rapid reception and reply at low cost. It is an interactive service, and is simple, fast and confidential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Although it has been used for patient reminders, psychological support, medical appointments, to report critical medical events or laboratory results and even for surveys in other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], but no research has been done to test the direct effects of Short Message Service on controlling (HbA1c) in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and in healthcare delivery in Iran as far as we are aware.</p><p>The present study evaluated and compared whether an intervention using the short message service (SMS) of cellular phone by a nurse and nurse-led telephone follow up could improve HbA1c levels in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>This study is quasi experimental research. Participants were recruited from the Iranian Diabetes Association. We studied this intervention during a three month period starting in May 2008. Diabetes was diagnosed according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria. The age range was 18&#x02013;65 years. Patients had to have telephone access in their homes and have their own personal mobile phone, or have access to one belonging to a relative. Although selection criteria required that participants should be diabetic patients that only use Oral anti-diabetic medications, should be able to read and write, have power vision sufficient, no problem in hearing and vocalization and no history of psychiatric diseases. Patients were excluded if they had a clinical history of an important illness such as renal insufficiency with a creatinine level &#x0003e;1.5 mg/dl, hepatic insufficiency, were mentally ill or had less than 7% of HbA1c.</p><p>Seventy nine patients met the above criteria and agreed to participate. They were randomized by random permuted block design using a random number table and assigned to one of two groups: SMS group (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;39) or Telephone group (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;40). Only 77 subjects completed the entire study, 38 SMS and 39 Telephone. Two subjects were lost before completing the post-test in the Telephone group: one decided to opt out of the programme before completing the post-test and one expired during intervention. One subject was lost before completing the post-test in the SMS group because the change of therapeutic regimen from oral anti-diabetic agents to insulin.</p><p>Ethics committee approval was required. For ethical considerations, the research protocol was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Written consent was obtained from those patients who agreed to participate in the study. Anonymity and confidentiality were guaranteed to participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The goal of the intervention was to maintain blood glucose levels within a normal range. Participants attended in three days diabetes self-care education in Iranian Diabetes Association. Before the intervention, each patient was instructed, for 10 minutes by researcher, about how to use their own cell phones and to check their ability to read Short Messages and match the time for telephone follow-up. The researcher provided the intervention for 12 weeks. Patients in the SMS group received about 4 messages weekly consisted of diet, exercise, diabetic medication taking and frequent self-monitoring blood glucose levels. Participants in SMS group could receive our messages at any place where access was possible by cellular phone. The researcher sent optimal recommendations back to each patient, 4 times by short message service of cellular phone weekly. For example, recommendations included: &#x02018;Do you know, the best bread for you is pebble bread&#x02019;; &#x02018;Please eat vegetables and salad in every meal&#x02019;; &#x02018;Please for prevention of high glycemic fluctuations&#x02019;, eat your meals in six times instead of three times&#x02019;; &#x02018;Please consume your drugs on prescribed times&#x02019; ; &#x02018;Do you know, eating in regular times, helps you to control your diabetes better&#x02019;; &#x02018;Lack of exercise may be the cause of the aggravated glucose level&#x02019;; &#x02018;Try to exercise 3 times daily and at least 15 minutes every time&#x02019;; &#x02018;Do at least 30 minutes of physical exercise or walking&#x02019;; &#x02018;Please check the amount that you eat&#x02019;; &#x02018;Take your recommended diabetic medication&#x02019;; &#x02018;If you consume Glybenclamide, please eat it, 30 minutes before your meal&#x02019; and so on. The 12 weeks of intervention consisted of continuous education and reinforcement of diet, exercise, medication taking, as well as frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose levels.</p><p>The intervention for Telephone group was provided via telephone for 12 weeks. The 12 weeks of intervention consisted of counseling on the nature of the disease, risk factors, importance of maintaining blood glucose levels within a near-normal range, continuous education and reinforcement of diet, exercise, medications taking, hypoglycemia management, illness management how to record daily blood glucose and frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose levels. The researcher contacted the telephone group at least twice a week for the first month and then weekly for the second and third month. The total frequency of telephone counseling averaged 16 times per subject. The duration of each counseling session was an average of 20 minutes. The researcher was asking questions such as: &#x0201c;did you take your recommended diabetic medication?&#x0201d; &#x0201c;When did you consume your prescribed tablet?&#x0201d; Do you know how you&#x02019;re consuming medications, act in your body? &#x0201c;How many times did you do physical exercise or walking during last days?&#x0201d; &#x0201c;When is the best time to do exercise?&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Did you feel better after doing exercise?&#x0201d; Do you know that doing exercise is as important as diabetic medication?&#x0201c; How many days did you follow your recommended diet over the past days?&#x0201d; Did you eat salad and vegetable before every meal?&#x0201d; Before initiation of recommendation, researcher asked every patient about problems they were facing during last days and patients could ask their questions and could solve their problems. Sometimes they feel stress, so the researcher educate some ways of decreasing stress such as: deep breathing, distraction methods, taking a bath, go to the country, concentrate to good points of their life, be more with their family members or closed or lovely friends, try to laugh more and so on.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Before the intervention, demographic characteristics and HbA1c value were collected as pre-test data at the Iranian Diabetes Society. The intervention was provided to the telephone group with counseling appointments scheduled when convenient to the subject. The HbA1c was measured again three months later. Patients&#x02019; blood was drawn in veins for HbA1c measurement. HbA1c was measured in the metabolism and endocrinology laboratory of the Tehran University-affiliated medical center. HbA1c was determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography technique. HbA1c level was measured after 12 weeks as posttest data.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>The data were analyzed using the SPSS (Version 11.5) program. Chi square test, Paired t-test, independent t-test and Fisher&#x02019;s exact test were used to test for the homogeneity of demographic and clinical characteristics between the SMS and Telephone groups. The paired t test was used for comparison of differences between pretest and posttest values in the group. The unpaired t test was used for comparing the differences between the SMS and Telephone groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The characteristics of the SMS and Telephone groups are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

Patients with diabetes wanted more frequent contact with their health care providers for managing the disease. By using telemedicine management systems such as short message service via cellular phones and telephone follow-up, patients can contact their nurses frequently. The patients in the Telephone group have more frequent contact with the nurse than those in the short message service of cellular phone group. In addition, the patients in the Telephone group received advice according their most recent data, confirming their current state. These factors may have stimulated and motivated the patients to control glucose levels enthusiastically.</p><p>These results have important clinical implications because the service for diabetic patients provided via mobile phone is now increasing, whereas the efficacy of the short message service for glucose control has not been evaluated extensively. Also, this study results show evidence that short message services are as effective as telephone calls guidance in managing diabetes. One major advantage of short message service is that the researcher could send short messages without location limitations. An intervention that involves the use of SMS and personal cellular phone can also be applicable to other chronic diseases such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.</p><p>This study adds that a nurse educational intervention programme using the telephone calls and an SMS by cellular phone improved levels of glycosylated haemoglobin levels for three months in patients with type2 diabetes. The SMS by cellular phone can be used as a means of providing education for patients with diabetes.</p><p>The trial demonstrated the usability of the system. The effectiveness of the system relied on regular contact. The contact frequency provided an indication of the level of acceptance and the extent to which use of the system had become a habit. Therefore, nurse&#x02019;s education using SMS of cellular phone not only allowed for the patients to maintain steady levels of HbA1c, but also improved the degree of their HbA1c control as well. These results confirm that the use of various telemedicine approaches by the nurse have a positive impact on patient&#x02019;s HbA1c control.</p><p>Although this study demonstrated that an SMS of cellular phone intervention by a nurse could maintain and reduce .HbA1c during a short-term study period of 12 weeks, the long-term effectiveness remains to be determined.</p><p>In this study, Iranian patients with type 2 diabetes who received short massages and followed by telephone had improved HbA1c levels. This study suggests both telephone follow-up intervention and using SMS of personal cellular phone improved HbA1c levels remarkably during three months in type 2 diabetic patients. Regard to convenience of SMS can be used as an appropriate alternative method for following up in diabetic patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MZ had substantial contributions to conception and design of the study, analysis of the data and drafting the manuscript.
