The Environmental Exposure Unit (EEU) is a validated model of experimental SAR. The objective of this double-blind, four-way crossover study was to evaluate the onset of action of azelastine nasal spray, versus the oral antihistamines loratadine 10&#x000a0;mg and cetirizine 10&#x000a0;mg in the relief of the symptoms of SAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>70 participants, aged 18-65, were randomized to receive azelastine nasal spray, cetirizine, loratadine, or placebo after controlled ragweed pollen exposure in the EEU. Symptoms were evaluated using the total nasal symptom score (TNSS). The primary efficacy parameter was the onset of action as measured by the change from baseline in TNSS.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Azelastine displayed a statistically significant improvement in TNSS compared with placebo at all time points from 15&#x000a0;minutes through 6&#x000a0;hours post dose. Azelastine, cetirizine, and loratadine reduced TNSS compared to placebo with an onset of action of 15 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), 60 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.015), and 75 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.034) minutes, respectively. The overall assessment of efficacy was rated as good or very good by 46% of the participants for azelastine, 51% of the participants for cetirizine, and 30% of the participants for loratadine compared to 18% of the participants for placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Azelastine&#x02019;s onset of action for symptom relief was faster than that of cetirizine and loratadine. The overall participant satisfaction in treatment with azelastine is comparable to cetirizine and statistically superior to loratadine. These results suggest that azelastine may be preferential to oral antihistamines for the rapid relief of SAR symptoms.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Allergic rhinitis</kwd><kwd>Azelastine</kwd><kwd>Environmental exposure unit</kwd><kwd>Onset of action</kwd><kwd>Cetirizine</kwd><kwd>Loratadine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) is an inflammatory disease characterized by multiple symptoms including sneezing, rhinnorhea, nasal congestion, nasal and nasopharyngeal itching, and has associated ocular symptoms such as itchy, watery and red/burning eyes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Oral antihistamines are often the first line treatment administered for SAR
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, as SAR symptoms result from an interaction between inhaled allergens and IgE antibodies on mast cells located in the upper airway
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], it may be possible to achieve faster symptom relief through direct local delivery of a medication to the nasal tissues.</p><p>Azelastine is a second generation H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamine
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] that is currently marketed as a topically applied agent (i.e. nasal spray). Numerous studies have demonstrated its ability to provide significant improvement in the symptoms of SAR compared to placebo
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Azelastine is believed to exert its effects through alteration of the activities of mast cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils and inhibition of the synthesis or expression of leukotrienes, kinins, cytokines, and chemokines
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The regional and chronological fluctuations associated with the natural exposure to aeroallergens give rise to considerable inter-study variations when assessing the efficacy and onset of action of various drugs to treat SAR; therefore, this study was conducted in the highly controlled environment of the Environmental Exposure Unit (EEU). The EEU is a well-validated and internationally recognized controlled allergen challenge facility located in Kingston, ON Canada
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The EEU allows for large groups of clinical trial participants to be simultaneously exposed to controlled levels of airborne allergens such as ragweed or grass pollen. Within this specially designed room, allergen levels can be precisely maintained at predetermined levels and environmental variables such as air quality, temperature, humidity and CO<sub>2</sub> levels are tightly regulated
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. With the ability to control these variables, study conditions can be reproduced on different days at any time of the year with the same or different study participants, something that cannot be achieved with any other research model for allergic rhinitis. Utilizing this model thus yields more precise results for direct comparisons of different treatment modalities
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Over the past decade, the EEU has gained international acceptance for the clinical research conducted in Kingston with over 20 publications in top research journals (recent references indicated)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Azelastine hydrochloride has been marketed as a prescription product in the United States since 1996 under the trade name Astelin&#x000ae;. A new dosing regimen of 1 spray per nostril twice daily was approved in 2006 for the treatment of SAR
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and thus was administered in this study.</p><p>The objective of the current evaluation was to determine the onset of action of azelastine nasal spray, compared to established oral antihistamines (loratadine 10&#x000a0;mg and cetirizine 10&#x000a0;mg tablets), for the relief of symptoms of SAR. This study further allowed for the comparison of topical versus oral application of medication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study participants</title><p>Participants were healthy male and female volunteers between the ages of 18 and 65 with a history of SAR to ragweed for the preceding two consecutive pollen seasons. Atopic status was confirmed with a positive response to a skin prick test to ragweed allergen at screening or within 12&#x000a0;months of the screening visit (defined as a wheal diameter greater than or equal to 3&#x000a0;mm larger than the diluent control).</p><p>Enrolled female participants of childbearing potential used a medically acceptable form of birth control for at least 1&#x000a0;month prior to screening. Those who were not sexually active consented to use a double-barrier method should they become sexually active during the study. Females who were pregnant, lactating or had the intention of becoming pregnant were not enrolled.</p><p>Participants with a history of hypersensitivity to azelastine, loratadine, or cetirizine or were known to be nonresponsive to antihistamines were excluded. Participants with relevant concomitant disease (chronic sinusitis) or nasal structural abnormalities causing greater than 50% obstruction were also excluded. Furthermore, participants who suffered from an acute illness that could have interfered with the conduct of the study within 7&#x000a0;days of any pollen exposure visit were excluded. Also excluded were participants with asthma who required more than occasional use (&#x0003c;3 times per week) of inhaled short-acting &#x003b2;-2 agonists and any participants who took restricted medications within the proscribed time period prior to their first priming visit (See Table&#x000a0;

This rapid onset of action is consistent with previous environmental exposure facility trials
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], which also demonstrated an azelastine onset of action for TNSS of 15&#x000a0;minutes.</p><p>Azelastine demonstrated greater symptom score reduction than cetirizine during the immediate period post-dose and better efficacy than loratadine for the majority of the period post-dose (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This suggests that azelastine may be preferential to oral antihistamines for the rapid relief of SAR symptoms. In vitro studies using rat IgE-producing hybridoma FE-3 cells have shown azelastine to have an inhibitory effect on IgE secretion
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. While this has not been shown with human cells nor in vivo, it is possible that azelastine may confer rapid relief through inhibition of allergen-antibody interactions associated with SAR symptoms in the upper airway. Furthermore, the topical application of azelastine may allow for more rapid absorption in comparison to the orally taken cetirizine and loratadine, thereby accounting for its faster onset of action.</p><p>Azelastine&#x02019;s onset of action for the relief of the individual components of TNSS (sneezing, itchy nose, and runny nose) was also faster than the onset of action for cetirizine and loratadine. Azelastine achieved durable significant improvement at 15&#x000a0;minutes for sneezing and itchy nose and at 30&#x000a0;minutes for runny nose. Cetirizine and loratadine did not achieve a durable significant response for all components until at least 60&#x000a0;minutes and 75&#x000a0;minutes post-dose, respectively. Overall, azelastine was able to decrease the TNSS component scores more quickly, and was able to maintain the decreased score at a level comparable to or better than cetirizine and loratadine over the ensuing 6&#x000a0;hours post-dose (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). It should be noted that the oral medications were as or almost as effective over the last 2&#x000a0;hours of the allergen challenge in treating TNSS. There were no statistically significant differences between the average TNSS change from baseline over the last two hours for all three medications. Thus, azelastine provided comparable relief of TNSS symptoms during the later period post-dose.</p><p>Azelastine showed a faster onset of action for the relief of stuffy nose and teary eyes than cetirizine and loratadine. Faster relief of stuffy nose is significant as nasal congestion has been reported as the most bothersome rhinitis symptom by more than half of 3206 patients surveyed with histories of rhinitis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Azelastine and cetirizine both showed an onset of action of 15&#x000a0;minutes for the relief of itchy eyes, which was faster than the onset of action for loratadine. For the overall participant satisfaction in treatment, azelastine was comparable to cetirizine and statistically superior to loratadine (Table&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>).</p><p>No safety concerns were identified in this study, with all active preparations being safe and well tolerated.</p><p>The effectiveness and onset of action of cetirizine 10&#x000a0;mg and loratadine 10&#x000a0;mg compared to placebo has previously been studied
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], with results that are consistent with the findings of this trial. Both studies found the onset of action for multi-component symptom scores to be approximately 1&#x000a0;hour for cetirizine and approximately 3&#x000a0;hours for loratadine. This is consistent with the current results as cetirizine&#x02019;s onset of action occurred at approximately 1&#x000a0;hour for most symptoms evaluated. Loratadine&#x02019;s onset of action occurred more quickly in this trial than in these previous trials; however, its onset of action was consistently longer than cetirizine and azelastine, not occurring until at least 75&#x000a0;minutes for all symptoms. One point to consider as well is that the double-dummy nature of these types of studies may lead to enhanced efficacy in the antihistamine arms due to the known therapeutic benefits derived from nasal saline (placebo) application that would be delivered to the oral antihistamine treated participants.</p><p>Other trials have examined azelastine (2 sprays per nostril) in comparison to cetirizine 10&#x000a0;mg for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. These studies examined TNSS scores over the course of 14&#x000a0;days and therefore onset of action was not the main objective. Azelastine showed greater improvements in TNSS symptoms than cetirizine over the 14&#x000a0;days in both studies. A more appreciable difference in total TNSS may have been observed in this study had the maximum TNSS score been greater than 9.</p><p>Azelastine (2 sprays per nostril) has also been studied for its efficacy in conjunction with loratadine 10&#x000a0;mg
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The combination of azelastine and loratadine was compared to azelastine alone and desloratadine 5&#x000a0;mg. This study found azelastine to be an effective alternative for those with poor response to loratadine. However, the individual efficacies of azelastine and loratadine were not compared in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first trial directly comparing the onset of action of azelastine, cetirizine, and loratadine for the treatment of SAR. The unique operational characteristics of the EEU facilitated this head-to-head comparison. This study supports the rapid onset of action of azelastine nasal spray to relieve SAR symptoms; more quickly than oral antihistamines. The faster onset combined with comparable levels of symptom relief suggest that azelastine could be used as a replacement for oral antihistamines in the management of SAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ITT: Intent to treat; PP: Per protocol; SAR: Seasonal allergic rhinitis; TNSS: Total nasal symptom score</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Dr Ellis has received speaking honoraria from Pfizer, Merck and Sanofi, has served on an Advisory Board for Sanofi, and has received research grants from Circassia Ltd, Adiga Life Sciences, and GlaxoSmithKline in the last 12 months.
