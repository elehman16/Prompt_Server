The difficulties involved in mesh placement and in mesh-related complications could be the reason many small abdominal hernias are still primary closed. In laparoscopic repair, a mesh is placed intraperitoneally, while the most common procedure is open surgery is pre-peritoneal mesh placement. A recently developed alternative method is the so-called patch repair, in this approach a mesh can be placed intraperitoneally through open surgery. In theory, such patches are particularly suitable for small hernias due to a reduction in the required dissection. This simple procedure is described in several studies. It is still unclear whether this new approach is associated with an equal risk of recurrence and complications compared with pre-peritoneal meshes. The material of the patch is in direct contact with intra-abdominal organs, it is unknown if this leads to more complications. On the other hand, the smaller dissection in the pre-peritoneal plane may lead to a reduction in wound complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>346 patients suffering from an umbilical or epigastric hernia will be included in a multi-centre patient-blinded trial, comparing mesh repair with patch repair. Randomisation will take place for the two operation techniques. The two devices investigated are a flat pre-peritoneal mesh and a Proceed Ventral Patch&#x000ae;. Stratification will occur per centre. Post-operative evaluation will take place after 1, 3, 12 and 24&#x000a0;months. The number of complications requiring treatment is the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints are Verbal Descriptor Scale (VDS) pain score and VDS cosmetic score, operation duration, recurrence and costs. An intention to treat analysis will be performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial is one of the first in its kind, to compare different mesh devices in a randomized controlled setting. The results will help to evaluate mesh repair for epigastric an umbilical hernia, and find a surgical method that minimizes the complication rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Netherlands Trail Registration (NTR) www.trialregister.nl 2010 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=2514">NTR2514</ext-link> NL33995.060.10</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Umbilical</kwd><kwd>Epigastric</kwd><kwd>Hernia</kwd><kwd>Herniorraphy</kwd><kwd>Mesh repair</kwd><kwd>Proceed Ventral Patch</kwd><kwd>Complications</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>Recurrence</kwd><kwd>Costs</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The evidence that umbilical and epigastric hernias must be repaired using a mesh, in analogy with other hernias, is accumulating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The use of a mesh in large hernias reduces the risk of recurrence from approximately 15-40% to 1-10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, less research has been performed if this also applies for small hernias. To date, most small hernias are still closed with primary sutures, because of the sometimes-difficult pre-peritoneal plane in which the mesh should be placed. Therefore, the results of the Hernia Umbilicalis Mesh versus Primair suture (HUMP) trial that focuses on hernias smaller than 2 centimetres will have great added value for umbilical hernias in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Other retrospective studies suggest that for the reoperation rate due to recurrence mesh is superior in umbilical and epigastric hernias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In contrast to the HUMP trial, which places the mesh in this pre-peritoneal plane, a mesh can also be placed intraperitoneally. Advantages of intraperitoneal mesh placement can be shorter operation time. Intraperitoneal mesh placement can also be done by a laparoscopic approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Although in the laparoscopic mesh placement, several new fascia openings in the abdominal wall are created. The search for alternative techniques without these additional fascia defects may have played an important role in the development of these so-called patches. Patches are small devices, which can be inserted by open surgery and placed underneath the peritoneum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In theory, such patches are particularly suitable for small hernias because of the lesser dissection necessary. It is still unclear whether this simpler procedure is also associated with at least an equal risk of recurrence and complications compared to conventional mesh placement. The ease of a surgical procedure is not a clear clinically relevant parameter, but it does often play a significant role in the surgeon&#x02019;s choices. Not only are there implications for approximately 4100 umbilical and 2400 epigastric operations in the Netherlands per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], but also for a frequently occurring other abdominal wall hernia, the small incisional hernia.</p><p>The MORPHEUS trial is designed to clarify which treatment for primary umbilical and epigastric hernias is superior in terms of complications, costs and recurrence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>The MORPHEUS trial is a multicentre, randomized controlled, nationwide, patient-blinded, superiority study. Patients will be randomly allocated to undergo open flat mesh repair or open patch repair for primary umbilical or epigastric hernias. The aim of this study is to determine the ideal treatment for patients with these conditions in terms of operation related complication and postoperative pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives/Endpoints</title><p>The primary objective of the MORPHEUS trial is to evaluate whether a ventral patch is associated with fewer complications than in conventional mesh placement for epigastric and umbilical repair. A complication is defined as an undesired development that requires treatment. Complications will be recorded up to three months after the initial procedure and pain up to 24&#x000a0;months post-operative. Secondary endpoints are differences in recurrence, cosmetic score, operation duration and costs.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The institutional review board of each participating hospital has approved this randomized controlled trial. Inclusion started February the 1<sup>st</sup> 2011. Adult patients with a single primary umbilical or epigastric hernia qualify for participation in the study. Patients with incarcerated hernia are also included. The maximum size of the herniation orifice can be 3&#x000a0;cm, corresponding with 2 fingers in analogy with the European Herniation Society (EHS) classification for inguinal hernias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Patients with diagnosed ascites are excluded. This also applies for patients who cannot sufficiently understand and/or follow through participation in a trial.

Those who participate must sign the informed consent form, which must also be signed by the investigator. If a patient does not participate in the trial, the reason for this must be stated. A patient included in the trial is requested to fill in a questionnaire (P1) before the operation.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>All procedures will take place under general anaesthesia. Administering a local anaesthetic peri-operatively is recommended. Prophylactic antibiotics are given on indication only. The use of a steri-drape as well as drains is not advised. Enlarging the herniation orifice as well as closing fascia over the mesh is permitted for both techniques.</p><p>The conventional mesh procedure begins with a para-umbilical or median incision across the hernia, then dissection of the fascia and mobilisation of the hernia sac. Opening of the hernia sac for inspection is permitted. Dissection of the pre-peritoneal area takes place after repositioning of the hernia. A flat large pore and lightweight polypropylene mesh with a minimum diameter of 6&#x000a0;cm is placed. Fixation of the mesh is carried out with non-absorbable monofilament sutures.</p><p>For the patch procedure, the hernia sac is opened. Possible adhesions must be released intraperitoneally. The patch is placed underneath the peritoneum, the slips fixed to the fascia. If in the surgeon&#x02019;s opinion the hernia sac can be repositioned without opening it, placement is also permitted in the pre-peritoneal plane. We have chosen the standard of a PROCEED&#x02122; VENTRAL PATCH (Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany) for this trial. No specific brand was chosen for the flat large pore and lightweight polypropylene mesh.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up and flow chart protocol</title><p>The surgeon must fill in a questionnaire (D1) immediately after the operation. The patients are advised to take 1 gram of paracetamol 3 times a day for the first 2&#x000a0;weeks, and to begin mobilizing immediately according to their capacity. Follow-up at the outpatient clinic takes place after 1 and 12&#x000a0;months, with the practitioner filling in the questionnaires (D2 and D3). The patients are asked to fill in a questionnaire 3 and 24&#x000a0;months after the operation (P2 and P3). These questionnaires will be sent to the patients by postal service or e-mail. Non-responders were contacted up to three times by means of a telephone questionnaire.

These are defined in detail further in the protocol. The occurrence of complications up to 23% is described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Trials involving patch repair report a much lower complication rate, but the number of trials is significantly less. It is assumed that a conventional procedure leads to a complication in 20% of the cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The hypothesis is that this is reduced to 10% if a patch is used for repair. At a significance level of 5% and a power of 90%, the random sample size is 137 patients per group in a bilateral t-test. In the result analysis a Mann&#x02013;Whitney parametric test will be used to evaluate a normal distribution. Therefore, the sample size must be increased by 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Taking a minimum of 10% loss-to-follow-up into account as well, the total number of patients to be randomized becomes 346.</p></sec><sec><title>Participant recruitment and retention</title><p>The surgeon will recruit the patients.

Lots of mesh devices are available for herniorraphy made by various companies. Often the choice of the mesh depends on the personal favour of the operating surgeon. The reason to start with this trial is to have a more scientific approach for the decision-making regarding the determination of mesh device.</p><p>In this study protocol only the patient is blinded for the treatment. By all means, the operating surgeon cannot be blinded for the type of mesh. The doctor who sees the patients in the outpatient clinic, and fills in forms D2 an D3 can be blind for the treatment type. Because of logistical reasons this is not added to this study protocol. Besides the logistical reasons we think that there is little value in blinding the treating doctor in the outpatient clinic. Observer-bias will be very little because of the straightforward multiple-choice questions in forms D2 and D3.</p><p>The results will help to evaluate mesh repair for epigastric an umbilical hernia, and find a surgical device/method that minimizes the complication rate.
