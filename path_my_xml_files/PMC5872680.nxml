First, twenty one SHR were randomized into three groups to either receive in a single-oral dose of purified water (negative control), FM, or naloxone (opioid receptor antagonist) + FM.

Results indicated that opioid receptors were not involved in the hypotensive effect of FM. However, ACEI activity (94 U/L), the oxidative stress index (malondialdehyde/catalase + glutathione peroxidase) 0.9, and nitric oxide in plasma (4.4 &#x000b1; 1.3 U/L), were significantly different from the negative control, and not significantly different from the Captopril group.

Introduction</title><p>Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, a leading risk factor for death and disability. It has been estimated that hypertension affects more than 40% of people over 25 [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The high cost and adverse effects associated with pharmacological therapy have encouraged the scientists to search for new alternatives [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, there has been a rising interest in fermented dairy foods that, besides being nutritional, may promote health or reduce diseases, such as hypertension [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The beneficial effects of dairy products are attributed to several bioactive components, such as calcium, medium-chain fatty acids, lactose, conjugated linoleic acid and bioactive peptides [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Bioactive peptides from milk are liberated from the native protein through proteolysis during gastrointestinal digestion or food processing, such as fermentation with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In fact, multifunctional properties of milk-derived peptides are increasingly recognized [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. </p><p>The antihypertensive effect of fermented milk products has been attributed to bioactive peptides [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and/or gamma-amminobutyric acid (GABA) [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] produced during milk fermentation. In fact, the antihypertensive effect of bioactive peptides is often attributed to angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI), an enzyme that plays a crucial role in blood regulation through the renin angiotensin system (RAS) [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, it has been reported that in some cases there is no correlation between in vitro and in vivo ACEI activity, due to peptides undergoing further degradation during gastrointestinal digestion, which may cause less bioavailability to reach target organs and cause the beneficial effect [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, peptides with antioxidant [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], nitric oxide pathway [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and opioid receptor binding activities [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] might also exhibit antihypertensive activity. Hence, antihypertensive bioactive peptides in fermented milks, may be acting via multiple mechanisms [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>It has been previously reported that a fermented skim milk product with <italic>Lactococcus</italic> (<italic>L.</italic>) <italic>lactis</italic> NRRL B-50571 had ACEI activity in vitro; and this effect was strain-dependent [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, fermented milk with <italic>L. lactis</italic> NRRL B-50571 reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate and had a hypolypidemic effect on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally, in a pilot randomized double blind controlled clinical trial with prehypertensive subjects a blood pressure lowering effect of fermented milk with <italic>L. lactis</italic> NRRL-B50571 was observed [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

Hence, the antihypertensive effect may be attributed to bioactive peptides present in this fermented milk; yet, it is not clear which mechanism is involved in the hypotensive effect. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine in SHR if the antihypertensive effect of fermented milk with <italic>L. lactis</italic> NRRL B-50571 was through the nitric oxide pathway, the opioid receptor binding, or the ACEI and antioxidant activities.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-10-00262"><title>2.

Hence, in this study the blood pressure lowering effect may not be attributed to peptides binding to opioid receptors.</p><p>On the other hand, it was reported that the mechanism of the blood pressure lowering effect of a tetrapeptide from milk whey, after a single subcutaneous administration to SHR, was by opioid receptors, since the response was antagonized with naloxone [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, it should not be disregarded that if SHR were administered subcutaneously with specific peptides present in the fermented milk with <italic>L. lactis</italic> NRRL B-50571) [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the antihypertensive effect could be via binding opioid receptors.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-nutrients-10-00262"><title>3.2. Long-Term Effect of FM on Blood Pressure</title><p>In a parallel study, twenty seven SHR with blood pressure higher than 200/150 mmHg for systolic and diastolic blood pressures were selected for randomization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nutrients-10-00262-t002">Table 2</xref>). As expected, there were no significant differences (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) between groups on clinical characteristics (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and weight). In this study, we evaluated the other possible mechanisms involved in the antihypertensive effect of fermented milk with <italic>L. lactis</italic>, after six weeks of administration. Changes in SBP and DBP for every week are represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-00262-f003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-00262-f004">Figure 4</xref>. Both SBP and DBP values from the Captopril group and FM group were significantly different from the negative control group (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), but they were not significantly different (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) between them. Maximal SBP decreases from the FM group was of 49.9 &#x000b1; 14.2 mmHg, after 6 weeks of treatment, while the Captopril group SBP decreased 45.2 &#x000b1; 23.6 mmHg on the same week of intervention. After six weeks of intervention, SHR were sacrificed to obtain plasma and evaluate ACEI activity, NO production and antioxidant effect.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-nutrients-10-00262"><title>3.3. ACEI Activity</title><p>One method to determine <italic>in vivo</italic> ACEI activity indirectly from peptides is through the determination of circulating ACEI activity in plasma [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-00262-f005">Figure 5</xref> represents the ACEI activity in plasma of SHR after six weeks post-treatment. Plasma ACEI activity was reduced in SHR treated with Captopril (a potent ACE inhibitor) and FM groups, and was not significantly different between them (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Moreover, ACEI activity in plasma from the negative control group was 5.5 times higher than the FM group, and was significantly different (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) from the groups treated with FM or Captopril. Thus, the effect may be attributed to the in vivo ACE inhibition from bioactive peptides in FM, because circulating ACE activity was reduced. </p><p>A similar finding of ACEI activity in vivo after long-term effect of lactoferrin hydrolysates in SHR was evaluated [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In another study where there was a single intake of lactoferrin-derived peptides, there were also reductions in circulating ACE activity (40%) after 1 h post-administration; furthermore, these effects were similar to the SHR group, which received Captopril [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], henceforth angiotensin converting enzyme is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in blood regulation through the renin angiotensin system (RAS), thus its inhibition exerts antihypertensive effects [<xref rid="B30-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the present study, since reductions of the ACEI activity in circulating plasma were similar in the FM group and Captopril group; henceforth we may assume that this mechanistic pathway may be involved in the hypotensive effect of FM with <italic>L. lactis</italic> NRRL B-50571.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-nutrients-10-00262"><title>3.4. NO Pathway</title><p>In our present study, NO concentration in plasma was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-00262-f006">Figure 6</xref>). After long-term effect of each treatment, plasma NO concentrations were significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) higher in the FM group and Captopril group than in the negative control group. Actually, plasma NO was 1.6 times higher in the FM group than in the negative control group; and was significantly different (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Recent studies have reported that some antihypertensive peptides may improve NO bioavailability through antioxidant effects, but certain peptides may also enhance NO production, improve endothelial function and improve blood pressure [<xref rid="B31-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. NO is an important bioregulatory molecule, which improves endothelial function, improves vasodilatation and controls blood pressure; therefore it is considered to be the main vasodilator. SHR may develop endothelial dysfunction by reducing bioavailability of NO. Therefore, increased bioavailability of NO may also improve vasodilation and reduce blood pressure [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our findings are similar with those by Kim et al. [<xref rid="B33-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; they reported that fermented milk had an antihypertensive effect in SHR, had less ACEI activity in plasma, and more concentration of NO, compared to their control group. Hence, NO production may also be considered a mechanism involved in the hypotensive effect of FM with <italic>L. lactis</italic> NRRL B-50571.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-nutrients-10-00262"><title>3.5. Antioxidant Effect</title><p>To date, there is growing evidence that oxidative stress is one of the main responsible factors for the initiation or evolution of hypertension and its complications. Increased oxidative stress is also considered to be an important causative factor of the vascular endothelial dysfunction, causing decrement of NO production [<xref rid="B34-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore, there has been a rising interest on the pursuit for bioactive peptides with antioxidant activity, which may provide additional benefit to the endogenous antioxidant defense system [<xref rid="B35-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Moreover, lipid peroxidation plays a major role in oxidative stress. Hence, bioactive components that may reduce lipoperoxidation may help decrease oxidative stress [<xref rid="B34-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It has been reported that food bioactive peptides have strong antioxidant effect without significant side effects [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and that milk derived peptides are the most studied [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In fact, it has been reported that whey protein has beneficial effects through enhancement of antioxidant enzymes and down regulation of oxidative markers such as lipoperoxidation [<xref rid="B37-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. </p><p>In the present study, we evaluated the concentration of three antioxidant enzymes in plasma post-treatments. Results indicated that SOD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-00262-f007">Figure 7</xref>) and CAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-00262-f008">Figure 8</xref>) were not significantly different (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) in either group; nevertheless, values were higher in the Captopril group and the FM group than in the negative control group. Moreover, GPx activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-00262-f009">Figure 9</xref>) in the Captopril group was significantly higher (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) than in the FM group and negative control group; however, GPx activity value from the FM group was slightly higher than in the negative control group. Additionally we evaluated lipoperoxidation in plasma through TBA, by detecting MDA products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-00262-f010">Figure 10</xref>). In this study, although we did not detect differences between all groups (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), MDA values from the FM group and Captopril group were lower than in the negative control. </p><p>Nonetheless, after the evaluation of the oxidative stress index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-00262-f011">Figure 11</xref>), which indicates the balance between lipoperoxidation (as malondialdehyde, MDA) and total antioxidant enzyme activity (CAT and GPx), results demonstrated that the Captopril group and the FM group were not significantly different (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), yet they were significantly different (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) from the negative control group. Since FM decreased oxidative stress in SHR, antioxidant activity may also be considered as an underlying mechanism pathway on the antihypertensive effect of FM. Thus, daily consumption of fermented milk with <italic>L. lactis</italic> NRRL B-50571 may help lower high blood pressure, as well as MDA levels and oxidative stress index, ACEI activity, and an enhancement of NO production. </p><p>Similarly, it was reported that the antihypertensive effect of whey protein concentrate hydrolysates in SHR was through ACEI activity, oxidative damage reduction, and enhancement of NO production [<xref rid="B38-nutrients-10-00262" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-nutrients-10-00262"><title>4.
