Moreover, we hypothesized that a lower proportion of patients cared for in a CGA unit, compared to conventional care, would present with a higher degree of frailty. Another research question was whether there was any difference between the groups in reported use of municipal services such as home help services, home health care, and residential care.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>This is a clinical, prospective, controlled trial with two parallel groups, carried out at the NU county hospital group between March 2013 and July 2015. The total population of the NU healthcare system is 280,000 inhabitants. The study was approved by an independent ethics committee at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden (8883-12, 20121212) and registered at the Swedish National Database of Research and Development (identifier 113021; November 4, 2012; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.researchweb.org/is/vgr/project/113021">http://www.researchweb.org/is/vgr/project/113021</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Selection of participants</title><p>Inclusion criteria: Patients, 75 years or older, in need of in-hospital treatment, and who qualified for the foundation of frailty &#x02013; that is, those who had two or more of the following FRESH criteria: general fatigue, tiredness from a short walk, dependence in shopping, frequent falls/anticipation of falls, and three or more visits to the emergency ward during the last 12 months.</p><p>Exclusion criteria: A patient clearly suited for care in a conventional acute medical care unit due to the severity and type of condition: acute stroke, acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, or other acute life-threatening conditions; the patient declined participation in the study; informed consent could not be obtained from the patient (and it was not possible to obtain informed consent from a relative); or the patient was a previously defined M&#x000c4;VA patient (such patients were excluded due to the risk of bias).</p><p>When the ambulance staff, or the staff at a primary care clinic, identified a patient who met the inclusion criteria, a senior M&#x000c4;VA doctor or the on-call doctor was contacted via telephone. If the M&#x000c4;VA doctor agreed that the patient fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and there was a bed available at M&#x000c4;VA, the patient was included in the intervention group and admitted directly to M&#x000c4;VA without passing through the emergency room. In case of unavailability of a bed on the M&#x000c4;VA wards, the patient was included in the control group and admitted to a conventional acute medical care unit via the emergency room. Allocation was possible 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient, or from a member of his/her next of kin, after oral and written informed consent. All patients eligible for inclusion were registered in a screening-log book. All data were registered and handled in accordance with Good Clinical Practices and legislation.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The two types of hospital units were the intervention and control units. Intervention group: Patients who were cared for in a CGA unit (M&#x000c4;VA). The M&#x000c4;VAs are characterized by a structured, systematic interdisciplinary CGA and care by validated instruments focusing on: somatic and mental health, medication review, functional, and activity ability, including early rehabilitation, social situation, and early discharge planning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cia-12-1239">Figure 1</xref>). Patients are admitted directly to the CGA unit via ambulance or primary care. The early rehabilitation strategy involves physicians, nurses, occupational therapists, and physiotherapists as active team members. This implies care guidance that is adjusted to the needs of frail elderly patients. In order to individualize the assessment and treatment, the team has a person-centered approach. These wards work according to the CGA concept and are led by specialists in geriatrics, internal medicine, and, in a few cases, family medicine. The specialists who were not geriatricians all had a special interest in the care of elderly patients.</p><p>Control group: Patients who were cared for in a conventional acute medical care unit, where standard procedures in accordance with national and international guidelines are applied. All patients were admitted to these care units via the emergency room. Physiotherapists and occupational therapists worked merely on a consultative approach and treat patients only after being actively contacted by physicians or nurses.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods and measurements</title><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Clinical and demographic characteristics</title><p>The following data were collected: housing, age, sex, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, renal function, other comorbidities and all-cause mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>ADL</title><p>ADL independence/dependence was assessed by using the ADL Staircase before discharge.<xref rid="b31-cia-12-1239" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> This instrument comprises five personal ADL (PADL) items (ie, feeding, transferring, going to the toilet, dressing, and bathing),<xref rid="b32-cia-12-1239" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> extended by four instrumental ADL (IADL) items (ie, cooking, shopping, cleaning, and transportation). The instrument is considered clinically relevant and has been validated.<xref rid="b33-cia-12-1239" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34-cia-12-1239" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The ADL Staircase was administered by interview and, if possible, observation. The assessment was recorded on a three-grade scale: independent, partly dependent, and dependent. Dependence was defined in terms of assistance from another person. Scores ranged from nil to nine dependencies.</p></sec><sec><title>Frailty</title><p>The degree of frailty was determined with the FRESH screening instrument. FRESH screening has been developed from the intervention project &#x0201c;Continuum of care for frail elderly people.&#x0201d; This instrument has been validated and has manifested high sensitivity and specificity (81% and 80%, respectively) for screening for frailty in acute settings. The sum of sensitivity and positive prediction is 173, which is considered an excellent clinical value. It has been used in practice for a few years.<xref rid="b11-cia-12-1239" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-cia-12-1239" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p></sec><sec><title>The Charlson Comorbidity Index</title><p>The patient&#x02019;s total burden of morbidity was measured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index.<xref rid="b35-cia-12-1239" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b36-cia-12-1239" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> It contains 19 categories of comorbidity and predicts the 10-year mortality for a patient. Each comorbidity is assigned a score of 1, 2, 3, or 6, depending on the risk of death associated with this condition.</p><p>During the index hospital-care episode, clinical and demographic characteristics were collected. Most patients were assessed by an occupational therapist (ADL independence/dependence) and a nurse (eg, housing). A trained physician made the assessments in a few cases. Follow-up assessments were made 3 months after discharge by a physician at the hospital or in the patient&#x02019;s home. Patients were the primary informants. When necessary, proxy informants were used, mostly a family member.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was decline in functional activity, assessed by the ADL Staircase, from the index hospitalization until 3 months after discharge. A one-step decline on the ADL Staircase &#x02013; that is, loss of independence in one or more ADLs &#x02013; was considered clinically relevant.</p><p>In a complementary analysis, the functional abilities of patients were classified into independence, IADL-dependence, and PADL-dependence. A decline from independence to ADL-dependence or from IADL- to PADL-dependence was considered a clinically relevant change. Being partly dependent was classified as dependence.</p><p>A secondary outcome was a one-step higher degree of frailty at 3 months, as measured by the FRESH instrument. The reported use of municipal services was classified into three levels, denoting consecutively increasing dependence: 1) own living without home help services or home health care; 2) own living with home help services or home health care; and 3) residential care. A one-step level increase was considered relevant.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>The sample size calculation was based on change in functional capacity measured as the loss of basal ADL according to the Katz Index after 3 months (significance level 0.05, power 80%). As previous studies mostly included less frail patients, and had different follow-up times, it was difficult to estimate strict clinically relevant differences. Based on a study along similar lines<xref rid="b37-cia-12-1239" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> and by the use of a two-sided test, it was necessary to include 150 patients in each study group. To compensate for uncertainty, it was estimated that 200 evaluable patients should be included in each group &#x02013; that is, 400 subjects in total. This is in parity with previous similar studies.<xref rid="b20-cia-12-1239" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>The analysis used the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle &#x02013; that is, the included patients remained in the study group to which they were allocated. After discharge from the index care episode, patients in both groups could be re-admitted to conventional care or the CGA unit.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.3. Continuous data were compared using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test and categorical data were analyzed using Fisher&#x02019;s exact or chi-square tests. Associations of the intervention with the primary and secondary outcomes were assessed by either Cox regression or a multiple logistic regression model adjusted for relevant prognostic variables (sex, age, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index score). A variance inflation factor test was used to analyze all independent variables included in the models for possible collinearity. Variance inflation factor values &#x0003e;2.5 were considered indicative of collinearity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="intro|methods|subjects"><title>Characteristics of study subjects</title><p>Between March 2013 and July 2015, the ambulance or primary care teams identified 822 eligible patients.

Acute care in a CGA unit was independently associated with less decline in independence in ADLs and less increase in degree of frailty.</p><p>In our trial, severely frail elderly patients with acute medical, non-surgical illnesses were included. To our knowledge, former studies focusing on the CGA concept have not included patients who were this old with such a high total morbidity burden. Our results, therefore, add to the knowledge concerning a potentially appropriate emergency care organization that meets the needs of these patients in terms of relevant outcomes, evaluated with well-established instruments. The generalizability of the results to other hospitals is enhanced by the fact that this trial was integrated in the standard daily clinical context and included a wide spectrum of diagnoses. Furthermore, we studied frail elderly patients in need of acute care, which adds complementary knowledge to former studies on patients in a more chronic and stable phase. Frail elderly patients with similar characteristics as in our study constitute a large part of everyday hospital care consumption, which emphasizes a particular need to study this important patient group.</p><p>Treatment in a CGA unit was associated with a significantly lower risk of functional decline, measured by the ADL Staircase, at the 3-month follow-up. Similarly, when ADLs were classified into three strata (independence, IADL-dependence, and PADL-dependence), decrease to a more dependence-associated stratum was less prevalent in the intervention group. This agrees with the results of a few previous studies of elderly patients.<xref rid="b12-cia-12-1239" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b24-cia-12-1239" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b27-cia-12-1239" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> It should be emphasized that home and hospital CGA programs have been reported to be consistently valuable for several outcomes of elderly patients, whereas CGA performed in other settings have shown diverging results.<xref rid="b38-cia-12-1239" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p><p>Increases in the degree of frailty were less prevalent in our intervention group. As dependence or difficulty carrying out ADLs is associated with frailty,<xref rid="b8-cia-12-1239" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b14-cia-12-1239" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-cia-12-1239" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> this seems to be a reasonable and consistent finding.</p><p>One reason as to why there was no difference between the groups in the increased use of municipal services at 3 months may be that this outcome is influenced not only by the patients&#x02019; ADLs, but also by administrative and socioeconomic issues such as the supply of municipal home help services and rooms in residential care. In addition, participants who died before follow-up were excluded in the analysis, which is likely to imply a conservative estimation. As a co-variation between mortality and dependence in ADLs can be assumed, the control group with higher mortality is likely to gain from the chosen analysis strategy.</p><p>Frail elderly patients in acute care have complex needs. They would, therefore, be likely to benefit from a complex intervention, including a biopsychosocial approach. The CGA and related care constitutes such an intervention. There may be several critical differences compared to conventional care, which may interact and benefit frail elderly patients. In our study, patients in the intervention group were directly admitted to the CGA unit, without passing through the emergency room unlike the control group patients. This is one difference in care, which may play a role in the difference in outcomes, maybe by reducing time to initiation of acute treatment. However, the early rehabilitation perspective, including assessment and care, should be regarded as the most crucial aspect.</p><p>One question to address in future research is whether the reported benefit for very frail patients persists in a long-term perspective. More research is also needed to identify appropriate organizational forms adapted to the different stages of needs that frail elderly patients can manifest &#x02013; that is, stable chronic disease and acute illnesses. This further research should include comprehensive evaluations of activities in primary and municipal care, ambulant geriatric care units, and specialized hospital care. Some of the frail elderly patients will still need organ-specific, highly technological treatments. A future challenge is the search for a strategy to coordinate and integrate specialized interventions with the CGA approach.</p><p>The M&#x000c4;VA form of care constitutes one example of how acute care for frail elderly individuals can be organized. This example could be implemented in everyday hospital health care in Sweden and other countries. Frail elderly patients would thereby be offered more appropriate emergency care than they are at present.</p><p>Approximately half of the eligible patients took part in the study, which could be looked upon as a limitation. There was, however, no difference in this respect between the groups, and the main reason was that patients declined to participate in the study.</p><p>It was considered very important to include patients who are representative of the frail elderly population in everyday health care. A significant proportion of these patients are cognitively impaired, especially in the acute stage of the illness. For these reasons, randomizing through a lottery, after obtaining informed consent in the ambulance, was considered utterly difficult to implement. As two hospital care forms were evaluated, blinding of patients or staff was not possible. As most of the baseline characteristics did not differ between the groups, the allocation procedure we used seems to be confirmed as random to a satisfactory extent. We believe that a patient allocation sequence which was unpredictable was generated, and that this sequence was concealed from the investigators enrolling patients in the study. When differences were identified, patients in the intervention group were slightly more ill (eg, presenting with a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score), with no identified bias in favor of the intervention group. However, the absence of a lottery procedure constituted a potential risk of bias.</p><p>It is a weakness that the assessments could not be carried out in a blinded fashion, and this could potentially have influenced a few of the outcomes. However, in practice, it would have been very difficult to blind the assessors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Team-based emergency care for frail elderly patients with acute medical disorders in a CGA unit is superior to the care in a conventional acute medical care unit in terms of clinical functional outcomes. The emergency care in a CGA unit was independently associated with less decline in independence in ADLs and less increase in degree of frailty at 3 months. The likelihood for patients in the intervention group to avail increased use of municipal services was the same as for patients in the control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1-cia-12-1239"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of participant selection and assessment.</p><p><bold>Notes:</bold> *Including 10 patients unable to give informed consent; **including six patients unable to give informed consent.
