Darkly pigmented irides do not dilate as fast or as well as light-colored irides. However, there have been studies suggesting that prior instillation of an anesthetic like amethocaine may enhance the adrenergic iris dilator muscle response to a mydriatic-like tropicamide, by increasing its corneal penetration and hence its bioavailability.<xref rid="b1-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Achieving adequate mydriasis has diagnostic and therapeutic implications; for instance, the visualization of the retinal periphery for the staging or diagnosis of retinal disorders such as retinopathy of prematurity<xref rid="b3-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> retinoblastomas,<xref rid="b4-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> or the laser treatment of retinal tumors as indicated in transpupillary thermotherapy<xref rid="b5-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and for surgical procedures.<xref rid="b6-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> While higher concentrations or synergistic combinations of mydriatics may be used to achieve greater mydriasis,<xref rid="b7-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> it is reported that simply applying a topical anesthetic before the instillation of a mydriatic not only increases the comfort of the patient but also increases the rate and degree of mydriasis achieved.<xref rid="b7-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Mordi et al. documented a clear poten-tiating effect of proparacaine on tropicamide-induced mydriasis in blue&#x02014;green and hazel&#x02014;brown irides.<xref rid="b9-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, while the blue&#x02014;green pupils remained at 90% of maximal dilatation for a longer duration, the duration was not prolonged in brown&#x02014;hazel eyes. This demonstrates that iris color affects the response of the pupil to mydriatics, being less responsive as the iris color darkens. On the other hand, Ghose reported a significant increase of 3.62 + 0.75 mm in pupil size in dark irides pre-treated with lignocaine 4%, when dilated with tropicamide drops, suggesting that pre-instillation of an anesthetic could indeed potentiate tropicamide-induced dilatation in darkly pigmented irides. This controversy therefore prompted this present study to determine and quantify the potentiating effect of a single drop of amethocaine, a topical anesthetic, on the mydriasis, produced by tropicamide, a commonly used dilating agent, in healthy young African adults, with darkly pigmented irides.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><sec><title>Infrared video pupillometer</title><p>An infrared video monocular pupillometer was utilized in this study. The camera module was constructed from a 1/4&#x02033; monochrome CCD camera board, a specialized constant-magnification lens, and a LED flex printed circuit board populated with two infrared LEDs for iris illumination. The pupillometer was interfaced directly to a laptop PC via an IEEE 1394a port. The software used for control and acquisition of pupil data was a special investigational version of the software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-oed-6-2014-013">Fig. 1</xref>) provided commercially by NeurOptics&#x02122; (Irvine, CA, USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neuroptics">http://www.neuroptics</ext-link>. com) desktop pupillometer systems.

Mean undilated pupil diameter was 4.25 + 0.72 mm in the placebo eyes and 4.15 + 0.15 mm in the intervention eyes. The mean undilated pupil diameters did not differ significantly between the placebo eyes and drug eyes at the onset (<italic>P</italic> = 0.168). For the purpose of statistical analysis, a pupillary diameter of &#x02265; 6.0 mm (clinically effective diameter, CED) was taken to be clinically significant.<xref rid="b8-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-oed-6-2014-013">Figure 3</xref> is a box-plot showing the spread of pupil diameters recorded in the control (placebo-treated) eye during the 60-minute dilatation phase.

While the mean pupil diameter increased by up to 2 mm in the drug eyes, dilatation in the placebo eyes was less than 2 mm. The marked dilatation, which occurred between 10 and 20 minutes in both the placebo-treated and amethocaine-treated eyes, is shown by the wider separation of the two curves during this time interval. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-oed-6-2014-013">Figure 6</xref> analyses the average rate (speed) of dilatation in millimeter per minute. The highest change in average dilatation speed occurred within the first 15 minutes, when the average rate of dilatation increased from a baseline of 0.04 mm/minute in the placebo-treated eye and 0.05 mm/minute in the amethocaine-treated eye at 5 minutes, respectively, to a peak of 0.08 mm/minute in the placebo-treated eye and 0.09 mm/minute in the amethocaine-treated eye at 15 minutes. The average rate of dilatation rapidly slowed down in amethocaine-treated eyes dropping to 0.04 mm/minute at 25 minutes, 0.01 mm/minute at 35 minutes, and becoming negligible thereafter. The speed of dilatation followed a less precipitous initial drop in the placebo-treated eye, dropping to 0.06 mm/minute at 25 minutes and 0.01 mm/minute at 35 minutes, also becoming negligible thereafter. Average pupil dilatation rate was the same in both placebo-treated and amethocaine-treated eyes (0.01&#x02013;0.005 mm/minute) between 35 and 45 minutes, but dropped further in amethocaine-treated eyes to 0.003 mm/minute while leveling off at 0.01 mm/minute in placebo-treated eyes at the end of the dilatation period.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-oed-6-2014-013">Table 2</xref> shows that a total of 31 (62%) subjects reached the CED of 6.0 mm, in their amethocaine-treated eye, whereas 19 (38%) did not.

The <italic>x</italic>-axis shows the time taken to reach the CED of 6.0 mm, in minutes, whereas the <italic>y</italic>-axis denotes the probability of the eyes not reaching the CED. The time taken for 50% of amethocaine-treated eyes (ie, median time) to reach the CED of 6 mm was approximately 40 minutes. However, less than 50% of placebo-treated eyes reached the CED of 6 mm.</p><p>Magnitude of dilatation was calculated as the mean difference between pupil size at each time interval and the pupil size when tropicamide was instilled. The magnitude of pupillary dilatation achieved in the placebo-treated eyes and amethocaine-treated eyes is illustrated. The mean dilatation observed in the first 10 minutes was 0.41 &#x000b1; 0.57 mm in the placebo-treated eyes (range &#x02212;0.76 to 1.62 mm) as compared with a mean dilatation of 0.53 &#x000b1; 0.57 mm in the amethocaine-treated eyes (range &#x02212;0.68 to 1.90). The mean dilatation observed at the end of the dilatation phase (at 60 minutes) was 1.97 &#x000b1; 0.60 mm in the placebo-treated eyes (range 0.75&#x02013;3.17 mm) compared with 2.01 &#x000b1; 0.61 mm in the amethocaine-treated eyes (range 0.91&#x02013;3.22 mm). It was observed, however, that although the maximum change in pupil size occurred at 60 minutes in the placebo-treated eyes (3.17 mm), the maximum change in pupil size was recorded at 40 minutes in the amethocaine-treated eyes (3.31 mm).</p><p>No adverse events were recorded in the 50 subjects used for this study, and the drugs appear to have been well tolerated by individual subjects with only minimal to moderate discomfort felt at the time of instillation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Darkly pigmented irides do not dilate as fast or as widely as light-colored irides. Chen and Poth attributed the reduced effect of mydriatics to reduced absorption in the iris crypts, because of mechanical obstruction by pigments contained within the chromophores.<xref rid="b13-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> On the other hand, Angenent and Koelle explained this difference on the basis of enzymatic hydrolysis of the adrenergic mediator of pupillary dilatation by DOPA-oxidase, thereby leaving an imbalance that results in predominant function of the cholinergic sphincter in darkly pigmented irides.<xref rid="b14-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The typical Nigerian patient is black (dark-skinned) with densely pigmented dark brown irides, and therefore does not dilate quickly and sometimes does not dilate optimally for routine examination in clinical practice. Emiru noted that the dark-skinned African did not achieve the large pupil diameters of the Caucasian even after 60 minutes of dilatation.<xref rid="b15-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> His reported mean pupil diameter at 60 minutes was 6.21 mm, which is comparable to the mean diameter of 6.01 &#x000b1; 0.54 mm obtained at 60 minutes in the amethocaine-treated eye in this study. It must be noted however that the pupil size reported in Emiru&#x02019;s study may have been overestimated, as he used the subjective pupil ruler.<xref rid="b15-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Regardless of the absolute accuracy of the measurement, this comparison shows that even with an apparent potentiating agent, pupillary dilatation remains difficult in dark irides.</p><p>Ghose et al. studying the potentiating effect of 4% lignocaine on tropicamide-induced mydriasis in Indians with dark brown irides obtained a mean maximum pupil size of 6.75 &#x000b1; 0.80 mm in the intervention eye and 6.08 &#x000b1; 0.97 mm in the control eye.<xref rid="b1-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This is much larger than the pupil sizes of 6.01 &#x000b1; 0.54 mm and 5.90 &#x000b1; 0.48 mm, obtained for amethocaine-treated and control eyes, respectively, in this study. The difference recorded in maximum pupil size, between both studies, was about 0.74 mm in the drug-treated eye and 0.18 mm in the control eye. The much larger difference in the drug-treated eye suggests that 4% of lignocaine may have a greater potentiating effect on tropicamide than 0.5% of amethocaine, or it may simply reflect a difference in the density of iris pigmentation in the two groups (Indians vs. Nigerians) as suggested by Emiru, who states that iris pigmentation and not race is more likely to be responsible for the poorer pupil dilatation in Africans.<xref rid="b15-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In addition, it should also be noted that the study by Ghose et al. is also potentially overestimated as they too employed the pupil ruler and not a sensitive and reliable instrument like the infrared video pupillometer.<xref rid="b1-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Furthermore, we observed that there was a 3.7 times greater likelihood, for the eye that was pre-treated with amethocaine to achieve the CED, of 6.0 mm, than it was in the eye that did not receive amethocaine (placebo-treated or control eye), when comparing the 11 subjects who achieved CED in the amethocaine-treated eye alone to the 3 subjects who achieved CED in their placebo-treated eye alone. However, the <italic>P</italic> value of 0.057, using McNemar&#x02019;s test, was not statistically significant. This would mean that it is difficult for darkly pigmented irides to reach the CED irrespective of the pre-instillation of an anesthetic.</p><p>Topical anesthetics like amethocaine are known to inhibit the rate of corneal epithelial cell migration by disrupting cytoplasmic action in filaments and destroying superficial corneal epithelial microvilli.<xref rid="b16-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The mechanism of amethocaine&#x02019;s potentiating effect on tropicamide-induced mydriasis is believed to be because of an increase in the intraocular penetration of the tropicamide as a result of greater absorption through the microscopic disruptions in the corneal epithelium and reduced tearing, which increases contact time and by extension, the bioavailability.<xref rid="b1-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b17-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b20-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> While most authors would agree that both light and dark irides demonstrate a potentiated mydriasis when pre-treated with amethocaine, Siderov reported a potentiating effect only in light-colored irides and not in darkly pigmented eyes.<xref rid="b2-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Furthermore, Haddad et al. claimed there was no potentiating effect at all.<xref rid="b21-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The results of this study, however, clearly suggest a potentiating effect of the anesthetic on dilatation, in the eyes pre-treated with amethocaine, even though the difference was not marked clinically. Siderov et al. may have failed to record any potentiating effect using just a magnifying loupe and ruler in the darkly pigmented eyes because his method of measuring was less sensitive to the small changes in pupil size.<xref rid="b2-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In a different paper studying the effect of dosage on the mydriatic efficacy of tropicamide, Siderov and Nurse reported an increased mydriasis with two drops of tropicamide as compared with a single drop in control eyes.<xref rid="b22-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> It is therefore likely that the potentiating effect may be amplified with an increase in the dosage or concentration of the anesthetic or mydriatic. The infrared pupillometer overcomes this limitation in two ways. The infrared LEDs capture the image of the pupil in high contrast (black pupil on a white (iris) background) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-oed-6-2014-013">Figure 1</xref>, making the measuring points easier to identify by the software. Also, because the video camera measures to an accuracy of 0.03 mm, even small changes in pupil size were accurately recorded. Though the sample size was small and may be considered a potential limitation of this study, the sensitivity and the accuracy of the video pupillometer reduced the margin of error.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrated that an initial drop of amethocaine had a statistically significant effect on the rate and amplitude of tropicamide-induced pupillary dilatation in darkly pigmented irides, though the change was small and was not clinically overt. This relatively modest change is related to the fact that darkly pigmented pupils are generally difficult to dilate;<xref rid="b15-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b23-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b26-oed-6-2014-013" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> however, it does not mean that this small effect cannot influence clinical diagnoses or therapies. We therefore submit that pre-instillation of amethocaine does appear to potentiate the mydriatic effect of tropicamide in darkly pigmented African irides. We suggest that this evidence supports the routine use of an anesthetic before dilating patients with tropicamide; it is safe to use and does not add any additional burden to the patient. This may have potential clinical benefit where inadequate pupillary dilatation may negatively influence the outcome of the ophthalmic procedures such as cataract surgery, NdYAG or femtosecond laser capsulotomy, pan-retinal photocoagulation, fundus photography, and other retinal imaging or examination techniques. It is probable that greater effects may be observed by increasing the dosage or concentration of either the anesthetic or mydriatic or both drugs. Further studies to assess the effect of larger doses or concentrations of the anesthetic and mydriatic are recommended.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank Prof. Charles O.
