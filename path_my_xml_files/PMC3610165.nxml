practice, patients with chronic pancreatitis undergo surgical intervention in a late stage of the disease, when conservative treatment and endoscopic interventions have failed. Recent evidence suggests that surgical intervention early on in the disease benefits patients in terms of better pain control and preservation of pancreatic function. Therefore, we designed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the benefits, risks and costs of early surgical intervention compared to the current stepwise practice for chronic pancreatitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The ESCAPE trial is a randomized controlled, parallel, superiority multicenter trial. Patients with chronic pancreatitis, a dilated pancreatic duct (&#x02265; 5&#x000a0;mm) and moderate pain and/or frequent flare-ups will be registered and followed monthly as potential candidates for the trial. When a registered patient meets the randomization criteria (i.e. need for opioid analgesics) the patient will be randomized to either early surgical intervention (group A) or optimal current step-up practice (group B). An expert panel of chronic pancreatitis specialists will oversee the assessment of eligibility and ensure that allocation to either treatment arm is possible. Patients in group A will undergo pancreaticojejunostomy or a Frey-procedure in case of an enlarged pancreatic head (&#x02265; 4&#x000a0;cm). Patients in group B will undergo a step-up practice of optimal medical treatment, if needed followed by endoscopic interventions, and if needed followed by surgery, according to predefined criteria. Primary outcome is pain assessed with the Izbicki pain score during a follow-up of 18&#x000a0;months. Secondary outcomes include complications, mortality, total direct and indirect costs, quality of life, pancreatic insufficiency, alternative pain scales, length of hospital admission, number of interventions and pancreatitis flare-ups. For the sample size calculation we defined a minimal clinically relevant difference in the primary endpoint as a difference of at least 15 points on the Izbicki pain score during follow-up. To detect this difference a total of 88 patients will be randomized (alpha 0.05, power 90%, drop-out 10%).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The ESCAPE trial will investigate whether early surgery in chronic pancreatitis is beneficial in terms of pain relief, pancreatic function and quality of life, compared with current step-up practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN45877994">ISRCTN45877994</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chronic pancreatitis</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>Surgical management</kwd><kwd>Surgery</kwd><kwd>Endoscopic treatment</kwd><kwd>Endoscopy</kwd><kwd>ERCP</kwd><kwd>Opioid</kwd><kwd>Pancreaticojejunostomy</kwd><kwd>Frey procedure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP), the most important clinical problem is the management of pain, which often occurs daily and is disabling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. CP is also associated with pancreatic insufficiency, both endocrine and exocrine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], which develops in 50% and 80% of patients within 5&#x000a0;years, respectively. CP is related to several causative factors, most notably alcohol toxicity. Other factors such as genetics, anatomic abnormalities and autoimmunity also play a role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In current practice, patients with CP are managed by a conservative step-up practice. The first step is medical management, ranging from pancreatic enzymes and mild analgesics to opioids. When medical management fails, the next step is usually endoscopic intervention. Surgical intervention is kept as an option of last resort when other treatments have failed and the severity of disease has increased substantially and pain becomes unmanageable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This approach is based on the so called &#x02018;burnout hypothesis&#x02019;, assuming that CP is a &#x02018;self-limiting&#x02019; disease in which pain will ultimately resolve spontaneously due to progressive parenchymal destruction of the pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Many reports have questioned the validity of this hypothesis, including the group that first introduced it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The main argument against the burnout hypothesis is the long time it takes for pain to subside; e.g. after 5&#x000a0;years of the onset of the disease about 60% of the patients will still experience substantial pain, and that in many reports complete insufficiency (&#x02018;burnout&#x02019;) of the gland does not guarantee pain relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>As an alternative to the current conservative step-up practice, there is emerging evidence to suggest that surgery early in the clinical course of CP is beneficial in terms of pain control and pancreatic function. First, pathophysiological studies of pain in CP have shown that prolonged periods of pain are associated with peripheral and central nerve sensitization. Consequently, a self-perpetuating pain state develops, which is very difficult to reverse and manage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Secondly, experimental and clinical studies suggest that early surgical intervention can mitigate disease progression. In an experimental model of early versus late surgical drainage for CP in piglets, we have previously demonstrated that early surgery resulted in less histological cell damage and better exocrine pancreatic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Clinically, two observational cohort studies have shown that surgical interventions, especially drainage procedures, have the potential to delay the progressive loss of pancreatic function in CP patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We recently also performed an observational study that supports the hypothesis that longstanding disease is associated with poor pain control after surgical intervention. In 266 consecutive patients undergoing an operation for CP we observed that surgery after 3&#x000a0;years of onset of symptoms was independently associated with worsened pain outcome and increased rates of endocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Additionally, preoperative use of opioids (indicative of severity of disease and time-delay to surgery) were significantly associated with bad outcome of surgery in terms of pain control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Finally, in a small pilot randomized trial, 32 patients with early stage CP and dilated pancreatic duct were randomized between early surgical drainage and a conservative approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Substantial pain relief was observed in 16/17 (94%) patients in the surgical group compared to 2/15 (13%) patients in the conservative group. New onset endocrine and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency were respectively observed in 2/13 (15%) and 1/15 (7%) in the early surgical group compared to 10/12 (83%) and 11/14 (79%) in the conservative group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Despite the evidence suggesting a benefit of early surgery, most patients with chronic pancreatitis are not managed by this approach in current practice. Therefore, the Dutch Pancreatitis Study Group designed a randomized controlled multicenter trial to evaluate the benefits, risks and costs of early surgical intervention: the Early Surgery versus Optimal Current Step-up Practice for Chronic Pancreatitis (ESCAPE) &#x02013; trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The ESCAPE trial is an open label randomized controlled, parallel, superiority multicenter trial.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><sec><title>Study hypothesis</title><p>We hypothesize that early surgery can relieve pain early in the disease course of chronic pancreatitis.

Since pain is associated with many of the negative effects of CP on costs, social functioning and quality of life, the average reduction of pain during this period is of interest.</p><p>Calculation of a sample size based on the hypothesized difference between treatment arms was not possible due to unavailability of such data. We, therefore, decided to base this calculation on detecting the minimal clinically relevant difference of the Izbicki pain score. In a consensus meeting the Chronic Pancreatitis Expert Panel agreed that the trial should aim to detect a difference of 15 points or more on the Izbicki pain score (minimal clinically relevant difference) during follow-up. Attempting to detect smaller differences would not bring any clear advantage to the clinical decision making process, but would substantially increase the required sample size.</p><p>In previous studies, the average within group standard deviation of the Izbicki pain score was in the order of 20 points. Based on these assumptions, it was determined that 39 patients per group are needed to detect the minimal clinically relevant difference of 15 points on average using an &#x02018;area under the curve&#x02019;-analysis, based on alpha of 0.05 with a power of 90%.

This allows for quantifying and comparing of the effect of study interventions on pain during the full follow-up period. Since we will measure the Izbicki pain score at fixed intervals, the &#x02018;area under the curve&#x02019; analysis is statistically equivalent to comparing the average Izbicki score during the study period.

Reviews and experts have repeatedly indicated a lack of randomized studies comparing surgical to medical treatment in CP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This is widely considered as an important hiatus in the current knowledge regarding treatment of this disease. The ESCAPE-trial has, therefore, the potential to substantially improve the health status of CP patients and thereby impact daily clinical practice. The importance of the ESCAPE-trial is also strengthened by several reports indicating a substantial increase in incidence of CP in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Rationale of study question</title><p>As described in the introduction, medical management is currently the first treatment for many CP patients. Although medical management may suffice to suppress symptoms early in the disease, it does little to influence the progression of disease and does not guarantee long-term relief of symptoms. Longitudinal studies show that of all CP patients, 40 to 75% will still require surgery for pain in the course of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The percentage of patients requiring a surgical intervention is probably even higher if only patients that are suitable candidates for surgery (have morphological abnormalities) are considered.</p><p>The current expectative management of CP means that, even in patients with clear morphological changes, progression of disease to the extent of severe and debilitating pain is a necessity before surgical interventions are considered. This approach should be questioned in the light of the prior discussed evidence (see introduction) suggesting that early intervention could mitigate disease progression and benefit the patient in terms of pain control as well as preservation of pancreatic function. The ESCAPE trial allows to examine these potential benefits in a setting of a well designed, sufficiently powered randomized trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Rationale for used value of minimal clinically relevant difference</title><p>Calculation of a sample size based on the hypothesized difference between treatment arms was not possible, because the anticipated difference in the Izbicki pain scores between the early surgery group and the optimal current step-up practice could not be estimated with precision. Earlier surgical studies only provided Izbicki pain scores for patients who are operated late in the disease process. These scores do not reflect the expected results after early surgery, since we hypothesized that early surgery will achieve better pain control. In addition, the optimal current step-up practice is a consensus treatment designed for the purpose of this study. No exact levels of Izbicki scores are known for this research arm. The one small RCT by Nealon et al. that has studied the topic of early surgery in chronic pancreatitis only presented pain as proportion of patients with pain relief (94% for the early surgical group versus 13% for the non-surgical group) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We choose not to use these values for our sample size calculations for several reasons:</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02004;Measuring the outcome continuously best serves our hypothesis. It enables us to describe and better quantify the degree of pain during the 1.5&#x000a0;year follow-up period, and thus relate the degree of pain with costs and quality of life more precisely.</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02004;The non-surgical arm in the above mentioned trial was not clearly described. In the ESCAPE-trial we optimized the management of those patients with our current practice step-approach.</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02004;The observed differences in the trial are very large whereas its sample size is very small and no formal sample size calculation had been made; this needs confirmation in a large trial.</p><p>To be able to make a reliable sample size calculation we, therefore, decided to base this calculation on detecting the minimal clinically relevant difference in the average Izbicki pain scores between the two study groups. This is a recognized and well accepted method for sample size calculations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. First, we estimated the expected Izbicki pain score for the early surgery group. The most reliable Izbicki pain scores for the Dutch situation are produced by the CEPAN study which compared (late) surgery versus endoscopic intervention for CP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The mean Izbicki pain score in the surgical group was 25 points. For the ESCAPE trial we hypothesize that an early surgical intervention will be able to achieve better pain control after surgery; probably in the range of 10 to 20 points. Subsequently, the clinical impact of an increase in the Izbicki pain score from this level by various amounts was discussed. A difference of 15 points was chosen to be the minimal difference that would alter the clinical situation of the patient in a potentially clinically relevant way. For illustration, the clinical meaning of such an increase is discussed: According to the Izbicki pain score, a patient with 15 points will have no pain to very mild pain (VAS 1 to 2), that occurs infrequently (several times a year), will not be in need for opioids medication and the disease will have minimal effect on the ability to work (no interfering to about 1&#x000a0;week per year of work disability). If the Izbicki pain score increases by 15 points (to 30 points) the situation of the patient will change slightly to the following: the patient will have mild pain (VAS 2.5 to 3.5), with a frequency of about once a month, necessitating weak opioids and interfering slightly with ability to work (about 1&#x000a0;week per year of work disability). Powering the trial to detect a smaller difference will increase the sample size substantially without affecting decision making, since smaller differences are likely not sufficient to change treatment choice from favouring step-up practice into favouring early surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Rationale for registration prior to randomization</title><p>In this trial, we aimed to select patients for which the two intervention arms are applicable in clinical practice. If patients can be managed satisfactory with non-opioid medication, there is no reason to seek more advanced treatment options. The low risks associated with non-opioid medication and adequate pain control do not justify a change of practice to more advanced modalities like early surgery. Progression of pain toward the need for opioid analgesics is a clear sign that pain management of a patient has become complex. We have, therefore, chosen this event as the most appropriate moment for randomization. Additionally, newly developed need for opioids is a transparent clinical event, thereby increasing the generalizability of the results to clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>The expert panel</title><p>An Expert Panel of CP specialists (gastroenterologists, surgeons, pain specialists and radiologists) will oversee the assessment of eligibility and will ensure that allocation to either treatment arm is possible prior to randomization. The expert panel consists of 18 experts (8 surgeons, 7 gastroenterologists 2 anesthesiologists and 1 radiologists). The Expert Panel is already in use within the CARE project, a nationwide prospective registration and follow-up system for CP patients. Furthermore, the Expert Panel has already proven to be valuable and highly supportive during previous trial of the Dutch Pancreatitis Study Group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Formulation of the optimal current step-up practice arm</title><p>The current step-up practice arm represents optimal current practice in the management of chronic pancreatitis in the Netherlands. It is in concordance with international guidelines and current knowledge, and represents consensus of CP specialists within the Dutch Pancreatitis Study Group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This optimal current step-up practice according to an explicit consensus protocol is considered the best alternative available for comparison to early surgery. An unstandardized control arm, leaving management decisions at the discretion of individual physicians is not preferred. From a clinical point of view it will be hard to know which treatment is compared in the trial. This will get in the way of drawing reliable conclusions and reduces the generalizability of the results.</p><p>Few published data exist about the proportion of patients that in current practice undergo surgery early in the disease. In a Dutch surgical cohort we observed that the median time between reported onset of first pain and endoscopic intervention was 16&#x000a0;months (10th - 90th percentile 2 to 56), while it took a median time of 15&#x000a0;months (10th-90th percentile 4 to 81) between first endoscopic treatment and surgical intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In the same cohort patients underwent 0 to up to 29 endoscopic interventions before surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In this trial endoscopic treatment is limited to 12&#x000a0;weeks if pain persists.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The ESCAPE is a randomized controlled multicenter trial aiming to evaluate the benefits, risks and costs of early surgical intervention in patients with chronic pancreatitis as an alternative to current step-up practice of pain medication, if needed followed by endoscopic treatment, and eventually if needed followed by surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CP: Chronic pancreatitis; CRF: Case record form; CT: Computed tomography; ERCP: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography; ESCAPE trial: Early surgery versus optimal current step-up practice for chronic pancreatitis trial; ESWL: Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy; MRCP: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; NSAID: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; SF-36: Short form 36; VAS: Visual analogue scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

The DPSG is a multi-disciplinary cooperation between 24 hospitals in the Netherlands (all 8 university medical centres in the country and 16 large teaching hospitals). Within this cooperation, all hospitals and specialties with expertise in clinical and experimental pancreatitis research are represented. Internist, gastroenterologist, surgeon and radiologists in these hospitals work together in this study group to advance the knowledge about and care for pancreatitis. The DPSG has an excellent track record in conducting multi-centre research and has in its 10&#x000a0;years of existence already conducted and/or initiated several large and demanding trials. The DPSG has already published results of three randomized controlled multicenter trials for the treatment of acute pancreatitis. Two other trials are currently ongoing.</p><p>These trials have concentrated on acute pancreatitis since this was the initial focus of the DPSG. Since 2008, the DPSG has extended its study scope to include CP. The ESCAPE trial will be, therefore, the first trial to be conducted for CP within this cooperation. Since the DPSG included all experts in the field of pancreatitis in the Netherlands, both acute and chronic, the ESCAPE trial will benefit from the effective and productive organizational infrastructure available.</p></sec><sec><title>Pre-publication history</title><p>The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/13/49/prepub">http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/13/49/prepub</ext-link></p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The ESCAPE-trial is funded by the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMW, grant number 17110216 supported by the Dutch Ministry of Health and Scientific Research), and the Dutch Digestive Diseases Foundation (grant number WO10-21, Maag Lever Darm Stichting &#x02013; MLDS).
