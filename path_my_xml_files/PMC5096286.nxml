Each physician was asked to consult ten patients for whom he or she is not the physician in charge. We used mixed methods: Quantitative outcomes included physicians&#x02019; assessments (empathy, complexity of consultation, knowledge transfer) and patients&#x02019; assessments (satisfaction, empathy, knowledge transfer). For qualitative analyses, 15 (eight in the training and seven in the control group) videotaped consultations were analyzed based on grounded theory, and separate focus groups with the physicians of both groups were conducted.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 137 patients were included. Although cluster-randomized, physicians in the two groups differed. Those in the training group were younger (33.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.9 vs. 40.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.5&#x000a0;years) and had less work experience (5.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.9 vs. 11.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.4&#x000a0;years). Patient satisfaction with the CM consultation was relatively high on a scale from 0 to 24 and was comparable in the two groups (training group: 19.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.6; control group 20.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.1). The qualitative findings showed that physicians structured majority of consultations as taught during the training. Comparing only the younger and less CM experienced physicians, those trained in CM communication felt more confident discussing CM-related topics than those without training.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A CM communication-training program might be especially beneficial for physicians with less consulting experience when communicating about CM-related issues.

The European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists has recognized CM as relevant topic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and it is increasingly integrated into cancer care as integrative medicine. Clinical practice guidelines for integrative medicine have been drawn up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although breast cancer patients wish to receive information about CM from the specialist they consult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], it is rarely a topic of patient-physician communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] with specialists being less often informed by their patients about CM use than general practitioners (GPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Reasons for not disclosing CM use include a lack of confidence in the physicians&#x02019; openness towards the topic, a lack of trust in physician&#x02019;s CM expertise, and a perception that there is insufficient time to discuss it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Consequently, patients often seek information outside the medical system with an increasing risk of interactions between herbs and anticancer therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Physicians often feel uncomfortable discussing CM-related questions and seek training on CM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Besides presenting evidence-based information on CM, guidelines highlight the importance of teaching communication skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], since effective communication can positively affect outcomes such as patient satisfaction and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although first CM-related trainings are available, a training that focusses on communicating CM and uses a blended learning approach is still missing. This study was part of a collaborative research project, Competence Network Complementary Medicine in Oncology &#x02013; KOKON, whose aim was to improve evidence-based knowledge on CM among patients and health professionals. The aim was to develop and evaluate a blended-learning training program for physicians for communicating with breast cancer patients about CM. Its feasibility and preliminary effects were evaluated by using quantitative and qualitative research methods (mixed-method approach).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>In a prospective multicenter cluster-randomized pragmatic mixed-method pilot trial we compared a group of trained physicians with an untrained group (control). The study design has been developed with a stakeholder group using Delphi methods (one meeting plus written rounds) including patient representatives, oncologists, psychologists, an expert in media science, an ethicist, GPs and CM experts. A total of eight breast cancer centers or Comprehensive Cancer Centers (CCC) with two physicians each were randomized (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Ten consultations per physician (160 patients in total) were planned. Each consultation was assessed quantitatively by physicians and patients. For the qualitative analysis 16 consultations (eight in each group) were planned to be videotaped and focus group discussions with physicians of both groups were conducted. The study followed the usual guidelines for clinical trials (Declaration of Helsinki and ICH-GCP where appropriate), was approved by the respective Ethics Committees (approval numbers see declaration section) and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02223091. The directors of the participating centers, the physicians and the patients gave written consent to participate in the study.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12885_2016_2884_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

The scale consists of 7 items with 5 response options each. (Scored from 0 to 4, range of score 0 to 28, higher values indicate better comprehensibility and higher relevance of information given during the consultation).

Continuous variables are presented as means, standard deviations, medians and in parts as ranges, categorical variables as absolute and relative frequencies. Satisfaction, empathy and information scores were each modeled in a mixed-effect regression, with intervention as a fixed effect and the physician as a random effect. These models were than extended to calculate the mean differences among the participating physicians, adjusting for age, experience and position (junior physician, specialist, senior physician). Because this is an exploratory analysis we report estimated means and 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Qualitative data collection and analysis</title><p>Video recordings were taken within the study, and their analysis was based on grounded theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Three physicians per group considered themselves inexperienced in CM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Characteristics of the consultation sessions</title><p>The content of the consultation depended on the stage of the patients&#x02019; disease. With newly diagnosed patients the focus was on informing the patients about possible CM treatment options and giving dietary and exercise recommendations. With patients during/after treatment or in the case of metastatic disease consultations targeted specific needs.</p><p>The consultations were not only used to discuss CM. The patients also used the time with a physician to address other issues (e.g. anxiety about the cancer itself, concerns regarding chemotherapy).</p><p>In the training group the KOKON consultation elements (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were applied in most of the observed consultations. By contrast, these elements were less often applied by the untrained physicians.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Focus group discussion</title><p>Five of eight physicians from each group participated.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Training group</title><p>Overall, participants felt comfortable with applying the KOKON consultation structure. They were motivated to conduct high-quality consultations and had the impression that they take more time for consultations than before the training. In particular, physicians in the early stage of their career and who had little experience with CM felt more comfortable consulting on CM and better prepared to deal with gaps in knowledge about CM evidence.</p><p>Discussants also expressed interest in further training on CM evidence and in group sessions for a literature review of CM. Some physicians suggested setting up a CM support hotline for complex cases.</p><p>Discussants observed that the topics that came up during consultation were not just related to CM; patients often had questions about their conventional therapies. Another point of discussion was the difficulty of integrating CM consultations into clinical routine due to the amount of time needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Control group</title><p>The physicians in the control group felt unprepared for the consultations. This was especially a problem for those at an early stage of their career or with no CM knowledge. To compensate for their lack of knowledge these physicians prepared themselves by searching for information on CM. However, they remained insecure during the consultation.</p><p>Physicians found it very satisfying to have a protected time to talk with their patients. Besides CM other questions concerning the disease in general were discussed.</p><p>Like their trained colleagues, physicians in the control group, especially those at an early stage of their career, talked about difficulties integrating the consultations into their daily routines.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first systematic CM communication-training program and the physicians judged it positively. The qualitative results showed that a CM communication-training program might be especially beneficial for physicians with less consulting experience when communicating about CM-related issues.</p><p>Many cancer patients wish to be informed about CM by their physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and the lack of training in the field poses a problem. The combination of various pedagogic elements as provided in our training can enhance satisfaction, learning speed and knowledge of trainees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition our curriculum was evidence and experience based.</p><p>Patients evaluated the consultation service in both groups very positively and appreciated talking about CM. The consultations provided a setting in which to discuss problems and concerns regarding their disease and treatment effects irrespective of CM.</p><p>With regard to quantitative outcomes there were no differences between the groups. Ceiling effects of the outcomes and longer consultation experience of the physicians in the control group might explain these results and more suitable outcomes should be considered in future trials.</p><p>However, the training might be especially beneficial for physicians who are young and have less CM experience. Those reported in the focus groups that they felt more secure after the training. This provides information for the ongoing discussion of which group of physicians would benefit most from such a training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Physician in the training group took more time for their consultations compared to those in the control group, most likely because the scope of the consultation was broader for the training group and those physicians gave more consideration to their patient&#x02019;s situation.</p><p>Some physicians obtained information on CM on their own in order to prepare for their consultations. Although information is available on the internet this did not help them to overcome feelings of insecurity when consulting on CM. This highlights the importance of communication skills beyond simple having facts to share in CM consultations, e.g. to understand the patient&#x02019;s individual motivation about CM treatments.</p><p>Beside organizational reasons, insecurity in conducting consultations about CM might have resulted in fewer consultations being held in the control group compared to those in the training group.</p><p>The strength of the current study was the mixed-method approach, which provided us with a broad view of the preliminary effects of CM communication training, its acceptance and its implementation into clinical routine care.</p><p>Communication skills training in oncology showed small effects for interventions lasting &#x0003c;3&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Although we tried to balance the shorter duration of the on-site skills training with blended learning elements prolonged on-site skill training might have resulted in larger effects. This was in line with the participants desire to have a longer on-site skills training, but might not be feasible for most clinicians.</p><p>The main limitation of the study is that despite cluster randomization the physicians of the control group were older and more experienced in consulting oncological patients. Especially when the number of clusters is small &#x02013; as it is the case in pilot trials &#x02013; an unequal distribution of clusters can occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Randomization at the patient level might have prevented unequal distribution, but this is not practical for a training program as an intervention, because knowledge exchange among the physicians in one hospital is highly probable, and might influence the results.</p><p>The participating physicians found it difficult to integrate the CM consultations into their daily routine as the consultations were time-intensive. Moreover, the training was directed to inform patients about CM in an independent consultation with a physician who is not in charge of the patient. A training program that focused on informing a physician&#x02019;s own patients about CM might be less time-consuming and easier to implement into daily routine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that patients appreciated consultations about CM. Young and inexperienced physicians might derive a greater benefit from training on communicating with patients about CM, because their more experienced colleagues may have gained CM knowledge independently during their career. For future studies it is important to develop appropriate outcome measures and to assure comparability of groups.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CAM</term><def><p>Complementary and alternative medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CM</term><def><p>Complementary medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>General practitioner</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Iris Bartsch for data acquisition and Katja Icke for data management as well as the stakeholders (H.
