To reduce anxiety, increase tolerance, and improve outcomes of such interventions, sedation is common practice.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Conventionally, sedative agents administered in the ICU are g-aminobutyric receptor agonists which include the benzodiazepines (usually midazolam) and propofol.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Optimum sedation is vital in striking a balance between providing pain relief and maintaining patient calm while preventing over-sedation and unnecessarily lengthy ICU stays.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Many protocols advise daily sedation interruptions to assess the level of sedative in the patient and to avoid over-sedation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Due to limitation of subjective sedation scales to assess ICU sedation, over-sedation and under sedation are the major challenges in the ICU management. To overcome this, Bispectral Index (BIS), an objective tool to assess sedation and consciousness is now being used in critical care setting.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist, has sedative, analgesic, and sympatholytic properties. Activation of the receptors in the brain and spinal cord inhibits neuronal firing, causing sedation, analgesia, hypotension, and bradycardia. In addition to reduced respiratory depression, dexmedetomidine scores over the currently used ICU sedatives such as midazolam and propofol in having analgesic properties that help reduce the opioid requirement and the associated side effects.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>In this study, we compare the efficacy and safety of the two sedative drugs that are midazolam and dexmedetomidine in patients on mechanical ventilator with the help of BIS monitoring and correlation of BIS with Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS). We also observe the effect of sedation on morbidity and mortality of the patient.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This study was conducted on 28 patients of either sex ranging from 20 to 60 years, requiring mechanical ventilation in ICU at Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow. Patients admitted to ICU requiring mechanical ventilatory support were eligible for enrolment. Exclusion criteria include transfer from outside institution, admission after resuscitation from cardiac arrest, head injury patients, impaired hearing, impaired visual acuity such as blindness, facial and eye trauma, severe hepatic derangement, renal insufficiency requiring dialysis, and patient on neuromuscular blockade.</p><p>The patients were divided into two groups of 14 patients each:</p><p>

</p><p>Written consent was obtained from every patient's relative. All the patients were examined thoroughly and relevant routine investigations such as hemoglobin, total and differential leukocyte counts, platelet count, serum creatinine, serum urea, blood urea nitrogen, serum bilirubin, serum electrolytes including sodium, potassium, and calcium were done. Arterial blood gas was done in all patients. Special investigations if required were performed accordingly. Choice of sedation and/or analgesic regimens was made at the discretion of team of intensivists, independent of the BIS score.</p><p>Injection dexmedetomidine infusion was started with a loading dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg over 10 min followed by the infusion at the rate of 0.2&#x02013;0.7 &#x003bc;g/kg/h. Dosage was adjusted to maintain a BIS score of 60&#x02013;80 or a SAS of 3 or 4 during mechanical ventilation. Injection midazolam is given as an initial intravenous bolus of 0.5&#x02013;5 mg every 1&#x02013;5 min as needed. Continuous infusion at 1&#x02013;2 mg/h, doses to be increased in increments of 1&#x02013;2 mg/h until adequate sedation is achieved as with dexmedetomidine.</p><p>After wiping the patient's forehead and temple with alcohol and drying the skin to ensure that a quality signal will be obtained, sensor placed across the patient's forehead and over the left or right temple. The BIS index displayed on the monitor as a number recorded. Continuous intravenous sedatives infusion (midazolam or dexmedetomidine) were given for the first 8 h to every patient, who had SAS score &#x02265;4; then sedatives were adjusted and on as and when required basis to achieve a score of 3 or 4 on SAS scale. Injection tramadol (intramuscular) was given to ensure adequate analgesia, it was administered to all patients according to the need, based on nurses assessment of the level of analgesia, which is as follows: (1) Denotes extreme pain, (2) severe pain, (3) moderate pain, (4) slight pain, (5) no pain. Injection tramadol was administered in response to a score of 1&#x02013;4 and was continued until the pain was considered to be adequately controlled. Simultaneous recording of the clinical sedation scale (Riker's SAS), sedative drugs, and BIS index done at every 4 h for the first 24 h, then every 8 hourly. Sedation assessment was performed before recording the BIS value to avoid bias. Time to extubation after the sedative drug had been stopped was noted and total duration of mechanical ventilation was also noted. Data were collected until patients were extubated. Hemodynamic parameters such as pulse rate (PR), blood pressure, SpO2, electrocardiogram, and temperature were also monitored. A thorough assessment of patient's condition such as chest, cardiovascular system, urine output, mental status, and PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio to see lung injury was done on daily basis.</p><p>SAS[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] was applied to see clinical sedation score which is as follows:</p><p>

Besides that, the study shows a correlation between BIS and SAS score with sedation and without sedation in both the groups.</p><p>The mean PR in both the groups was almost equal, that was 120 bpm for Group A and 124 bpm for Group B before sedation. After sedation, in Group A, heart rate reduced more than Group B. We observed bradycardia in two patients in Group A. Except for interruption of infusion, no treatment is required. No incidence of bradycardia was noticed in Group B. One patient developed atrial fibrillation in Group A. Riker <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] found dexmedetomidine-treated patients were more likely to develop bradycardia. MacLaren <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In his study, on the use of adjunctive dexmedetomidine therapy in intensive care patients found that bradycardia and hypotension were more common with the use of dexmedetomidine and out of forty patients 22 patients were extubated within 24 h of starting dexmedetomidine infusion which was earlier than other agents alone. These findings support the results of our study.</p><p>Mean arterial pressure was decreased more in Group A patients than Group B patients after the start of sedation. Two patients in the Group A had an incidence of hypotension that required drug interruption. While three patients who required ionotropic support expired during the treatment. There was no incidence of hypotension in Group B that required interruption of the drug. Four patients who required ionotropic support expired during the treatment in Group B. Martin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] concluded the same findings that hypotension and bradycardia occurred more frequently in the dexmedetomidine group and pre-operative cardiovascular conditions were not risk factors for dexmedetomidine patients.</p><p>Dasta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] had done a study on a total of 366 intubated ICU patients anticipated to require sedation for &#x0003e;24 h and concluded in his study that dexmedetomidine based sedation for ICU patients was significantly less costly than continuous infusion of midazolam. The reduction in total ICU cost was explained primarily by decreased cost of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. Riker <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] compared dexmedetomidine and midazolam in mechanically ventilated patients in his study and concluded that At comparable sedation levels, dexmedetomidine-treated patients spent less time on the ventilator, experienced less delirium, and developed less tachycardia and hypertension. The most notable adverse effect of dexmedetomidine was bradycardia. The median time of extubation was 1.9 days shorter and ICU length of stay was 1.7 days shorter in dexmedetomidine group. Siobal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in 2006, had published a pilot study using dexmedetomidine to facilitate extubation in ICU patients. They concluded that dexmedetomidine appears to maintain adequate sedation without hemodynamic instability or respiratory drive depression, and thus may facilitate extubation in agitated difficult-to-wean patients. A total of 24 trials involving 2419 critically ill patients from over 11 countries were identified and subjected to meta-analysis by Tan and Ho.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] This meta-analysis showed that significant heterogeneity existed between studies on dexmedetomidine. They concluded that dexmedetomidine reduced the length of ICU stay.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The risk of bradycardia was, however, higher when both a loading dose and high maintenance doses of dexmedetomidine were used.</p><p>In the present study, duration of mechanical ventilation in Group A was shorter by 17.79 h as compared to Group B. Mean duration of mechanical ventilation in Group A patients was 77.86 &#x000b1; 5.71 h. In this group seven patients were weaned successfully in &#x0003c;72 h, o which three patients required mechanical ventilation for &#x0003c;48 h. In contrast in Group B, mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 95.64 &#x000b1; 17.00 h and only two patients were weaned in &#x0003c;72 h. No patient was weaned in &#x0003c;48 h in Group B. There was a significant reduction (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001) in the mean duration of mechanical ventilation in Group A as compared to Group B patients. The mean time to extubation in Group A was 21 &#x000b1; 6.44 h and in Group B was 30.40 &#x000b1; 10.62. We also found that in Group A one patient was extubated in as early as 8 h after the sedation was stopped, whereas in Group B, the minimum time to extubation was 18 h. Reade <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] studied dexmedetomidine versus haloperidol in delirious, agitated, and intubated patients. They concluded that dexmedetomidine significantly shortened median time to extubation from 42.5 h to 19.9 h (<italic>P</italic> = 0.016). Dexmedetomidine also decreased length of stay from 6.5 days to 1.5 days (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004) after drug commencement. This study also supports the results of our study. Thus, the results were similar to the above studies. The difference between the two groups in our study is less compared to the previous studies, probably because of the shorter duration of sedation in our study. In some previous studies, it is documented that dexmedetomidine is an alternative to traditional sedatives and analgesics in critically ill patients. The safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine in adults likely persist beyond 24 h, without the emergence of rebound effects after discontinuation.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Ma <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] compared the reliability of BIS with SAS in assessing the depth of sedation in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. They concluded that SAS is well correlated with BIS in assessing the depth of sedation. BIS is an objective efficient tool for monitoring the depth of sedation in mechanically ventilated ICU patients, and it is more reliable than SAS especially when sedation levels reached to SAS 2&#x02013;4. In the present study, we also observed that with increasing depth of sedation, there was an increase in correlation between SAS and BIS and was independent of drug used for sedation. Turkmen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] showed that the significant correlation between Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and BIS values were found (<italic>r</italic> = 0.900, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001). Most of the previous studies had supported the results of the present study except some. Frenzel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] concluded that BIS values are correlated with only some ICU patients with the clinical assessment of sedation level.</p><p>Side effects are more common in Group A patients than Group B patients. In previous studies, it was documented that dexmedetomidine causes hypotension, bradycardia, and arrhythmia. In the present study, hypotension, bradycardia, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation were found in Group A patients while delayed awakening was found in Group B patients. In contrast, mortality was more common in Group B patients (29%) than Group A patients (21%). Although it was not statically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>Pandharipande <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] compared dexmedetomidine and lorazepam in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. They concluded that sedation with dexmedetomidine resulted in more days alive without delirium and coma. The 28 days mortality in the dexmedetomidine group was 17% versus 27% in the lorazepam group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.18). These findings support the results of our study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Both dexmedetomidine and midazolam were found to be efficacious and could achieve adequate sedation in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Sedation with dexmedetomidine resulted in quick extubation and decreased the duration of mechanical ventilation in comparison to midazolam in ICU patients.
