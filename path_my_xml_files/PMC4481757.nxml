The teachers evaluated the students performing spinal block. The performance was rated for procedural and interpersonal skills (direct observation of procedural skills [DOPS] and Smith and Kendall Behavioural scale [SKBS] respectively).

It is necessary for taking a history, explaining the diagnosis, giving instructions regarding medicines or obtaining consent for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. It helps to counsel to relieve symptoms and motivate to participate in the therapy.</p><p>A good doctor must have an empathetic attitude towards patients. Empathy indicates one person's appreciation, understanding and acceptance to someone else's emotions. Tavakol <italic>et al.</italic> have explored medical students&#x02019; understanding of empathy, emphasising its importance in modern patient-centered care. Their report hints that negative influence student and doctor communication hinders empathetic engagement.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Empathy has been described as the foundation of patient &#x02013; physician relationship by Hojat <italic>et al.</italic> Lack of empathy is associated with suboptimal patient care behaviours and more recently as important clinical outcomes such as blood glucose and lipid control in diabetic patients.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Smith and Mishra stated that in any doctor-patient encounter, fact - finding and information gathering is the agenda of a doctor, whereas exploring hopes and fears rather than precisely giving information about symptoms is seen on the part of the patient. Communication should not be a mere exchange of words; in anaesthesia teams, it should be directed towards co-ordinated and safe progress of the patient into anaesthesia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Communications by the anaesthetist can elicit subconscious patient responses in mood resulting in anxiolysis and analgesia. Cognitive reframing is a recognised, relevant pain reduction strategy. For example, calling the sensation of a local anaesthetic injection &#x02018;a numbing sensation&#x02019; rather than &#x02018;a sting&#x02019; may result in quite different perceptions.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Pain being an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage; therefore a nocebo or negative suggestion will elicit a subconscious change that might be expected to adversely affect the post-operative experience.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study was carried out in anaesthesia department, from January to May 2014. All residents and faculty members were involved. Totally 20 residents were evaluated by 10 lecturers while performing spinal anaesthesia. Senior faculty members were involved in training and teaching as follows: Lectures were taken to create a background that patients are fearful about anaesthesia. Students were informed about their involvement in patient interaction and the need for effective communication. Students were explained the pathophysiology of pain and the need to adopt the practice of sympathetic listening to alleviate patients&#x02019; anxiety about anaesthesia and surgery. Need for attitudinal change to impart the understanding about behavioural modification in future practice was taught.</p><p>Students were informed about the questionnaires [Annexures <xref ref-type="app" rid="APP1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="APP2">2</xref>] that they will be required to ask to the patients. Department faculty was provided with checklists [Annexures <xref ref-type="app" rid="APP3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="APP4">4</xref>] with scores. They were also informed to rate the students in behaviourally anchored scale.</p><p>Students were randomly evaluated by teachers. Students were not aware as to which teacher is evaluating his/her performance at the time of giving spinal anaesthesia. The teachers were blinded about the type of questionnaire that the student will receive post-operatively.</p><p>Pre-operatively all students informed the patients about the proposed conduct of spinal anaesthesia in a sympathetic manner. Post-operatively they were randomly given the questionnaires to allocate them into group <italic>P</italic> or group C [Annexures <xref ref-type="app" rid="APP1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="APP2">2</xref>]. The interview questions in group <italic>P</italic> (pain) mainly focused the attention of patients on the surgical pain and those of group C (comfort) mainly diverted their attention from the pain. The effect of students&#x02019; communication skill of alleviating patients&#x02019; anxiety about pain was to be tested.</p><p>Patients were also evaluated by the teachers at regular intervals. Analgesic doses required post-operatively were recorded. Students performed spinal anaesthesia under direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS) and their performance was assessed [Annexure <xref ref-type="app" rid="APP3">3</xref>]. The extent of patient cooperation and skill of communication acquired was judged using Smith and Kendall behaviourally anchored scale (SKBS). Student performance was measured using a 10-point scale [Annexure <xref ref-type="app" rid="APP4">4</xref>].[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Data was analyzed using Chi-square test to find association between group <italic>P</italic> and group C with respect to Questions-1, 2, pain on movement, pain at rest and botheration due to wound. Mann &#x02013; Whitney test was used to find significant differences between groups P and C with Median VAS and Median VNRS. Two independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test was used to find the significant difference between the study groups for Mean DOPS and SKBS scores.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Totally 20 residents were evaluated by 10 teachers while performing spinal anaesthesia. Communication skills and professional attitudes, as well as procedural skills, were taught to these students before they were subjected to this evaluation. The responses to the questionnaires that were given to the students for a patient interview in the post-operative period were collected. The checklists that the teachers were given to judge the students&#x02019; performance were also collected.</p><p>Patients undergoing elective lower segment caesarean section (LSCS) were included. Those with complications like pregnancy induced hypertension, coagulation disorders, placenta previa, heart disease and multiple pregnancies were excluded. Totally 100 patients were studied with the indications for LSCS being: Previous LSCS-24, previous 2 LSCS-11, oligohydramnios-10, post-dated pregnancy-7, cephalo-pelvic disproportion-18, intrauterine growth restriction-17, failure of induction-5 and breech presentation-8.</p><p>The questions that were asked to patients in each group were comparable as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows questions with results in both groups.

Largely fragmented and static curricula are likely to produce ill-equipped graduates if complete redesigning is not undertaken. The core of the system is the encounter between people who need services and those who have been entrusted to deliver them. Education of committed health workers empowers the health of citizens. The essence of empathetic work is service orientation steered by social accountability.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The Charter of Medical Professionalism states that, to focus on &#x02018;primacy of patient welfare&#x02019;, doctor self-care is necessary for the doctors to meet the professional obligations expected of them. Empathy can be threatened by doctor's distress, which is seen at all levels of medical training.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Clinical teaching brings together the learning triad of patient, student and clinician/teacher in a particular clinical environment. All three components are useful to provide effective student learning. Direct contact with patients is important for the development of clinical reasoning, communication skills, professional attitudes and empathy [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Annexure Diagram 1</xref>].[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>It is generally observed that patients do not know about anaesthesia-related procedures and are anxious about surgery resulting in an overall excessively painful post-operative experience. Use of negative valence words like &#x02018;injection&#x02019;, &#x02018;prick&#x02019;, and &#x02018;pain&#x02019;, modulate the neurobiology towards more excruciating post-operative pain. Overall goal of our study was to teach the learning anaesthesiologists to communicate effectively with the patients. The aim was to teach them to build a rapport with patients, so as to assure them a smooth intra and less painful post-operative course.</p><p>The teaching was expected to be effective enough to obtain a calm and cooperative patient for spinal anaesthesia on table. The positive modulation of the neurobiology of patients was tested post-operatively by asking them both positively as well as negatively valenced questions. The questionnaires were either oriented towards pain (pain group) or towards comfort (comfort group). The questions in both groups were serially comparable, and the responses obtained were statistically correlated [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>].</p><p>The professionalism and attitudinal skills of the students were tested by different teachers on different occasions. The tools applied to do so were: DOPS and SKBS. Mean value of DOPS score obtained by 11 students in P-group was found to be 3.98 (&#x000b1;0.62) on a 5-point scale; that of 9 students in C-group was 4.13 (&#x000b1;0.56). <italic>P</italic> value of two independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test was 0.567 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05 = not significant). This indicated that students allocated to P-group performed spinal anaesthesia equally effectively as those allocated to C-group. Thus, the professional skills were comparable in two groups.</p><p>Comparing the attitudinal and behavioural skills using SKBS score, <italic>P</italic> - 0.867 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05 = not significant). Mean value of SKBS score on a 10 point scale, of 11 students of P-group was 7.23 (&#x000b1;1.27) and that of 9 students of C-group was 7.31 (&#x000b1;0.95). This indicated that there was no significant difference between behavioural skills of students allocated to two groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p><p>In a similar study, Chooi <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] randomized 300 post-LSCS patients into pain and comfort groups. Patients were interviewed using standard questionnaires by two midwives before evaluation by doctors, post-anaesthesia. The midwives were aware about the group to which a patient was allocated, but the patients had no idea of any such intervention. Written informed patient consent to take part in the study was obtained after the questioning was completed. Post-operative pain management was given to all patients as per usual protocol. According to authors, though different questionnaires were employed both ultimately focused patients&#x02019; attention towards pain. Ethical challenge was possible as consent was taken after being questioned.</p><p>They expressed a need of phrasing post-operative questions more accurately and improving internal validity in terms of randomisation and allocation concealment to minimise bias. They reported that 75.7% of patients in pain group had pain and 79.4% patients in comfort group were comfortable. In our study, 54% patients in group P had pain and 80% patients in group C were comfortable. 60% patients in group P had no botheration due to wound compared to 72% in group C. However, this number was not statistically significantly higher in group C compared to group P. Thus, in our study 28% patients in group C and 40% patients in group P were bothered because of wound, whereas Chooi <italic>et al.</italic> reported 15.1% in comfort and 55% in pain groups.</p><p>Thus, as a result of communication skill training given to students, they could improve the intra and post-operative patient satisfaction significantly. The pre-operative visit helped to improve patients&#x02019; psychology to undergo anaesthesia procedures and surgery as has been judged by DOPS and SKBS tool by teachers while assessing the students.</p><p>Effective communication between doctor and patient has been stated the core of clinical requirement for the medical profession.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Multi-disciplinary assessment of students&#x02019; clinical performance using Amsterdam Attitude and Communication scale (AACS) has been made precise by De Haes <italic>et al.</italic> The goal of their study was to enhance students&#x02019; awareness about the relevance of learning behavioural skills in the earlier stages of their medical training.</p><p>Four hundred and forty-two 5<sup>th</sup> year clinical students were judged 6 times in two settings by doctors and nurses and video-taped interviews judged by psychologists and doctors. Overall mean of the clinical performance was 3.96 &#x000b1; 0.55; judgments of behaviour in the clinic were more precise standard error ranging from 0.11 to 0.16. In conclusion, the authors have recommended the use of AACS and the like instruments in other medical schools also for their summative assessments to be more feasible and useful.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Comparison of the analgesic requirement in our study shows group C patients more comfortable than group P. Dauphinee described the outcome of current education policies in health professions. He referred to the need of a common framework to find out the impact of education programs at advance levels of training. He suggested studying patient outcomes like improved survival, fewer complications and fewer side-effects from the hospital records and patient feedbacks about the quality of life reported after the treatment from patient records.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Students in both groups effectively communicated with patients pre-operatively. The pre-operative visit helped to improve patients&#x02019; psychology to undergo anaesthesia procedures. Though post-operative questions were oriented towards either pain or comfort, number of patients without pain was found to be more in C-group than in P-group. Pain on movement was found to be more in P-group. Pain at rest and botheration due to wound was found to be comparable with less requirement of analgesics in C-group. We, therefore, conclude that the pain mechanism was effectively modulated pre-operatively with the soothing pre-operative dialogue.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="APP1"><title>Annexure 1: Questionnaire for group P</title><p>Group P (pain) contains standard questions.
