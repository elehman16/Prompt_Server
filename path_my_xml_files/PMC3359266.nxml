The most prevalent health problems (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes...) are for the most part related to life habits. We propose a holistic and integral approach as the best option for tackling behavior and its determinants. The research team has elaborated the necessary educational material to realize group teaching, which we call "Health Workshops". The goal of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of these Health Workshops in the following terms: Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL), incorporate and maintain a balanced diet, do physical activity regularly, maintain risk factors such as tension, weight, cholesterol within normal limits and diminish cardiovascular risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Controlled and random clinical testing, comparing a group of persons who have participated in the Health Workshops with a control group of similar characteristics who have not participated in the Health Workshops.</p><p>Field of study: the research is being done in Health Centers of the city of Barcelona, Spain.</p><p>Population studied: The group is composed of 108 persons that are actually doing the Health Workshops, and 108 that are not and form the control group. They are assigned at random to one group or the other.</p><p>Data Analysis: With Student's t-distribution test to compare the differences between numerical variables or their non parametric equivalent if the variable does not comply with the criteria of normality. (Kolmogorov-Smirnof test). Chi-square test to compare the differences between categorical variables and the Logistic Regression Model to analyze different meaningful variables by dichotomous analysis related to the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The Health Workshop proposed in the present study constitutes an innovative approach in health promotion, placing the emphasis on the person's self responsibility for his/her own health.</p><p>The rhythm of a weekly session during 8 weeks with recommended activities to put into practice, as well as the support of the group is an opportunity to incorporate healthy habits and make a commitment to self-care. The sheets handed out are a Health Manual that can always be consulted after the workshop ends.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinical Trials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01440738">NCT01440738</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The promotion of health and the interventions in community health continue to be one of the pending subjects of our health system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The most common health problems (heart disease, cancer, diabetes...) are related in a large amount to behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The estimates are that 35% of cancers are diet related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The increase of physical activity produces a reduction in the risk of chronic illnesses, like cardiovascular ones, arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, all of them associated to a sedentary life style [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Also, regular physical exercise helps improve mild depressions and anxieties. Some studies have objected that interventions to improve behavior or habits by changing them to healthier ones have resulted in short lived improvements[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In a systematic revision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] in diabetes mellitus patients, they have found evidence that group education has had a positive effect for a better metabolic control, the decrease of arterial pressure and overweight, the increase of self control, the quality of life, the development of self care abilities as well as satisfaction with the treatment received, and permits verification of the effectiveness of groups in the incorporation of healthy habits, but that these positive changes do not continue after a time, once the group activity has finished. To continue with this revision and on reflection of the possible reasons of why these positive changes do not continue after a time we find that these studies about health promotion usually deal with specific aspects (physical activity, diet...) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] but do not include other aspects that have influence in behavior and health and well-being.</p><p>The biomedical system has a relevant role when approaching ailments in our western society. In spite of the fact that the research team also forms part of the same biomedical system which tends to fraction and specialize, our proposal is centered on a holistic and integrating approach as the best way to tackle health behaviors and its determinants. The proposal is based on Virginia Henderson's model of the concept of nursing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]; this model has resulted useful in individual caring, and our hypothesis is that this holistic focusing is equally useful to guide other actions of health promotion, as it contemplates the person as a whole giving importance to physical aspects as well as psychical, emotional, cultural and spiritual ones.</p><p>Henderson defines the person as whole that has 14 basic activities or requisites to be satisfied in order to maintain a person's health and well being, and develop all his/her capacities. These 14 components are:</p><p>Breathe normally, Eat and Drink Adequately, Eliminate Body Waste, Maintain Desirable Positions, Sleep and Rest, Wear Suitable Clothes, Maintain Body Temperature by adjusting clothes and modifying environment, Keep the Body clean and well-groomed, Avoid Dangers and Injuring Others, Communicate with others, express emotions, needs and fears, Worship according to one's faith, Work to have a sense of Accomplishment, Play and Participate in various forms of Recreation, Learn, discover and Satisfy Curiosity. According to this model, everybody is capable of carrying out these basic activities by themselves, and if they don't, it is because of lack of the knowledge, will, or strength to do so.</p><p>In the year 2008 the research team developed the necessary educational material to carry out group education which we named "HEALTH WORKSHOPS" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] addressed to the general public. The workshops consist of 8 sessions with weekly cadence and gather those 14 components described by Henderson. In the different sessions we incorporate tools in order to help integrate healthy habits to daily life and improve the quality of living perceived and have a direct relation to their prevalent health problems. Also these healthy habits are contained in health system plans of all the Autonomous Communities in Spain, and are recommended in the Program of Health Prevention and Health Promotion Activities. (PAPPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]</p><p>In spite of not being standard, the measurements of Heath Related Quality of Life (HRQOL), have proved valid and reliable in evaluating health results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Clinical personnel and managers have recognized the importance of measuring the HRQOL as useful in informing about the most effective patient handling and in decision making in matters of health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These measurements include health profiles in which the general questionnaire of Medical Outcomes Study 36 item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) stands out, containing 36 items that cover two areas, the functional state (4 physical dimensions) and the emotional well-being (4 mental dimensions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Furthermore this questionnaire has normative population values for the Spanish population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] for which reason we consider using it as the main variable in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Hyphotesis</title><p>The Group Intervention of Health Promotion that this study proposes (which contemplates in an integral way biological, physiological, social, cultural and spiritual aspects of the person related to health and well-being), improves the quality of life related to health (HRQOL) and facilitates the incorporation and keeping of healthy habits.</p><sec><title>Objectives</title><sec><title>Principal objective</title><p>Assess the effectiveness of the Health Workshops, in terms of HRQOL measured by the SF-36 Questionnaire.</p><p>Secondary objectives:</p><p>1.)
