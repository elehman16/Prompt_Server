In addition, intensive pharmacological treatment of risk factors can reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, these benefits depend on people with diabetes taking their medication as prescribed, eating a healthy diet, being physically active on a regular basis and avoiding smoking.</p><p>There is some evidence that patient education, training patients in self-management and using interventions incorporating well-specified behaviour change techniques can be effective, at least in the short term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, only a minority of people with type 2 diabetes in the UK have attended a structured education programme to assist with behaviour change, and where attendance has occurred the effectiveness of the programme in practice is largely uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The Early Activity In Diabetes (Early ACTID: ISRCTN92162869) and Action for Health Diabetes (Look-AHEAD: NCT00017953) trials have demonstrated beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors of adding intensive lifestyle interventions to the primary care of diabetes patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These studies were selective in their behavioural focus. Many previous studies have been conducted in research clinics or specialist settings and have not clearly characterised the comparison condition. Behavioural interventions and their hypothesised mechanisms of action are rarely clearly specified and the delivery of the intervention is not often assessed. Most trials have relied on self-reported measures of behaviour, which are imprecise and subject to recall bias, and do not assess adherence to medication. This limits evaluation of the effects of behavioural interventions independent of organisational and pharmacological components, and cannot inform subsequent integration of the most effective components into routine practice.</p><p>We aimed to address these uncertainties in the Anglo&#x02013;Danish&#x02013;Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment in People with Screen Detected Diabetes in Primary Care-Plus (ADDITION-Plus) trial by evaluating the effect of a theory-based behaviour change intervention delivered by trained and quality-assured lifestyle facilitators, external to the primary care team, on objectively measured health behaviours (physical activity, diet change, medication adherence and smoking) among people with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes receiving intensive general practice care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The study design and rationale have been reported previously (2002&#x02013;2007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Patients were recruited from 34 general practices in the East of England. The majority of practices (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;26) were participating in the intensive treatment arm of the ADDITION-Cambridge trial of treatment of people with diabetes detected by screening (ISRCTN86769081) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A further eight practices were recruited to increase the participation of recently clinically diagnosed patients (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Eligibility criteria were initially assessed by general practice staff and included age 40&#x02013;69&#x000a0;years with type 2 diabetes following screening in the ADDITION study or clinical diagnosis during the previous 3&#x000a0;years. Exclusion criteria included patients who had a psychotic illness or an illness with a likely prognosis of &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;year and women who were pregnant or lactating. Of 425 eligible screen-detected patients and 684 patients clinically diagnosed within the previous 3&#x000a0;years, 239 from each group agreed to be individually randomised to receive intensive treatment alone (comparison group) or in conjunction with a facilitator-led behaviour change intervention (intervention group).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study design and participant flow in the ADDITION-Plus trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="125_2014_3236_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Randomisation was central using a partial minimisation procedure to balance stratifiers (age, sex and general practice; and within screen-detected and clinically diagnosed subgroups: BMI, self-reported smoking and medication adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]) between the arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

In brief, the intervention was delivered by three female trained lifestyle facilitators, who were not part of the general practice team. The facilitators used detailed protocols to guide each contact with the participant and received ongoing supervision and feedback from a clinical psychologist. The behaviours targeted in the intervention were physical activity, dietary intake, medication adherence and smoking cessation. Facilitators taught patients a range of self-regulatory skills to achieve behaviour change and maintenance over time, supported by a manual describing the skills. The intervention was delivered over 1&#x000a0;year at the participants&#x02019; surgeries and included a 1&#x000a0;h introductory meeting followed by six 30&#x000a0;min meetings and four brief phone calls.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Measurements and endpoints</title><p>Baseline and 1&#x000a0;year measurements were undertaken at outpatient clinical research facilities by trained staff following standard operating procedures.

Where non-normality could not be resolved by log-transformation, 95% CIs were estimated using semi-parametric bias corrected and accelerated bootstrap regression with 1,999 resamples. We conducted a per protocol analysis of each primary outcome, in which the per protocol population comprised comparison-arm participants and those intervention-arm participants who attended the introductory and initial three core-intervention sessions.

Rubin&#x02019;s multiple imputation method with 30 multiple imputation datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] was used together with two contrasting scenarios for the intervention effect in excluded participants. The first optimistically assumed that excluded participants achieved the same full intervention effect as observed in participants with the outcome data, and the second pessimistically assumed that no intervention effect was achieved.

Intervention group participants reported feeling confident in using the skills they had been taught (mean [SD] score 7.9 [1.7] on a scale of 0 to 10). Self-reported use of skills to increase physical activity and to eat a lower-fat diet was relatively high, ranging from 62% of participants who reported using prompts or reminders to 88% who reported setting achievable goals. Fewer participants reported using these skills to enhance medication adherence, ranging from 50% who reported that they had prepared for setbacks to 68% setting achievable goals. Skills use was lowest among those participants who were trying to stop smoking, with 26% recording or monitoring their progress and 45% reporting that they had set achievable goals. Intervention participants rated their facilitators highly with a mean response of 44 (SD 6.5, on a scale of 10&#x02013;50).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Per protocol, subgroup and sensitivity analyses</title><p>Per protocol analyses of the primary outcome data replicated our main results, except for the plasma vitamin C level for which the increase over 12&#x000a0;months was slightly greater in the comparison than in the intervention group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04). Our conclusions were unaffected by the sensitivity analysis for missing data. Similarly, there was no evidence that intervention effects on the primary outcomes differed between participants with screen-detected and recently diagnosed diabetes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>For patients with recently diagnosed diabetes offered intensive treatment in primary care the additional input of a facilitator from outside the practice delivering a theory-based multi-behaviour intervention was not associated with significant improvements in objectively measured health behaviours. There was no difference between trial groups in change from baseline to 1&#x000a0;year in cardiovascular risk factors or self-reported health behaviours. The intervention group reported higher levels of SF-36 physical functioning as well as SF-36 change in health status, health utility and satisfaction with diabetes services at 1&#x000a0;year, and greater changes in diet and activity over the year compared with the comparison group. However, there was no intervention effect on the remaining SF-36 measures, state anxiety, diabetes-specific and general well-being, diabetes-related quality of life, diabetes treatment satisfaction or relational empathy. We found no evidence to support this external behavioural facilitator model of care where the primary care team delivers a well-organised and intensive treatment service.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The study was carried out in primary care settings where most of the care of individuals with recently diagnosed diabetes takes place in the UK. General practice registers typically cover 99% of all residents living in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and nearly half of the practices approached agreed to take part. Generalisability to more deprived settings with greater ethnic diversity may be limited in light of the non-random recruitment of general practices from a single geographical region.</p><p>Internal validity was strong; participants were individually randomised and groups were well matched for baseline characteristics. Participant retention at 1&#x000a0;year was similarly high in both trial groups. We used objective measurement of four key behaviours affecting CVD risk, as well as measuring self-reported behaviour, functional status and well-being. The apparent effect on self-reported change in behaviours over time highlights the need for caution in interpreting the results of trials of behavioural interventions that rely on subjective measures. Clinically important outcomes were measured using standardised equipment and protocols, with trained staff unaware of study group allocation.</p><p>The intervention was based on theory and evidence from psychology to support change in behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and included a patient-centred approach to facilitating behaviour change, which has been shown to be more effective than didactic interventions in improving CVD risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Quality-assured delivery was enabled by training, ongoing supervision and protocols. The carefully characterised intervention and the objective measurement of health behaviours allowed us to isolate potential effects of the behavioural intervention from other aspects of intensive general practice care.</p><p>Plasma drug and cotinine levels were available only for a subset of participants and the timing of blood samples following ingestion of tablets and other factors affecting plasma drug levels were not standardised, which will have reduced the precision of estimates. However, these issues did not differ by study group and while the measure of adherence was less precise, it was less prone to bias than self-report measures. Objective measures of physical activity, smoking and medication adherence at baseline would have improved precision and enabled us to assess change over time. However, such detailed measurement might increase the salience and influence the behaviour of participants in both groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This is likely to be more relevant to physical activity than to the other health behaviours assessed via blood samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Understanding the results</title><p>There may have been limited scope for additional benefit among ADDITION-Plus patients, who were already receiving intensive treatment, including theory-based educational materials and lifestyle advice on all the target behaviours by the primary care team. In addition, there were improvements from baseline in plasma vitamin C levels, self-reported diet and physical activity and cardiovascular risk factors in both study groups, further limiting potential change. The absence of an intervention effect on health behaviours was unlikely to be due to failure to deliver the programme. Attendance at intervention sessions, self-reported use of skills to improve lifestyle behaviours and levels of satisfaction with the programme were all high. Facilitators met monthly to discuss intervention delivery and listened to tape recordings of their sessions. They also received ongoing supervision and support from a clinical psychologist. The intervention was associated with stronger intentions to change physical activity and medication adherence at follow-up. We targeted mediators of behaviour change and included behaviour change techniques from a range of theories. However, the evidence that any of the commonly used theories predict changes in objectively assessed health behaviours is limited. Behaviour change might be enhanced by focusing on fewer behaviours and being more directive in selecting which ones to focus on. Targeting dietary change and physical activity sequentially might be less effective than targeting them simultaneously, but more evidence is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Increasing the intensity of the training or of intervention delivery could have enhanced the opportunity to change behaviour, but may not be feasible in routine practice. Facilitator-led care focusing on behaviour change might add value in settings where primary care based intensive treatment is not feasible or effective.</p><p>We recorded moderate effects of the intervention on measures of self-reported health status, health utility and physical function. These positive effects occurred independently of any change in objectively measured health behaviours, suggesting a mechanism independent of behaviour change. Other trials have also shown that interventions can improve patient-reported outcomes such as well-being but not behaviour or clinical endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. It is not clear whether the improvements were related to the supportive alliances formed with lifestyle facilitators or whether the effect was mediated by a feeling of false reassurance from participating in the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Regardless of the mechanism, self-reported health is an independent predictor of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. These improvements warrant further examination, particularly if they persist over the long term when intervention support is withdrawn and can be achieved with a less intensive intervention. Five-year follow-up of the trial cohort is planned.</p><p>Recent attempts to promote behaviour change in individuals soon after the diagnosis of diabetes have had mixed effects. In the Diabetes Education and Self-Management for Ongoing and Newly Diagnosed Diabetes (DESMOND) trial (ISRCTN17844016), 824 newly diagnosed patients were cluster randomised to receive either a 6&#x000a0;h structured group-education programme focused on behaviour change or usual care (comparison group) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The DESMOND trial participants had a mean age of 60&#x000a0;years, included more men than women (55%), had a mean BMI of approximately 32&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and were, therefore, broadly similar to ADDITION-Plus participants. The intervention was based on similar theories of learning used in the ADDITION-Plus trial and focused on lifestyle factors such as food choice and physical activity. Compared with the control group, the intervention group achieved greater improvements in weight loss and smoking cessation and positive improvements in belief about illness, but no difference in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels after 1&#x000a0;year. Self-reported physical activity levels were higher in the intervention than in the comparison group at all time points, but were not significantly different at 1&#x000a0;year. There was no objective measurement of behaviour change in this trial cohort and it was difficult to elucidate exactly which components of the intervention were associated with the observed improvements. Further, the DESMOND control group was different from our comparison group, where individuals were already receiving intensive treatment for diabetes.</p><p>In the Early ACTID trial, 593 recently diagnosed patients with a mean age of 60&#x000a0;years were randomised to receive usual care (control group), an intensive diet intervention (6.5&#x000a0;h of individual counselling by a dietitian/nurse over 1&#x000a0;year) or an intensive diet intervention plus a pedometer-based activity programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. After 12&#x000a0;months, there were significant improvements in glycaemic control, insulin resistance and body weight in both intervention groups compared with the control group; however, the addition of the activity intervention conferred no extra benefit. Accelerometry data indicated that individuals in the diet and activity group increased their physical activity significantly more than those in the other two groups. However, the lack of measurement of dietary change or any other health behaviour again makes it difficult to explain the beneficial effects observed in this trial. Other studies examining behavioural change in type 2 diabetes patients tend to be small, of shorter duration and to focus on individuals later in the disease trajectory. No published trial to date captures objective measurement of four key health behaviours in recently diagnosed patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A facilitator-led, individually tailored multiple behaviour change intervention over 1&#x000a0;year did not improve objectively measured health behaviours or cardiovascular risk factors among people with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes receiving intensive treatment in UK primary care. Effects on self-reported changes in diet and physical activity were not confirmed by objective data, highlighting the need for caution in interpreting trials of behavioural interventions that rely on subjective measures. Enabling primary care teams to deliver a well-organised intensive treatment service to newly diagnosed patients should remain a priority for policymakers and commissioners.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec21"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="125_2014_3236_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><label>ESM</label><caption><p>(PDF 88&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>ADDITION</term><def><p>Anglo&#x02013;Danish&#x02013;Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment in People with Screen Detected Diabetes in Primary Care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CARE</term><def><p>Consultation and Relational Empathy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVD</term><def><p>Cardiovascular disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DESMOND</term><def><p>Diabetes Education and Self-Management for Ongoing and Newly Diagnosed Diabetes</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Early ACTID</term><def><p>Early Activity in Diabetes</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D</term><def><p>EuroQol 5-D</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Look-AHEAD</term><def><p>Action for Health Diabetes</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MARS</term><def><p>Medication Adherence Report Schedule</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAEE</term><def><p>Physical activity energy expenditure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-36</term><def><p>Short-Form 36</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TPB</term><def><p>Theory of planned behaviour</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UKPDS</term><def><p>UK Prospective Diabetes Study</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to all participants, lifestyle facilitators, practice nurses and family physicians for taking part in the ADDITION-Plus trial: Arbury Road Surgery, Ashwell Surgery, Birchwood Surgery, Bottisham Medical Practice, Brookfields/Cherry Hinton, Buckden Surgery, Clarkson Surgery, Cornerstone Practice, Cornford House Surgery, Cottenham Surgery, Dr Eaton &#x00026; Partners (Saffron Walden), George Clare Surgery, Great Staughton Surgery, Haddenham Surgery, Hilton House Surgery, Lensfield Road Surgery, Manea Surgery, Milton Surgery, New Roysia Surgery, Orchard House Surgery, Orton Medical Practice, Parkhall Road Surgery, Park Medical Centre, Petersfield Medical Practice, Riverside Practice, Rookery Medical Centre, Rosalind Franklin House, South Street Surgery, St Mary&#x02019;s Surgery, Thaxted Surgery, The Old Exchange, The Spinney Surgery, The Surgery (Over) and Woolpit Surgery.
