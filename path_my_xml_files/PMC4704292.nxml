Unfortunately, in many physical education lessons students do not engage in sufficient MVPA to achieve health benefits. In this trial we will test the efficacy of a teacher professional development intervention, delivered partially via the Internet, on secondary school students&#x02019; MVPA during physical education lessons. Teaching strategies covered in this training are designed to (i) maximize opportunities for students to be physically active during lessons and (ii) enhance students&#x02019; autonomous motivation towards physical activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p id="Par2">A two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial with allocation at the school level (intervention vs. usual care control). Teachers and Year 8 students in government-funded secondary schools in low socio-economic areas of the Western Sydney region of Australia will be eligible to participate. During the main portion of the intervention (6 months), teachers will participate in two workshops and complete two implementation tasks at their school. Implementation tasks will involve video-based self-reflection via the project&#x02019;s Web 2.0 platform and an individualized feedback meeting with a project mentor. Each intervention school will also complete two group peer-mentoring sessions at their school (one per term) in which they will discuss implementation with members of their school physical education staff. In the booster period (3&#x000a0;months), teachers will complete a half-day workshop at their school, plus one online implementation task, and a group mentoring session at their school. Throughout the entire intervention period (main intervention plus booster period), teachers will have access to online resources. Data collection will include baseline, post-intervention (7&#x02013;8 months after baseline) and maintenance phase (14&#x02013;15 months after baseline) assessments. Research assistants blinded to group allocation will collect all data. The primary outcome will be the proportion of physical education lesson time that students spend in MVPA. Secondary outcomes will include leisure-time physical activity, subjective well-being, and motivation towards physical activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The provision of an online training platform for teachers could help facilitate more widespread dissemination of evidence-based interventions compared with programs that rely exclusively on face-to-face training.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry-<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=365660">ACTRN12614000184673</ext-link>.

They provide access to the majority of the population and have the facilities, trained personnel and curriculum to address public health objectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Physical education (PE) is the primary vehicle responsible for physical activity promotion in schools and has the potential to provide students with regular opportunities to be physically active. Unfortunately, in many of these lessons students do not engage in sufficient moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) to achieve health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In this trial we will test the effect of a PE teacher professional development intervention, delivered partially via the Internet, on students&#x02019; MVPA during PE lessons. Known as the Activity and Motivation in Physical Education (AMPED) Project, this intervention is also designed to enhance students&#x02019; motivation to be physically active during PE lessons and their leisure-time (i.e., outside school hours). If MVPA during PE and leisure time can be increased, youth can be expected to realize a variety of benefits, including enhanced self-concept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], better quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], greater engagement at school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], better academic results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and improved physical health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview of previous research</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Focusing on lesson structure to improve PE lessons provides opportunities for MVPA</title><p id="Par16">Numerous studies have assessed the effect of interventions designed to increase MVPA during PE lessons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These investigations have included large trials in the United States focused on improving PE teachers&#x02019; lesson planning and delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For example, the Middle School Physical Activity and Nutrition intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] created teacher awareness, helped teachers to design and implement active PE lessons, and developed teachers&#x02019; class management skills. Previous interventions focusing on lesson planning and delivery have successfully increased the proportion of time students spent in MVPA during PE lessons. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] found a pooled effect of <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.6 when comparing the physical activity levels of intervention versus control students. This difference was equivalent to approximately 24&#x000a0;% more MVPA during PE lessons.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Student motivation towards PE is associated with MVPA during lessons</title><p id="Par17">Epidemiological evidence suggests that the largest decrease in youth physical activity occurs during early adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This trend parallels age-related declines in adaptive motivation for school and PE, in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Few interventions have been specifically designed to motivate students to take advantage of opportunities for MVPA during PE lessons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This omission ignores the evidence that student motivation is an important correlate and likely determinant of MVPA during PE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For example, Lonsdale and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] showed that students motivated by autonomous factors (e.g., intrinsic motivation) were 20&#x000a0;% more active than students in the same lessons who were motivated by external factors (e.g., pressure from others). Similarly, Jaakkola and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] found that students&#x02019; autonomous motivation was a significant correlate of objectively-measured MVPA during PE lessons.</p><p id="Par18">PE teachers can play an important role in motivating children to be actively involved in lessons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that PE teachers can be trained to motivate their students more effectively and that these interventions have a positive influence on students&#x02019; motivation towards PE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The influence of these interventions on students&#x02019; MVPA during PE lessons, however, has received little attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Student motivation towards PE is associated with leisure-time physical activity motivation and behavior</title><p id="Par19">Student motivation towards PE lessons is positively associated with leisure-time MVPA motivation and self-reported PA outside school hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, interventions with PE teachers that enhance students&#x02019; motivation towards PE, also produce increases in leisure-time physical activity intentions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and self-reported leisure-time MVPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. There is no evidence, however, regarding the effect of interventions designed to enhance students&#x02019; motivation towards PE on objectively-measured PA outside lesson time. Given the general tendency for young people to over-report their MVPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and the evidence that associations between self-reported and objectively-measured MVPA can be poor among youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], there is a need to examine intervention effectiveness using objective MVPA measures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Theoretical framework for the current study</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Self-determination theory</title><p id="Par20">Self-Determination Theory (SDT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] has been widely applied to a variety of life contexts, including education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] sport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and PE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. According to SDT tenets, social-contextual factors (e.g., teachers&#x02019; behavior towards students) can affect individuals&#x02019; (e.g. students&#x02019;) motivation by satisfying three key psychological needs: (ii) autonomy, the sense that one is acting in a self-directed manner; (ii) competence, the belief that one can interact effectively with one&#x02019;s environment; and (iii) relatedness, perceptions of connectedness with significant others.</p><p id="Par21">SDT also outlines two broad dimensions of motivation. Controlled motivation exists when students participate because they feel external pressure (e.g., from a teacher) or internal pressure (e.g., guilt) to participate. In contrast, students who have autonomous motivation towards PE participate because of the enjoyment or interest inherent in lessons, or because they value the outcomes of PE participation. In the context of PE, there is evidence that when teachers use motivational strategies that satisfy these three psychological needs, students experience more autonomous motivation and less controlled motivation. Importantly, autonomous motivation is positively associated with multiple adaptive outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], including student effort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] during lessons.</p><p id="Par22">Motivational strategies that support students&#x02019; needs include, but are not limited to: (i) providing task choice and offering opportunities for students to take initiative; (ii) providing a rationale and explaining the personal relevance of an activity; (iii) acknowledging students&#x02019; difficulties when learning skills; and (iv) praising students for effort and improvement. A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], showed that these strategies can be taught effectively to a range of professionals (e.g., teachers, managers, healthcare workers), with teachers showing the greatest propensity to increase their supportive behaviors (pooled effect size <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.2). Research has also shown that using these instructional strategies is associated with greater student psychological needs satisfaction, leading to greater well-being, learning, and psychological development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Previous physical education interventions based on self-determination theory</title><p id="Par23">A number of recent studies have examined the effects of SDT-based interventions designed to promote needs supportive teaching in PE. For example, Tessier and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] found that ratings by blinded observers across an eight-week period showed that teachers (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) in the experimental condition were more needs supportive than teachers in the control condition. Another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] showed that teachers in the experimental condition (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) who had been taught to use four needs supportive strategies showed greater increases in student ratings of support than teachers in the comparison condition (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) who had only been taught two needs supportive strategies. The experimental group students also reported greater increases in autonomous motivation toward PE and more self-reported leisure-time PA than control participants. A third study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], found that a SDT-based training intervention for teachers produced improvements in students&#x02019; needs satisfaction, autonomous motivation, and intention to be physically active during leisure time. Finally, in a study involving a single teacher, Perlman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] found that students taught using a needs supportive teaching style were more physically active during lessons than when this teacher did not employ these strategies.</p><p id="Par24">While the results of these studies are promising, a number of important limitations exist. These include: (i) evidence regarding the influence of needs supportive interventions on students&#x02019; PA during PE lessons has been limited to studies involving a small number of teachers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and those examining a limited range of needs supportive behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]; (ii) the lack of objective measurement of leisure-time PA, as only self-report measures have been employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; and (iii) the limited assessment of the longer-term effects of these interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>The current study</title><p id="Par25">Few studies have been conducted with adolescents, but numerous studies have shown that interventions designed to improve primary and middle school PE teachers&#x02019; lesson planning and delivery can increase the MVPA that students accumulate during PE lessons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These interventions have provided greater opportunities for MVPA during lessons, but little focus has been placed on enhancing students&#x02019; motivation towards PE in order to increase MVPA during lessons. Indeed, the content of many of these PA-focused interventions was designed to be enjoyable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but none of these interventions have been firmly grounded in relevant behavior change theory, nor have they examined whether the theoretical mediators were responsible for intervention effects on MVPA during PE lessons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Theory-based interventions are needed in the PA promotion field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], as they provide greater understanding of the process of behavior change and may ultimately lead to more effective interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Self-determination theory provides a useful framework for physical activity behavior studies and an increasing number of interventions are based on SDT tenets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">In this study, we will test a professional development intervention for teachers that combines the lesson planning and delivery approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] with motivational strategies designed to promote students&#x02019; needs satisfaction and autonomous motivation towards PE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A cluster RCT design, with allocation at the school level, was preferred to a RCT with individual level allocation because the risk of contamination effects would be high if teachers and students were randomly assigned from within a single school.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Web-based delivery</title><p id="Par28">Previous research aimed at increasing students&#x02019; MVPA during PE has focused almost exclusively on teacher professional development conducted in face-to-face workshops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While many of these interventions have produced significant and important increases in student MVPA, large-scale dissemination of exclusively &#x02018;in-person&#x02019; professional development to teachers is logistically challenging and expensive. These challenges may constrain training to a single face-to-face workshop, which likely limits teachers&#x02019; learning and their implementation of new teaching strategies into their practice, compared with professional development delivered over an extended period of time. By capitalizing on the advantages of web-mediated professional learning, widespread reach, cost-effectiveness, and quality assurance (e.g., extending training over several sessions vs one longer session) may be achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Thus, we designed a teacher professional development intervention that incorporates a &#x02018;blended design&#x02019;, with a mix of face-to-face and online learning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Research questions</title><p id="Par29">

To ensure 80&#x000a0;% power to detect an effect of this size would require 90 participants in a non-clustered trial (two-tailed probability level of 0.05). We considered the clustered nature of the data, including both school and class levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, results from recent studies of MVPA in PE lessons indicated that clustering at the school level was negligible after accounting from clustering at the class level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. As a result, we adjusted our sample size calculations for clustering using the formula 1&#x02009;+&#x02009;(<italic>m</italic>-1)&#x003c1;, where <italic>m</italic> is the number of students per class and &#x003c1; is the intra-class correlation (ICC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par62">Our recent study in Sydney-area schools indicated a class-level ICC of 0.62 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which was similar to Aelterman et al.

With an estimated class size of 22 participating students, an adjustment of 14.23 was required: 1&#x02009;+&#x02009;(22&#x02013;1)*0.63&#x02009;=&#x02009;14.23. Multiplying by the 90 participants required in non-clustered trial, we estimated that 1280 students would need to participate to achieve 80&#x000a0;% power. We estimate that 14 schools, with a mean of 4.5 classes of Year 8 students per school can be recruited and, therefore, aim to recruit 1386 students (14 schools &#x000d7; 4.5 classes per school &#x000d7; 22 students per class). Potential loss to follow up of up to 30&#x000a0;% of participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;384; a very conservative estimate) will not substantially impact on the statistical power of the study. This resilience to loss of power exists because this study will use generalized mixed models, enabling the inclusion of all participants (included at baseline) in the analyses.

</p><p id="Par71">Importantly, many aspects of the face-to-face workshop will be delivered using web-based resources. For example, best/poor practice videos will be accessed through the project website during face-to-face workshops. Teachers will also conduct their first self-reflection task during the workshop by accessing videos of their lessons that will be uploaded onto the project website. Teacher self-reflection will involve a rating of their implementation of each AMPED strategy (1 to 5 stars) and free-text response explaining why they provided this rating. See an example in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix B provides details of all ratings and descriptions.

</p><p id="Par72">All teachers in the intervention condition will be provided with a touchscreen tablet computer (iPad) to use during the workshops and implementation in their schools. Using this technology will allow us to blend learning during the face-to-face workshops with implementation tasks completed in schools. It is important to provide this equipment to teachers as pilot work in local schools showed that many computers in NSW Department of Education schools operate outdated versions of web browsers that do not support the project&#x02019;s website. Many teachers suggested that updating computer software would be a significant barrier to implementation, as it required a school network administrator to complete the process.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Technology-assisted implementation in schools</title><p id="Par73">Teachers in the intervention condition will have access to the project&#x02019;s interactive website. The site guides teachers through a series of three implementation tasks, with one task to be completed after each face-to-face workshop (two during main intervention, one during booster intervention).</p><p id="Par74">The first step in each implementation task will require teachers to set an &#x02018;action plan&#x02019; (i.e., goals) for implementation of AMPED strategies taught during the face-to-face training workshop into their lessons during the month following the workshop. The second task will require teachers to reflect on their implementation of AMPED strategies, using video clips of their teaching during the month following the workshop. Specifically, project staff will film a scheduled lesson occuring after the workshop, which will then be analyzed using a coding system designed to identify events that take place during lessons and are relevant to principles taught during the face-to-face workshop. For example, each time a teacher provides students with feedback during a lesson, this event will be &#x02018;tagged&#x02019; and a short video clip containing all instances of teacher feedback will be uploaded to the website. Teachers can then reflect on the extent to which this feedback aligns with strategies designed to support students&#x02019; psychological needs (e.g., Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par75">The third and final step in the implementation task will involve a mentoring conversation at each teacher&#x02019;s school. Following each self-reflection task, teachers will meet with one of three mentors who are part of the project team. A mentor will review each teacher&#x02019;s video clips and then facilitate a feedback conversation with the teacher. This conversation will be the final step in the first implementation task. Mentors will then help teachers to set a new action plan for implementation over the remainder of the term.</p><p id="Par76">Project mentors will have at least three years of experience teaching PE and will complete two days of training designed to ensure in-depth understanding of AMPED intervention principles. This training will involve reading and discussing SDT-related research papers, learning about the mentors&#x02019; role and participation in the intervention, and practice using the video coding system and website for viewing mentees&#x02019; videos. The peer mentors will also practice their mentoring skills in mock mentoring sessions, reflect on their own mentoring practice and provide feedback on the other peer mentors&#x02019; performance.</p><p id="Par77">Teachers will complete the implementation task three times-once following each workshop. They will also participate in three group mentoring conversations at their school-once per term during the two main intervention terms and once during the booster period. These group mentoring sessions will take place at each school and involve PE staff members from that school. The purpose of these sessions is to encourage staff to reflect on their implementation of AMPED strategies and devise methods to support each other&#x02019;s implementation in the future. A project mentor will lead the first group mentoring session. A member of each school&#x02019;s PE staff will lead the second mentoring session, with the project mentor observing and providing the staff member with private feedback following the session. The staff member will lead the third and final group mentoring session on his/her own during the booster period.</p><p id="Par78">In addition to facilitating teachers&#x02019; implementation tasks, the project website will provide teachers with resources designed to facilitate successful implementation of principles from the face-to-face workshops. The site utilizes a Web 2.0 platform that allows for dynamic interaction between the teachers and the research team. For example, teachers will be able to rate and comment on each of the resources that the research team posts on the site. This teacher feedback will automatically update the list of top rated resources on the site. Resources will also be &#x02018;pushed&#x02019; to teachers when they create each action plan. Specifically, each resource will be linked via a database to relevant AMPED strategies. Thus, when a teacher includes an AMPED strategy as part of an action plan, an email will be sent to the teacher with links to relevant resources that will aid implementation.</p><p id="Par79">The web platform also includes a community of practice discussion forum where teachers can share experiences from their attempts to implement specific strategies from the intervention in their own PE lessons. The project manager, with input as required from the project mentors and lead investigators, will moderate the discussion and provide ongoing advice to help teachers overcome barriers to implementation.</p><p id="Par80">Teachers will also be able to download an AMPED mobile application (&#x02018;app&#x02019;) that provides reminders to implement their chosen strategies at an interval of their choosing (range&#x02009;=&#x02009;once per day to once every eight weeks). The app will also prompt teachers to conduct brief self-reflections on their implementation of AMPED strategies, with the same interval range as the reminder function.

In their action plan near the end of the workshop, teachers will be asked to set a goal for MVPA during lessons in the upcoming term. In the first four weeks following the workshop, a research assistant will visit each teacher&#x02019;s class and fit students with accelerometers for one lesson.

The purpose of this meeting is to reflect on the core principles of (i) lesson planning and delivery and (ii) motivational support from the first two workshops. Teachers will be encouraged to reflect and discuss their attempts to improve their practice from the previous year. Each teacher will be asked to create an action plan for the upcoming term and use the website or mobile app to reflect on his or her implementation by the middle of the term. In the final weeks of the term, each school will be asked to hold a final group mentoring meeting.

Sedentary behavior will be classified as &#x02264;100 counts per minute.</p><p id="Par91">Student participation rate in PE lessons-Research assistants will record the total number of students at each lesson, the number of students at each lesson that are not participating and the number of students absent from each lesson. These data will be used to calculate the proportion of students&#x02019; participating in each lesson.</p><p id="Par92">Physical activity and sedentary behavior during leisure time (i.e., outside school)-Students will be instructed to wear their accelerometer for five weekdays and two weekend days at each time point (baseline, post-intervention, and maintenance). Accelerometer data processing procedures (e.g., activity intensity classification) will be consistent with those described for PE lessons. Periods of non-wear time will be defined as 30&#x000a0;minutes or more of consecutive &#x02018;0&#x02019; counts and will be removed from the dataset. This non-wear criterion was chosen because research with adolescents indicates that 30-minute bouts of sedentary behavior (&#x02264;100 counts per minute) are extremely rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. To be included in the analyses, the student will need to provide valid data for at least three days in total, including at least two weekdays. Valid days will be defined as days with&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;h of wear time. These criteria have been chosen because: (i) compared to more stringent criteria, they are likely to minimize missing data, which is important for maintaining population representativeness in this repeated-measures group randomized trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]; and (ii) they are relatively consistent with other accelerometer studies in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. To ensure increased compliance with this protocol we will: (i) deliver thorough, clear, and standardized initial instructions during a classroom lesson; (ii) send an SMS text message to students each morning reminding them to put the accelerometer on; and (iii) send an SMS text message prior to the day of accelerometer collection to ask teachers to give a verbal reminder to students regarding wearing and return. Leisure time MVPA will also be measured subjectively using an adaptation of two versions of the Health Behavior in School-Aged Children questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Psychological outcomes</title><p id="Par93">Students&#x02019; physical self-concept-Aspects of students&#x02019; global and physical self-concept will be measured using 21 items from the Physical Self Inventory.

The questionnaire aims to assess students&#x02019; cognitive, behavioral and affective engagement. At each time point, students will be asked during a mathematics lesson to report on their typical engagement with mathematics (e.g., &#x0201c;I like maths lessons&#x0201d;).

Analysis of observations will take place from data gathered at baseline and post-intervention. Within lessons, students will be chosen at random and observed in intervals for the duration of the lesson. Students will be observed and categorized as being either on or off task.

Specifically, intention to treat analyses will involve analysis of outcomes collected from all students who completed baseline assessment, regardless of whether or not they complete post-intervention or maintenance phase assessments. Between-arm differences in changes on the primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed by including an indicator variable for group allocation (arm), a variable representing time (baseline, post-intervention, and/or maintenance) and their interaction.</p><p id="Par106">For the primary outcome (MVPA during lessons), student data will be gathered from between one and three lessons per student at each of the time points (baseline, post-intervention and maintenance). The repeated measure will be modeled as a random intercept effect. Lesson will also be modeled as a random intercept effect. Analyses will also be adjusted for class and teacher clustering-each teacher will be given a case ID. In instances where teachers &#x02018;team-taught&#x02019; (i.e., two teachers within a single lesson), we will create a new case ID that is unique to that combination of teachers. In some instances students will be taught by different teachers within a time point (i.e., from lesson to lesson) or across time points (e.g., from baseline to post-intervention). We will account for this data structure by specifying cross-classified random effects models. Possible school-level residual clustering will be explored and included in the models, if appropriate. In sum, we will include four random intercept effects: (i) lesson; (ii) student; (iii) teacher; and (iv) class. We will consider a fifth random intercept effect for school, if preliminary analyses suggest clustering of MVPA during lessons at the school level.</p><p id="Par107">We will also control for a number of variables that could influence students&#x02019; MVPA during lessons. These include temperature at the start time of the lesson, the type of activity included in the lesson and the timing of accelerometer fitting for the lesson (the student arrived at lesson wearing an accelerometer or was fitted at started of lesson).</p><p id="Par108">Generalized linear mixed models will be also used to examine mediation hypotheses. Mediating effects will be estimated using a cluster-bootstrapped based product-of-coefficients test that is appropriate for cluster randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>].</p><p id="Par109">Potential moderators of the intervention effects will also be explored. Potential moderators will include gender and ethnic background (categorical variables), as well as socio-economic status and baseline levels of physical activity and psychosocial variables (e.g., motivation and needs satisfaction) which will be treated as continuous variables. Moderator effects will be explored using the same generalized mixed modeling approach by including appropriate interaction terms in the regression models. The trial is powered to detect main effects, not interactions; thus, we will employ a less stringent significance level to explore potential moderators.
