In patients receiving insulin, the insulin dose was reduced by 25% at randomization. Patients were stratified by age, insulin use, and time from the most recent qualifying cardiovascular (CV) event. Co-primary end points were a change from baseline in hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) and the proportion of patients achieving a combined reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> of &#x02265;0.5% (5.5 mmol/mol), body weight (BW) of &#x02265;3%, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) of &#x02265;3 mmHg.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>At 24 weeks, dapagliflozin significantly reduced HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x02212;0.38% [&#x02212;4.2 mmol/mol]) from baseline (8.18%) compared with a slight increase with placebo from baseline (8.08%) (0.08% [0.9 mmol/mol]). Significantly more patients met the three-item end point with treatment with dapagliflozin than with placebo (11.7% vs. 0.9%, respectively). Changes were maintained over 52 weeks.

Chronic hyperglycemia contributes to the development of macrovascular and microvascular complications, yet, in the U.S., only 52% of patients with type 2 diabetes reach the recommended goal for hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) concentration of &#x0003c;7.0% (53 mmol/mol) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Optimal glycemic control may be hampered by side effects associated with specific antidiabetic agents, challenges associated with an aging population, and concerns related to polypharmacy. Given the clinical consequences and the increased health risks conferred by comorbid conditions, effective management of type 2 diabetes must achieve glycemic control and include management strategies that address CVD risk, hypertension, and obesity (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes who are of advanced age and/or are at a higher risk of a future cardiovascular (CV) event have been understudied and under-represented in clinical trials evaluating antidiabetic agents. In addition, older patients tend to have more advanced disease and require different therapeutic approaches. Therefore, it is imperative that clinicians are provided with additional evidence on effective therapies to use when designing therapeutic regimens for high-risk patients. The already increased risk of CV events in patients with type 2 diabetes is a well-recognized problem that has contributed to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirement for new diabetes therapies to demonstrate CV safety. For both populations, safe and effective therapeutic strategies are required that provide hyperglycemic control and added clinical benefit.</p><p>Dapagliflozin is an approved, first-in-class selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) that reduces hyperglycemia through the reduction of glucose reabsorption into the kidney and circulation and through the promotion of urinary glucose excretion (glucuresis). Observations to date (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) for dapagliflozin have demonstrated reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) within 1 week, reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> in patients in all stages of type 2 diabetes, a moderate lowering of blood pressure, and favorable effects on body weight (BW). Thus, the SGLT2i class of drugs represents a new insulin-independent means to achieve glycemia. In clinical trials, dapagliflozin is well tolerated as monotherapy or as combination therapy with metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Despite the clinical data to date, there is a paucity of data on the efficacy of SGLT2i agents in subjects with type 2 diabetes who are at high risk of CVD. Thus, we sought to determine the effect of dapagliflozin on HbA<sub>1c</sub> lowering, BW reduction, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction in patients with a high risk for future CVD events. We defined &#x0201c;high risk&#x0201d; as consisting of an older aged cohort with increased risk of CV complications due to pre-existing CVD and hypertension, and patients with a regimen of concomitant medications such as oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs), insulin, antihypertensive drugs, and diuretic agents, including loop diuretics. Although not designed as a CV safety study, we conducted a 24-week, double-blinded, randomized control trial in this high-risk cohort and additionally assessed the long-term safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin up to 52 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study Design</title><p>The study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, phase 3 study of 24 weeks duration with a 28-week extension period (clinical trial reg. no. NCT01031680, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>), which was conducted in Europe, Asia, the U.S., Canada, and Argentina. An additional 52-week long-term extension study is ongoing (104 weeks in total). The study was designed and monitored in accordance with the ethical principles of Good Clinical Practice, as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation and the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by an institutional review board, and all patients gave written, informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Treatments and Interventions</title><p>Patients (<italic>N</italic> = 922) were randomized 1:1 to receive once-daily dapagliflozin 10 mg or a matched placebo dose plus pre-existing stable background treatment, excluding rosiglitazone. Patients were stratified by age at enrollment (&#x0003c;65 or &#x02265;65 years), insulin use at randomization (no or yes), and time from the most recent qualifying CV event (&#x0003e;1 or &#x02264; 1 year). In patients treated with insulin at randomization, the mean daily insulin dose used in the 2 weeks before randomization was reduced by 25% according to a prespecified algorithm; however, insulin up-titration was allowed per the rescue protocol. During the 28-week extension period, patients continued treatment as administered during the 24-week treatment period. Patients were permitted antidiabetic and/or antihypertensive rescue medication per protocol. Details regarding background treatment stabilization, key inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomization, rescue criteria, and treatment are provided in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc14-0315/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Efficacy and Safety End Points</title><p>The primary end points evaluated in the overall population and in the predefined age strata included the mean change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline to week 24 and the proportion of responders achieving a three-item end point of combined clinical benefit at week 24. The three-item composite end point consisted of an absolute drop from baseline in HbA<sub>1c</sub> of &#x02265;0.5% (5.5 mmol/mol), a relative drop of &#x02265;3% for total BW, and an absolute drop of &#x02265;3 mmHg from baseline in seated SBP. These end points were also evaluated in a post hoc subgroup analysis of insulin use.</p><p>Key secondary variables included the mean change in seated SBP from baseline (at weeks 8 and 24), the mean percent change in BW, and the proportion of patients with baseline BMI of &#x02265;27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with a &#x02265;5% reduction in BW. Other secondary end points included the mean change in seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP); the proportion of patients with seated SBP of &#x0003c;130 mmHg in the group of patients with a baseline seated SBP of &#x02265;130 mmHg; the mean change in BW from baseline; the mean change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> in patients with a baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;8.0% (64 mmol/mol) and an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;9.0% (75 mmol/mol); the proportion of patients achieving an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0% (53 mmol/mol); the mean change in FPG at weeks 1 and 24; the proportion of patients rescued for failing to maintain FPG/HbA<sub>1c</sub> below the prespecified rescue criteria at weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, and 52 (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc14-0315/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>); the proportion of patients achieving a reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> of &#x02265;0.5% (5.5 mmol/mol); the proportion of patients achieving a reduction in seated SBP from baseline of &#x02265;3 or &#x02265;5 mmHg; and the mean change in calculated average daily insulin dose in patients treated with insulin at baseline.</p><p>The safety analysis set included all patients who received one or more doses of randomized study medication and who provided safety records. The safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin versus placebo were assessed by the evaluation of adverse events (AEs), including CV events, laboratory values, electrocardiogram results, vital signs, hypoglycemic events, calculated creatinine clearance, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and physical examination findings over 52 weeks (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc14-0315/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The last observation carried forward approach was used for all variables at 24 weeks. The primary end points were tested by an ANCOVA model and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method, respectively (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The ANCOVA model examined the change from baseline in HbA<sub>1c</sub> with terms for treatment group, strata, and baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> (covariate). The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test controlled for stratification in the study. Primary analyses of HbA<sub>1c</sub> and the three-item composite excluded data after patients received glycemic rescue treatment. The three-item composite end point also excluded data after patients received hypertensive rescue treatment. Results from the extension study were analyzed by longitudinal repeated-measures analysis. Primary end points were controlled for type I error by using a two-sided &#x003b1; = 0.025, a Bonferroni adjustment. If statistically significant for the overall study population, testing was performed within the age strata using a further Bonferroni adjustment with &#x003b1; = 0.0125. Key secondary end points were submitted to a hierarchical testing procedure for the overall study population and the two age strata in parallel streams, with the &#x003b1; level dependent upon whether statistical significance was reached for one or both of the primary end points. Statistical testing was not performed for exploratory (52-week) end points. Results for continuous data up to 52 weeks were analyzed by longitudinal, repeated-measures models. Planned sensitivity analyses were also conducted for efficacy end points that included data after rescue. Safety end points were evaluated for all patients.

Specifically, we demonstrate in this high-risk cohort that dapagliflozin was superior to placebo when added to usual care in reducing HbA<sub>1c</sub>, as well as achieving a three-item combined clinical benefit end point of simultaneous HbA<sub>1c</sub> lowering, BW reduction, and SBP reduction. While the results appear to confirm observations from other clinical trials (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) with use of dapagliflozin as monotherapy or add-on therapy, the prior studies did not specifically evaluate subjects who were at such high risk for CVD; and therefore, the data provide new clinical information to guide physicians. Importantly, the data suggest that similar efficacy was observed for analyses by age strata (&#x0003c;65 years and &#x02265;65 years) and insulin use at randomization. The efficacy of both primary end points was maintained over 52 weeks in the overall study population and in the age-groups.</p><p>As an important feature of this study, patients were required to be receiving stable regimens of antidiabetic, antihypertensive, antiplatelet, and lipid-lowering medications at randomization, and use of these medications was maintained throughout the study. However, the insulin dose was reduced by 25% at the onset of the study to minimize the risk of initial hypoglycemia when adding dapagliflozin to therapy.</p><p>A companion study (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) (clinical trial reg. no. NCT01042977, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>) enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes and pre-existing CVD; however, unlike the current study, a history of hypertension was not required for enrollment, but &#x0003e;90% of patients had hypertension. Another important aspect of the current study is that dapagliflozin treatment resulted in significant HbA<sub>1c</sub> lowering compared with placebo in a wide range of renal functions. These data appear to be in contrast to those from a report (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) suggesting reduced efficacy in patients with moderate renal impairment. Results from the companion study (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) appear to support the observations of this current report.</p><p>It is important for providers to consider therapies that address not only glycemia, but also other unmet clinical needs such as weight gain, hypoglycemia, and other CVD risk factors. In this regard, this study was much different from past studies as it is one of the first to assess the treatment of comorbid conditions in a high-risk cohort. Specifically, we evaluated a co-primary three-item end point of combined clinical benefit, which consisted of an absolute drop from baseline in HbA<sub>1c</sub> of &#x02265;0.5% (5.5 mmol/mol), a relative drop of &#x02265;3% in total BW, and an absolute drop of &#x02265;3 mmHg from baseline in seated SBP. The choice of end points and the levels chosen as clinically significant were based on the expected efficacy of dapagliflozin-induced glucuresis, which are well-established benefits to patients, and accepted regulatory thresholds from prior studies (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) evaluating such clinical parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this was tested in a prospective, randomized study. Dapagliflozin had significantly greater effects in achieving this three-item end point of combined clinical benefit compared with placebo. As outlined, 45% of dapagliflozin-treated patients had a reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> of &#x02265;0.5%, 40% had a reduction in BW of &#x02265;3%, 38% had a reduction in SBP of &#x02265;3 mmHg, and &#x0223c;12% successfully met all three criteria for the overall response to the three-item end point at 24 weeks.</p><p>Additional measures of glycemic control (i.e., FPG reduction, the proportion of patients with an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0%, and the proportion of patients requiring antidiabetic rescue [24.6% for the dapagliflozin group and 51.8% for the placebo group]) were significantly better in patients treated with dapagliflozin than placebo at 24 weeks and were maintained through the study extension. There are many factors that may have contributed to the rescue rate in both groups, including the higher HbA<sub>1c</sub> upper limit of 10.5%, as individuals in this upper range may have been considered more advanced in the disease process. In addition, it was the strategy to decrease insulin dosing by 25% at the time of randomization, which may have increased the failure rate of those patients receiving placebo.</p><p>Following the baseline 25% reduction in insulin dose, the mean dose of insulin increased more in the placebo group than in the dapagliflozin group (5.1 vs. 1.0 IU/day), although doses remained lower than the prereduction level in either group. These findings, in addition to those from previous reports, suggest that dapagliflozin is efficacious in a broad spectrum of patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Urinary frequency was not evaluated in this study, although early work on the compound (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) did demonstrate an increase in 24-h urine volume, supporting the osmotic diuresis. As a result of a mild osmotic diuresis, dapagliflozin has been observed to have blood pressure&#x02013;lowering effects (SBP &#x02212;2.3 to &#x02212;7.2 mmHg, DBP &#x02212;1.0 to &#x02212;2.8 mmHg) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In the current study, the observed small reductions in SBP may also be attributed to the optimization of antihypertensive treatment in the lead-in period and the near-goal at baseline. The increase in renal impairment was thought to be mostly a result of patients meeting prespecified study discontinuation criteria for laboratory abnormalities assessed as renal impairment/failure, including decreased renal creatinine or increased blood creatinine. The reason that more patients overall, especially among those &#x02265;65 years of age, met these criteria in the study may be the relatively higher proportion of patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.</p><p>The novelty of the current study relates to the evaluation of a new agent when used in a high-risk cohort. Patients are living longer with type 2 diabetes, and a greater percentage of older patients will have type 2 diabetes. Thus, a key focus of the current study was safety in patients who have multiple comorbid conditions and are treated with multiple concomitant medications. A limitation of our approach was that subjects with certain diseases and abnormalities were excluded from the study population for the purpose of limiting confounding factors that would complicate the interpretation of the results or to exclude subjects whose safety could be compromised by participation in the study. However, the changes observed in weight and blood pressure were in the range of clinical benefit, and no safety concerns were related to these measures. In particular, blood pressure changes are of potential concern in patients receiving therapy with loop diuretic drugs. Yet, the safety results in the patients in the dapagliflozin group who were treated with loop diuretic drugs were generally similar to those observed for patients treated with placebo, with the exception of an increased number of study discontinuations, which occurred mostly as a result of patients meeting prespecified discontinuation criteria for laboratory abnormalities assessed as renal impairment/failure, including decreased renal creatinine or increased blood creatinine.</p><p>In this population of patients with a history of CVD and hypertension, dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated over 52 weeks. Even with the additional concomitant medications, there was no increased risk of hypoglycemia with dapagliflozin treatment in these patients. The number of events of hypovolemia was elevated in the dapagliflozin group versus the placebo group, potentially reflecting the influence of the multiple concomitant medications being taken by this population. While the overall rates of volume-related events were low, caution should be exercised when administering dapagliflozin to patients who are at risk for volume depletion. An increased risk for events of fungal genital infections was observed with the use of dapagliflozin versus placebo, which is consistent with the findings of other reports on this class of drugs (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Safety results were largely similar for the current study and the companion study (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In the current study, neoplasms were observed in 12 patients in the dapagliflozin group and in 2 patients in the placebo group, whereas in the parallel companion study fewer neoplasms were observed in the dapagliflozin group versus the placebo group (5 vs. 10, respectively). Similarly, an imbalance in the number of deaths considered unrelated to dapagliflozin was observed in the current study, which, again, was not observed in the companion study or in the overall dapagliflozin program. It is important to note that this sample size is too small to draw conclusions about rare events (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In the overall dapagliflozin program, no imbalances were observed for the overall incidence rates of neoplasms/100 patient-years for patients receiving dapagliflozin (1.39) and control subjects (1.34) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and all-cause deaths were balanced in the dapagliflozin group (0.53%, 29 of 5,498 deaths) and the control group (0.60%, 19 of 3,184 deaths) (data on file). Moreover, in a meta-analysis (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) for major adverse cardiac events (i.e., CV death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) in all patients within the phase 2b/3 program (including this study and the companion study), the events hazard ratio was 0.819 (95% CI 0.583&#x02013;1.152) in favor of dapagliflozin treatment.</p><p>The efficacy of dapagliflozin outlined in this study appears to be in line with or slightly greater than that of other agents in the class, including canagliflozin and those in development (i.e., empagliflozin) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The important and novel aspect of the study is that this study, along with its sister comparison trial, provided data on efficacy and weight loss in a high-risk group of patients, which separates this study from others (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Clearly, the interest would be in having head-to-head comparisons with more recent agents (i.e., dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors), but this will need to be addressed in future studies (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Although the 52-week data were felt to be exploratory, they do support the long-term durability of this agent.</p><p>In conclusion, this study clearly advances the field and provides significant new clinical information on SGLT2i use and efficacy. The strengths of the study are the large and well-characterized cohort, the observation period (i.e., 1 year), and the comprehensive clinical evaluation of the subjects. Given the paucity of available data, the current study assists clinicians when determining appropriate regimens for patients with type 2 diabetes who are at high risk for CVD. As such, dapagliflozin, when added to usual care in a population with a high CVD risk, was superior to placebo in reducing HbA<sub>1c</sub>, as well as demonstrating combined efficacy for HbA<sub>1c</sub> lowering, BW reduction, and SBP reduction, in a year-long study. These data indicate that the safety profile of dapagliflozin makes it appropriate for use in a population of patients with advanced type 2 diabetes, CVD, and hypertension, and, as such, provides significantly new clinical information.</p></sec>
