Uncertainty persists about whether they cause symptomatic muscle adverse effects, such as pain and weakness, in the absence of statin myopathy. Discrepancies between data from observational studies, which suggest statins are associated with excess muscle symptoms, and from randomised trials, which suggest no such excess, have caused confusion. N-of-1 trials offer the opportunity to establish whether muscle symptoms during statin use are caused by statins in particular individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This series of 200 randomised, double-blinded N-of-1 trials in primary care will determine (1) the effect of statins on all muscle symptoms and (2) the effect of statins on muscle pain that is perceived to be statin related. Patients who are considering discontinuing statin use due to muscle symptoms and those who have discontinued in the last 3&#x02009;years due to such symptoms will be recruited. Participants will be randomised to a sequence of six 2-month treatment periods during which they will receive atorvastatin 20&#x02009;mg per day or matched placebo. On each of the last 7&#x02009;days of each treatment period, participants will rate their muscle symptoms on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).</p><p>At the end of their trial, participants will be shown numerical and graphical summaries of their own symptom data during statin and placebo periods. The primary analysis on the aggregate data from all participants will be a linear mixed model for VAS muscle symptom score, comparing scores during treatment with statin and placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This trial received a favourable opinion from South Central-Hampshire A Research Ethics Committee. Results will be published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. Dissemination of results to patients will take place via the media, website (statinwise.lshtm.ac.uk) and patient organisations.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>

These reports have been prompted by data from non-randomised, non-blinded observational studies,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref> but randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have found no evidence of an effect on these symptoms.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A recent review of the evidence from randomised trials and observational studies suggested that symptomatic adverse events may be misattributed to statins,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and there is further evidence from trials of statins of this misattribution.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p><p>Uncertainty about the association between muscle symptoms and statins persists due to limitations of observational studies and trials. A major limitation of observational studies is a lack of blinding; patients taking a medication expect to experience adverse effects,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and therefore reporting of symptoms in statin users may be higher than in a comparable population not on statins. This phenomenon, the &#x02018;nocebo&#x02019; effect, can lead to bias in unblinded studies.</p><p>In trials, outcome definitions have been inconsistent,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and the temporal nature of muscle symptoms related to statins may not be compatible with the nature of adverse event collection. Another important consideration is dilution bias; even in the absence of statins, musculoskeletal symptoms are very common among the age groups of people most likely to take statins and could dilute any true effect of statins on muscle pain. In the randomised Heart Protection Study, around one-third of participants in the placebo arm reported unexplained muscle pain or weakness in response to regular direct questioning from the study nurse, with an almost identical proportion among participants in the statin arm.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Dilution of statin-related symptoms by non-statin-related symptoms would have led to a bias towards the null.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Overcoming this bias and disentangling statin-related from non-statin-related muscle symptoms is key in determining whether statins cause muscle symptoms.</p><p>Despite evidence-based recommendations about the risks and benefits of statin use, many patients believe that&#x000a0;their muscle symptoms are due to statins and discontinue use, therefore potentially missing out on the potential benefits. Clinicians faced with patients presenting with muscle symptoms during statin use are encouraged to measure the blood CK, which is substantially elevated in the rare cases of statin-associated myopathy, but in the vast majority of patients, the CK level will be normal, ruling out myopathy. In these cases, there is currently no other diagnostic tool allowing clinicians to empirically evaluate whether symptoms reported by an individual statin&#x000a0;user are caused by the statin itself or by the &#x02018;nocebo&#x02019; effect.</p><p>Therefore, this series of N-of-1 trials aims to offer the opportunity for individual patients to discover whether the symptoms that they are experiencing are attributable to statins. Each patient acts as their own control, and the treatment that minimises their symptoms can be established.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> The proposed trial will address some of the criticisms of previous evidence. The trial is double-blinded and placebo-controlled to minimise bias, and the sequence of statin and placebo treatments is randomised. Additionally, the within-patient comparisons of symptoms experienced while on placebo and statin will allow us to determine (1) the effect of statins on all muscle symptoms and (2) the effect of statins on muscle pain that is perceived to be statin related.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>A series of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled N-of-1<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> trials in primary care.</p><p>Each participant in the study can be seen as having their own RCT, and StatinWISE is a series of 200 of these, which is equivalent to a single multiple-crossover study of 200 patients.</p><p>N-of-1 trials can be demanding on the time of both patient and clinician, and StatinWISE has been designed with both of these groups in mind.

This was chosen to represent the smallest VAS change in pain which patients would perceive as being beneficial and might therefore change a patient&#x02019;s decision regarding subsequent statin use. Two studies have concluded that the smallest change in VAS pain score corresponding to &#x02018;a little more&#x02019; or &#x02018;a little less&#x02019; pain was 1.3&#x02009;cm, with a lower limit of the CI at 1&#x02009;cm.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> A 1.3&#x02009;cm minimum change value was used to power a pilot series of N-of-1 trials for statin adverse effects,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and our study is therefore powered for a 1&#x02009;cm change as a conservative estimate of the smallest beneficial change.</p><p>Using simulation, we estimated that a sample size of 64 participants provides approximately 90% power to detect a treatment effect of at least 1&#x02009;cm, assuming a type I error of 5%. Allowing for loss to follow-up of 40% of participants through the trial inflates the required sample size to 107 participants.</p><p>Period effects (changes in underlying VAS pain score due to factors other than randomised treatment, for example, seasonal&#x000a0;and activity-related), variability in individual statin effects across participants and imperfect adherence to the assigned treatment were investigated by further detailed simulations. VAS pain scores are not normally distributed, since they are bounded (0&#x02013;10&#x02009;cm) and can display large fluctuations in response. Therefore, further power calculations were performed drawing the outcome from a Beta distribution and from a distribution with normal variance components on a logit scale, to assess the robustness of the sample size estimates to the distribution chosen. These factors all have the effect of decreasing power, thus increasing the sample size required. An approximately 80% increase in the sample size required in the absence of these effects provided approximately 90% or more power across a plausible range of these potential effects, thus we determined that a final sample size of 200 was required.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Statistical methods</title><sec id="s3f1"><title>Primary analysis</title><p>To estimate the population average estimate of the trial VAS muscle symptom score, data from each N-of-1 trial will be aggregated. We will adopt an intention-to-treat approach. Participants who enter data on muscle symptoms at least once during a treatment period with statin and at least once during a treatment period with placebo will be included in the primary analysis.</p><p>The primary analysis will be a linear mixed model for VAS muscle symptom score with random effects for participant and allowing the treatment effect to vary randomly across participants. Residual errors will be modelled using a first-order autoregressive error structure within each treatment period to account for correlation between the seven daily measurements, with robust standard errors to account for non-normality of the VAS scores. Although VAS muscle symptom scores are unlikely to be exactly normally distributed, analysing such data using normal-based methods is likely to be a sufficiently robust approach.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Sensitivity analyses will explore the robustness of conclusions to period effects, within-participant correlation structures and missing data. All tests will be two-sided. P&#x0003c;0.05&#x02009;will be considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="s3f2"><title>Secondary analyses</title><p>The secondary outcomes include a single binary measure of whether the participant reports having muscle symptoms during that treatment period or not. This will also be combined with the follow-up question pertaining to attribution, to obtain a single binary measure of whether the participant reports having muscle symptoms that they attribute to the trial treatment or not. These two binary outcome measures will be assessed using a logistic mixed model with random participant and treatment effects and fixed period effects.</p><p>We will also perform a secondary analysis using the daily VAS scores, in combination with the follow-up question pertaining to attribution. This analysis will be performed in the same way as the primary analysis, but with VAS scores set to zero if the patient attributes their symptoms to a non-statin-related cause.</p><p>By removing symptoms with a known cause, these secondary analyses will be restricted to symptoms that the participant believes could be due to their study medication. This could reduce possible dilution bias that may be present in the primary outcome. If the secondary analyses of muscle symptoms that the participant attributes to the study medication produce a substantially higher measure of effect than the primary analysis of all muscle symptoms, then this suggests that&#x000a0;the primary result may have been affected by dilution bias.</p><p>Secondary outcomes relating to the impact of the atorvastatin treatment on other aspects of life will be analysed in a similar manner to the primary outcome, omitting the autoregressive correlation structure since these secondary outcomes are measured once per treatment period.</p><p>We will investigate whether the excess muscle symptoms, if any, experienced during treatment periods with statin are at a single body site versus multiple sites, and whether symptoms are more common at any specific body site.</p><p>Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise the measures of adherence to randomised treatment and their relationship to the statin and placebo periods. We will use the measures of adherence to randomised treatment to perform an efficacy analysis based around an instrumental variables approach.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Since these analyses require much stronger assumptions than the intention-to-treat analysis above, the results of the efficacy analysis will be presented and interpreted as a secondary analysis.</p><p>We will relate the participant&#x02019;s decision regarding future statin use, and whether or not the participant found their own result helpful in making their subsequent treatment decisions, to their individual estimated effect of the atorvastatin treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s3f3"><title>Subgroup analyses</title><p>There are no a priori subgroup analyses planned. If an overall population-level effect is detected, we may investigate whether the effect varies within subgroups defined by measured baseline characteristics. These analyses will be presented and interpreted as being exploratory.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Data monitoring</title><p>An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) has been appointed for this trial to oversee the safety monitoring. The DMC will review accumulating data on a regular basis from the ongoing trial and advise the trial steering committee (TSC)&#x000a0;regarding the continuing safety of current participants and those yet to be recruited, as well as reviewing the validity and scientific merit of the trial. An independent statistician is appointed to provide the analysis service required by the DMC.</p><p>The intervention (atorvastatin) has a marketing authorisation in the UK and has been in clinical use for decades. Atorvastatin is not a new drug and has a well-documented safety profile. Furthermore, this trial is being conducted in a population in which statin use is clinically indicated. It is anticipated that participants in this trial are at higher risk of CVDs because of underlying clinical conditions requiring statin use. Additionally, as participation is for 15 months, it is likely that they will have common medical problems (eg, colds, coughs&#x000a0;and fevers). On the basis that: (1) participants would have had prior exposure to&#x000a0;the trial treatment, (2) the trial treatment is clinically indicated for their medical condition and (3) the known safety profile of the trial treatment, we will limit adverse events reporting to any untoward medical occurrence not listed in the Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier and/or SmPC affecting a trial participant which at any dose:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>results in death</p></list-item><list-item><p>is life-threatening</p></list-item><list-item><p>requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation</p></list-item><list-item><p>results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity</p></list-item><list-item><p>is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</p></list-item></list>

We plan to carry out onsite monitoring where central statistical monitoring shows abnormality.
