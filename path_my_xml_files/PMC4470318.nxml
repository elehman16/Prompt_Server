and efficacy of the circumcision procedure requires continual improvement. In the
present study, we investigated the safety and efficacy of a new male circumcision
technique involving the use of a circular stapler. In total, 879 consecutive adult
male patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: 441 underwent stapler
circumcision, and 438 underwent conventional circumcision. The operative time, pain
score, blood loss volume, healing time, treatment costs, and postoperative
complications were compared between the two groups. The operative time and blood loss
volume were significantly lower in the stapler group than in the conventional group
(6.8 &#x000b1; 3.1 <italic>vs</italic> 24.2 &#x000b1; 3.2 min and 1.8 &#x000b1; 1.8 <italic>vs</italic> 9.4 &#x000b1;
1.5 mL, respectively; P&#x0003c;0.01 for both). The intraoperative and postoperative pain
scores were significantly lower in the stapler group than in the conventional group
(0.8 &#x000b1; 0.5 <italic>vs</italic> 2.4 &#x000b1; 0.8 and 4.0 &#x000b1;0.9 <italic>vs</italic> 5.8 &#x000b1; 1.0,
respectively; P&#x0003c;0.01 for both). Additionally, the stapler group had significantly
fewer complications than the conventional group (2.7% <italic>vs</italic> 7.8%,
respectively; P&#x0003c;0.01). However, the treatment costs in the stapler group were much
higher than those in the conventional group (US$356.60 &#x000b1; 8.20 <italic>vs</italic>
US$126.50 &#x000b1; 7.00, respectively; P&#x0003c;0.01). Most patients (388/441, 88.0%) who
underwent stapler circumcision required removal of residual staple nails. Overall,
the present study has shown that stapler circumcision is a time-efficient and safe
male circumcision technique, although it requires further improvement.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Circumcision</kwd><kwd>Complication</kwd><kwd>Male</kwd><kwd>Stapler</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="20"/><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Male circumcision (MC) was one of the earliest operations performed by humans. This
procedure has the potential to decrease the risk of sexually transmitted diseases such
as human papillomavirus, genital ulcer disease, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infection (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Additionally, it improves penile topical hygiene and reduces the
incidence of balanitis and penile cancer (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Conventional MC as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) includes three
techniques: the dorsal slit, the forceps-guided method, and sleeve resection (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, complications such as bleeding, edema,
and unsatisfactory cosmetic results are still common in patients who undergo
conventional MC (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Moreover, conventional MC is time consuming.</p><p>The Chinese Shang Ring was recently introduced worldwide. The use of this device is
associated with a shorter operative time, lower blood loss volume, and fewer
postoperative complications than in conventional MC (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, use of the Shang Ring
also has some drawbacks: more time is required for wound healing, patients must endure
pain for 7 to 16 days until the ring can be removed, and wound dehiscence is relatively
common after the ring is removed because the procedure is sutureless.</p><p>The circular stapler, a new disposable circumcision device, has been developed for
commercial use in China (Henry Medical Device Company, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). It includes two parts: an inner bell and an outer bell. The inner
bell is designed to protect the glans. The outer bell comprises a circular blade to cut
the foreskin and staples to close the wound for simultaneous hemostasis. We performed a
prospective randomized clinical trial involving four urological departments to
investigate the safety and efficacy of MC with a circular stapler in adult male
patients.</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The circular stapler comprises an inner bell and an outer bell. The inner bell
is designed to protect the glans. The outer bell has two cutting trigger handles,
a regulating screw, a circular blade, staples, a safety shield, and a bolt. The
circular blade and staples are hidden in the outer bell and protected by the
safety shield and bolt.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="1414-431X-bjmbr-48-06-00577-gf01"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec><title>Patient selection</title><p>This clinical trial was approved by the Zhejiang University Ethics Committee, and
patients provided written informed consent before undergoing the procedures. All
enrolled patients were adult men 18 to 70 years of age with a redundant prepuce or
phimosis. The exclusion criteria were acute infection of the genitalia (acute
posthitis or balanitis), a thickened prepuce secondary to chronic inflammation,
severe foreskin adhesion, or other contraindications to MC such as a concealed penis
or sexually transmitted disease.</p><p>In total, 879 patients were prospectively enrolled in the present study from March
2013 to March 2014. The patients were from four urological departments (The First
Affiliated Hospital, Beilun People's Hospital, Yuyao People's Hospital, and Xiangshan
First People's Hospital) and divided into 2 groups: 441 underwent stapler
circumcision, and 438 underwent conventional circumcision. All patients were advised
to avoid sexual intercourse and masturbation for at least 4 weeks after
circumcision.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical technique</title><p>In the stapler group, the appropriate size of the stapler device was first determined
by measuring the penis just below the glans. The penis was then surgically
disinfected with povidone-iodine. A dorsal penile nerve block and a circumferential
block were performed with 1% lidocaine, and the treatment was conducted according to
a defined protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="f02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>

surgery. Additionally, an investigator called each patient to inquire about the wound
condition until complete healing was achieved. Fifty-six patients who underwent the
stapler technique were followed up 1 year after circumcision. The following data were
collected and compared between the two groups: operative time, pain score
(intraoperative and 1 h after surgery), blood loss volume, postoperative
complications, healing time, and treatment costs. We used an internationally accepted
visual analog scale to evaluate pain. Mild edema was considered to be present when
the perimeter of the inner foreskin layer, including the edema, was &#x02264; 30% of the
perimeter of the penile shaft. If the perimeter was &#x0003e;30% of the penile shaft, the
edema was classified as severe. Wound dehiscence was defined as a &#x0003e;2-mm separation
of the wound edge. Postoperative bleeding was defined as bleeding that required
suture closure. The healing time was defined as the time point at which the crusts of
the wound disappeared and the healing line totally appeared. All patients were asked
about their satisfaction with the procedure by a questionnaire used by Yue et al.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref> shows the typical recovery process of
stapler circumcision. There were no significant complications in either group. Most
patients developed foreskin edema; mild edema usually disappeared 2 weeks after
surgery, whereas severe edema lasted 1 to 3 months. Severe edema occurred in 5 of 441
patients who underwent stapler circumcision and in 18 of 438 patients who underwent
conventional circumcision. In the stapler group, no patients developed wound
dehiscence, but five patients developed postoperative bleeding. In the conventional
group, five and eight patients developed wound dehiscence and postoperative bleeding,
respectively. Wound dehiscence of &#x0003c;5 mm was treated conservatively. If dehiscence
of &#x0003e;5 mm occurred in combination with bleeding, interrupted absorbable 5-0 sutures
were applied. Infection was controlled by oral antibiotics such as levofloxacin.</p><fig id="f03" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Typical recovery process of stapler circumcision.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="1414-431X-bjmbr-48-06-00577-gf03"/></fig><p>A total of 42 patients (9.5%) in the stapler group required stitches because of
bleeding or incomplete wound closure during the operation. The staples usually began
to fall off spontaneously 10 days after surgery. If they did not fall off completely,
the residual staples had to be removed by the surgeon within 1 month after surgery.
The staples began to fall off spontaneously 10 days after surgery in 20% of the
patients (86/441); they did not fall off at all in 5% of the patients (22/441); and
they fell off within 1 month in 95% of the patients (419/441). However, 88% of the
patients (388/441) still required removal of residual staples by their surgeon.</p><p>Among the 879 patients who underwent either stapler or conventional circumcision, we
found no penile deformities or any long-term complications such as meatal stenosis,
skin bridging, or others.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>MC is the most frequently performed procedure by urologists. Approximately 1.4 million
MC procedures are performed annually in US medical settings (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The WHO recommends three conventional methods to perform
circumcision, and these techniques are used worldwide. However, conventional
circumcision still has some drawbacks: it requires training; it may have a high
complication rate, especially in some African countries, where circumcision is often
performed by poorly trained and underequipped health workers (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>); and it takes time,
even when performed by experienced surgeons, which challenges the medical MC scale-up
for HIV prevention in Africa (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>The circular stapler is a new device used to perform circumcision. It was commercially
developed in China and is applied in some Chinese hospitals. In line with a study by
Yuan et al. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), our data show that MC with a
stapler has some advantages: a short operative time, minimal pain, and a low blood loss
volume comparable with those of another new circumcision device, the Chinese Shang Ring
(<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).
Therefore, the stapler also has the potential to be used in high-volume settings by
health care providers with minimal training and experience because of its simplicity and
short operative and recovery times. Currently, its most substantial deterrent to
widespread use is cost. A reusable version of the circular stapler might be a
solution.</p><p>Our study has shown that stapler circumcision is associated with fewer complications
than conventional circumcision, especially with respect to severe edema and wound
dehiscence. These advantages of stapler circumcision may be due to the short operative
time, minimal tissue injury, and lack of electrocautery. A comparison of the frequency
of complications across studies has been hampered by the use of different research
methods and lack of standardization. Based on the literature and our experience, we
believe that the stapler still has some advantages over the Shang Ring (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). First, the foreskin is cut completely with the
stapler, which causes less pain after the operation. In contrast, patients who undergo
circumcision with the Shang Ring experience pain for 7 to 16 days until the ring is
removed. Based on patients' self-reports, this postoperative pain can be very severe
when spontaneous or nocturnal erection occurs. Second, patients who undergo stapler
circumcision have shorter healing time, In patients treated with the Shang Ring, removal
of the foreskin is obtained by necrosis, which leads to a relatively ischemic edge.
After ring removal, more time is required to reconstruct the local blood circulation for
wound healing. Third, patients who undergo stapler circumcision have less wound
dehiscence. Patients treated with the Shang Ring have a greater possibility of wound
dehiscence because no suturing is performed around the wound. Wound dehiscence usually
develops when spontaneous or nocturnal erection occurs. However, these advantages should
be further tested in a well-designed head-to-head randomized clinical trial.</p><p>The main disadvantage of the stapler is the need to remove residual staples after
surgery. Most patients (388/441, 88.0%) who underwent stapler circumcision in the
present study required removal of residual staples by their surgeon. We recently added a
plastic gasket underneath the staples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Figure 4</xref>)
and are evaluating its impact on spontaneous staple removal. The other solution is to
improve the material of the staples so that they fall off spontaneously within 1
month.</p><fig id="f04" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>A plastic gasket (arrow) is present underneath the staples.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="1414-431X-bjmbr-48-06-00577-gf04"/></fig><p>In children in some countries, circumcision is mainly performed for religious reasons
(<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). One study showed that neonatal MC is cost-effective for disease prevention
(<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The herein-described circular stapler
may eventually be applied to children and infants because of its simplicity and short
operative and recovery times.</p><p>The main limitations of our study are that sexual function and behavior were not
evaluated and that most patients were followed up for no more than 1 year.</p><p>In conclusion, the circular stapler is an easy and user-friendly device for performing
MC. It is associated with a shorter operative time, lower blood loss volume, and fewer
postoperative complications than conventional circumcision. This new device may greatly
facilitate and standardize circumcision procedures; thus, its popularization would be
valuable. With further improvement, it could become the standard MC technique.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge Professor George N. Thalmann, Department of Urology,
