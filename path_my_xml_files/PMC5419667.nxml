Inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein by anacetrapib reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by around 25% to 40% and more than doubles high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. However, it is not known if these apparently favorable lipid changes translate into reductions in cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The REVEAL study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that is assessing the efficacy and safety of adding anacetrapib to effective LDL-lowering treatment with atorvastatin for an average of at least 4&#x000a0;years among patients with preexisting atherosclerotic vascular disease. The primary assessment is an intention-to-treat comparison among all randomized participants of the effects of allocation to anacetrapib on major coronary events (defined as the occurrence of coronary death, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Between August 2011 and October 2013, 30,449 individuals in Europe, North America, and China were randomized to receive anacetrapib 100&#x000a0;mg daily or matching placebo.

At the randomization visit (after at least 8&#x000a0;weeks on a protocol-defined atorvastatin regimen), mean plasma LDL cholesterol was 61 (15) mg/dL and HDL cholesterol was 40 (10) mg/dL.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>The REVEAL trial will provide a robust evaluation of the clinical efficacy and safety of adding anacetrapib to an effective statin regimen.

Torcetrapib was the first CETP inhibitor to be studied in a large-scale outcome trial.

All participants were to receive effective LDL-lowering treatment using atorvastatin. The primary outcome for the assessment of efficacy is <italic>major coronary event</italic>, which is defined as coronary death, MI, or coronary revascularization (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Study organization</title><p>The study was designed by the independent investigators at the Clinical Trial Service Unit at the University of Oxford (the regulatory trial sponsor) in collaboration with the TIMI Study Group based at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, and Merck &#x00026; Co, Inc (Merck), which manufactures anacetrapib and provides funding for the study. The independent Steering Committee is responsible for drafting the main reports from the study. Although Merck has the opportunity to comment on drafts of manuscripts, it otherwise has no role in the analysis of the data presented, the preparation and approval of this manuscript, or the decision to submit it for publication. The study protocol (see Supplementary Material) was approved by the relevant institutional review board and drug regulatory authority for each participating center.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><title>Eligibility</title><p>The REVEAL trial aimed to enroll a broad range of participants at high risk for future cardiovascular events (see <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Men and women older than 50&#x000a0;years were considered eligible if they met at least one of the inclusion criteria (history of MI, cerebrovascular atherosclerotic disease, peripheral arterial disease, or diabetes mellitus with other evidence of symptomatic coronary heart disease), had none of the exclusion criteria, and if their own doctor did not consider there to be a definite contraindication to either anacetrapib or atorvastatin (the protocol-specified background statin treatment for all participants).</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><title>Invitation, screening, and run-in phase</title><p>Extensive prescreening efforts were made to identify large numbers of potential participants at each recruiting site. Potentially eligible patients were identified from clinical records (including electronic health care records) and, in many places, were contacted to seek their provisional agreement to attend a screening visit. The exact methods varied by center and by country, and in all cases were subject to appropriate institutional review board approval and compliance with data privacy regulations. Potential participants were given information about the study and invited to attend a screening visit.</p><p>At the screening visit, relevant medical history, current medication, and other factors pertinent to eligibility were recorded directly on to the screening visit form on the study IT system (which was designed to ensure that complete information was obtained and to prompt actions in line with the protocol). Potentially eligible individuals had the study explained to them by the clinic staff and were asked to provide written informed consent. In addition, they were asked to indicate on the consent form which, if any, of the samples of plasma, serum, cells, or urine could be stored long term for future unspecified research analyses. Blood pressure was measured and a non&#x02013;fasting blood sample was taken for immediate measurement of total cholesterol, alanine transaminase (ALT), creatine kinase (CK), and creatinine using a Reflotron Plus (Roche Diagnostics International, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) dry chemistry analyzer. These results were recorded directly on the study clinic IT system, which provided an assessment of eligibility and determined the atorvastatin dose to be used for that individual (see below). At the end of the screening visit, eligible participants were issued with a 12-week supply of active atorvastatin (at an appropriate dose) and placebo anacetrapib, with 1 tablet of each to be taken daily. All other lipid-modifying treatments were stopped. An appointment was made for a randomization visit in 8 to 12&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>The prerandomization, single-blind, run-in phase was intended to help identify and exclude before randomization those individuals who would be unlikely to comply with long-term study treatment and follow-up. During run-in, the local investigator (and, where appropriate, each individual's primary care physician or hospital specialist) was given a description of their patient's medical history, previous lipid-modifying treatment and screening visit total cholesterol result, and advised of the atorvastatin dose that would be provided during the trial. The doctor was asked to indicate whether, in their view, their patient was unsuitable for entry into the randomized phase of the study (for whatever reason). The run-in period also provided screened participants with the opportunity to consider whether they remained willing to take part in the randomized comparison, take study medication, and attend follow-up visits for at least 4 to 5&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><title>Determination of atorvastatin dose</title><p>All participants who entered the run-in phase were issued with an atorvastatin regimen that was intended to reduce their LDL cholesterol to less than 77&#x000a0;mg/dL (2&#x000a0;mmol/L) and which was at least as intensive as their current LDL-lowering treatment (see Supplementary Material). At the screening visit, a computerized algorithm used the dry chemistry total cholesterol measurement and the type and dose of their current (prestudy) LDL-lowering therapy (statin and/or ezetimibe) to determine eligibility and the minimum dose of study atorvastatin (either 10 or 20&#x000a0;mg in China, 20 or 80&#x000a0;mg in other countries) likely to be required to lower total cholesterol to less than 135&#x000a0;mg/dL (3.5&#x000a0;mmol/L). Individuals were excluded if they were already receiving LDL-lowering treatment that was more intensive than the maximum atorvastatin dose available in the trial or if it was unlikely that they would achieve the target total cholesterol on that dose of atorvastatin.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><title>Randomization visit</title><p>At the randomization visit, eligibility was rechecked and information on SAEs and any other significant problems during the run-in period were recorded. Nonstudy medication, compliance with run-in treatment, and consent information were checked. Information about smoking history and alcohol intake was sought and an assessment of quality of life was made using the EQ5D questionnaire. Blood pressure (measured once with patient sitting using Omron BP760 (Omron Healthcare UK, Milton Keynes, UK) or equivalent local model), height, weight, and hip, waist, and neck circumference were measured. All details were recorded directly on the Randomization Form on the clinic IT system. A blood sample was taken for immediate dry chemistry measurement of total cholesterol, ALT, and CK. Individuals could only remain eligible if total cholesterol was &#x02264;155&#x000a0;mg/dL (4&#x000a0;mmol/L), ALT &#x02264;2&#x000d7; upper limit of normal, and CK &#x02264;3&#x000d7; upper limit of normal. Additional non&#x02013;fasting blood samples and a urine sample were taken for central laboratory assays of lipid profile, glycosylated hemoglobin, plasma creatinine, and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (see Supplementary Material). Samples of genetic material, plasma, serum, and urine are being stored long term for future analysis, subject to appropriate consents.</p><p>Eligible and consenting individuals were allocated anacetrapib or placebo using a minimized randomization program embedded within the clinic IT system that helps maximize balance between the treatment groups with respect to prognostically important variables (see Supplementary Material).<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Randomized participants were issued with a 7-month supply of study treatment consisting of (<italic>a</italic>) anacetrapib 100&#x000a0;mg or matching placebo, and (<italic>b</italic>) active atorvastatin (at the same dose issued at the screening visit). An appointment for the first postrandomization follow-up visit was made and the participant's doctor(s) was notified that his/her patient had been randomized.</p></sec><sec id="s0045"><title>Post&#x02010;randomization follow-up</title><p>After randomization, it is intended that all participants remain on study treatment and that follow-up information is collected for the full duration of the study.

Additional &#x0201c;early recall&#x0201d; visits are arranged for any participants who require review outside their planned visit schedule. Details of the follow-up visit assessments are provided in the Supplementary Material. Wherever possible, extended follow-up (off study treatment) of all surviving randomized participants will continue for at least 2&#x000a0;years beyond the final study visit to provide information on the longer-term safety and efficacy of anacetrapib.</p></sec><sec id="s0050"><title>Adverse event recording and adjudication of potential study outcomes</title><p>At each follow-up visit, study staff seek details of all SAEs (including study outcomes and reasons for hospitalization), any non-serious adverse events attributed to or resulting in discontinuation of study treatment, and any symptoms of muscle pain or weakness or suggestive of hepatitis (loss of appetite, nausea, jaundice, lethargy, or malaise). At the request of the US Food and Drug Administration, information on all other non-serious adverse events is sought for participants in North America. Potential study outcomes are adjudicated by clinicians based at or overseen by the Central Coordinating Office, blind to study treatment allocation or blood lipid values and using standard definitions (see Supplementary Material).</p></sec><sec id="s0055"><title>Statistical considerations</title><sec id="s0060"><title>Sample size and predicted number of events</title><p>Based on a major coronary event rate of 1.8% per annum and median follow-up of 4&#x000a0;years, a trial of 30,000 participants would have 88% power at 2-tailed <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.01 to detect a 15% relative risk reduction (see Supplementary Material).

The prerandomization screening and run-in phase successfully ensured that all participants were receiving appropriate doses of atorvastatin and the resulting mean baseline LDL cholesterol concentration (61&#x000a0;mg/dL) is in line with that anticipated in the study protocol (67&#x000a0;mg/dL).</p><p>Extended follow-up of a subset of DEFINE participants showed that anacetrapib has a long terminal half-life such that low levels of anacetrapib (about 8% of apparent steady-state on-treatment trough exposures and 2% of apparent steady-state peak concentrations) were detected in blood 2.5 to 4&#x000a0;years after cessation of therapy.<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Preliminary data demonstrate that anacetrapib accumulates in adipose tissue and appears to have a prolonged elimination phase from fat.<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Although drug concentrations appear to reach a plateau in plasma by 4&#x000a0;weeks of dosing, adipose tissue concentration of anacetrapib continues to increase for at least 16&#x000a0;weeks of dosing. Up to 1 year after cessation of therapy, only minimal declines in adipose levels of anacetrapib are seen despite a substantial decline in plasma concentration. Preclinical toxicology and exploratory studies performed to date have not indicated any deleterious effects of anacetrapib on adipose tissue structure or function. To explore this issue further, serial adipose tissue biopsies and plasma samples are being taken from several hundred REVEAL participants after at least 18&#x000a0;months of anacetrapib dosing. The planned extended follow-up of all surviving randomized participants (off treatment) will also provide valuable information on the longer-term effects of the study treatment (as has been done for a number of previous lipid treatment trials).<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27.</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28.</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29.</xref></p><p>By contrast with the ACCELERATE trial of evacetrapib,<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18.</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20.</xref> the REVEAL trial of anacetrapib (which has similar effects on lipids) has recruited more participants (30,449 vs 12,092), included a lower proportion with recent acute coronary syndrome (15% vs 31%), has longer duration of follow-up (about 4&#x000a0;years vs around 2.5&#x000a0;years), and involves more primary cardiovascular events (anticipated over 3,000 vs about 1,500). Thus, the REVEAL trial will provide a robust assessment of the efficacy and safety of anacetrapib among individuals at high risk for cardiovascular events who are receiving effective LDL-lowering treatment. The main study results are anticipated later in 2017.</p></sec><sec id="s0100"><title>The REVEAL Collaborative Group</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="li0010"><p><bold>Steering Committee:</bold> M.J.
