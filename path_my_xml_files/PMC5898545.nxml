In Estonia, the intervention is delivered to first grade students (aged seven to eight) within the regular school curriculum. The current work describes a protocol for a cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the PAX GBG conducted in Estonia.</p></sec><sec><title>Design and methods</title><p>This is an ongoing, pragmatic, two-year, matched-pair, cluster-RCT conducted in Estonian elementary schools. Schools were matched to pairs based on their geographical location and number of students per classroom. One school in each pair was randomly selected to receive the intervention and the other placed on a wait-list as a control. 42 schools provided baseline data during the autumn of 2016. Data is collected at two more points in time &#x02013; seven months and 19 months post-baseline. Outcomes of children's mental health and behavior are measured by the teacher- and parent-rated Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, parent-rated Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham &#x02013; IV Questionnaire and the Go/No-Go task completed by children. Teachers also rate their self-efficacy and overall classroom behavior.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study aims to test the effectiveness of the intervention in Estonian classrooms with a newer version of the rigorously tested GBG program. To our knowledge, this study is the first to measure the effects of the intervention on children's inhibitory control, which has been associated with externalizing problems in the literature. The results from this trial will provide further understanding into how the program influences children's well-being and self-control.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="intref0010">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> registry (NCT02865603).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mental health</kwd><kwd>Intervention</kwd><kwd>Children</kwd><kwd>Good behavior game</kwd><kwd>Prevention</kwd><kwd>Health promotion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Children have the right to live and grow up in an environment that provides the best possible conditions for their health <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. A child's mental health and well-being arise through interactions between individual, social and environmental factors that shape their behavior and choices <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Psychological well-being, personal and social competence, strong attachment to parents and a supportive school environment are all powerful factors that contribute to children being less vulnerable to drug use, mental health problems, dropping out of school, delinquency, violence and risky sexual behavior <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">School is a frequently used setting for preventive interventions targeting children <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> as they spend large amounts of their time there. Several universal school-based prevention programs have demonstrably reduced psychological and behavioral problems in children <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. One of these is the Good Behavior Game (GBG), a behavior management strategy that has been used for more than 40 years <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The GBG addresses disruptive and aggressive behavior during middle childhood, important behavioral antecedents of adolescent drug use and mental health problems <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p id="p0020">The goal of the GBG is to increase children's self-regulation and peer-cooperation <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Interventions addressing self-control during childhood can prevent a range of difficulties, for example, substance dependence and criminal offences during adulthood <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. At the same time, cooperative social environments foster children's successful development and promote their mental health <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p id="p0025">Several studies across the United States, the Netherlands and Belgium have attested the effectiveness of GBG and found that the GBG reduces behavioral and emotional problems <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, prevents the use of tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and improves educational attainment <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Although, in general, the program has proven to be effective, one study also determined that the intervention did not have a positive impact on children from dysfunctional families or those with combinations of behavioral and social risks <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p id="p0030">The PAX version of the GBG (PAX GBG, developed by the Paxis Institute in the United States) was implemented in Estonia for the first time in 2014 by the Estonian National Institute for Health Development (NIHD). In addition to the original classroom-based game where students are reinforced for their mutual success in withholding inappropriate behavior, PAX GBG includes evidence-based kernels or behavior influence strategies <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. There are four categories of kernels based on their effect: antecedent, relational, physiological and reinforcement. These kernels help children prepare for and achieve goals, reduce anxiety and offer rewards when effective behavior has occurred <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. More recent studies conducted in the United States have shown that the PAX version of the game reduces hyperactivity, increases prosocial behavior, improves children's academic skills and promotes teacher's self-efficacy <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p id="p0035">The aim of this paper is to present the research protocol for the study designed to evaluate the impact of PAX GBG on students' mental health and behavior as well as teacher's self-efficacy in Estonia compared with the waiting list control condition. The newer version of the intervention (PAX GBG) has only been experimentally evaluated in English-language environments. Amendments were made on surface level (adapting language and images) and the underlying logic of the program was preserved during the adaptation in Estonia. At the same time, the adaptation to a new country and language, as along with the novel socioeconomic, educational and cultural environment, could feature prominently with regards to the effectiveness of the intervention <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Design</title><p id="p0040">This study is an ongoing pragmatic, two-year, cluster-randomized waitlist-controlled trial conducted during school years, 2016/17 and 2017/18, in Estonia.

Schools that had at least 10 first grade students per class in 2015/16 were selected to be contacted as the class sizes in 2016/17 were not known yet.</p><p id="p0110">Invitations to take part in the study were sent in the spring of 2016 to 164 schools, which fit with the inclusion criteria. Invitation forms included a brief introduction of the program, the conditions of participation and a description of the goal and procedures of the study. If a school was interested in participating, the representative from the school signed the request form and wrote the name of the volunteering first grade teacher. By signing the form, the school conveyed that they understand the conditions for participation (e.g., the random assignment of schools to the intervention and control arms of the trial, willingness not to sign up for the KiVa program during the study period, agreement to participate in the intervention-related activities).</p><p id="p0115">The incentives for schools to participate in the study were PAX GBG materials, participation in a three-day PAX GBG training and mentoring support for the teacher for one year.</p><p id="p0120">55 schools sent back the interest form. Six of them withdrew their participation by the summer. Reasons for withdrawal were changes with personnel and lack of time. Three schools did not meet the eligibility criteria (not enough students or Russian as an instruction language) and were excluded, leaving 46 schools for the trial. All withdrawals and exclusions happened before randomization.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Randomization</title><p id="p0125">46 schools were matched to pairs by geographical location and class size. Matching was used to facilitate implementation all over Estonia. There are 15 regions in Estonia, 11 have a local trained PAX GBG mentor. To ensure regional coverage of schools implementing the intervention (which is a regulation set by the funder) and to provide mentors with work within reasonable distance, matching was decided as the best option for achieving the research- and implementation-related goals.</p><p id="p0130">Blocking or stratification is usually used in randomized experiments to improve precision <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In addition to accomplishing implementation-related goals, pairing (two schools per block) is expected to reduce intervention and control group differences at baseline and increase the statistical power. However, matched randomization also has several weaknesses <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> that will be taken into account within the study (i.e. if a school exits the trial after enrollment, the paired school will also be dropped; analytical limitations).</p><p id="p0135">After matching, pairs were randomized into two groups. One school from each pair was randomly selected to receive the PAX GBG or to continue their activities without receiving the intervention (business as usual/BAU). The intervention is targeted at Year 1 students and hence one of the 1st classes was selected randomly from each of the participating schools (if there was more than one 1st grade).</p><p id="p0140">Cluster randomization was conducted in September 2016 by an independent statistician from the Estonian-Swedish Mental Health and Suicidology Institute (ERSI). A random number generator, which employs atmospheric noise to generate truly random numbers, was utilized <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p id="p0145">Following randomization and baseline data collection, the schools were contacted by phone and the results of the randomization were explained. Two schools from the intervention group dropped out after the randomization and hence their matched pairs in the control group were also removed from the study. One school wanted the third grade to participate (instead of the first) and the other was not able to ensure it was possible for the teacher to participate in the PAX GBG trainings.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><label>2.5</label><title>Minimum detectable effect size</title><p id="p0150">A calculation was carried out to estimate the effect size the trial could detect as statistically significant. Cohen's d was used as an effect size measure. As an outcome variable, the <italic>Teacher-Rated Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire</italic> (SDQ) total difficulties score at first post-assessment was considered.</p><p id="p0155">For calculating the minimum detectable effect size (MDES) we considered two scenarios. For the first, we took into account the matched-pair design. However, as our matching criteria had presumably only weak associations with the outcome variable, the MDES calculations were also performed using simple cluster random assignment. In both cases, we used a significance level of 0.05 and a power value 0.8; average class size was an estimated 20 children. For the first scenario an intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.15 was assumed for children in the same pair of schools. The effects of the pairs of schools were treated as random - with random intercepts and random effects on intervention. To account for intervention effect heterogeneity values of 0.5 and 0.75 were employed as a ratio of the variance of the intervention effect between pairs to the variance between pairs. On these conditions, 21 pairs with one intervention and one control school resulted in a MDES of 0.257 (or 0.286 if the random effects variance ratio was 0.75). Adding covariates to the children level (i.e. gender and baseline score) with an assumption of 20% variance reduction decreased the MDES value to 0.243 or 0.273.</p><p id="p0160">With the second scenario, we discarded the level of pairs and assumed an ICC of 0.15 for children in the same school. The ICC for the primary outcome measure was based on earlier research in the field <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The effects of the schools were considered as random intercepts. With 42 schools randomized to the intervention or control groups on a 1:1 bases, this scenario resulted in a MDES equal to 0.389. Again, adding children-level covariates (assuming a 20% variance reduction) diminished the MDES, yielding 0.380.</p><p id="p0165">In other school-based intervention trials, the effects on students' mental health and well-being were found to vary between small and moderate <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Previous trials of GBG have found the effects on students behavior also to vary between small and moderate <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Based on the calculations, we are aware that statistical power is an issue with this trial and we might be able to detect moderate effects.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><label>2.6</label><title>Human subject protections</title><p id="p0170">Ethical approval for the study was received from Tallinn Medical Research Ethics Committee on 16 of June 2016 (Decision No. 1487).</p><sec id="sec2.6.1"><label>2.6.1</label><title>Active consent</title><p id="p0175">Study participants were informed and consent was acquired in the following way:<list list-type="simple" id="olist0010"><list-item id="o0010"><label>1.</label><p id="p0180">An administration representative from each school filled out and signed an informed consent form to apply to take part in the study.

Teachers implement the methodology daily within the regular school curriculum, using kernels during all lessons where possible and GBG every day starting from the training. All children from the intervention classes receive the intervention regardless of whether they participate in the study or not.</p><p id="p0220">The PAX GBG begins with creating a shared class vision displayed in the classroom. For developing and maintaining a supportive classroom environment evidence-based kernels are utilized daily. For example PAX Quiet (a cue for attention), PAX Voices (a cue for expected voice levels), Timer (to improve focus and increase time engaged in learning), PAX Stix (to increase equality and participation), Granny's Wacky prizes (motivators to increase wanted behaviors), OK/Not OK desk cards (providing feedback to groups and individuals), and PAX Tootle notes (express appreciation, thanks and recognition of accomplishments).</p><p id="p0225">Once the kernels are used regularly in the classroom, the GBG is introduced and played. To play the game, the class is divided into teams. Teams work cooperatively and if they do not exceed a specified criterion of previously defined inappropriate behaviors within the game period, they win a simple activity reward (selected from Granny's Wacky prizes). At the beginning, children play the game for brief periods, with game sessions lengthening over time <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p id="p0230">Competing as groups allows rewarding positive rather than deviant behavior. The students that are grouped together influence and assist each other to win the game, leading to the internalization of norms for appropriate behaviors in school and other settings <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Group rewards are conditional on the behavior of a group's members and, as such, supports cooperative behavior in the classroom <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.

In the previous two years, 41 classes participated in the program.</p><p id="p0240">There are 22 active mentors (currently coaching teachers) in Estonia. The mentors all passed a three-day training conducted by the PAX GBG program developer, Dennis Embry, as well as by PAX GBG lead international trainer, Claire Richardson, and took part in continuing education training organized by the NIHD. The Estonian PAX GBG mentors conduct teacher trainings in Estonia, lasting three days altogether. Each training day was carried out separately (i.e., not in sequence). Compared with United States, where teachers normally take part of 1-day training and receive one additional booster session <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, the training period in Estonia was extended in 2015 to improve implementation fidelity.</p><p id="p0245">The first training day for intervention schools' teachers was conducted at the end of October 2016 and focused on theoretical background of PAX GBG. How to increase a child's well-being, how to use kernels in classroom and the scientific background of the PAX GBG was discussed. Teachers also received PAX GBG materials (manual, posters, harmonica, desk cards, Tootle Note blanks, PAX Stix, timer, and Granny Wacky Prizes cards). The second training day was two weeks later in November 2016. Before that, teachers had to finish home assignment, which included familiarizing themselves with the teacher's manual, creating a shared vision with children and practicing kernels in their classroom.

Per each implementing teacher, the mentor spends approximately 30&#x000a0;h per school year on class visits that include coaching sessions. During the 2016/17 school year, mentors visit each class between 10 and 14 times. They also provide counseling via e-mail and phone. In the beginning, the visits occur every two to three weeks. When a teacher feels more confident, the visits are less frequent. During the second year (in this case, 2017/18), teachers can continue using the PAX GBG methods and participate in the third day of the training in the winter of 2018. They also receive up to two visits from the mentor at the beginning of the school year to encourage continuing with the intervention. There is no cut-off for the intervention and the implementation of the methodology is expected to become a daily practice for teachers, even as they do not receive regular support during second school-year from mentors.</p><p id="p0260">One school visit normally lasts two to 3&#x000a0;h. During the visit, the mentor observes the classroom environment and the use of PAX GBG. After the observation, the mentor makes recommendations for the teacher.

First one will be used when matching has been effective (correlation between paired cluster response means (SDQ total difficulties) at baseline is at least moderate i.e. above 0.4) and takes into account the matched-pair design. Multilevel linear models with three levels (child, school, and pair) will be used with continuous responses (i.e. SDQ total difficulties mean score at post-test), where intervention group (PAX GBG vs. control) will be entered at the school level as a fixed effect, random effects will model differences between pairs and variation of the intervention effect among pairs. Covariates (i.e. gender and pre-intervention score) will be included at child-level. Binary outcomes (i.e. SDQ bandings no risk/at risk) will be compared between trial arms using multilevel generalized linear models.

The aim is to find out if the intervention has different effect to children based on their baseline risk-status (i.e. no risk vs. at risk on SDQ) and socio-demographic factors (i.e. family structure and socioeconomic status), using four-level (with pair-matched design) or three-level (when matching was ineffective) models with repeated measures entered as first level variables.

At the same time, the evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions is deficient in Estonia <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, and this study is among the first to evaluate the intervention effects by conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT).</p><p id="p0490">This research helps to raise awareness of the importance of conducting impact evaluations and assessing the intervention's influence on children's well-being. In Estonia, the term &#x02018;evidence-based&#x02019; is not formally defined by national authorities, which has resulted in many approaches and programs defining themselves as &#x02018;evidence-based&#x02019;. There is also confusion surrounding what kind of studies provide reliable evidence of a program's effectiveness. By carrying out an experimental study, an important step is taken towards improving the quality of studies and raising the standards of required evidence to prove that a program is effective in Estonia.</p><p id="p0495">Although there is sufficient evidence for the effectiveness of GBG in general, and recent data has demonstrated the positive impact of the PAX GBG on children's mental health, this research serves as an opportunity to determine whether the PAX GBG functions in real-life conditions after adaptation to a new language and environment. The PAX GBG could protect Estonian children from a range of emotional and behavioral disorders and through that, lead to cost savings in the longer term.</p><p id="p0500">This study also intends to contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms through which the PAX GBG might affect children's behaviors, such as their ability to inhibit a response. It is assumed that the PAX GBG might provide children with the tools that they need for self-regulation and, as such, prevent mental health disorders and risky behaviors. However, the study doesn't carry out mediator analysis. As we will collect data from children, teachers and parents, we will strengthen such research's credibility and validity through data triangulation. Another strength of this study lies in using questionnaires as well as behavioral task, the latter being considered to be more objective and less biased compared to questionnaires.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Limitations</title><p id="p0505">Several methodological challenges influenced the design of this trial. First, cluster-RCTs require large sample sizes of participants to be able to detect small or moderate effects between the intervention and control group. It was thought to be impossible from the start of this study to involve large amounts of schools in this trial and, therefore, sample size calculations were not performed. There are altogether 472 schools in Estonia providing primary education in Estonian, of which most are small in size with an average of 10 students per classroom. Before the start of this trial, 79 schools were already implementing the KiVa or PAX GBG programs. As a consequence, it was possible to invite 164 schools to the trial, from which one-third showed interest after receiving several invitations.</p><p id="p0510">Even though the number of schools participating in the trial was not large, the input from this study is important to guide policy-related decisions in Estonia as well as encourage similar study designs in other countries regardless of the limitations and challenges that may arise.</p><p id="p0515">Secondly, the preliminary aim was to use a simple-cluster randomized design. Based on the implementation-related goals, the final decision was to perform a matched-cluster randomization trial instead, which has its own weaknesses. It is unknown whether the matching was effective as the variables matched are not expected to be correlated with the outcomes. Hence, it is difficult to predict whether matching has actually improved the power of the study or not.</p><p id="p0520">Another issue involves the impact estimations, which will be based on mITT. The initial plan was to conduct an ITT analysis, the gold standard for assessing the superiority of the intervention in randomized trials <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Unfortunately, it was not possible to keep two schools in the study and thus their matched schools were also excluded. At this moment it is assumed that this did not increase the potential for bias.</p><p id="p0525">One explicit limitation of this study is its focus on outcomes rather than the factors influencing the outcomes. Prior evidence has shown that teacher-related factors, such as their personal resources and attitudes, are associated with PAX GBG implementation success <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. It would be interesting to establish how the intervention aligns with Estonian teachers' approaches to teaching. Furthermore, it would be valuable to discern which individual, school-level and environmental factors influence the adaptation and implementation of the intervention. To enhance the implementation and mentoring, as well as to ensure sustainability, additional qualitative data collected from mentors, school administrators and teachers would be necessary. Those are all areas of further research that would be conducted later if there are sufficient resources available.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0530">There is a strong need in Estonia, and in Europe, in general, to bolster research into mental health and well-being among children, including the outcomes of interventions <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Schools often implement preventive interventions to improve children's well-being, but it is frequently unknown if these activities achieve their objectives and make a positive difference. At the same time, several challenges hinder evaluating the effects of school-based interventions, such as the inability to recruit and retain large sample of schools. Nevertheless, impact evaluations are important to demonstrate causality as well as to find out whether adapted programs work, and if they do so, across different environments.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0535">The study is funded by the <funding-source id="gs1">European Social Fund</funding-source> and <funding-source id="gs2">Ministry of the Interior in Estonia</funding-source>.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="p0540">None of the authors have competing interests.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p id="p0545">KS was the lead author of this study protocol.
