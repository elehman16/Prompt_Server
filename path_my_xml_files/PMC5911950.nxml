Data collection methods for previous cost and cost-effectiveness analyses of health and social care interventions targeting people with learning disabilities have relied on health care/health insurance records or data collection forms completed by the service provider rather than by people with learning disabilities themselves. This paper reports on the development and testing of data collection methods for an economic evaluation within a randomised controlled trial (RCT) for a supported self-management programme for people with mild/moderate learning disabilities and type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A case finding study was conducted to identify types of health and social care use and data collection methods employed in previous studies with this population. Based on this evidence, resource use questionnaires for completion by GP staff and interviewer-administered participant questionnaires (covering a wider cost perspective and health-related quality of life) were tested within a feasibility RCT. Interviewer-administered questionnaires included the EQ-5D-3L (the NICE recommended measure for use in economic evaluation). Participants were adults &#x0003e;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years with a mild or moderate learning disability and type 2 diabetes, with mental capacity to give consent to research participation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Data collection for questionnaires completed by GP staff requesting data for the last 12 months proved time intensive and difficult. Whilst 82.3% (121/147) of questionnaires were returned, up to 17% of service use items were recorded as unknown. Subsequently, a shorter recall period (4&#x000a0;months) led to a higher return rate but with a higher rate of missing data. Missing data for interviewer-administered participant questionnaires was &#x0003e;&#x02009;8% but the interviewers reported difficulty with participant recall. Almost 60% (48/80) of participants had difficulty completing the EQ-5D-3L.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Further investigation as to how service use can be recorded is recommended. Concerns about the reliability of identifying service use data directly from participants with a learning disability due to challenges in completion, specifically around recall, remain. The degree of difficulty to complete EQ-5D-3L indicates concerns regarding the appropriateness of using this measure in its current form in research with this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN41897033">ISRCTN41897033 </ext-link>(registered 21 January 2013).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s40814-018-0266-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Type 2 diabetes</kwd><kwd>Supported self-management</kwd><kwd>Learning disability</kwd><kwd>Economic evaluation</kwd><kwd>EQ-5D</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par20">It is estimated that there are around 1.2 million people in the UK with a mild or moderate learning disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Learning disability can be defined as the presence of a significantly reduced ability to understand new or complex information and to learn new skills combined with a reduced ability to cope independently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As a population, people with a learning disability are more likely to be in poorer health and to die earlier than those without a learning disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Disparities in health and health outcomes for this population have been the focus of recent NHS policy initiatives, which have placed addressing poor outcomes and health inequalities for people with a learning disability at the heart of their agenda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These disparities can be seen in the higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes in people with a learning disability compared to the general population, 9&#x02013;11 and 4&#x02013;5%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and higher rates of hospital admissions due to poorly controlled diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">There are a number of possible explanations for high rates of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes in adults with a learning disability including high prevalence of obesity and unhealthy diets, prescription medications that increase risk of obesity, reduced self-management skills and lack of practical support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Whilst self-management of type 2 diabetes is encouraged in the general population, its value and cost effectiveness has not been explored in people with a learning disability.</p><p id="Par22">This paper reports on the development and testing of data collection methods for an economic evaluation within a randomised controlled trial (RCT) for a supported diabetes self-management programme for people with a mild/moderate learning disability. A full description of the study is reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but in brief the study sought to explore the feasibility of conducting a definitive phase III randomised controlled trial to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of supported self-management of type 2 diabetes in adults with a mild or moderate learning disability and consisted of the following: (i) an initial case finding and recruitment study, (ii) development of materials to implement and evaluate an RCT of supported self-management, (iii) feasibility RCT of supported self-management + treatment as usual (SSM) vs. treatment as usual (TAU). As Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows, development and testing of data collection methods for an economic evaluation was undertaken in two phases, during the case finding study (phase I) and during the feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) (phase II).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Phase I and phase II data collection development</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40814_2018_266_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Phase I&#x02014;case finding study; methods for economic evaluation</title><p id="Par23">The aim of the phase I case finding study was to identify the different types of health and social care used by individuals with a mild/moderate learning disability and type 2 diabetes. This information would then be used to design a resource use questionnaire for completion by GP staff using the patient&#x02019;s record for use in an economic evaluation of a supported self-management intervention for this population. In addition, phase I would identify suitable outcome measures for such an economic evaluation.</p><p id="Par24">A literature review was undertaken to inform the choice of outcome measure and the development of the health care resource use questionnaires to be completed by GP staff. These health care resource use questionnaires were to be piloted within the phase I case finding study before further refinement and testing for use in the phase II feasibility RCT.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Literature review</title><p id="Par25">The aim of the literature review was fourfold: to identify (i) health and social care resources used by people with type 2 diabetes and a learning disability within self-management interventions (including frequency and drivers of costs) and the methods by which that data were collected; (ii) health and social care resources used by the general population of people with type 2 diabetes within self-management interventions (including frequency and drivers of costs); (iii) health and social care resources used in other settings by people with a learning disability and the methods by which that data was collected; (iv) outcome measures used within any of the cost-effectiveness analyses identified.</p><p id="Par26">The search strategies comprised index terms, text words and their synonyms for four concepts: learning disability, self-care interventions, type 2 diabetes and costs (or economic evaluations). Three separate searches were run in EMBASE, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library between May 2013 and February 2014. Searches used alternative combinations of three of the four concepts in each. The searches were not limited by language or date of publication. The inclusion criteria were as follows: cost-effectiveness studies for healthy lifestyle interventions; cost-effectiveness studies for diabetes self-management; and studies with costs and/or outcomes for people with a learning disability. Papers were excluded in which studies reported in abstract form only, related to self-monitoring or focussed on pharmaceutical treatment for diabetes. Titles and abstracts were reviewed by two people (CH and JOD) and data extracted using a bespoke data extraction template which included the type of intervention, duration of the study, outcome measures used and type of cost data collected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Development and administration of resource use questionnaires</title><p id="Par27">Based on information retrieved from the literature review (see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), together with input from the wider study team, the health care resource use questionnaires to be completed by GP staff were developed. This questionnaire covered primary and secondary health care use over a 12-month period and included community-based services such as an ophthalmologist, podiatrist and dietician, i.e. services that people with diabetes are often advised to attend.</p><p id="Par28">After consent to contact their GP was obtained from the study participant, the Clinical Trials Research Unit (CTRU) posted the questionnaire to GP practices. A cover letter explaining the study and reimbursement for the time to complete the questionnaire was provided. The CTRU informed the research team if the questionnaire had not been returned after 6&#x000a0;weeks. Reminders to complete questionnaires were by way of a series of emails and unlogged telephone calls by a researcher to the GP practices. For questionnaires still not returned after the 6-week reminder, where feasible, the researcher visited the GP surgery and supported the practice to complete the questionnaire.</p><p id="Par29">The completeness of the data collected in the questionnaires was recorded using descriptive statistics, detailing the number and percentage of questionnaires returned and the number and percentage of missing items within the returned questionnaires.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Phase I&#x02014;case finding study; results</title><p id="Par30">The literature review searches identified 1189 unique references.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Resource use</title><p id="Par31">The first search of evidence of cost-effectiveness analysis of self-management interventions in people with diabetes and a learning disability found no papers that met the inclusion criteria. The second search, studies of cost-effectiveness analysis of self-management interventions in people with diabetes, identified eight studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] that met the inclusion criteria (see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The selected studies were lifestyle modification programmes and telephone interventions (both automated and non-automated). The final search for studies detailing costs or costs and outcomes of interventions for people with a learning disability, identified six studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] that met the inclusion criteria (see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Two cost-of-illness studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] examined service use and healthcare costs of people with a learning disability, giving an overview of the main drivers in the cost of care for a person with a learning disability, with hospital-based care, GP, nursing care and accommodation being the main drivers of service costs.</p><p id="Par32">Cost data were collected using a variety of methods including interviews with health workers, standardised templates for staff, participant questionnaires and participant medical records. Each diabetes self-management intervention included programme costs with staff (e.g. nurses, counsellors, educators) being the greatest drivers of cost in relation to intervention delivery. Administration costs such as telephone charges, printing charges and translation costs added to the expense of the interventions. In many of the US studies, patient costs were not included or included in a generalised form using insurance information, with just one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] including participant out-of-pocket costs such as gym membership, exercise equipment and cost of diet change. From Review (iii), resource use (hospital-based care, GP and nurse care) and accommodation were found to be the main drivers identified in relation to the cost-of-illness studies for people with a learning disability. The UK studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] used modified versions of the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Based on the limited data of health and social care use gleaned from the review in phase I of this study, and in consultation with the experts on the study team, a resource use questionnaire to be completed by GP staff was developed using a modified version of the CSRI for distribution to GP practices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Outcome measures</title><p id="Par34">In respect of outcomes, the included diabetes interventions used clinical marker data such as HbA1C levels, body mass index (BMI) and risk of cardiovascular disease; in terms of quality of life measures, the majority of the diabetes interventions used quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], derived from the EQ-5D-3L or SF-12. In the four studies involving a cohort of people with cognitive or learning disability which measured health outcomes, two studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] used activity patterns such as social interactions; another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] measured health outcomes using an aggression scale and the QOL-Q; and one cost-effectiveness analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] used EQ-5D-3L to calculate QALYs.</p><p id="Par35">Previous work has suggested that the SF-36 is promising for use with people with a learning disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; the shorter SF-12, used in one of the papers identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], uses 12 questions from the SF-36. The EQ-5D-3L and the Health Utilities Index (HUI) have also been shown to be superior compared with other preference-based measures of health for this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. None of the studies identified in Reviews (ii) and (iii) had used the HUI. Based on the frequent use of EQ-5D-3L in the included literature from Review (ii), the EQ-5D-3L was chosen to be assessed for feasibility as an outcome measure for any subsequent RCT within phase II.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data collection experience and missing data results</title><p id="Par36">Between June 2013 and January 2015, a resource use questionnaire to be completed by GP staff for each consented participant was posted to their GP practice for completion using their patient record. The questionnaires asked about the services the participant had used over the previous 12&#x000a0;months. Case finding methods in phase 1 identified 147 eligible and consenting participants, of whom 121 (82.3%) had a resource use questionnaire completed on their behalf by a member of staff at a GP practice or with support from a researcher. Of completed questionnaires, missing data for each item was &#x0003c;&#x02009;5%; however, items recording service use responses, whilst not missing, were recorded as unknown in up to 17% of items. The data collection process for these questionnaires proved time intensive and difficult. In some instances, researcher telephone reminders to encourage completion exceeded nine or more attempts. Further attempts to contact proved less rewarding with emails being rarely replied to. Often service uses could only be accurately counted by opening every document in the participant&#x02019;s file to check for referral letters which had been scanned and saved as attachments in a patient record. There were cases where staff at practices refused to complete sections because the process took longer than they had anticipated. Those practices who did not want to complete the questionnaire were offered the option of a research team member visiting the practice to support them in completing the questionnaire; however, this offer was only accepted on three occasions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Resource use</title><p id="Par37">As shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, GP and practice nurse visits are the most frequent resources used. Almost 93% of the 121 participants visited the GP at least once in a 12-month period and 90% of participants visited the practice nurse. One in three (34.7%) participants had been to see a podiatrist and over one quarter (27.3%) had been to see an ophthalmologist. Over 21% of participants attended A&#x00026;E in the 12-month period and 11.6% had at least one inpatient stay. Services such as dietician, diabetic clinic, district nurse, and nephrologist were much less frequently used.

A secondary aim of phase II was to test the data collection questionnaires for use in a subsequent definitive RCT. This included an analysis of the acceptability of interviewer-administered participant questionnaires and participant-reported outcomes from interviews at baseline and 6-month follow-up, and an exploratory analysis of data collected from GP records using a revised version of the phase I questionnaire to be completed by GP staff in order to identify the main drivers of health and social care cost within the intervention and treatment-as-usual (TAU) groups.</p><p id="Par40">The resource use questionnaire to be completed by participants took a wider, societal perspective including questions about health care use resource use, employment status, sick leave, their living situation and out-of-pocket expenditures incurred as a result of health care admissions or appointments. Questions were written in plain English and were phrased in a conversational tone. The interviewers recorded post-interview journals reporting on their perceptions of the ease of completion. This gave a more in-depth understanding of the challenges for participants in responding to the questions, and the influence of supporters on participant responses. The questionnaires were analysed using descriptive statistics to assess the level of completeness of data, categorised into resource use, employment and accommodation.</p><p id="Par41">In addition to the questionnaire for completion by participants, a revised resource use questionnaire was again sent to GP practices to complete using the patient&#x02019;s record. As concerns were voiced by staff at the GP practices and study researchers over the time-consuming and problematic collection process in phase I, for phase II, there was a change of approach to the collection of health care resource use data. GP practices were asked for participants&#x02019; resource use relating to a shorter duration than in phase I (4&#x000a0;months rather than 12&#x000a0;months). The completion rate improved for phase II, GP practices were contacted regarding completion after 6&#x000a0;weeks had passed on just two occasions.</p><p id="Par42">Unit costs were assigned to the data in order to estimate the main drivers of health and social care costs over a 4-month period for the sample.

Despite few missing data, interviewers reported that 60% of participants (48/80) at baseline and 53.9% of participants (41/76) at follow-up had some level of difficulty completing the measure. The most important contextual area was the role played by the supporter in the interview process. Although 25% of participants (20/80) did not have a supporter present, for those with a supporter present interviewers recorded supporter intervention on occasion (for 11% of participants at baseline and 14.5% at follow-up) providing explanation of the questions when required, and sometimes when not. Supporters contextualised the question for the respondent, answering questions on the respondent&#x02019;s behalf and sometimes succeeding in persuading respondents to change answers to match their own perceptions of the respondent&#x02019;s health state. In the case of the latter, it was clear that often the supporter did not agree with the level chosen by the participant. On occasion, the supporter being present was enough to influence the participant. Researchers recorded the following observation:<disp-quote><p id="Par61">- &#x0201c;Participants answers were contradicted by the supporter at first.

Resource use questionnaires (covering participants&#x02019; health and social care) completed by GP staff and interviewer-administered participant questionnaires (covering a wider cost perspective and health-related quality of life using the EQ-5D-3L).</p><p id="Par63">The analysis of the results from the phase I resource use questionnaire completed by GP staff highlights the high use of primary care services such as GP and nurse care in comparison with hospital-based care. Whilst 82.3% of the questionnaires were returned and with few missing items (&#x0003c;&#x02009;5% missing), there was however a high level of service use recorded as unknown (which could therefore be considered to be missing data). This highlights the challenge of data collection in primary care. Completion of the resource use questionnaires by GP staff was time consuming and problematic in respect of the intensity of follow-up reminders required to achieve the return rate of over 82% (including researchers helping with completion in the GP surgeries). Potential reasons for the time-consuming nature of the questionnaires and the missing data was the 12-month time period over which resource usage was requested and the GP practice inability or unwillingness to complete the task.</p><p id="Par64">In phase II, the time period over which resource usage was collected from GP records was decreased to 4&#x000a0;months, to ease completion. When unit costs were applied, the main drivers of cost were GP care and hospital-based care (A&#x00026;E and inpatient stays). The types of services used and the main drivers of cost are similar to findings from the literature review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The time spent in hospital was not recorded; therefore, each inpatient stay is assumed to be a short stay which may underestimate the cost of this resource use. In addition, it was not possible to differentiate between face-to-face and telephone contacts from the patient&#x02019;s records; face-to-face contact was assumed which may have overestimated the time and cost.</p><p id="Par65">The intensity of reminders and GP visits to assist completion in case finding was not replicated in the feasibility RCT, and in fact, the return rate increased in the second phase of the study. It is not possible to say whether this was because the surgeries became more adept at completion over time or whether it was because the questionnaires were asking about a shorter timespan in the RCT. There were less data reported as &#x02018;unknown&#x02019;; however, more data was reported as missing. Data on services provided outside the GP surgery team, some of which are part of the Diabetes Annual Care Review, e.g. podiatrist, which were recorded as unknown and missing remained relatively high. If GP records were to be used in future studies with this population, methods to retrieve data on community service use would also need to be factored into the design. The only service not recorded as being used by any of the participants was the diabetes educational course despite being part of recommended first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Further investigation of how these community-based services may be captured is required.</p><p id="Par66">Despite the difficulty in collecting data directly from GP records, it appears to be a more reliable method than collecting the information from participants themselves. Participants were asked to recall their recent health care use at baseline and follow-up. Interviewers recorded a high occurrence of difficulty with this question (61% at baseline). Rephrasing of questions (e.g. 4&#x000a0;weeks/1&#x000a0;month) and supporter clarification was required. Such a high degree of difficulty with recall indicates concerns about collecting resource use data directly from participants. Interviewers classified accommodation and employment subjectively and changed their interpretation of the response (or it was a different interviewer). A finding would be that these categories need to be better defined for interviewers.</p><p id="Par67">The solution as to how to collect resource use data for this population could lie in the use of electronic records, such as Patient Level Information and Costing System (PLICS), as coverage in the UK increases. Providing a central data team with specific data extraction queries could make the data collection process more efficient. These methods bring their own challenges, not least in how to collect out-of-pocket costs for lifestyle change interventions (e.g. cost of changes in diet and exercise) and the costs associated with self-management itself. Accommodation and employment status data may also not be included within GP records.</p><p id="Par68">There was almost no missing EQ-5D-3L data reported with only two participants not completing this part of the questionnaire at baseline and one not completing at follow-up. This was most likely because it was interviewer-administered. Despite high completion rates, participants still experienced difficulty answering, with up to 60% being considered to have some level of difficulty with the EQ-5D-3L questions and requiring assistance from the researcher or supporter. The main difficulty experienced was with wording and understanding terms in the questions; rephrasing and explanations of terms helped with completion; however, this is discouraged by the creators of the EQ-5D as it invalidates the measure. Supporters intervened often, sometimes correcting participant&#x02019;s answers, even if the participant did not appear to have trouble with the question. Participants on occasion disagreed with supporters, placing a different value on their own health.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par69">Data collection methods for a future economic evaluation were developed, and their feasibility was tested during this study. In the testing phase (feasibility RCT), there was a higher return rate of the resource use questionnaire from GP practices than had been seen in the development phase (phase I). There were relatively high rates of &#x02018;unknown&#x02019; answers for community-provided care than for care provided within the GP surgery or by the GP team; therefore, a requirement for further investigation as to how community team service use can be recorded remains, as does sustaining the high return rate from GP practices.</p><p id="Par70">In respect of the participant-completed resource use questionnaires, there were challenges in completion, specifically around the time particular events happened and recall more generally. Difficulty with recall is common in people who have a learning disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and there are concerns about the reliability of identifying service use data for use in economic evaluations directly from the participants with a learning disability themselves.</p><p id="Par71">In respect of assessment of quality of life, although rephrasing and provision of explanations facilitated completion of EQ-5D-3L, a substantial proportion of participants had difficulty in understanding the questions. The high degree of difficulty experienced indicates concerns regarding the appropriateness of using this measure in its current form in research with this population. Further research into the language, format and process of completion of the EQ-5D-3L for participants with a learning disability is recommended.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec22"><p>
