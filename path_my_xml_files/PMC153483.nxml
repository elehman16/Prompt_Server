In a double-blind clinical trial, the tolerability and efficacy of Daflon (500 mg) + DEC (25 mg) or DEC (25 mg) alone, twice daily for 90 days, was studied in 26 patients with bancroftian filarial lymphoedema.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>None of the patients in either drug group reported any adverse reaction throughout the treatment period (90 days). Haematological and biochemical parameters were within normal limits and there was no significant difference between the pre-treatment (day 0) and post-treatment (day 90) values. The group receiving Daflon showed significant reduction in oedema volume from day 90 (140.6 &#x000b1; 18.8 ml) to day 360 (71.8 &#x000b1; 20.7 ml) compared to the pre-treatment (day 0, 198.4 &#x000b1; 16.5 ml) value. This accounted for a 63.8% reduction in oedema volume by day 360 (considering the pre-treatment (day 0) as 100%). In the DEC group, the changes in oedema volume (between day 1 and day 360) were not significant when compared to the pre-treatment (day 0) value. The percentage reduction at day 360 was only 9%, which was not significant (P &#x0003e; 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has shown that Daflon (500 mg, twice a day for 90 days) is both safe and efficacious in reducing oedema volume in bancroftian filarial lymphoedema. Further clinical trials are essential for strengthening the evidence base on the role of this drug in the morbidity management of lymphatic filariasis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is endemic in as many as 80 countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].

In India alone, 553 million people are estimated to live in areas endemic for lymphatic filariasis and there are approximately 21 million people with symptomatic filariasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Progressive lymphoedema (from the early reversible stages to irreversible and complicated stages) associated with the increase in episodic attacks of acute adenolymphangitis (ADL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] is the most important cause of physical suffering, permanent disability and economic loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

Furthermore, it is costly and it has been observed that sustaining the gains achieved by surgery depends on the ability to prevent subsequent ADL episodes (by following a hygiene and skin care regimen) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Physiotherapeutic measures such as manual massage, pneumatic compression and interferential current therapy have been found to be useful in odemea volume reduction in other secondary lymphoedema cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], however, these have yet to be properly evaluated in the management of filarial lymphoedema. Interferential current therapy showed significant oedema reduction in brugian filarial lymphoedema cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Although, pneumatic compression also results in oedema volume reduction, the results are not sustained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Manual massage could be most useful as a self-help measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], but objective data are yet to be generated in LF cases. Of the chemotherapeutic agents investigated previously, 5,6 benzo-alpha-pyrone was most promising. In a double-blind placebo controlled study on bancroftian filarial lymphoedma cases in south India, it was observed that 5,6 benzo-alpha-pyrone (given at the dosage of 200 mg twice daily) resulted in significant reduction in oedema volume (63% in grade II cases) at the end of a two year treatment period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The efficacy of this drug has also been demonstrated in a study in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. However, 5,6 benzo-aplha-pyrone cannot be currently recommended for use as the drug has been shown to be hepato-toxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>Earlier studies have shown that DEC has limited role in the management of filarial lymphoedema. In areas endemic for burgian filariasis in Indonesia considerable improvement in lymphoedema, including reversal of elephantiasis, has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. However, these observations were based on community studies and objective measurement of oedema volume was not carried out. A significant reduction in oedema volume was reported with repeated courses of DEC along with supportive measures (such as pneumatic compression, use of crepe bandage etc.) in a study, again on brugian filarial lymphoedema cases, from south India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. However, this was an open trial and it is not possible to differentiate the effect of DEC alone from that of the supportive measures. In bancroftian filarial lymphoedema cases, long term DEC therapy (6 mg /kg /day in two divided doses for 2 years) resulted in reduction in oedema volume ranging only between 3 to 7 % in different grades of oedema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. A double blind clinical trial with single dose DEC (6 mg / kg body weight) or ivermectin (400 mg / kg body weight) did not show any significant change in oedema volume in bancroftian filarial lymphoedema cases over a one-year follow-up period (Vector Control Research Centre &#x02013; unpublished data). In the current study, DEC treatment alone at the dosage of 25 mg twice a day for 90 days did not result in significant change oedema volume in filarial lymphoedema cases. Freedman <italic>et al</italic>., using lymphoscintigraphy did not observe any improvement in lymphatic pathology after two courses of DEC (for 12 days each) in bancroftian filarial lymphoedema cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Furthermore, DEC did not reduce the incidence of episodic ADL attacks in individual lymphoedema cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] as well as in the community after mass drug administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. These results suggest the limitations of DEC in the morbidity management in LF.</p><p>This is the first report of a clinical trial on the tolerability and efficacy of Daflon in filarial lymphoedema cases. Daflon is known to be phlebotonic, it reduces capillary permeability and has an anti-lipidaemic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This drug is known to be safe and without any adverse reaction in the dosage of 2 tablets of 500 mg each per day, and it has been given up to one-year period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The results of the current study showed that there was neither any adverse reaction during the 90 days treatment period nor any significant change between the pre-treatment (day 0) and post-treatment (day 90) haematological or biochemical parameters in any of the patients (which were within normal limits). This demonstrates that Daflon (500 mg, twice a day for 90 days) is safe, well tolerated, and can be used up to 90 days in patients with filarial lymphoedema. Furthermore, the drug is also efficacious, reflected by a significant reduction in oedema volume of 63.8% (recorded between day 0 and day 360, inclusive of 90 days of treatment period) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). A significant reduction in oedema volume was detected by the end of day 90 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In other clinical conditions, appreciable change has been detected between 6 weeks to 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. The pattern of change in oedema volume showed a marked reduction from day 75 until day 180 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), after which the change was marginal (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This could suggest that repeat course(s) may be required for further decrease in oedema volume. Although Daflon was given along with DEC in the current study, since DEC alone did not show any significant reduction in oedema volume (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), the results seen in the former group is likely to be due to Daflon.</p><p>None of the patients in either drugs group suffered from an ADL attack during the treatment and follow-up period. The reason for this, however, is not clear. Although DEC, (25 mg twice a day for 90 days), was given to all patients, it is difficult to assign this effect to DEC, as previous experience, in both hospital and community studies, did not favour this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. All the patients were also from a limited geographical area with similar environmental and socio-economic conditions having similar risk for ADL. None of the patients were advocated a specific hygiene and skin care regimen as a part of the protocol (since this is not yet a routine measure advocated by the National Filariasis Control Programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] and also as this could confound the results of effects of the drug (however, for ethical reasons all patients were educated in an appropriate hygiene and skin care regimen after completion of the study)).</p><p>We conclude that Daflon (500 mg, twice a day for 90 days) is both safe and efficacious in reducing oedema volume in filarial lymphoedema. DEC, at the dosage given, did not result in any significant change in oedema volume. However, as the current study was limited to a few patients in south India (and did not have an arm of Daflon alone) further clinical trials (preferably multi-centre) with larger numbers of patients need to be carried out (and should address the effect of Daflon on lymphatic pathology). This is essential for strengthening the evidence base on the use of Daflon in the management of filarial lymphoedema, before recommending its use in morbidity management to the Global Programme for the Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LKD; Study design, case detection, recruitment and follow-up, data analysis and manuscript preparation.
