In addition, we will clarify the aforementioned assumption that &#x02018;<italic>Yin-Deficiency</italic>&#x02019; is the major cause of xerostomia in the elderly by identifying a correlation between xerostomia and &#x02018;<italic>Yin-Deficiency</italic>&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will be carried out at two centers: Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital and Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], is a fairly common condition among the elderly
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It is estimated that approximately 30% of the population aged 65 years and older have xerostomia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and several studies have reported a higher prevalence in the elderly than in the younger population
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The causes of xerostomia are long-term uses of xerostomia-inducing medications for chronic diseases and systemic diseases (for example, Sj&#x000f6;gren&#x02019;s syndrome, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, and Parkinson&#x02019;s disease), head and neck radiation therapy, aging, heavy smoking, and stress
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the elderly, the long-term use of medications and aging are regarded as major causes of xerostomia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, recent xerostomia studies mostly focused on Sj&#x000f6;gren&#x02019;s syndrome or postradiotherapy-induced xerostomia, which are related to salivary gland damage, and only a few studies have assessed xerostomia in elderly subjects who did not exhibit obvious structural damage of the salivary glands
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Xerostomia is not generally accepted as a disease despite its high prevalence in the elderly; therefore, this condition continues to impair the affected patient&#x02019;s quality of life (QoL)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. For example, xerostomia in the elderly is known to cause dental problems and changes in chewing, swallowing, digestion, and taste
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Therefore, many xerostomia patients turn to solutions such as frequent water intake, sour foods, and alternative therapies (herbs or nutritional supplements)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, it is unclear whether these behaviors or therapies provide relief from xerostomia symptoms.</p><p>In traditional Korean medicine (TKM), &#x02018;<italic>Yin-Deficiency</italic>&#x02019; is regarded as the main pathologic cause of xerostomia in the elderly
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Generally, the balance of <italic>Yin</italic> and <italic>Yang</italic> is important for maintaining health and treating diseases in TKM
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Particularly, <italic>Yin</italic> in &#x02018;<italic>Yin-Deficiency</italic>&#x02019; refers to general body fluids, including blood, and <italic>Jing</italic> (mostly translated as &#x02018;essence of body&#x02019;)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Therefore, &#x02018;<italic>Yin-Deficiency</italic>&#x02019; is closely correlated with a shortage of body fluids, which results in various symptoms (dry mouth, dry eyes, or constipation)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. TKM has many herbal prescriptions for treating &#x02018;<italic>Yin-Deficiency</italic>&#x02019;
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p><italic>Yukmijihwang-tang</italic> (YMJ; <italic>Liu-wei-di-huang-tang</italic> in traditional Chinese medicine; <italic>Lokumijio-to</italic> in Kampo Medicine) is described in the ancient Chinese literature, &#x02018;<italic>Key to Therapeutics of Children&#x02019;s Diseases</italic>&#x02019;
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and is composed of six herbs. It has long been used for enriching the fluid-humor of the body in TKM, and it can treat <italic>Deficiency Fire Flaming Upward</italic> due to &#x02018;<italic>Yin-Deficiency</italic>&#x02019;. Recently, many studies have described the pharmacological effects of YMJ, such as protection against renal ischemia/reperfusion in rats
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], memory enhancement in rats
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and antioxidant and antidiabetic effects in early diabetic nephropathy patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In xerostomia-related aspects, YMJ is a famous herbal formula for body enrichment, which includes relieving &#x02018;<italic>Yin-Deficiency</italic>&#x02019;
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], because of its demonstrated antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities in animal studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, it is postulated that YMJ can improve xerostomia in the elderly by enriching the <italic>Qi</italic> of the body and tonifying <italic>Yin</italic>.</p><p>However, to our knowledge, no clinical trial has examined the effects of YMJ on xerostomia. Therefore, we designed a randomized clinical trial to assess the effects and safety of the use of YMJ on xerostomia in the elderly. To evaluate any changes in xerostomia symptoms, the visual analogue scale (VAS) for xerostomia and the salivary flow rate will be analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The aims of this study are to:</p><p>(1) obtain clinical evidence regarding the safety and effects of YMJ in elderly individuals with xerostomia;</p><p>(2) identify a correlation between xerostomia in the elderly and the &#x02018;<italic>Yin-deficiency</italic>&#x02019; state.</p></sec><sec><title>Hypothesis</title><p>We hypothesize that 8 weeks of YMJ administration will improve xerostomia in the elderly and will not induce severe side effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>This is an academic research study that will be conducted as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-center trial at Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital and Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong in Seoul, Korea.</p><p>This clinical trial will consist of an 8-week oral administration of YMJ with two visits at 4-week intervals and a 2-week follow-up period. Before enrollment, all subjects will go through a 7-day run-in period.</p><p>After randomization, all subjects will be divided into two groups: the YMJ and placebo groups. Each group will be provided with YMJ or a placebo for 8 weeks and the subjects will be required to take 3 g of YMJ or placebo three times a day. During the 8-week administration period, subjects will be prohibited from taking any kind of xerostomia-relieving drug such as pilocarpine or cevimeline. Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline and at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 10 weeks after randomization.</p><p>The flow of the entire trial is shown in Figure&#x000a0;

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The same study indicated a mean standard deviation (SD = <italic>&#x003c3;</italic>) of 1.87. In our study, the ratio (<italic>&#x003bb;</italic>) of the experimental group to the placebo group will be 1:1. With a power of 80% (1 - &#x003b2;) and a significance level of 5% (&#x003b1;), assuming &#x00394; = 1.54 and &#x003c3; = 1.87, a sample size of n<sub>t</sub> = n<sub>c</sub>= 36 subjects per each group will be required (<italic>n</italic><sub>t</sub>, number of YMJ group; <italic>n</italic><sub>c</sub>, number of placebo group). Considering an assumed dropout rate of 25%, a total of 96 subjects will be needed. Although the intervention period in this study is different from that in previous similar study, we chose data from a previous study
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The rationale for choosing these data is the lack of studies or guidelines that used the same herbal prescription (YMJ) or the same outcome measure as this study.</p><p>On the other hand, to our knowledge, no clinical study has been conducted to assess the correlation between xerostomia in the elderly and the &#x02018;<italic>Yin-deficiency</italic>&#x02019; state. Thus, the current trial is regarded as a pilot study to assess this correlation. This correlation will be assessed with a sample size of 96 subjects, which we believe is an appropriate sample size for evaluating this clinical correlation. The results will be shown by using descriptive statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>In general, the definition of elderly is used to describe people over the age of 60 years
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; in accordance, we will recruit subjects who are between 60 and 80 years of age and have experienced xerostomia for 3 months prior to participation. We have restricted the subjects&#x02019; ages to below 80 years because individuals over this age are considered to have lower eligibility in this study on the basis of the rationale that the incidence of disease is increased as an individual ages.Therefore, we set an upper limit of 80 years on the subjects&#x02019; ages by a consensus among geriatric disease specialists.</p><p>The subjects should present with VAS scores &#x0003e;4 for xerostomia 2 weeks before the study period.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This questionnaire consists of 10 VAS-related items: an irritable rash on the palms or soles, flushing of the zygomatic area in the afternoon, tidal fever, night sweats, emaciation or weight loss, dry mouth and/or throat, dizziness, constipation, decreased urine with yellowish color, and insomnia. The subjects will take this questionnaire at baseline and 8 weeks.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>We will perform the following tests on all subjects at screening and after completion of YMJ administration: complete blood cell count; levels of aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine; and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. These blood tests will help us to exclude subjects who have serious diseases and abnormal liver, heart, kidney, or other organ function. Throughout the present study, we will also check whether the 8-week administration of YMJ in xerostomia patients is safe by using these tests or CRF documentations.</p><p>In addition, at each visit, investigators will ask the subjects whether there are any adverse events (AEs) during the study period. If there is any AE, the investigator will provide the appropriate treatment to the subject immediately and record AEs in the dedicated document of the CRF including its severity and causality with the experimental agent. These AEs occurred during the entire study will be reviewed and monitored by independent CRA.</p><p>In the case of serious adverse events (SAEs), the investigator will offer the corresponding treatment to the subject immediately and report to IRB within 24 h from the time of recognition. If necessary, blind will be broken by adequate procedure and the documented procedure will be kept in the investigator study file.</p></sec><sec><title>Quality control</title><p>To retain the accuracy and quality of the clinical trial, DreamCIS, an established CRO located in Seoul, Korea, will audit the study. In addition, regular monitoring will be implemented by the CRA to ensure that the clinical trial is proceeding according to the protocol by checking trial master files, informed consent forms, the CRF, adverse events, and compliance with study agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>An independent statistician will perform a blind statistical analysis using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All data will be presented as means and SDs, and all analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle.</p><p>The analysis strategies in the present study are as follows.</p><p>First, we will use the ANCOVA to compare the changes in VAS scores (primary outcome) to evaluate the effects of YMJ and the placebo from the beginning (0 week) to the end (8 weeks) of the study period. Second, the secondary outcomes (DMSQ scores, USFR, SSFR, volume of residual saliva, salivary Ig A, chromogranin A, cortisol, and &#x02018;<italic>Yin-deficiency</italic>&#x02019; score) will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary outcome. Finally, correlation between subjective (VAS and DMSQ) and objective xerostomia-related variables (USFR, SSFR, and residual saliva) will be analyzed by Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients. Also, we will find out how xerostomia-related variables correlate with &#x02018;<italic>Yin-deficiency</italic>&#x02019; score or stress-related variables (salivary Ig A, chromogranin A, and cortisol), respectively, using Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients. In addition, we will check the AEs in YMJ and placebo group each and describe them using the descriptive statistics.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval and registration</title><p>This study will be carried out in accordance with the standards of the International Committee on Harmonization on Good Clinical Practice and the revised version of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol of the trial has been approved by two ethics committees: the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of both the Oriental Hospital at Kyung Hee University Medical Center and the Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong. The permission numbers are KOMCIRB 2011-28 for the Oriental Hospital at Kyung Hee University Medical Center and KHNMC-OH-IRB 2011-016 for the Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong.</p><p>The process of obtaining consent will be carried out by the principle of informed consent, which consists of information, decisional capacity, and voluntarism. Prior to screening, written informed consent approved by the IRB will be obtained from all participants who present at a clinic in response to an advertisement. The investigator will explain the study by using non-scientific language before the subjects read the terms of consent. Subjects will be given adequate time to decide whether they wish to participate before signing the consent form. After this process, if the subject spontaneously wishes to participate in the study, they will sign the consent form.</p><p>This trial is registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov protocol registration system, ID NCT01579877.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This clinical trial, which will be conducted as one of the nationwide projects to provide scientific evidence for TKM, belongs to the 2011 Traditional Korean Medicine R&#x00026;D projects funded by the Ministry for Health &#x00026; Welfare &#x00026; Family Affairs, Republic of Korea.</p><p>The present study emphasizes the significance of treatment for xerostomia in the elderly, which has been neglected clinically up to this point, and can play an important role in giving prominence to treatment for this condition. We anticipate that this study will reveal that a herbal prescription and a typical TKM treatment method, YMJ, can be an alternative treatment for xerostomia in the elderly, a condition that presently has no suitable remedy.</p><p>In general, herbal medicine is a key tool of TKM treatment and is known to have a great curative power for many diseases
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. YMJ, which is one of the most frequently used herbal formulas in Korea, is regarded to be safe and to have a beneficial effect on xerostomia in the elderly
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, no randomized controlled trials have shown the effectiveness of YMJ for xerostomia. Therefore, the current study was designed to obtain objective clinical evidence on the effects and safety of YMJ for the treatment of xerostomia in the elderly. If the effects of YMJ are verified in the present study, it could be used as a new alternative treatment option by elderly individuals with xerostomia, which is highly prevalent and without established standard therapies in conventional medicine.</p><p>The current study has three potential strengths. First, it is unique because the subjects of this study will have general xerostomia without the structural damage to the salivary glands that occurs with autoimmune disease or a history of radiation. Second, the &#x02018;<italic>Yin-deficiency</italic>&#x02019; questionnaire, an indigenous pattern identification tool in TKM, will be applied to diagnose the subjects&#x02019; xerostomia according to TKM theory. If a high correlation is found between xerostomia in the elderly and &#x02018;<italic>Yin-deficiency</italic>&#x02019;, this will provide reasonable evidence for prescribing YMJ for xerostomia in the elderly. Third, we will determine whether YMJ can change the subjective feeling of dry mouth as well as the salivary flow rate. Although the relationship between a subjective feeling of dry mouth and the salivary flow rate is controversial
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], the change in these factors in association with YMJ treatment could be compared in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>This study is currently recruiting patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AE: Adverse event; CRA: Clinical research associate; CRC: Clinical research coordinator; CRF: Case report form; CRO: Contract research organization; DMSQ: Dry mouth symptom questionnaire; Ig A: Immunoglobulin A; IRB: Institutional review board; QoL: Quality of life; SAE: Serious adverse event; SSFR: Stimulated salivary flow rate; TKM: Traditional Korean medicine; USFR: Unstimulated salivary flow rate; VAS: Visual analogue scale; YMJ: <italic>Yukmijihwang-tang.</italic></p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>JSK, JWP, and BHR contributed to securing funding for the project and to the study design.
