Probiotics have been reported to benefit IBS symptoms but the level of benefit remains quite unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>This study was designed to assess the benefit of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> I-3856 on IBS symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial has been performed in 379 subjects with diagnosed IBS. Subjects were randomly supplemented with the probiotics (1000&#x02009;mg) or placebo for 12 weeks. Questionnaires (gastrointestinal symptoms, stools, wellbeing, and quality of life) were completed. Primary endpoint was percentage of responders defined as having a 50% decrease in the weekly average &#x0201c;intestinal pain/discomfort score&#x0201d; for at least 4 out of the last 8 weeks of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no overall benefit of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> I-3856 on IBS symptoms and wellbeing in the study population.

Despite increased understanding there have been few new therapies introduced, and a combination of rare adverse effects and very low tolerance of side effects has led to the withdrawal of some effective therapies, notably alosetron and tegaserod.</p><p>Recent interest has therefore focused on drugs (e.g. lubiprostone, linaclotide) or agents like pro- and prebiotics whose actions are confined to the lumen with a perceived low likelihood of unwanted systemic effects.</p><p>There are numerous studies suggesting possible benefit of probiotics on IBS symptoms but the results are variable.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr5-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr6-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr7-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr8-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> This heterogeneity arises because different strains have different modes of action and also because IBS patients were often unselected and hence heterogeneous as regards bowel habit and underlying disease mechanism. Regrettably, few studies have included a mechanistic component so it is unclear exactly which of their numerous putative effects demonstrated in the laboratory are responsible for benefit in clinical practice.</p><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> I-3856, a strain from Lesaffre baker&#x02019;s yeast collection, in common with most yeasts secretes numerous saccharolytic enzymes which may assist the intestinal microbiota in generating short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and alcohols which are known to exert a prokinetic effect at least in the small intestine.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> This suggests that, like <italic>Bifidobacterium lactis</italic>,<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>
<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> I-3856 might be most effective for IBS with constipation.

The sample size determination was calculated on the basis of this previous clinical study. We hypothesized a difference of 15% between the two groups. However, this hypothesis may be too optimistic making our study underpowered to detect the small difference observed. In the present RCT, around half our patients (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;180) had IBS-C and this subgroup does appear to benefit with notable reduction in abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating and composite scores of IBS symptoms. Pain scores fell 1.1 on a seven-point scale, which is similar to the fall observed in other recent trials of IBS-C,<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> representing a 34% reduction from baseline. This current larger study was designed to confirm pilot data observed with the same yeast strain in unselected IBS patients where a greater improvement in pain was noted with a single 500&#x02009;mg daily dose, given for 8 weeks.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The current study used a higher dose (1000&#x02009;mg daily) which was well tolerated. The larger number and more detailed characterization of the IBS subtype allowed us to see that the beneficial effect was confined to those with constipation. A previous mechanistic study in IBS with constipation using <italic>Bifidobacterium infantis</italic> showed an acceleration of both small and large bowel transit.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Accelerating small bowel transit would be predicted to increase the influx of ileal contents into the caecum and secondarily accelerate colonic transit.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The underlying mechanism related to accelerated bowel transit is unclear but could relate to the known stimulatory effect of SCFAs on ileal motility.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>These are likely to act via fatty acid receptors on enteroendocrine cells. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> yeasts have extensive fermentative capacity and may increase small bowel SCFA levels though this has yet to be confirmed experimentally. It is worth noting that the presence of large numbers of live organisms in the upper small bowel is the major change induced by consuming probiotics, given the low level of organisms normally present. In contrast, in the colon, the impact is much less as they are diluted by the 10<sup>13</sup> organisms already present. This can be seen more clearly now that we can accurately non-invasively measure gut volumes using Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The normal fasting small bowel volume averages just 90&#x02009;mL,<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> while the fasting colon volume averages 561&#x02009;mL.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The commensal bacterial titer is low, usually below 10<sup>5</sup> while the titer of the colon can reach a concentration of 10<sup>13</sup>/mL of normal commensals. Consequently, assuming a uniform distribution, the ingestion of two capsules of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> I-3856 containing 8&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup> CFU/g would barely alter colonic organism numbers while increasing small bowel organism numbers 40,000 fold. In our study, the hypothesis of accelerated transit has not been validated by measure of the colonic transit time. However the number of complete spontaneous bowel movements reported by subjects was numerically higher on active group in IBS-C subtype and the stools did tend to be softer on active group compared to placebo, suggesting transit may well have been accelerated. Other studies measuring transit before and after treatment would be required to test the hypothesis of accelerated transit. Subjects included in the present protocol were not tested for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), which has been reported in 4&#x02013;19% of IBS patients,<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> the precise incidence depending on the methods used. Its role in causing IBS symptoms is contentious but some studies suggest a modest benefit from antibiotic use.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> At present it is not usually used in screening patients subjected to clinical trials but if a more reliable method of testing was available this might be reconsidered in the future, especially when testing products like probiotics which might affect gut bacteria. Another consideration is whether a low FODMAP diet, as advocated by the group from Monash University to treat IBS patients complaining of bloating and flatulence,<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> should be tried before entering patients into future clinical trials. At present this is not standard practice but if more evidence from other units support this then perhaps this should change.</p><p>Why <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> benefits pain/discomfort remains quite unclear. While animal studies suggest it might reduce visceral hypersensitivity, the translation of such studies to benefit in clinical studies has a poor track record,<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2050640615602571" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> so the relevance of the animal studies is quite unclear. Recent evidence supports the idea that pain in IBS-C increases as the number of days without bowel movements increases. This is possibly due to increasing pressure being required to propel the harder stool that results from slow transit.
