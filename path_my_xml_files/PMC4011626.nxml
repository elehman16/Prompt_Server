Controlling morning BP surge is therefore important to help prevent onset of cardiovascular disease. We compared the efficacy of azilsartan and candesartan in controlling morning systolic BP (SBP) surges by analyzing relevant ambulatory BP monitoring data in patients with/without baseline BP surges. As part of a 16-week randomized, double-blind study of azilsartan (20&#x02013;40 mg once daily) and candesartan (8&#x02013;12 mg once daily) in Japanese patients with essential hypertension, an exploratory analysis was carried out using ambulatory BP monitoring at baseline and week 14. The effects of study drugs on morning BP surges, including sleep trough surge (early morning SBP minus the lowest night-time SBP) and prewaking surge (early morning SBP minus SBP before awakening), were evaluated. Patients with sleep trough surge of at least 35 mmHg were defined by the presence of a morning BP surge (the &#x02018;surge group&#x02019;). Sleep trough surge and prewaking surge data were available at both baseline and week 14 in 548 patients, 147 of whom (azilsartan 76; candesartan 71) had a baseline morning BP surge. In surge group patients, azilsartan significantly reduced both the sleep trough surge and the prewaking surge at week 14 compared with candesartan (least squares means of the between-group differences &#x02212;5.8 mmHg, <italic>P</italic>=0.0395; and &#x02212;5.7 mmHg, <italic>P</italic>=0.0228, respectively).

Early morning blood pressure (BP) elevation/hypertension is significantly related to an increased risk to organs such as the brain, heart, and kidney <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7,8</xref>, and it is therefore very important to manage early morning hypertension to help prevent the onset of cardiovascular events.</p><p>Two types of early morning hypertension have been reported: one that transitions from night-time hypertension (nondipper) and the other where BP increases markedly in the early morning (surge). Both types are reported to be risks for cardiovascular disease <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Although a moderate morning surge in BP is a normal physiological phenomenon, a marked BP surge is a risk factor for cardiovascular events and end-organ damage independent of the 24-h BP level <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;19</xref>. For example, in the recent IDACO (International Database on Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring in Relation to Cardiovascular Outcomes) study, a meta-analysis of cohort studies using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), it was found that morning BP surge was a risk factor for cardiovascular events independent of both the 24-h BP level and the fall of BP during the night (night-time BP/daytime BP) <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Similarly, the JMS-ABPM study (Wave 1) reported that morning BP surge is a risk factor for strokes independent of the 24-h BP level and that a morning systolic BP (SBP) surge of 10 mmHg increases the risk of stroke by 22% <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10,21</xref>. Therefore, controlling morning BP surge is important to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease. However, few antihypertensive agents administered once daily are capable of maintaining a BP-lowering effect over a full 24-h period. Thus, the following morning, when the antihypertensive effects begin to wear off, BP variations from the previous night may not be corrected; thus, early morning BP surges and hypertension may occur.</p><p>Azilsartan is a new angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) that is expected to exert a more potent and sustained BP-lowering effect compared with existing ARBs because of its receptor binding properties. In-vitro studies have shown that azilsartan exerts a more potent inhibitory effect on angiotensin II type 1 (AT<sub>1</sub>) receptors and dissociates more slowly from the receptor than other currently marketed ARBs, including olmesartan, telmisartan, valsartan, and irbesartan <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. In a recent randomized, double-blind, comparative study in Japanese patients with stage I&#x02013;II essential hypertension, azilsartan was found to have safety and tolerability similar to that of candesartan, but it showed superior antihypertensive efficacy. In addition, ABPM data indicated that azilsartan had a more sustained BP-lowering effect than candesartan, and was effective for a full 24-h period <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Moreover, a follow-up analysis from the randomized, double-blind, comparative study showed the efficacy of azilsartan against changes in night-time BP <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>.</p><p>In this exploratory analysis, we evaluated the efficacy of azilsartan relative to that of candesartan in controlling morning SBP surges by analyzing relevant ABPM data in patients with and without baseline BP surges.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In the previous study, azilsartan was compared with candesartan in Japanese patients over a period of 16 weeks at 33 centers in Japan between May 2009 and June 2010 (clinical trial identifier: JapicCTI-090762) <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. The study procedures, patient inclusion/exclusion criteria, dosage regimens, efficacy and safety endpoints, statistical analyses, and ethical provisions have been reported in detail previously <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, and will be described only briefly here. Patients received either azilsartan 20 mg daily for the first 8 weeks, followed by 40 mg daily for the second 8 weeks, or candesartan cilexetil (candesartan) 8 mg daily for the first 8 weeks, followed by 12 mg daily for the second 8 weeks. At baseline (week 0) and subsequently at week 14, ABPM was performed over a period of 26 h or higher, during which time BP was measured at 30-min intervals starting at 10:00 h (&#x000b1;1 h); full details of the ABPM method have been described in the previous report <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>.</p><sec><title>Analysis of morning BP surge by ABPM</title><p>Patients who underwent ABPM at baseline were classified as having a sleep trough surge (defined using criteria similar to those of the IDACO study <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) or no sleep trough surge. The following definitions were applied: early morning SBP was defined as the mean SBP measured during the 2-h period after awakening. SBP before awakening was defined as the mean SBP measured during the 2-h period before awakening. Lowest night-time SBP was defined as the mean SBP measured during the period 35 min before and after measurement of the lowest sleep SBP. Sleep trough surge was defined as an increase in SBP from the lowest night-time SBP to the early morning SBP, whereas prewaking surge was defined as the early morning SBP minus the SBP before awakening. The presence of a morning BP surge was defined as a sleep trough surge of at least 35 mmHg.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Differences between azilsartan and candesartan in controlling morning BP surges were analyzed by comparing the mean (&#x000b1;SD) decreases from baseline in sleep trough surge and prewaking surge recorded in the two treatment groups.

Among the ARBs, once-daily administration of candesartan has been reported to regulate sleep trough surges more potently than the ACE inhibitor lisinopril <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. In the present analysis, we compared the efficacy of azilsartan on morning BP surges with that of candesartan by analyzing ABPM data according to the presence or absence of sleep trough surge in a previously reported randomized, double-blind study of the two ARBs in Japanese patients with stage I&#x02013;II essential hypertension <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. The key findings of the study were that in patients with sleep trough surge at baseline, administration of azilsartan decreased the lowest night-time SBP, the early morning SBP, and the SBP before awakening to a significantly greater extent than candesartan. As a result of the marked reduction in early morning SBP, both the sleep trough surge and the prewaking surge in these patients were significantly reduced by azilsartan in comparison with candesartan (least square means of the between-treatment differences &#x02212;5.8, 95% CI &#x02212;11.34, &#x02212;0.28 mmHg, <italic>P</italic>=0.0395; and &#x02212;5.7, 95% CI &#x02212;10.68, &#x02212;0.81 mmHg, <italic>P</italic>=0.0228, respectively).</p><p>In patients without a sleep trough surge at baseline (nonsurge group), the magnitude of changes in sleep trough surges and prewaking surges was mildly increased in both treatment groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Azilsartan and candesartan considerably reduced night-time mean SBP and lowest night-time SBP from baseline; therefore, both drugs increased the absolute values of surges. However, in the nonsurge group, both drugs also reduced early morning SBP at week 14 from baseline (&#x02212;8.7 mmHg), which was relatively lower at baseline. In other words, in the nonsurge group, both drugs increased the absolute values of surges, but with the positive potential that enables them to control and maintain SBPs lower from night-time to early morning. Thereby, these mild increased surges in the nonsurge group were not considered to be clinically meaningful.</p><p>The effects of antihypertensive agents on morning BP surges vary according to their mechanisms of action and the duration of their effects <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. Early-morning enhancement of the renin&#x02013;angiotensin system (RAS), endothelial functional disorder, and progression of vascular remodeling are considered to be involved in the enhancement of morning BP surges <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. As RAS inhibitors are expected to have a morning BP surge-regulating action, by controlling the early morning enhancement of RAS, they may also improve small vessel remodeling, thereby stabilizing early morning BP in the long term <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>.</p><p>Several clinical studies have shown that the effects of RAS inhibitors on morning BP surges vary from one drug to another. Whereas once-daily administration of candesartan has been shown to have a potent effect in regulating sleep trough BP surges <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, valsartan had no effect in regulating sleep trough surges <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. This difference is believed to be related to the duration of the antihypertensive effect of these ARBs.</p><p>In an earlier in-vitro study, azilsartan was shown to have a more potent inhibitory effect on AT<sub>1</sub> receptors and to dissociate more slowly from the receptor than other ARBs <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. In the randomized, double-blind comparative study in Japanese patients with stage I&#x02013;II essential hypertension from which ABPM data for the present study were derived, once-daily administration of azilsartan exerted a more potent and sustained 24-h BP-lowering effect than candesartan <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Therefore, the effect of azilsartan on morning BP surges may be related to its sustained action on the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the fact that several different definitions have been applied in studies of morning BP surges carried out to date. Although there is consensus that morning BP surges are associated with cardiovascular events, no consensus on their precise definition has been reached as yet <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. In this analysis, the lowest night-time SBP, the early morning SBP, the SBP before awakening, the sleep trough surge, and the prewaking surge were defined as mentioned above (see the Methods section) using the study of Kario <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> as a reference. In addition, the occurrence of a sleep trough BP surge was defined as an increase of SBP from the lowest night-time SBP to the mean early morning SBP of at least 35 mmHg by reference to the definition in the IDACO study, which is the largest study of the correlation between morning BP surges and cardiovascular events published to date (IDACO used the definition of at least 37 mmHg) <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. However, in the study of Kario and colleagues, an increase in SBP of at least 55 mmHg from the lowest sleep level to the early morning level was applied to examine the prognostic implications of morning BP surges for silent and clinical cerebrovascular disease in elderly hypertensive patients; this higher morning BP surge was associated with a higher risk of stroke than lower morning SBP surges (less than 55 mmHg) <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. A further limitation of the present study relates to the reproducibility of morning BP surges measured by conventional ABPM. This is because the time at which surges arise cannot be determined accurately and the extent of the surge is influenced by day-to-day variability of physical activity <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Because arising and ambulating from supine sleep is the major determinant of morning BP surges, BP may show little change if the patient remains supine after awakening <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Also, this study was a short-term evaluation, and did not evaluate the efficacy of the study medication in reducing cardiovascular events. The dosage selection of candesartan in this study should also be considered as another limitation. The rationale for increasing candesartan up to 12 mg daily is that, in Japan, the approved maximum daily dosage of candesartan is 12 mg. The antihypertensive efficacy of candesartan 12 mg, telmisartan 80 mg, valsartan 160 mg, and olmesartan 40 mg has been shown to be equivalent to that of enalapril 20 mg in Japanese patients with hypertension <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;34</xref>. Therefore, further evaluations using large-scale databases are needed to determine the threshold morning BP surge level associated with an increased cardiovascular risk.</p><p>Although no study has scientifically shown that selective regulation of morning BP surges will limit the onset of cardiovascular events and target organ damage, it is clear that a sustained morning BP surge is a risk factor for cardiovascular events and organ damage independent of the 24-h BP level <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;19</xref>. The current study has shown that azilsartan exerts a more pronounced effect in suppressing morning BP surges than candesartan. Thus, in addition to its potent and sustained antihypertensive effect, azilsartan may be expected to control morning BP surges and thereby help prevent the onset of cardiovascular events.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank all the patients, physicians, and medical staff who supported this study, and Content Ed Net for editorial assistance with the manuscript, which was funded by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.</p><sec><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>H.R. and K.K. served as medical experts for this study.
