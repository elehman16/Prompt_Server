However, the field has lacked a compelling model for how to use information about personality to facilitate patients&#x02019; engagement in treatment. Patient-centered models of assessment and feedback, such as Finn&#x02019;s semi-structured approach (&#x0201c;therapeutic assessment&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], are well suited for this purpose. In this approach, patients are viewed as collaborators who work with an assessor to define assessment goals and help interpret assessment results. Use of assessment results in this manner is theorized to facilitate positive change in patients by addressing needs of self-verification, self-enhancement, and self-discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The efficacy of this approach for increasing readiness for and engagement in mental health treatment is supported by quasi-experimental and pragmatic trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], randomized trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and a meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, this approach has not been used to facilitate patients&#x02019; engagement in SUD treatment.</p><p>We developed a patient-centered intervention using assessment and feedback of personality data for patients entering residential SUD treatment. Briefly, upon entry to a residential SUD program, patients are assessed with the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], a measure of normal-range personality, and are provided with personalized feedback describing: (a) how their personality profile compares to that of their age-related peers; (b) their possible pattern of adjustment to the treatment milieu; and (c) cognitive-behavioral assignments that can help address problematic behavioral tendencies. This approach is expected to help patients adapt to the demands of the residential setting by enabling them to anticipate how their personal tendencies may impact their treatment experiences. Further, the assessment of normal-range personality dimensions allows patients to feel recognized as unique individuals rather than as psychiatric patients with a pathological condition. Finally, the assessment results (a description of the patient in &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; personality terms) are also provided to treatment staff to facilitate their ability to empathize with patients and assist with the development of more individualized treatment plans for patients.</p><p>This patient-centered intervention follows several principles of collaborative forms of assessment, particularly the principles of therapeutic assessment espoused by Finn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For example, patients work with an assessor to develop individualized assessment questions in terms of what they would like to learn about themselves from the personality assessment, identify behavioral tendencies they would like to work on or change, or how to get the most out of the residential program. To facilitate this, patients are presented with brief descriptions of the personality domains that are measured by the NEO PI-R and are asked if any are of particular interest to them and why. During the feedback session, patients are encouraged to assist with interpretation of the assessment results in terms of how well the test&#x02019;s description of their personality does or does not match their experiences in the residential milieu and in the context of their lives more generally. Consistent with the tenets of therapeutic assessment, the assessor is encouraged to maintain empathic connections with patients during all sessions and to discuss and acknowledge patients&#x02019; past assessment experiences and any reservations they may have about the current assessment process.</p><p>In addition to its use of therapeutic assessment principles, this intervention incorporates several elements of a personality assessment system for SUD patients that was developed by Moffett, Steinberg, and Rhode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Specifically, the present intervention involves: (a) the assessment of normal, rather than abnormal, personality traits; (b) feedback to patients on their possible adjustment to the treatment milieu, given their personality profile; and (c) treatment recommendations that may help the patient maximize his/her benefit from the program. Consistent with Moffett et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], with patients&#x02019; permission, assessment results are also shared with the staff of the residential program. In contrast to Moffett et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], the present intervention does not include a reassessment of the patient&#x02019;s personality during treatment in order to revise his or her treatment plan. Rather, it includes a follow-up session with the patient one month into treatment to discuss the consistency of the assessment findings with the patient&#x02019;s treatment experiences and progress toward treatment goals, and the utility of the previously suggested treatment recommendations.</p><p>The objectives of the present study were to examine the acceptability of a patient-centered feedback intervention using assessment and feedback of personality data and efficacy of the intervention to increase early engagement in SUD treatment. This investigation was designed as a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with the goal of obtaining preliminary data on the objectives; thus, it corresponds to a Stage I trial in the stage model of behavioral therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants included 30 patients entering a 90-day residential SUD treatment program. Patients were mostly male (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;28); ranged in age from 26 to 64&#x000a0;years (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;49.07&#x000a0;years, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;11.15); had 13&#x000a0;years of education, on average (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.27); were predominantly Caucasian (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;18); and were not currently married (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;28). On average, patients had three prior episodes of residential SUD care (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.26).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design and procedures</title><p>Within one week of entry into the residential program, patients were recruited and randomly assigned to either the feedback (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;17) or control (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) condition. We oversampled for patients in the feedback condition to maximize information on perceptions of the intervention&#x02014;i.e., prior to recruitment, a list of 30 numbers (20 corresponding to the feedback condition, and 15 corresponding to the control condition) were put into random order in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. As patients entered the study, a research assistant added the patient to the randomization spreadsheet, notified the patient of his/her assignment, and scheduled the initial session with the Intervention Coordinator (IC).</p><p>The intervention procedures were conducted by a masters-level clinician who served as the IC. The IC was trained in the feedback protocol by the lead author. The training protocol included mock intervention sessions with the lead author and practice intervention sessions with eight SUD patients from the target program. The lead author was trained in the principles of therapeutic assessment by Dr. Finn and other members of the Center for Therapeutic Assessment through multiple in-person courses.</p><p>For the randomized trial, patients in the feedback condition completed three sessions with the IC. Sessions were videotaped and reviewed weekly with the lead author to ensure the IC&#x02019;s fidelity to the protocol:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>Initial session</italic> (8.3 mean days after treatment entry, SD = 3.0): Patients completed assessments of sociodemographics, treatment history, substance-related functioning, and personality. Next, patients worked with the IC to develop individualized assessment questions geared toward what they wanted to learn about themselves from the personality assessment, behavioral tendencies they wanted to work on or change, or how to get the most out of the residential program. To facilitate this, patients were presented with brief descriptions of the five broad domains of personality that are measured by the NEO PI-R and were asked if any were of particular interest to them and why. Patients were then asked to rate (a) how they thought their scores on the NEO PI-R compared to those of others their age and gender, and (b) their &#x0201c;ideal&#x0201d; personality. Responses to both sets of questions were given on a 5-point scale (1 = much lower than others my age, 5 = much higher than others my age) and were used by the IC to engage patients in a discussion of their current beliefs about their personality. This approach to administration of the NEO PI-R was used to assist the patient and IC in the development of individualized assessment questions (e.g., &#x0201c;How do I compare to others in terms of self-esteem and anger?&#x0201d;), as well as to help the IC understand aspects of the patient&#x02019;s personality in which he or she might lack insight. This information was then used by the IC to develop a personalized summary sheet of the assessment results. To maximize the patient&#x02019;s comprehension, feedback was limited to three or four test findings, with priority given to information that: (a) was relevant to the patient&#x02019;s assessment questions; (b) matched the patient&#x02019;s current self-perception; and (c) expanded the patient&#x02019;s knowledge about his or her personality.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Patient-centered feedback session</italic> (13.8 mean days after treatment entry; SD = 4.9): The IC provided patients with a summary sheet describing: (a) how their personality profile compared to that of others their age and gender; (b) how their personality might impact their adjustment to the program; and (c) recommendations to help address problematic behavioral tendencies. An example of feedback given to a patient in the feedback condition is shown in the <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>. For each assessment finding presented by the IC, the patient was encouraged to assist with its interpretation in terms of how well the description of his/her personality did or did not match his/her experiences in the milieu and life more generally, as well as which behavioral tendencies (as measured by the NEO PI-R) he/she wanted to prioritize in treatment.

Four patients (all from the control condition) who had previously attended the program were excluded from these analyses to balance the conditions in terms of having no prior exposure to the treatment milieu. Patients in the feedback condition had higher ratings on all program adjustment indices, with generally large effect sizes (average Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.63; range&#x02009;=&#x02009;.48&#x02013;.72). Patients in the feedback condition reported significantly more positive relations with other residents and had significantly higher scores on the program alliance composite. There were no statistically significant differences between conditions on treatment outcomes. However, those in the feedback condition had a longer length of stay in the program (i.e., approximately 7&#x000a0;days, on average) than those in the control condition, which equated to a small to medium effect size.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study represents a Stage I efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] trial of a patient-centered feedback intervention based on the results of personality testing, which aimed to increase patients&#x02019; engagement in SUD treatment. This intervention is novel because of its application of therapeutic assessment principles to an SUD population, as well as its integration of these principles with the personality assessment system for SUD patients developed by Moffett and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The findings provide preliminary support for the acceptability and efficacy of this intervention to facilitate early engagement in SUD treatment and highlight the clinical utility of providing patient-centered feedback on personality testing to SUD patients. Accordingly, this work lays the foundation for larger trials with additional follow-up assessments to test the efficacy of this intervention to increase retention in SUD care and improve outcomes post-treatment (i.e., a Stage II trial) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>While encouraging, the findings should be interpreted with caution, given the small sample size, short follow-up period, and exclusive use of patient reports to measure the indicators of treatment engagement. In addition, it is not clear which component of the intervention&#x02014;the patient-centered assessment process with patients, or the feedback to staff and discussion of how to modify treatment plans based on a patient&#x02019;s personality profile&#x02014;contributed to the higher ratings of program adjustment at the 1-month mark. Although testing of this intervention is still in the preliminary stages, if evidence accumulates to support its efficacy, research designs should evaluate the incremental contribution of the staff feedback component of the intervention to determine its association with outcomes, above and beyond the impact of providing feedback to patients only.</p><p>In terms of treatment outcomes, although the impacts of the intervention on length of stay and premature dropout were in the expected directions, they were not statistically significant. Notwithstanding the fact that power was limited in this small sample, it is possible that the dosing of the intervention may need to be increased in order to have a more beneficial impact on treatment outcomes. For example, an additional follow-up session and/or reassessment of patients&#x02019; personality at the end of treatment may boost the positive 1-month effects and provide patients with data on progress toward their treatment goals. Notably, this modification would align the intervention with measurement-based models of care, which have shown promise in the treatment of SUD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Further, future work should examine the impact of the intervention on treatment outcomes beyond 1&#x000a0;month, particularly post-treatment outcomes such as engagement in continuing care, substance use, and functioning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings of this pilot RCT highlight the clinical utility of providing SUD patients with patient-centered feedback based on the results of personality testing, and provide preliminary support for the acceptability and efficacy of this intervention to facilitate early engagement in residential treatment.
