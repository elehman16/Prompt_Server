Due to its insidious nature and irreversible consequences, OAG is considered to fulfil the criteria for population screening. However, there are no randomised controlled trials that demonstrate the effectiveness of screening for preventing blindness from OAG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>OAG is the most common type of glaucoma with a prevalence of 1.5-2% in the Caucasian population aged over 50. The worldwide number of OAG patients is estimated to be 61 million and approximately 6.7 million of them are bilaterally blind due to glaucoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The onset and progression of the chronic optic neuropathy due to OAG is asymptomatic until the late phase of the disease when central vision is also affected. The progression rate of OAG varies, but it has been estimated to take a mean time of 23&#x000a0;years without treatment and 35&#x000a0;years with treatment to progress from mild visual field (VF) damage to at least unilateral blindness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Still up to 5% of the patients with newly diagnosed OAG are blind in at least one eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A retrospective study in Finland revealed the cumulative incidence of unilateral blindness to be 6% at five years, 9% at 10&#x000a0;years and 15% at 15&#x000a0;years after glaucoma diagnosis. Risk factors for impending blindness were advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, poor compliance and fluctuation of intraocular pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. As for the risk factors of OAG itself, increasing age, elevated IOP, family history of glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, myopia and African origin have been identified so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>To date there is no systematic glaucoma screening in any country and most glaucoma cases are diagnosed by chance. Epidemiological studies have shown that at least half of the glaucoma patients are still undiagnosed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. An organized screening program could be a cost-effective strategy in older age groups (75&#x02013;79&#x000a0;years of age) based on a synthetic Markov model comparing regular screening to opportunistic case-finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, the results were sensitive to the estimates of several parameters, especially screening cost and specificity of screening tests. In screening, there should be a validated test with good sensitivity and specificity. This has been a major problem in glaucoma screening: there is no &#x0201c;golden standard&#x0201d; for the diagnosis and definition of the OAG is highly subjective depending on the observer and the set of tests. The definition of abnormality is based on the normative data of different diagnostic elements and the combination of them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, structural abnormalities in the optic nerve head (ONH) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) may precede functional defects in the visual fields. In a cross-sectional setting, the mean correlation between the structural and functional tests is only 35% (range 22-59%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the past decades diagnostic imaging instruments have been developed to overcome the subjectivity of the evaluations in the diagnostics. Still it is apparent that a single test is insufficient to find the persons with or without glaucoma and the best combination of the tests is unknown. In screening, a reliable protocol for the detection of true glaucoma is more important than early detection.</p><p>The NFBC main study was set out to explore the long-term morbidity, disease markers, spectrum of symptoms and psychosocial wellbeing throughout the life span. This unselected, geographically defined population sample consists of individuals born in 1966. The NFBC Eye Study includes three separate entities: the diagnostics of glaucoma, the effect of screening on glaucoma incidence and the cost-effectiveness of screening for glaucoma and other eye diseases. The analysis for the diagnostics is based on both cross-sectional and cohort designs whereas the analysis for the cost-effectiveness is based on randomised controlled design. Hence, the trial seeks to address the following questions: (i) what is the best combination of diagnostic tests for detecting glaucoma in an unscreened population, (ii) what are the benefits and disadvantages of the eye screening to the individual and the society and (iii) is glaucoma screening both effective and cost-effective. Other eye diseases as well as related factors, e.g. retinal perfusion parameters, diabetic retinopathy, early changes related to macular degeneration, presbyopia and vision associated quality of life, are also assessed. Also the relationship between birth weight and growth patterns during early life to eye diseases is evaluated. The purpose of the NFBC Eye Study is to evaluate the diagnostic methods and cost-effectiveness of glaucoma screening as well as other ocular morbidity in middle-aged Caucasian population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>The NFBC main study</title><p>The original cohort consists of 12058 subjects born in the region of Lapland and the Province of Oulu (96% of the deliveries in these regions). The cohort is comprised of males and females in approximately equal proportions (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The mothers of the subjects were recruited to the study on the basis of the expected birth date in 1966. This unique cohort has been followed prospectively since the 24<sup>th</sup> gestational week.

The study has received approval from the Ethical Committee of the Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District. The cohort was randomised to two groups: 50% undergo the eye examination and 50% are not examined. Thus, half of the cohort will be screened and the other half represents the opportunistic case finding model. The subjects randomised to the screening arm with a former diagnosis of glaucoma will undergo the screening protocol in order to evaluate the accuracy of the diagnosis. The pilot study was conducted in 2012 in order to test the study flow. Participants of the pilot study were healthy volunteers from the general population with a mean age of 49&#x000a0;years (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;80).</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>Out of the original cohort, 460 subjects have died and 961 have moved abroad. 10300 subjects with an address in Finland were included in the randomisation. The participants were stratified into three categories based on gender, age and postcode. The subjects were divided into four age categories according to their month of birth: January-March, April-June, July-September and October-December. They were divided into 13 postcode categories roughly following the regional centres of the national mail agency Itella. All in all, there were 104 (2 &#x000d7; 4 &#x000d7; 13) strata for randomisation. Randomisation was performed using Resampling Stats software (Resampling Stats Inc., Arlington, Virginia, USA). The epidemiologist responsible for the randomisation was blinded to all other information than the factors used for stratification.</p></sec><sec><title>Screening</title><p>The subjects randomised to the eye screening group (50%) undergo the examinations presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The examinations are performed by experienced study personnel (optometrist, perimetrist and photographer). Each subject is examined only once. An ophthalmologist will not participate in the examination of the subjects but is available for consultation. Up to ten subjects are examined daily, each of them requiring an average time of 65&#x000a0;minutes for eye screening with this comprehensive protocol.</p><table-wrap position="float"

Static white-on-white perimetry (white test points on a white background) limited to the 24 degree central area is considered to be the current standard for detecting glaucomatous visual field defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Numerical data e.g. reliability indices, glaucoma hemi-field test (GHT), visual field index (VFI), mean deviation and pattern standard deviation are documented. Evaluation of the overall reliability and suspicion of glaucoma is made by two independent ophthalmologists. Suspicion of early glaucomatous field loss is based on the following three parameters: reduction of sensitivity at the minimum of three clustered points with significance of p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 and one of them with significance of p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 on pattern deviation map, glaucoma hemi-field test (GHT) regarded as &#x0201c;borderline&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;outside normal limits&#x0201d; or pattern standard deviation abnormal at p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 level. The visual fields are considered to be reliable if the rate of false-positives is less than 15% and the rate of fixation losses is less than 20%.</p></sec><sec><title>Stereoscopic ONH and RNFL imaging</title><p>Color and grayscale digital fundus images are obtained with a Canon CF-60DSi Digital Mydriatic Fundus Camera with attached Canon EOS-1Ds MK III SLR Digital Camera (Canon Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The pupils are dilated for imaging. The images are processed with Adobe Photoshop CS (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) and Neacapture software (Neagen Ltd., Oulu, Finland). Stereoscopic ONH photography still represents the standard for detecting glaucomatous damage and progression of the optic disc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The separate RNFL photographs are taken with a monochromatic blue interference filter (495&#x000a0;nm) using the camera described above.

It is a large cohort with more than 10 000 subjects in follow-up. It is population-based and very homogenous in respect to many important, potentially confounding, factors. Hence, the results are applicable to populations with a Caucasian ethnic origin.</p><p>The cohort is unique as the subjects have been prospectively followed since the 24<sup>th</sup> gestational week. In addition to the glaucoma screening tests, also examinations suitable for diagnosing other eye diseases are obtained, e.g. macular OCT and fundus photography. The prospective follow-up allows the evaluation of the relationship between birth weight and growth patterns during early life to eye diseases. Risk factors and their value in predicting future glaucoma and other eye abnormalities will also be assessed.</p><p>The main challenge for glaucoma research is the lack of the diagnostic reference method, i.e. the golden standard. Any single conventional or modern diagnostic test is not reliable enough to detect a new or progressing glaucoma on its own. To date the diagnosis and determination of stability or instability of glaucoma has been based largely on the subjective expert opinion on structural and functional tests. The opinion between experts still tends to vary: the range of kappa statistic strength of agreement in different cross-sectional studies has been 0.5-0.9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. From this point of view, objective imaging tools are expected to be useful to get a more objective evaluation of the RNFL and ONH. Still, the management decisions should not be based solely on the results of a single technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The visual fields and the imaging results of HRT, GDx and OCT are also subject to fluctuation. Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy and the variability of test results disturb the detection of progression. Progression during follow-up will be used a reference standard for the diagnosis as progression is a part of the definition of glaucoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Repeated testing has been shown to reduce the variability of test results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, in a population screening setting, it is not feasible to perform repeated screening tests to all subjects. In the current study, only subjects with glaucomatous findings are referred to hospital for treatment and follow-up. It should be noted that this trial offers meticulous eye examinations for glaucoma screening but not actual treatment and care.</p><p>The effectiveness of screening can best be demonstrated by a randomised controlled setting. To date randomised diagnostic studies in glaucoma have been missing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. To our knowledge, this study is the first randomised controlled trial on glaucoma screening in an unselected population. Optimal intervention and prevention of the diseases may be possible if the high-risk groups are detected early. It is known that no single test is sufficient to discriminate persons with and without glaucoma but the optimum set and number of diagnostic tests is unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Moreover, a single examination of functional damage may not be reliable and the repeated test should be done in case of suspected damage.</p><p>In 10&#x000a0;years&#x02019; time the entire cohort (both the screened and the controls) will be examined with a similar screening protocol described here. The incidence of glaucoma and other eye diseases in both groups will be evaluated and the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of glaucoma screening for preventing blindness can be assessed. So far, there has not been compatible evidence for calculating the cost-utility of glaucoma screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A European multi-centre randomised screening trial has been suggested to evaluate cost-effectiveness in preventing glaucoma induced visual impairment. The NFBC eye study is designed to provide the much needed high quality evidence for the evaluation of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of glaucoma screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>VS participated in the design of the study, data analysis and writing the manuscript.
