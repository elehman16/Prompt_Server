Most of these studies, however, were limited by the short duration of observations and lack of sham acupuncture as the control group. Our preliminary experiments showed that the use of a warm needling achieved a much more persistent effect in the treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR) compared with simple acupuncture therapy. Hence, we have designed a multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which the first-line medication loratadine will be used as the control group, and the effect of warm needling therapy will be evaluated through long-term observation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The trial is designed as a multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, single-blinded (outcome assessors), non-inferiority trial. A total of 98 patients with persistent AR will be randomly assigned into two groups. Patients in the treatment group will be treated with warm needling at GV14 and acupuncture at EX-HN3, ST2, LI20, EX-HN8, GV23, LU7, LU5 and LI4 three times a week, for a total of 4&#x000a0;weeks. Patients in the control group will be treated with oral loratadine 10&#x000a0;mg/day for 4&#x000a0;weeks. The primary outcome will be the change in the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) from baseline to that at 6&#x000a0;months after treatment during the follow-up period. The secondary outcomes will include the Total Non-nasal Symptom Score and the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire, changes in the TNSS from baseline to that at 2 and 4&#x000a0;weeks during treatment, and 3&#x000a0;months after treatment during the follow-up period. Outcomes will be measured at 2 and 4&#x000a0;weeks, and 3 and 6&#x000a0;months after treatment. Any side effects of treatment will be observed and recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We expect that the study results will provide evidence to determine the effects of warm needling compared with loratadine.

AR is a worldwide health problem affecting people of all ages. The reported incidence of AR is 11.8&#x02013;46&#x000a0;% worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and 11.1&#x02013;19.1&#x000a0;% in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. AR is classified into intermittent allergic rhinitis (IAR) and persistent allergic rhinitis (PAR) according to the time of exposure. The major symptoms of AR include rhinorrhea, nasal itching, nasal obstruction, and sneezing. These symptoms can resolve spontaneously or with treatment. AR may cause disruption in sleep cycles and emotional balance, and impair daily activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Untreated AR can also trigger other diseases such as bronchial asthma, sinusitis, nasal polyps, otitis media, and allergic conjunctivitis, resulting in significant psychological disturbance and economic burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The current mainstream medical management of AR primarily includes allergen avoidance, pharmacotherapy, immunotherapy and patient education. These treatments, however, do not always provide complete relief of symptoms and are not usually cost-effective, and like other medications they come with undesirable side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although newer-generation medications have been developed, the issue of side effects has not been resolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, pharmacotherapy only provides quick symptom relief in the case of PAR and becomes less effective in recurrent cases due to the development of medication tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Immunotherapy can reduce the natural duration of AR and provide symptom control; however, it can cause a local or systemic anaphylactic reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, a safe and long-term effective treatment modality for AR is needed to provide symptom relief, regulate immune system function, decrease frequency and severity of AR recurrence, and prevent the condition from progressing.</p><p>The results from our previous international, multicenter clinical study in collaboration with South Korea revealed that 4-week long, active acupuncture treatment was significantly better at reducing AR symptoms compared with sham acupuncture and non-active treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, AR symptoms continued to reduce in the subsequent 4-weeks of follow-up, indicating the residual effect of acupuncture. Previous studies have demonstrated that moxibustion has a regulative effect on immune system function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Consequently, we have optimized the intervention scheme to warm needling. There are two types of warm needling, the one we used consists of placing an ignited moxa stick on the handle of the needle after insertion. Our hypothesis is that warm needling will achieve equal or better long-term symptom relief of AR and reduce its recurrence.</p><p>In previous studies of immunotherapy and pharmacotherapy effects on AR, the placebo control group treatment provided over 50&#x000a0;% symptom relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In previous clinical studies of AR treated with acupuncture therapy, placebo acupuncture was widely adopted as the control group. In this study, however, we have selected western medicine as the positive control instead of placebo acupuncture. Oral antihistamines are usually the first-line medication for AR symptom relief. Loratadine, as a second-generation antihistamine agent, has a strong selective antagonistic effect on the peripheral histamine H1 receptors, providing long-lasting effect without sedating the central nervous system. Not only is loratadine used in relieving and preventing AR-associated symptoms such as rhinorrhea, itching, sneezing, nasal blockage, and ocular symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], it is also widely used in the treatment of other allergic diseases. After a detailed evaluation of the desired and the adverse effects, we chose loratadine as the intervention for the control group.</p><p>We have designed a multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) for patients with PAR, using oral loratadine as control. The purpose of this trial is to answer two questions: (1) is the effect obtained by warm needling equal to or better than that achieved by loratadine? and (2) is the treatment of warm needling safe for patients with PAR?</p><p>The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT02339714">NCT02339714</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The trial is designed as multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, single-blinded (outcome assessors), non-inferiority trial, comparing the differences between warm needling therapy and loratadine for PAR.</p><p>We will recruit 98 patients with PAR from three hospitals in China.

Clinical recruitment staff will be in charge of the enrollment process of the 98 participants with PAR. Participants will be screened based on the inclusive and exclusive criteria, be briefed on the purpose, procedures, treatments and possible risks of the trial, and be clearly inform of their rights to discontinue participation in the clinical study. The screening process takes about 1&#x000a0;week, requiring the participants to fill in questionnaires on symptoms during the 1-week period. Upon participants signing off the consent forms, the staff will then assign the recruited patients to different intervention groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Randomization</title><p>The patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the warm needling group or the loratadine group. The randomization sequence was computer-generated by the Clinical Evaluation Center of CACMS and the corresponding group name will be kept in a sealed and consecutively numbered security envelope. The envelope will be kept by the recruitment staff of the three centers. After all patients have signed the informed consent form, the envelopes will be opened. The patients will receive either warm needling treatment or oral medication of loratadine treatment according to their assigned group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Blinding</title><p>Since the acupuncture group and the medication group have different characteristics regarding intervening measures and approaches, it is not feasible to blind both the operators and patients. Instead we adopted the single-blinded trial where both the outcome evaluator and statistical analyst will be blinded to the groupings and they will not be involved in any part of the treatments during trial to ensure that there no form of bias results. At the end of the observation period, un-blinding is permissible only after database blinding approval and data block.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Follow-up</title><p>Upon completion of the 4-week treatment period, there is a further 6-month follow-up period. The research staff will continue to follow the participants via telephone communication and short messaging service (SMS). The frequency of follow-up is monthly and we will keep a record of the assessment of symptoms and medication compliance or changes. In the event of participants discontinuing or deviating from intervention protocols, the study staff will record the reasons for this and their medications and then exclude the participants from the study, and the latest outcome data including symptoms and frequency of the attacks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Treatment group</title><p>Licensed acupuncture physicians will provide warm needling treatment three times a week for 4&#x000a0;weeks.

The baseline variables will include: center location, age, gender, highest education level achieved, employment, diagnosis, nasal mucosal examination result, allergen examination result, typical symptoms, occurrence time of symptoms, time of recurrence or aggravation, accessory examination of nasal mucosa and nasal sinus, family history, relevant diseases (allergic asthma, allergic conjunctivitis), other relevant clinical disorders (such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac arrhythmia), as well as the questionnaires such as the TNSS, the TNNSS, and the RQLQ.</p><p>Participants are required to record in the daily diary the symptoms of AR and intake of any other medications during this study period. Outcome evaluators will examine the outcomes at baseline, 2&#x000a0;weeks (within treatment), 4&#x000a0;weeks (end of treatment), 3&#x000a0;months (within follow-up), and 6&#x000a0;months (end of follow-up). Data on nasal symptoms, non-nasal symptoms, and patients&#x02019; quality of life will be collected.</p><p>Data monitoring and management will be performed by the Clinical Evaluation Center of CACMS every 3&#x000a0;months.

The mean change in TNSS before and after treatment was used as the indicator for the efficacy evaluation in the calculation of the sample size. Results from our previous studies showed that the mean TNSS change was 4.90&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.54 after acupuncture treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and 3.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.0 after loratadine treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Thus, we performed a non-inferiority test to calculate the appropriate trial sample size with 80&#x000a0;% power, alpha of 0.05, and an acceptable delta of 0.2. The results showed that a clinically important difference can be detected by a sample size of at least 39 in each group. This number was then increased to 49 per group (total of 98) to allow for a predicted 20-% dropout rate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The statistical analysis will be performed with SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) in the Clinical Evaluation Center of CACMS. We will perform baseline adjusted analyses for the following variables (the center and severity), and the baseline value of the corresponding outcomes will be assessed. The data analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat population. Descriptive statistics will be used to compare the baseline measures and patients&#x02019; characteristics between the two groups. Regarding the primary and secondary outcome measures, the two-sample <italic>t</italic> test or Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare the differences between the two groups from baseline to the end of treatment (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05 will be considered statistically significant). If an imbalance occurs in baseline characteristics between the two groups, ANCOVA will be applied.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Missing data and sensitivity analysis</title><p>The data used in the main statistical analysis should be collected in the fourth week of the treatment and at the half-year follow-up. In order to avoid missing data, we will provide an economic compensation for participants who have finished the trial and provided the completed data. The investigators have a wealth of experience in managing patients and collecting data in previous trials. They record the contact information of participants and keep in touch with them through a variety of means during the treatment and follow-up periods.</p><p>If the data are not obtained, we will record the time and reason for the missing data and will analyze the assumed missing data mechanism. For these missing data, we will use the multiple imputation adjustment approach. After the main analysis, we will perform a sensitivity analysis for the various datasets to enable us to judge the impact of missing data on our results.</p><p>A fully specified statistical analysis plan will be written independently.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Monitoring</title><p>All staff involved in the study must receive training in advance. The training includes the use of randomized envelopes, the method for filling out case report forms, details of the warm needling procedure, the use of scales, the method for the patients to fill in the diary, and follow-up visit skills. Staff have been examined after training to ensure the consistency of warm needling treatment and the evaluation method.</p><p>A special research team from the Clinical Evaluation Center of CACMS, independent from investigators and the sponsor, will perform external monitoring of this study in the three hospitals every 3&#x000a0;months during the study to ensure the authenticity of the data. An advisory board will follow the trial and give advice when necessary. The data monitoring committee (DMC) has been established independent of the sponsor and there is no conflict of interest. It is responsible for monitoring the trial progression and guaranteeing the patients&#x02019; safety. We have not specified interim analyses and stopping plans of the trial, but if the DMC requests interim analyses, these will be supplied.</p><p>In order to improve adherence of the intervention, we will deliver the medicine once a week to the control group, and provide free treatment in the treatment group for 4&#x000a0;weeks. At the end of treatment and follow-up, we will supply a monetary compensation to the participants to ensure that treatment and follow-up run to schedule.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="Sec29"><title>Ethics</title><p>This study was designed in accordance with Chinese corresponding regulations and the principles of the 1996 Declaration of Helsinki, and has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Acupuncture and Moxibustion of CACMS (201410301), Mentougou Hospital of TCM (201501151), and the Ethics Committee of Guang&#x02019;anmen Hospital, CACMS (2015EC043).</p><p>The research assistants will fully explain the purpose, procedure, treatment and possible risks of the trial, and clearly inform the patients of their right to discontinue the study.

The future report will follow the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], Revised Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and the extension of CONSORT for reporting non-inferiority randomized trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study are expected to provide reliable evidence for the long-term efficacy of warm needling in the treatment of PAR.</p><p>This trial is designed as a non-inferiority trial. In our previous study comparing acupuncture and sham-acupuncture (placebo), the effectiveness of acupuncture has been proven. Therefore, we chose loratadine as the control group intervention in this trial so as to compare the differences between them, whether warm needling has an equal effect or is better than loratadine. Since western medicine is clearly being provided to the control group, with warm needling to the treatment group, it is difficult for us to achieve blinding of the participants and operators. Therefore, we chose blinding of the outcome assessors and the statistical analysts. To reduce the potential bias, strict random allocation concealment will be applied to minimize the differences between the two groups.</p><p>In winter, the cold climate, especially in the morning, is the commonest trigger of AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In TCM, AR is differentiated as a deficiency of <italic>Wei Qi</italic>, caused by external Wind and Cold; due to this pathogenesis of AR, warm needling at <italic>Dazhui</italic> (GV14) was included in the treatment. Moxibustion plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and previous research has reported that moxibustion has a positive effect on RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Professor Tian Conghuo, the distinguished veteran doctor of TCM, has established the therapeutic method as strengthening <italic>yang</italic> and expelling Cold for AR. In the treatment, warm needling was applied at <italic>Dazhui</italic> (GV14), combining with acupuncture at local acupoints. <italic>Dazhui</italic> (GV14) is the confluent acupoint of the three <italic>yang</italic> meridians of hand and foot and the Governor Vessel. Hence, this point is also named as &#x0201c;<italic>yang</italic> within <italic>yang</italic>.&#x0201d; Moxibustion at <italic>Dazhui</italic> (GV14) acts by invigorating <italic>yang qi</italic> of all the <italic>yang</italic> meridians, promoting the circulation in the Governor Vessel, expelling Cold and consolidating the defensive <italic>qi</italic>. Therefore, this acupoint is especially suitable for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, asthma, common cold, and the other disorders caused by <italic>yang</italic> deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>In the preliminary experiment, we conducted a pilot RCT with a small sample size. The purpose of this pilot study was to test the feasibility of the trial. Participants were divided into three groups and accepted warm needling on ginger, acupuncture, and loratadine separately, 20 cases in each groups. The results showed that warm needling achieved a more persistent effect than acupuncture alone and loratadine alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. As a result, this multicenter RCT was designed to prove the effect of warm needling on AR. Considering the complication of manipulation of warm needling on ginger, we replaced ginger by increasing the numbers of moxa sticks. The TNSS at 6-month follow-up was taken as the primary outcome in this trial.</p><p>A previous systematic review of 13 studies showed that acupuncture was effective at reducing PAR symptoms and improving patients&#x02019; quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, the duration of observation in the included studies ranged from 4&#x000a0;weeks to 3&#x000a0;months, and the time of follow-up was short, resulting in lack of adequate evaluation of the long-term efficacy of acupuncture and moxibustion. Therefore, the time of follow-up in our study will be 6&#x000a0;months to ensure persistent observation of the efficacy maintenance.</p><p>We expect that this study results will provide evidence to determine the effects of warm needling therapy compared to loratadine. Our final goal of this study is to evaluate differences in the short-term and long-term effects between the two therapeutic methods, especially the long-term effect of warm needling therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Trial status</title><p>We are beginning to recruit participants for this trial.
