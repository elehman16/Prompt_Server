static body balance. [Subjects and Methods] In this randomized-controlled, single-blind
study, 59 university students (35 females, 24 males) were randomized into study (n=29) and
control (n=30) groups. The study group received a foot and ankle proprioceptive exercise
program including stretching, strengthening (plantar and dorsi-flexors, invertor and
evertor muscles), and balance board exercises, each with 10 repetitions per session, 5
days a week, for a total of 10 sessions. The control group did not receive any
intervention. Static body balance was evaluated by a kinesthetic ability trainer, which
showed the balance index scores under both single foot and both feet conditions. This
evaluation was repeated at the end of two weeks for both groups. [Results] Outcome
measures of the groups were similar at the baseline. Balance index scores of both groups
improved at the end of two weeks, and the study group had significantly lower index scores
than those of the control group, indicating better balance. [Conclusion] Ankle
proprioceptive training had positive effects on static body balance parameters in healthy
individuals, and it is worth investigating the effects of this type of training in
patients with balance disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Ankle proprioception</kwd><kwd>Static balance</kwd><kwd>Sport KAT</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The ankle joint is in close proximity to the body&#x02019;s base of support, thus playing an
integral role in maintaining balance. Stability of the ankle joint is paramount when
considering regulation of balance<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Capsular and ligamentous structures, musculotendinous units, and the anatomical alignment of
the osseous components are the stabilizing elements of the normal ankle<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ability to maintain balance during standing on a single
leg or both legs requires integrity of the visual, vestibular, and nervous systems. In the
presence of an intact vestibular system, standing with eyes closed depends mostly on the
normal function of the various proprioceptive receptors<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Proprioceptive information is generated by ligamentous
mechanoreceptors, Golgi tendon organs, and muscle spindles, which transduce mechanical
distortion of the surrounding connective tissue<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stability of the ankle joint during functional activities depends
on the presence of intact neural input from proprioceptors in the joint capsules, ligaments,
muscles, tendons, and skin<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Considering this knowledge, the findings of the related literature samples suggest that
ankle proprioception is closely related to balance control and that balance is negatively
affected by impaired ankle proprioception after injuries<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the results of studies investigating the effects of
proprioceptive training on body balance, or vice versa, are conflicting<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Powers et al. investigated the effect of 6 weeks of strength and
proprioception training on measures of muscle fatigue and static balance in subjects with
unilateral functional ankle instability (FAI) and found that there were no significant
effects of strength or proprioception training on these measures<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Rozzi et al. suggested that 4 weeks of balance training was
effective in improving joint proprioception and single-leg standing ability in subjects with
unstable and non-impaired ankles<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chong
et al. mentioned that healthy subjects reported improvements in balance control following a
purported ankle proprioception training program, although their results revealed that a
training program that controlled general balance did not specifically target ankle
proprioception<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Considering the above-mentioned knowledge about the close relationship between ankle
proprioception and balance, and the conflicting results of the literature samples, the
present study aimed to investigate the effect of ankle proprioceptive training on static
body balance in healthy individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This randomized-controlled, single-blind study was planned and performed as a graduation
study for physiotherapy and rehabilitation students. Administrative permission was obtained
from the Rectorate of Mu&#x0011f;la S&#x00131;tk&#x00131; Ko&#x000e7;man University. The study sample was derived from
students of the same university.</p><p>The inclusion criteria for the study were absence of musculoskeletal, neurologic,
orthopedic, rheumatic or cardiopulmonary disease; lower extremity deformity; muscle weakness
(&#x0003c;4/5 according to manual muscle testing); and postural impairment.</p><p>Among eligible candidates, 59 healthy university students (35 females, 24 males) with an
age range of 18&#x02013;28 years were included in the study, after signing informed consent forms,
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Subjects were randomized into the study
(n=29) and control (n=30) groups by drawing &#x0201c;study&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;control&#x0201d; cards from closed
envelopes. All subjects received treatment or control conditions as allocated.</p><p>Sex (female/male), body mass (kg), height (m), and body mass index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)
values of the subjects were recorded as the physical characteristics. In addition, their
dominant leg (right/left) and dominant foot length (cm) were recorded. A physiotherapist,
blinded to the group of subjects, performed all assessments, including the static body
balance test.</p><p>Static body balance was evaluated using a kinesthetic ability trainer (Sport KAT Model
650-TS, LLC, USA), which shows the balance index scores in both conditions: single foot and
both feet. This device consists of a circular platform with varying degrees of stability,
centered by a small pivot. In the preliminary session, the subjects were familiarized with
the balance assessment system. The pound per square inch (PSI) level was adjusted to 6, and
once comfortable on the testing device, the subjects performed a formal static test. They
stood on the platform with their hands on opposite shoulders; they were then asked to stand
in place, maintaining balance. The objective of the static balance test on this device was
to maintain the platform at the initial level relative to the X- and Y-axes. Therefore,
during the static balance test, the subjects kept their eyes open to view the monitor screen
and tried to keep the &#x0201c;X&#x0201d; in the center of the screen. The printouts included a numerical
score, based on the actual time spent on the exercise and the distance from the center of
the platform, measured every second. The test was performed on both feet and on the dominant
and non-dominant bare foot, each testing session lasting for 30 seconds. Balance index
scores range from zero to 6,000, and the lower the score, the better is the balance
index<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Static balance index score above
500 is considered a poor result<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>After balance assessment, the study group received a foot and ankle proprioceptive exercise

end of 2 weeks for both groups.</p><p>SPSS for Windows 20 was used for statistical analysis. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used
to test the normality of data distribution. Since normal distribution was observed,
quantitative data were analyzed by independent t-test for inter-group comparisons, and by

stretching, strengthening, and balance board exercises during two weeks, caused more
significant improvements than no intervention in balance index scores in healthy
individuals. The improvement of the balance index scores in the control group may be due to
the learning effect related to the measurement technique.</p><p>Han, et al. have stated that ankle proprioception plays an essential role in balance
control, since central processing of ankle proprioceptive information, along with other
sensory information, enables integration for postural and balance control<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hoffman and Payne investigated the effects
of Biomechanical Ankle Platform System&#x02122; training on postural sway in healthy high-school
students. Compared with subjects of the control group, those of the study group who received
proprioceptive ankle disk training showed significant improvements in both the
medial-lateral and anterior-posterior parameters of postural sway<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mattacola and Lloyd investigated the effects of a
six-week strength and proprioception training program on clinical measures of balance in
subjects with previously sustained first-degree lateral ankle sprains. The results revealed
that the strength and proprioception training program produced improvements in balance, as
assessed dynamically on a single-plane balance board<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Arslan, et al. investigated the effect of an eight-week
proprioception training program on dynamic postural control in taekwondo athletes, and
concluded that this program improved dynamic postural control in taekwondo athletes<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Akre and Kumaresan compared the
effectiveness of a four-week strengthening program and that of proprioceptive training on
dynamic balance in athletes with chronic ankle instability, and found that both
strengthening and proprioceptive training were equally effective in improving dynamic
balance<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lee and Lin investigated the
effects of 12-week training with a biomechanical ankle platform system on postural stability
and ankle proprioception in 12 university students with unilateral functional ankle
instability, and showed that this training improved postural stability and ankle
proprioception<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of the present study, which are parallel to the findings of the related
literature samples<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, showed that ankle proprioceptive training had positive effects on
static body balance parameters in healthy individuals.</p><p>In the present study, the effect of an ankle and foot proprioceptive training program,
which included strengthening, stretching, and balance board exercises, on static balance was
assessed in healthy young subjects when their eyes were open. The rationale of this design
was that static balance with open eyes is the easiest condition and the first step of more
complex balance reactions. Positive outcomes of this type of training on the evaluated
measures show that it is worth assessing the effects of this ankle proprioception training
program in more complex conditions to maintain both static and dynamic balance, as well as
in prevention and management of many diseases/impairments such as functional unstable feet,
hypermobility syndromes, geriatric falls, or neurological problems with balance
disorder.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Blackburn</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Cuskiewicz</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name><name><surname>Petschauer</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Balance and joint stability: the relative contributions of
