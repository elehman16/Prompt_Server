Nitric oxide (NO) has a crucial role in this process. NO release and endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression are reduced both in endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The generation of oxidative stress and production of oxygen-derived free radicals is considered as one of the most important mechanism involved in endothelial dysfunction.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In patients with type 1 diabetes, it is mentioned that oxygen-derived free radicals are produced from mitochondrial, enzymatic, and nonenzymatic sources. Some <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies indicated that adequate scavenging of these radicals by antioxidant agents such as vitamin C could restore endothelium dependent vasodilation and consequently normal endothelial function.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Endothelial function could be measured by different biochemical factors, but there are also some noninvasive methods for this purpose. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) measurement with high-resolution ultrasound is one of the noninvasive methods, which evaluate both endothelial function and structural arterial changes.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Accordingly, increased IMT and decreased FMD have been demonstrated in high-risk population with atherosclerosis such as type 1 diabetic patients.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] There are also a few studies which investigated the effectiveness of antioxidant agents such as vitamin C in improvement of endothelial dysfunction.

The high-frequency (7 MHz) vascular transducer (EKO 7 by Samsung Medison Company) was fixed with a stereotactic probe-holding device. In order to make a flow stimulus by reactive hyperemia a pediatric BP cuff was fixed on the wrist of the subjects and radial artery was imaged in a longitudinal plane 5 cm distal from the antecubital fossa. After performing a baseline rest image, the blood flow velocity was estimated by time averaging the Doppler signal from a mid-artery sample volume. Cuff deflation was followed by a brief high-flow state after a 5 min interval of ischemia. After cuff deflation, the image of the radial artery and the Doppler signal recorded alternatively for 5 min with 20 s intervals. After the procedure, obtained images saved on the EKO 7 hard disk and analyzed. Distance measurements of radial artery provided at maximum systolic extension.

The findings of our study indicated that vitamin C could improve IMT in both control and type 1 DM patients. IMT improvement was not different in diabetic patients with poor and good glycemic control. FMD had trend to be increased in two groups, but the difference was statistically significant in the control group.</p><p>The endothelial impairment in type 1 diabetic patients had been reported in several reports. Accordingly, it was considered as an early event in the atherosclerotic process and it is developed before the clinical manifestation of atherosclerotic complications.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] There are also evidences that some intervention could improve this process and consequently delay the early development of atherosclerosis and other related micro- and macro-vascular complications.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Vitamin C or ascorbic acid is an essential antioxidant in humans and its utility in improving endothelial dysfunction was determined in many studies, so in this study, we evaluated its effect on endothelial function parameters, which assessed by noninvasive methods and ultrasonography that is, IMT and FMD. As reported by previous studies using such noninvasive methods could be useful in early diagnosis of subclinical atherosclerosis in clinical practice and consequently they might be used for planning preventive strategies in high-risk patients for cardiovascular event.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Increased IMT has a predictive value for the development of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and FMD decrease in early phase of atherosclerosis.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Many studies have reported increased IMT and decreased FMD among type 1 diabetic patients.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>G&#x000fc;l <italic>et al</italic>. in Turkey have showed that increased IMT in type 1 diabetic patients was associated with microvascular complications.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Odermarsky <italic>et al</italic>. in Denmark have indicated that patients with type 1 DM with low plasma vitamin C concentrations could be more prone to microvascular dysfunction and increased IMT.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>In the current study, mean of IMT at baseline was significantly higher in healthy children than type 1 DM patients, it may be due that the BMI of diabetic patients was lower than the control group and as IMT increased with higher BMI, and so it could explain the obtained data.</p><p>Flow-mediated dilatation was not significantly different in two studied groups at baseline. It may be due to small sample size. Another explanation was the duration of DM in the studied population. Mean duration of disease in DM patients was 2.3 years. It seems that endothelial dysfunction was not developed during the early years of the disease and it could be detected in patients with at least 5-6 years history of the disease.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Though after administration of vitamin C, IMT decreased and FMD increased in both diabetic and control group, but the mean difference of IMT and FMD after intervention was not significantly different. The short duration of the disease or short duration of study could explain the findings.</p><p>There were few reports regarding the effectiveness of vitamin C on improvement of endothelial function among children with type 1 diabetes and the results were also controversial.</p><p>Timimi <italic>et al</italic>. have indicated that vitamin C selectively could restores the impaired endothelial function among patients with insulin dependent DM.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>It seems that its improvement in DM patients would be more significant if the glycemic control of DM patients would be appropriate also. Mean of HbA1c in the studied population was 8.6 and only 33.4% of patients had appropriate glycemic control.</p><p>Ceriello <italic>et al</italic>. in Italy have reported that that long-lasting hyperglycemia in type 1 diabetic patients induces permanent alterations in endothelial cells, which may contribute to endothelial dysfunction by increased oxidative stress even when hyperglycemia is normalized. They concluded that normalization of both endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress can be achieved in type 1 diabetic patients, with a combination of near-normalization of hyperglycemia and antioxidant treatment. They indicated that vitamin C could be effective in improvement of endothelial function in cases with appropriate glycemic control.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>In our study, mean differences of endothelial markers in diabetic patients with poor and good glycemic control was not different significantly. It may be due to the small sample size of subgroups.</p><p>In addition, it seems that the result would be more conclusive if other CVD risk factors such as lipid profile as well as insulin level have also been evaluated. However, there are evidences that insulin could induce vasodilatation.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The findings of the current study indicated that vitamin C may have a protective effect on endothelial dysfunction, but regarding its effectiveness among high-risk populations, such as diabetic patients with and without appropriate glycemic control the study was not sufficiently powered due to its small sample size.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of
