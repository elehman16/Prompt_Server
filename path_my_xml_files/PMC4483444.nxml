nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) before, during, and after a Tai Chi (TC) Qigong exercise.
[Subjects and Methods] Eleven survivors of NPC participated voluntarily in the study. The
heart rate of each participant was measured continuously for 1 minute before the TC Qigong
intervention, during the 5-minute TC Qigong intervention, and for 1 minute after the
intervention, using a Polar heart-rate monitor. Spectral HRV was expressed in terms of
normalised low frequency (LF) power, normalised high frequency (HF) power, and the low
frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) power ratio. [Results] Both the LF-power and the HF-power
components had significant time effects. However, the time effect of the LF/HF power ratio
was not significant. Post hoc contrast analysis revealed a significant decrease in LF
power and a concomitant increase in HF power during the 4th minute and 5th minute of the
TC Qigong exercise. [Conclusion] Five minutes of TC Qigong exercise was found to improve
HRV by increasing HF power and decreasing LF power, but these effects were transient. TC
Qigong might be an appropriate exercise for improving the ANS function and psychological
and cardiac health of survivors of NPC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Autonomic nervous system</kwd><kwd>Mind-body exercise</kwd><kwd>Head-and-neck cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction is common in cancer patients<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.

treatment can increase stress and adversely affect the psychological health of cancer
patients and survivors<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In recent years,
heart-rate variability (HRV) has commonly been used as an indicator of the regulation of the
heart by the ANS<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Changes in HRV are also associated with psychological symptoms and

patients&#x02019; HRV<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Compared with other cancer types, the incidence rate of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is
high, ranging from 25 to 50 per 100,000 in Southeast Asia and North Africa<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some of the survivors are young, which
makes their ANS function and cardiac and psychological health especially clinically
important. However, no researchers to date have measured HRV with specific attention to NPC
survivors.</p><p>It is known that exercise training can improve cardiac ANS activity<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Tai Chi (TC) Qigong, which is a kind of Chinese
mind-and-body exercise, can be used to bring the body and mind into balance, reduce the
side-effects of cancer treatments (e.g. cardiotoxicity)<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> and relieve stress<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Details of the TC Qigong form have been
described by Mak<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. It primarily involves
meditation, coordinated breathing (Qigong), and slow and smooth TC movements<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, we hypothesised that TC Qigong
practice may improve HRV in survivors of NPC. The aim of this study was to explore the
changes in HRV in survivors of NPC before, during, and after TC Qigong practice. The results
may have clinical implications for the use of TC Qigong in the improvement of ANS function
and the psychological and cardiac health of cancer survivors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Eleven survivors of NPC were recruited from the Nature Health Qigong Association by
convenience sampling. All of the participants were ethnic Chinese who fulfilled the
following inclusion criteria: a history of NPC diagnosis (i.e. positive Epstein-Barr virus
DNA and biopsy-test results) and the completion of conventional medical care; medical
stability; aged between 40 and 85&#x02005;years; normal cognitive and sensorimotor functions; and at
least three months&#x02019; training in 18-Forms Tai Chi Internal Qigong<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> (3 sessions per week and 1 hour per session). The criteria
for exclusion were as follows: significant respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological or
musculoskeletal disorders that might have affected test performance; the use of medication
of any form; and habitual smoking or drinking. Ethical approvals were obtained from the
Ethics Committees of the University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Institute of Education.
Written informed consent was also obtained from the participants. All of the procedures were
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>All of the physical measurements were taken by a physiotherapist and a trained research
assistant at the Nature Health Qigong Association during a supervised TC Qigong training
session. The room temperature was maintained at 22&#x02005;&#x000b0;C. Before the HRV measurements, which
were performed in a group setting, the participants were each asked to provide information
on their demographic characteristics and medical histories (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Demographic characteristics of the participants</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total number of participants</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54.7&#x000b1;7.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (number of males/females)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">164.9&#x000b1;9.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.9&#x000b1;12.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body-mass index (kgm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.7&#x000b1;3.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-NPC duration (years)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.7&#x000b1;7.0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are given as the mean &#x000b1; SD unless otherwise specified.

continuously collect heart-rate data (in the form of R to R peak intervals) from all of the
participants for 1 minute before the TC Qigong intervention (while standing still), during
the 5-minute TC Qigong intervention, and for 1 minute after the TC Qigong intervention
(while again standing still). The participants were asked to breathe naturally during the
pre- and post-intervention periods, and to coordinate their breathing with their bodily
movements during the TC Qigong exercise<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>After the data collection (which took 7 minutes), frequency spectral analysis of the
participants&#x02019; HRV was conducted at 1-minute intervals using the Kubios HRV Version 2.1
software package (Biosignal Analysis and Medical Imaging Group, University of Eastern
Finland, Finland). The participants&#x02019; spectral HRV was expressed in terms of three
components: normalised low frequency (LF) power (0.04&#x02013;0.15&#x02005;Hz), normalised high frequency
(HF) power (0.15&#x02013;0.4&#x02005;Hz), and the low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) power ratio.
Normalised LF power represents a predominantly sympathetic modulation of the sinus node,
while normalised HF power can be regarded as an index of vagal (parasympathetic) modulation.
The LF/HF power ratio reflects sympathovagal balance, and may provide a better estimation of
sympathetic influence on the heart rate. A ratio of less than 1 suggests a greater
parasympathetic outflow, and a ratio greater than 1 indicates a shift toward increased
sympathetic modulation<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences (SPSS) Version 20.0. Statistics such as the mean and standard deviation values were
used to describe the demographic and outcome variables. Normality of the data was checked
using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Mauchly&#x02019;s Test of Sphericity was also used to check the
sphericity assumption. The Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon adjustment was used to correct
violations of sphericity. All of the heart-rate data recorded before, during, and after the
TC Qigong exercise were analysed using one way repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Post hoc contrast analysis of the time effect was performed when appropriate. The
significance level was chosen as 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The demographic data are presented in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

increase the normalised HF-power component and decrease the normalised LF-power component of
HRV of survivors of NPC. Moreover, although the LF/HF power ratio was not found to have an
overall statistical significance for the current sample size, it exhibited a trend of
decrease towards the end of the TC Qigong exercise. Our results suggest that TC Qigong
increases cardiac vagal tone, and simultaneously reduces sympathetic activity in cancer
survivors<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, these favourable
outcomes were transient, disappearing within 1 minute of the cessation of the exercise.</p><p>Our findings are in agreement with those of a previous study in which Qigong training was
shown to increase normalised HF power and decrease the LF/HF power ratio in healthy young
adults<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. We hypothesise that this
phenomenon is due to meditation during TC Qigong training eliciting increases in
parasympathetic tone<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> and/ or slow
abdominal breathing during TC Qigong training eliciting reductions in sympathetic activity
and enhancing vagal activity<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Further
studies should be carried out examining both healthy individuals and survivors of NPC to
test this hypothesis.</p><p>The major clinical implication of our findings is that TC Qigong has the potential to
enhance the balance of the ANS in survivors of NPC by adjusting sympathetic and
parasympathetic activity<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a result,
it may reduce stress<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, improve
psychological health<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, and reduce cardiac
disorders<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> among this particular group
of individuals.</p><p>Although the results of this pilot study are promising, this study had several limitations.
The respiratory rate, which may affect HRV<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, was not monitored concurrently; and other confounding factors that
may influence HRV, such as age, gender<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>
and body-mass index<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, were not
controlled for in the analysis. Also, the sample size was small and no control group was
used; therefore, the statistical power and internal validity of this study may have been
compromised. Due to these potential limitations, the results of this study should be
interpreted with caution.</p><p>In summary, a 5-minute TC Qigong exercise was found to improve HRV by increasing normalised
HF power and decreasing normalised LF power (from the 4th minute of the exercise onward),
but its effects were transient. This suggests that TC Qigong may be an appropriate exercise
for improving ANS function and the psychological and cardiac health of survivors of NPC.
However, regular practice may be necessary to maintain these beneficial effects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by a Seed Fund for Basic Research for New Staff (201308159012)
