Reviews were given a unique code, which along with the baseline activity stratum, was supplied to one of the authors (AAM) who performed the randomisation. Stratifying by baseline access activity, and using computer-generated random number sequences, reviews were first allocated to intervention and control arms, then into pairs of reviews that would have the same reference period for outcome data collection, then to day of the week and week number (1&#x02013;29) that Tweeting would take place for reviews in the intervention arm. Days for Tweeting were Tuesday, Wednesday or Friday as these are considered to have the heaviest traffic.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Finally, the sequence of the three Tweets for each review (the Tweet package) in the intervention arm was also randomised.

Therefore, we estimated the magnitude of the detectable between-group difference in the primary outcome. Google Analytics data for all 170 reviews during the period 21 September 2013 to 28 February 2014 suggested that log-transformed mean number of views per week is normally distributed, with a mean of 1.5 and SD of 0.9. With 5% two-sided &#x003b1; and a sample size of 85 per arm, between-group differences in the range 0.43&#x02013;0.5 SDs, equivalent to a ratio of geometric means of 1.47 to 1.57, are detectable with 80&#x02013;90% power.</p><p>The primary outcome is a count of the number of times that each review is accessed during its 7-day follow-up period. Due to over-dispersion in this, and in other outcomes that are counts, we used multivariable negative binomial regression modelling to estimate incidence rate ratios and 95% CIs, adjusted for baseline activity stratum and day of the week on which the 7-day data collection period commenced. We also investigated the use of mixed effects models to take account of pairing of intervention and control reviews. This made no material difference and so results from the simpler models are presented. Outcomes with excess zero counts were analysed using zero-inflated negative binomial regression models. Binary variables were analysed using logistic regression. Continuous variables were analysed using linear regression, with log-transformation of outcomes and presentation as the ratio of geometric means if appropriate.</p><p>We conducted further secondary analyses of the primary outcome. By including appropriate interaction terms in the primary regression model, we investigated in subgroup analyses whether any effect of the intervention differed according to baseline activity, or by day of the week that Tweets were sent. The latter was not pre-specified before analysis of the data and therefore should be regarded as exploratory. Finally, we estimated the effects of the intervention separately for visits to the review summaries that originated from China and from outside China.</p><p>All between-group comparisons analysed reviews as randomised. As the intervention was delivered as intended, and there are no missing outcome data, sensitivity analyses were unnecessary.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>At the time of the trial, there were 849 followers on Twitter and 5995 followers on Weibo.

85 review summaries in the intervention and control arms, respectively, and strong statistical evidence of a nearly threefold increase in the intervention arm. There was further evidence of an effect of the intervention on all of the secondary outcomes.</p><p>There was no evidence that the intervention was differentially effective at increasing visits to reviews classified according to baseline activity as low (IRR 3.09, 95% CI 2.30 to 4.17), medium (IRR 2.65, 1.94 to 3.61) or high (IRR 1.85, 0.88 to 3.89) (overall p value for interaction=0.31). Nor was there any evidence of a differential effect according to day of the week that Tweets were sent (p value for interaction=0.68).</p><p>The data did not suggest that the intervention was any more or less effective in China compared with the rest of the world. The incidence rate ratio for the primary outcome for visits that originated from China was 2.27 (95% CI 0.35 to 14.77), and 2.15 (1.73 to 2.68) for from outside China.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Much investment is put into the dissemination of healthcare evidence. Many choices are available to individuals, institutions and industry, and it is difficult to estimate how much of this investment is misplaced. We were able to show that a simple approach on a commonly used set of systems (i) was possible to evaluate and (ii) seemed to have some effect.</p><p>This is the first randomised controlled trial that we are aware of evaluating the impact of Tweeting health-related web links on access to the target web page and/or related web pages. This study quantifies the effects of Tweeting evidence and generates many questions for future research. We used free-to-use software with limited functionality&#x02014;more sophisticated software may highlight more effects. We Tweeted links to large academic reviews focusing on one small area of healthcare to a relatively small &#x02018;following&#x02019;. Different techniques of Tweeting, other areas of healthcare, and a broad set of followers could result in a greater impact.</p><p>There are many more questions on the effects of types of social media targeting and how best to undertake this in order to encourage the implementation&#x000a0;of best evidence. Much more sophisticated outcome analytics are available beyond those we used which would add to understanding of how best to target for substantive encouragement of behaviour for best impact.</p><p>All hit rates, whatever way they were measured, were largely modest. The degree of effect was consistently substantial but is relative to the modest standard activity. Without our social media activity many of the Cochrane reviews have little or no activity within the target week. The social media activity changes this and there are some indications that the intervention also changed how a person interacts with the site. The user would stay longer, &#x02018;bounce off&#x02019; less frequently and exit to another site more frequently. We did not specially investigate if people tended to exit to the full Cochrane Review as access to the full text varies across countries. This study underlines the importance of this summaries web interface for the Cochrane Collaboration. The activities, however, increased by the social media intervention, would seem to indicate improved interest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Use of social media in an area of healthcare that is not particularly high profile, for the dissemination of evidence that is highly specialised through a small following, nevertheless, seemed to have a genuine effect by which indicators of interest were increased. There were more visits to the target site and the time spent on the page was longer. We cannot tell if that interest translated into better care more in line with best evidence, but &#x02018;product placement&#x02019; of good evidence is a significant step in the right direction.</p><p>Much effort is expended in disseminating health-related messages across social media with unclear effect. The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, based in the University of Nottingham, has randomised their reviews to be also disseminated by social media compared with no additional &#x02018;Tweeting&#x02019;/(&#x02018;Weibo-ing&#x02019;). There is now evidence from a trial that low-grade social media dissemination is powerful for the &#x02018;product placement&#x02019; of health information.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are really grateful to Constanze Knahl, student on the EU Erasmus Student Exchange from Neu-Ulm University of Applied Sciences, Ulm, Germany, who constructed the MS Access upload tool without which this study would have been much more difficult.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Mahesh Jayaram at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/maheshjayaram">@maheshjayaram</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> CEA wrote the first draft and all authors revised drafts.
