Post-discharge care is often fragmented leading to increased healthcare costs, readmissions, and sub-optimal utilization of rehabilitation and community services. The COMprehensive Post-Acute Stroke Services (COMPASS) Study is an ongoing cluster-randomized pragmatic trial to assess the effectiveness of a comprehensive, evidence-based, post-acute care model on patient-centered outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Forty-one hospitals in North Carolina were randomized (as 40&#x000a0;units) to either implement the COMPASS care model or continue their usual care. The recruitment goal is 6000 patients (3000 per arm). Hospital staff ascertain and enroll patients discharged home with a clinical diagnosis of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Patients discharged from intervention hospitals receive 2-day telephone follow-up; a comprehensive clinic visit within 2&#x000a0;weeks that includes a neurological evaluation, assessments of social and functional determinants of health, and an individualized COMPASS Care Plan&#x02122; integrated with a community-specific resource database; and additional follow-up calls at 30 and 60&#x000a0;days post-stroke discharge. This model is consistent with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services transitional care management services provided by physicians or advanced practice providers with support from a nurse to conduct patient assessments and coordinate follow-up services. Patients discharged from usual care hospitals represent the control group and receive the standard of care in place at that hospital. Patient-centered outcomes are collected from telephone surveys administered at 90&#x000a0;days. The primary endpoint is patient-reported functional status as measured by the Stroke Impact Scale 16. Secondary outcomes are: caregiver strain, all-cause readmissions, mortality, healthcare utilization, and medication adherence. The study engages patients, caregivers, and other stakeholders (including policymakers, advocacy groups, payers, and local community coalitions) to advise and support the design, implementation, and sustainability of the COMPASS care model.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Given the high societal and economic burden of stroke, identifying a care model to improve recovery, independence, and quality of life is critical for stroke survivors and their caregivers. The pragmatic trial design provides a real-world assessment of the COMPASS care model effectiveness and will facilitate rapid implementation into clinical practice if successful.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">Clinicaltrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02588664?term=COMPASS+AND+North+Carolina&#x00026;rank=5">NCT02588664</ext-link>; October 23, 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12883-017-0907-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Transitions of care</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Functional status</kwd><kwd>Pragmatic trial</kwd><kwd>Patient-centered care</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006093</institution-id><institution>Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PCS-1403-14532; NCT02588664</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duncan</surname><given-names>Pamela W.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1TR001420</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gesell</surname><given-names>Sabina B.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par20">Stroke is a major cause of long-term disability and mortality in the United States, exemplifying a complex chronic disease with high co-morbidity, associated healthcare costs, and readmission rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. An estimated 6.6 million Americans aged 20&#x000a0;years and older have had a stroke, and each year approximately 795,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. North Carolina (NC) has a particularly high stroke burden and is in the geographic region of the country known as the &#x02018;Stroke Belt&#x02019;. Stroke mortality in Eastern NC is 40% higher than the national average and hospital admission rates are the highest in the state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. African Americans comprise over 20% of the NC population and are more likely to be affected by stroke than their white counterparts, such as having higher post-stroke hospital readmission rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Stroke survivors experience significant physical, mental and social challenges. Roughly half are discharged directly home from the hospital, where they often realize disabilities not identified during hospitalization and are at risk for complications such as falls, physical deconditioning, aspiration pneumonia, infections, social isolation and depression as well as recurrent stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

Individuals discharged with a clinical diagnosis of transient ischemic attack (TIA) may also have residual deficits and are at increased risk for future stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Family members who care for stroke survivors often face significant burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Approximately 70% of stroke survivors require assistance with activities of daily living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This assistance is usually provided by family members who are often unprepared and ill-equipped to assume caregiving responsibilities such as providing direct care (e.g., bathing, toileting, mobility assistance, transfers), managing medications, assisting with instrumental activities of daily living, managing stroke survivor emotions and behaviors, communicating with providers, and identifying and accessing community resources. These new responsibilities often lead to overwhelming physical and emotional strain, depressive symptoms, decline in physical and mental health, reduced quality of life, and isolation in the family caregiver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">An effective, post-acute care model is needed given the significant impact of stroke on public health, the high risk and complexity of these patients early after discharge, and the strain on caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Currently the U.S. lacks a standard to require hospitals to coordinate community-based follow-up visits with primary or specialty care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The variation in availability, access, referrals, and effectiveness of post-acute stroke medical and rehabilitative care leads to significant gaps in the stroke system of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These gaps can lead to increased likelihood of readmission, and thus higher healthcare costs. Improved transitions of care from the acute phase to the post-discharge environment may help improve functional status and quality of life for stroke survivors and their caregivers and reduce healthcare costs to society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Stroke morbidity and mortality may also be reduced through effective transitional care, secondary prevention, and rehabilitation early post-stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Early supported discharge (ESD) is the only evidence-based transitional care intervention found to reduce the negative impact of stroke (i.e., decreased length of stay, accelerated functional recovery, improved patient and caregiver satisfaction) and is the standard of care in the United Kingdom and Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

Recruitment efforts first targeted hospitals in the NC Stroke Care Collaborative (NCSCC) network (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;51) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The NCSCC is a hospital-based, prospective registry of stroke patients and was part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x02019;s Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry Program through 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It was designed to measure, track, and improve the quality of acute stroke care. The NCSCC hospital network covers 60% of the counties in NC, 80% of the state&#x02019;s population, and 82% of stroke discharges annually. Recruitment efforts were next extended to all other eligible hospitals in NC. Hospital recruitment lasted for 1&#x000a0;year by which time a total of 110 hospitals in NC had been identified as potentially eligible and invited to participate. Fifteen hospitals did not meet one or more of the inclusion criteria (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) because they transferred all stroke patients from the emergency department to another hospital. In addition, 54 hospitals declined to participate in the study. Limited resources (e.g., finances, staff, time) necessary to establish the COMPASS clinic infrastructure and adopt the intervention care model was the primary reason given for non-participation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Hospital recruitment and randomization. *Reasons are not mutually exclusive. &#x0201c;Other&#x0201d; reasons include: Decision made at the health system level; bureaucratic issues; decision maker(s) unconvinced of additive value of participation; concerns about sustainability, who should be the on-site principal investigator, and/or IRB/consenting</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12883_2017_907_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par29">Forty-one hospitals (40 randomized units) agreed to participate in the COMPASS study (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

These needs include medical, physical, and social determinants of health, goals of care, and preferences as recommended by the CMS. The COMPASS care model was designed to address these needs by identifying four essential &#x02018;dimensions&#x02019; of care to help patients &#x02018;find their way forward after stroke&#x02019;. These dimensions are depicted as directions on a compass in messaging to patient, caregivers, and practitioners (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The COMPASS care model was developed and refined at the Wake Forest Baptist Transitional Stroke Clinic (the study vanguard site). The model consists of patient follow-up post-discharge and standardized patient and caregiver patient reported assessments. The innovative focal point of the COMPASS care model is real-time generation of an individualized patient electronic care plan (COMPASS-CP&#x02122;) that also incorporates caregiver support needs and an integrated registry of community resources. The COMPASS-CP was designed to meet CMS requirements for comprehensive care of complex patients and was piloted at the study vanguard site prior to implementation at trial sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The development of the individualized COMPASS-CP was guided by key patient-centered questions (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) and identifies areas of concern that prohibit maximizing full recovery and provide a solution in the form of education, coaching, and referrals to community-based resources.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>COMPASS key messages - finding the way forward</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12883_2017_907_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig>

The COMPASS Study brochure included a way to opt out of the research component (<italic>i.e</italic>.<italic>,</italic> the 90-day survey). Verbal consent was obtained at the beginning of the telephone survey for the collection of those data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Stakeholder engagement shaped the study design</title><p id="Par64">Stakeholder engagement shaped our choice for a delayed start design, which provided the best statistical control to assess the intervention&#x02019;s effects compared with current practice, while also ensuring that all communities would benefit from the trial. Hospital stakeholders (stroke and administrative leadership teams at 29 hospitals) explicitly requested the opportunity to implement the COMPASS care model at some point in the study even if initially randomized to the control group. This design feature supported our hospital recruitment efforts. Patients and caregivers determined the primary outcome, which measures aspects of physical functioning that matter to patients and their families, and is the only widely used measure of stroke outcomes developed from patient and caregiver focus groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Patients and caregivers also determined the selection of our secondary outcome of caregiver strain. Stakeholders helped develop the informed consent process (<italic>i.e</italic>.<italic>,</italic> timing and language) and study materials. In addition, we convened site-specific meetings with each intervention hospital and their partners to engage local community stakeholders, patients and caregivers and to orient them to the study purpose, intervention and follow-ups, and available learning modules. The community stakeholders included primary care physicians, pharmacists, home health agencies, outpatient rehab providers, Area Agency on Aging representatives, faith leaders, emergency medicine paramedics, and other community partners. Additional information on our methods for engaging a broad base of stakeholders are described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par65">This study was designed to evaluate whether implementation of a post-acute stroke care model in real-world clinical practice improves functional status of stroke patients discharged home compared with usual care. Stroke is a high-cost, complex chronic disease that requires extensive post-acute management. Comprehensive post-acute services for stroke require bridging hospital-based acute care with expanded care teams for rehabilitation, primary care management, access to community resources, and caregiver support. Early supported discharge and other transitions of care processes may improve functional outcomes, but uncertainty remains as to the best method to manage stroke patients as they transition to home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The CMS is setting new directions and reimbursements for value-based care for chronic conditions. Stroke may soon be targeted for 90-day bundled payments, which link payments for services rendered during an episode of care encompassing the inpatient stay and post-acute services through 90&#x000a0;days. We have developed a multidisciplinary care model that would meet these new standards.</p><p id="Par66">A pragmatic trial addresses questions of effectiveness, the degree of benefit of a given intervention tested in a real-world setting. There is urgency for such information to evaluate recommended transitional care and comprehensive services for stroke that can be readily implemented into practice. The COMPASS Study will also allow us to systematically evaluate the uptake of the intervention in a diverse environment of hospital systems across North Carolina. At the same time, we employed several strategies from a traditional trial design to measure adherence to the intervention, increase participant retention, and standardize the capture of the primary outcome in order to minimize selection bias. In keeping with a pragmatic design, participants are enrolled with few exclusion criteria and we believe this will contribute to the generalizability of our findings to stroke patients outside of North Carolina. We will be assessing potential modifiers (<italic>e.g</italic>., age, race, sex, insurance status, and stroke severity) and will consider these in drawing inferences to different target populations. Moreover, even though current post-acute care may vary, our pragmatic care model incorporates this variability by tailoring the intervention to each community and individual patient&#x02019;s needs, connecting patients with local resources. This adaptability further supports generalizability of the COMPASS care model to other clinical settings.</p><p id="Par67">As part of our design, we chose to randomize the hospital and not individual patients within a hospital. This was deemed most appropriate given the system-level nature of the intervention, which made patient-level randomization within a single site not feasible. Group randomization also allowed us to assess feasibility and sustainability of implementing a new care model as the new standard of care for a health system. The cluster-randomized design however, may lead to imbalance in patient characteristics between randomization groups due to the fewer number of randomization assignments.</p><p id="Par68">The primary operational challenge in conducting the study to date was navigating the complexity of rapidly engaging diverse health systems for research. Hospitals and systems were sometimes slow to engage because of the substantial hospital investment of staff and other resources needed to implement an intervention of this scale. The financial support provided by the study is in keeping with its pragmatic nature and is modest compared with compensation offered in many traditional clinical trials. Health systems have many competing priorities and opportunities. The extensive engagement challenges and solutions required to successfully recruit a diverse mix of hospital systems is the topic of a future publication. Initiating all hospitals simultaneously was also a challenge. To address this we randomized and launched sites in waves. This allowed us to direct separate implementation teams in a more focused manner toward subsets of hospitals. This strategy also had the unexpected benefit of allowing us more time to tailor the intervention to each site and to conduct site-specific visits and trainings in addition to the centralized training sessions. Finally, use of a central IRB for streamlining administrative burden was invaluable as was the rigorous organizational structure needed to manage operations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par69">This trial addresses a critical gap in post-acute stroke care management. If successful, the COMPASS care model, which has been implemented into current clinical practice in North Carolina, could be scaled to other settings, or targeted for other chronic diseases, and would position health systems for CMS value-based care models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This care model could be further expanded to engage primary care and sub-specialty clinics which, in collaboration with hospitals, would facilitate successful patient transitions to health, independence, and recovery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>
