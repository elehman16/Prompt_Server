(2014), Lowery <italic>et al</italic>. (2013) and Walker <italic>et al</italic>. (2014) showed early specialist palliative care improves health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Studies by Pirl <italic>et al</italic>. (2012), Lowery <italic>et al</italic>. (2013), and Walker <italic>et al</italic>. (2014) showed early specialist palliative care improved mood depression and anxiety. Studies by Zimmermann <italic>et al</italic>. and Rugno <italic>et al</italic>.

(2014) showed survival improvement with early specialist palliative care. All these studies were carried in ambulatory palliative care setting. No survival benefit of palliative care intervention was seen in inpatient palliative care setting. The studies by Geer <italic>et al</italic>. (2012), Rugno <italic>et al</italic>. (2014), and Lowery <italic>et al</italic>. (2013) showed that early palliative care intervention positively influences treatment decision making.

There is moderate evidence to support the role of early specialist palliative care intervention in improvement of symptoms, survival, and health-related communication. There is limited evidence at present to support role of early specialist palliative care interventions in pediatric and geriatric oncology. Qualitative studies on barriers and negative patient outcomes may provide useful insights toward restructuring early specialist palliative care interventions.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>Early specialist palliative care</kwd><kwd>Patient-related outcomes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The World Health Organization and American Society of Clinical Oncology have recommended early integration of specialist palliative care in patients with cancer.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The traditional models of palliative care delivery have expanded its scope to include newer models of care delivery such as integrated care model, shared care model, and pop-up model.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Early specialist palliative care delivery involves the integration of specialist palliative care early in the course of illness trajectory.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In recent times, early specialist palliative care has evolved itself as a novel model of palliative care delivery,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and there is gradual accumulation of evidence to support its role in cancer and noncancer setting.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] This article would like to critically examine the evidence for and against integration of early specialist palliative care in cancer care with a specific focus on patient related outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The question for the literature search was &#x02013; Does integration of early specialist palliative care in cancer care influences patient-related outcomes? The search was carried out using electronic databases such as MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The Boolean operators used for literature search was early or timing AND specialist palliative care AND cancer or oncology AND patient-related outcomes. To answer the literature search question, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic review, surveys, observational studies, and qualitative studies were included. Opinion papers, editorials, and letters to editors were excluded. Only those papers related to early specialist palliative care in cancer care was included and other research relating to nonspecialist and nonearly palliative care intervention was excluded. Only research published in English language in the last 10 years (2005 and later) were included. All unpublished literature and grey literature were excluded. About 31 research papers were included in the final review. Each research paper was analyzed, and outcomes were presented along with reviewer's own discussion of results.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS OF REVIEW</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Early specialist palliative care and patient-elated outcomes in adult oncology</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Health-related quality of life</title><p>According to studies, early specialist palliative care improves health-related quality of life (HRQOL).[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The study by Temel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was an adequately powered RCT to detect HRQOL improvement. However, actual difference in mean HRQOL scores between standard oncology group and specialist palliative care group was marginal. It is not clear whether such small changes in the score could confer clinical benefit. RCT by Bakitas <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] (ENABLE II trial) focused on patient empowerment through specialist nurse led education and telehealth in a mixed group of cancer population. This was an adequately powered RCT and HRQOL tools used met the minimally clinically important difference (MCID) and standard deviation criteria. However, a follow-up RCT, i.e. ENABLE III Trial[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] failed to demonstrate improvement in HRQOL. ENABLE III trial compared the effect of 3-month early and delayed specialist palliative care intervention on HRQOL. Three months may be too short to appreciate HRQOL benefits of specialist palliative care in a mixed group of cancer, as the illness trajectories and baseline symptom/HRQOL scores differ between malignancies. A similar RCT, focusing on nurse led education intervention showed improvement in HRQOL.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, this RCT was terminated prematurely, and the study was grossly underpowered. A cluster RCT in a mixed cancer population by Zimmermann <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] showed statistically significant improvement in HRQOL scores at 4-month end point. This trial was primarily designed to assess the improvement in HRQOL at 3 months. RCTs in palliative care research measuring the delayed outcomes of an intervention, may have limitations and observational studies may be useful.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Although specialist palliative care interventions in Temel <italic>et al</italic>. and Zimmermann <italic>et al</italic>. were similar, the delay in HRQOL improvement may be due to different group of population studied. RCT by Rugno <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] in advanced gynec-oncology patients showed significant improvement in HRQOL. This RCT had a selection bias due to the lack of palliative care referral protocol. The RCTs by Walker <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Lowery <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] were primarily designed to assess the improvement in depression and cost benefit, respectively. HRQOL was a secondary endpoint. While few other RCTs[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] have demonstrated HRQOL benefits of palliative care, these interventions were either not specialist palliative care or was not initiated early in the course of illness.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Mood, depression, and anxiety</title><p>According to studies, early specialist palliative care improves mood, depression, and anxiety.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] RCTs by Pirl <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Walker <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] showed that improvement in depression was independent of pharmacological treatment. In the study by Pirl <italic>et al</italic>., improvement in depression scores did not correlate with improved survival. A possible explanation could be that epidermal growth factor receptor wild type mutation in lung cancer is an independent risk factor influencing depression and survival.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In RCTs by Pirl <italic>et al</italic>. and Walker <italic>et al</italic>., patients in both groups received antidepressants. Improvement in depression may be due to intense counseling, phone follow-up, and regular titration of antidepressants in the specialist palliative care intervention group. Two RCTs by Bakitas <italic>et al</italic>. (ENABLE II and III trials) showed no improvement in anxiety and depression with specialist palliative care intervention.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] This may be due to the specialist palliative care intervention in these trials being mainly psycho-education with limited clinical input from specialist palliative care physicians. ENABLE III trial was not adequately powered to detect patient-reported outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Symptom control</title><p>According to studies, early specialist palliative care intervention improves symptoms[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The RCT by Zimmermann <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] showed symptom improvement at 4 months. Here, the trial was originally designed to detect symptom improvement at 3 months. Furthermore, in this study, the actual difference in symptom scores was marginal. This may be due to low symptom burden in early specialist palliative care group. This is evident as many study subjects declined to participate in the study during screening due to the lack of symptoms. The RCT by Rugno <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] showed only improvement in insomnia. The retrospective review of medical records by Kwon <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] had both selection bias and referral bias. This study had no protocol for palliative care referral, and palliative outpatient services was called supportive care services to source more referral. Two RCTs, ENABLE II[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and ENABLE III[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] did not show any improvement in symptoms. This could be because specialist palliative care interventions were nurse led education interventions with limited specialist palliative care physician input. A mixed method (RCT and qualitative) study in surgical oncology patients showed no perceived improvement in symptoms with early specialist palliative care intervention.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] However, the patients in the study group felt reassured knowing pain and palliative care services were available. This study was underpowered to detect MCID difference for pain, and the patients had a combination of postoperative and cancer pain.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Survival</title><p>According to studies, early specialist palliative care improves survival.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] RCTs by Temel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Bakitas <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] were conducted in outpatient ambulatory setting. However, RCTs studying hospital- and home-based palliative care model did not show survival improvement with palliative care intervention.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In the study by Temel <italic>et al</italic>., survival benefit was not the study end point, and it was achieved following several secondary post hoc analyses. The trial was underpowered to show survival benefit. Cancer staging, extent of chemotherapy received, and baseline comorbid illness were not clearly stated. These could be confounding factors when estimating survival benefit. Although in the study by Bakitas <italic>et al</italic>., the survival benefit was not statistically significant, 15% improvement in median survival is clinically significant. The studies by Brumley <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Gade <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] studying home- and hospital-based palliative care models, had a heterogeneous population of cancer and noncancer with multiple comorbid conditions and poor performance status. Although these patient population groups did not have survival benefit, they had good relief of symptoms, emotional well-being, and satisfaction of care. Hence, survival benefit may not be a reliable marker of specialist palliative care intervention in these settings. RCT by Rugno <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] has correlated survival benefit to improved HRQOL. This view is supported by other RCTs.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] There is conflicting evidence on the improvement in depression correlating with improved survival.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] A positive correlation is seen between receiving less intravenous (IV) chemotherapy, and early hospice referral with improved survival.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec3-5"><title>Treatment decision making</title><p>A RCT in NSCLC[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] showed that early specialist palliative care intervention decreased use of IV chemotherapy in the last 2 months of life, and there was longer time gap between IV chemotherapy and death. Survival was longer in the group with less IV chemotherapy. This could be due to &#x0003c;10% response to second line IV chemotherapy, significant side effects of IV chemotherapy causing inadvertent shortening of life[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and greater efficacy of oral chemotherapy[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] in advanced NSCLC. Timely cessation of chemotherapy at the end-of-life also facilitates early hospice referral.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In the study by Greer <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] chemotherapy decision-making was not envisaged as the study outcome during trial design and chemotherapy regimens between the groups were not standardized. The study was carried out in NSCLC patients and results of this study cannot be extrapolated to other malignancies such as breast or head and neck cancers with a more indolent course. Findings of RCT by Geer <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] are supported by studies in advanced gynec-oncology patients[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and advanced ovarian cancer patients,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] which has also shown less chemotherapy use in last months of life.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-6"><title>Advanced care planning</title><p>According to studies, early specialist palliative care improves illness perception, goals of care discussion, and advanced care planning.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] In the RCT by Temel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] in NSCLC patients receiving early specialist palliative care intervention, higher proportion of patients were aware that their disease was not curable at 12 weeks. Furthermore, the patients in early palliative care group had better awareness that the goal of cancer treatment was not cure. Patients who had better illness perception and better awareness of goals of treatment received less IV chemotherapy at end-of-life. Although this study was adequately powered, it did not use a validated tool to assess illness perception. The study findings were supported by a qualitative study by Yoong <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] However, this qualitative study was a retrospective analysis of medical records.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-7"><title>Health-resource utilization and health-related cost</title><p>According to studies, early specialist palliative care decreases acute hospital admission, emergency department visits, and length of hospital stay.

Studies by Temel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Greer <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] were adequately powered RCTs conducted in ambulatory NSCLC setting. Study by Lowery <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] studied cost saving benefit and health care utilization in platinum resistant ovarian cancer, which has similar prognostic outcomes as NSCLC. All these three studies were conducted at the USA and early hospice referral was attributed to receiving less IV chemotherapy at the end-of-life. The study findings are relevant for the United States setting, as patients cannot access concurrent hospice care alongside IV chemotherapy.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Studies by McNamara <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Hui <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and Kwon <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] were retrospective study of medical records and in all these studies, the data were not primarily collected for research purposes.

However, majority of studies in this review were non-RCTs, from United States, and emphasized direct cost benefits. Studies by May <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and Lowery <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] were cohort studies and had selection biases due to selective palliative care referral.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-8"><title>End-of-life care</title><p>According to studies, early specialist palliative care improves the end-of-life care outcomes.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] In the RCT by Temel <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] the early specialist palliative care group received less aggressive medical interventions at the end-of-life and higher rates of documentation of end-of-life preferences.

There could be communication gaps with patients and caregivers receiving mixed messages from oncologists and palliative care providers. There might be ethical dilemmas in timing of palliative care referral in clinical situations with unclear illness trajectory and uncertain prognosis. Dealing with patient's unrealistic expectation and dealing with patient's perceptions of palliative care referral could be challenging for the oncologists. Logistics involved in palliative care referral, timely access, and additional costs involved could be other barriers for palliative care referral. All these qualitative studies had disproportionately higher number of physicians with a small group of other health care providers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Role of early specialist palliative care and patient outcomes in adult oncology have been extensively studied. There is a paucity of literature on role of early specialist palliative care intervention in pediatric and geriatric oncology. In adult oncology, there is evidence to suggest early specialist palliative care improves HRQOL, mood, treatment decision-making, healthcare utilization, advanced care planning, patient satisfaction, and end-of-life care. However, there is moderate evidence to support role of early specialist palliative care intervention in improvement of symptoms, survival and health related communication. There is limited evidence to support role of early specialist palliative care interventions in pediatric and geriatric oncology. Qualitative studies on barriers and negative patient outcomes may provide useful insights toward restructuring early specialist palliative care interventions. Further research and build-up of evidence is needed to facilitate development of early specialist care intervention as one more model of palliative care delivery.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial
