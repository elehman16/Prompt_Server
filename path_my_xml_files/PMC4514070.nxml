Five y after vaccination, in subjects from the Month 60 according-to-protocol cohort (seronegative and DNA negative for HPV type analyzed at baseline), serum neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses induced by HPV-16/18 vaccine remained 7.8-fold (18-26-y stratum), 5.6-fold (27-35-y stratum) and 2.3-fold (36-45-y stratum) higher than those induced by HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine for HPV-16. For HPV-18, the fold differences were 12.1, 13.0 and 7.8, respectively. At Month 60, all (100%) subjects in HPV-16/18 vaccine group and the majority (95.7%-97.5%) in HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine group were seropositive for HPV-16. For HPV-18, the majority (98.1%-100%) of subjects in HPV-16/18 vaccine group were seropositive; however, seropositivity rates in HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine group decreased considerably (61.1%-76.9%) across the 3 age strata. In the total vaccinated cohort (received &#x02265; 1 dose regardless of baseline HPV serostatus and DNA status), geometric mean titers for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 nAb were higher in HPV-16/18 vaccine group than in HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine group. Based on the 5-y data, piece-wise and modified power-law models predicted a longer durability of nAb response for HPV-16/18 vaccine compared to HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine. Beyond the differences apparent between the vaccines in terms of immunogenicity and modeled persistence of antibody responses, comparative studies including clinical endpoints would be needed to determine whether differences exist in duration of vaccine-induced protection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>antibodies</kwd><kwd><italic>Cervarix&#x000ae;</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Gardasil</italic>&#x000ae;</kwd><kwd>human papillomavirus</kwd><kwd>immunogenicity</kwd><kwd>models</kwd><kwd>neutralizing</kwd><kwd>statistical</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="3"/><ref-count count="17"/><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AAHS</term><def><p>amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AS04</term><def><p>Adjuvant System containing 3-<italic>O</italic>-desacyl-<italic>4&#x02019;</italic>-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) adsorbed on aluminum salt (500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g Al<sup>3+</sup>)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ATP</term><def><p>according-to-protocol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ED<sub>50</sub></term><def><p>effective dose producing 50% response</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ELISA</term><def><p>enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GMT</term><def><p>geometric mean titer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HPV</term><def><p>human papillomavirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSC</term><def><p>medically significant condition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>nAb</term><def><p>neutralizing antibodies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NOAD</term><def><p>new onset autoimmune disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NOCD</term><def><p>new onset chronic disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBNA</term><def><p>pseudovirion-based neutralization assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SP</term><def><p>seropositivity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TVC</term><def><p>total vaccinated cohort</p></def></def-item></def-list></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Two virus-like particle-based prophylactic vaccines against oncogenic, high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 have been licensed in over 130 countries: the HPV-16/18 vaccine (<italic>Cervarix&#x000ae;</italic>, GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines) and the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine (<italic>Gardasil</italic>&#x000ae;, Merck).

As predicted by both the piece-wise and modified power-law models, even 20 y after the first vaccination, anti-HPV-16 nAb levels from women of any age stratum in the HPV-16/18 vaccine group appeared to remain higher than those from any age stratum in the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine group. The differences in anti-HPV-18 nAb response between the 2 vaccines (7.8-13.0 fold) were more pronounced. While the HPV-16/18 vaccine induced anti-HPV-18 nAb plateau levels across the 3 age strata that remained substantially above the level associated with natural infection, the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine induced anti-HPV-18 nAb plateau levels similar to or below the level associated with natural infection. Both the piece-wise and modified power-law models predicted an anti-HPV-18 nAb level lower than that associated with natural infection 20 y after vaccination with the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine. In a 5-y study of the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine in a younger age population (aged 16-23&#x000a0;y), while the vaccine-induced anti-HPV-16 nAb level (assessed by Merck competitive Luminex immunoassay) remained above the level associated with natural infection, the anti-HPV-18 nAb level decreased to a level close to that associated with natural infection.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p>The decrease of anti-HPV-18 nAb levels within 5-y follow-up was further reflected in the loss of seropositivity among at least 20% of women in the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine group across all age strata. At Month 60, in women who received the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine, while the seropositivity rate for anti-HPV-16 nAb remained high (95.7-97.5%), the seropositivity rate for anti-HPV-18 nAbs decreased substantially (61.1-76.9%), across all age strata. In contrast, seropositivity rates for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 nAbs remained high (100% and 98.1-100%, respectively) across all age groups in women who received the HPV-16/18 vaccine.

Both models showed that nAb responses induced by the HPV-16/18 vaccine could remain longer above the levels associated with natural infection than with the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine, across the 3 age strata. Actual measured ELISA results also compared well with the prediction models. Interestingly, the modified power-law model showed that the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine would induce a lifelong anti-HPV-16 immunoglobulin G antibody response (as determined by ELISA) above the level associated with natural infection; however, the anti-HPV-16 nAb response was predicted to remain above the level associated with natural infection for only 1-2 y. This needs to be considered with caution as protection is thought to be driven by nAb.</p><p>In a study of the HPV-16/18 vaccine, levels of anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies reached a plateau approximately 18 months after initial vaccination and remained several-fold above the levels induced by natural infection through 8.4 y of follow-up.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Here, a similar trend was predicted for the HPV-16/18 vaccine by the modified power-law model; a plateau in antibody responses at approximately 18 months after initial vaccination and a long-term immune response with antibody titers predicted to be sustained above those associated with natural infection.</p><p>Limitations of this 5-y follow-up include the low number of subjects who attended the Month 60 visit. This may be explained by the fact that the study was initially planned for 4&#x000a0;y&#x02014;only 38% of women consented for the one-y extension follow-up. Modeling programs have limitations as they process clinical data based on pre-established assumptions.

The piece-wise model is based solely upon antibody levels (fitted based on different non-overlapping time intervals) and makes the conservative assumption that antibody responses will follow a linear decrease from Month 21 onwards<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>. In reality, actual antibody levels at the subsequent time points (Months 24, 36, 48, and 60) would also influence the long-term persistence of the anti-HPV-16/18 antibody response.

Another limitation is that our study excluded adolescent girls, the primary target group for vaccination. However, a separate comparative study conducted in 12-15 y old girls reported a higher level of antibody response with the HPV-16/18 vaccine compared with the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and another head-to-head immunogenicity study in 9-14 y old girls is ongoing (NCT01462357).

This report will include modeling of the level of this response up to 20 y post-vaccination (NCT00877877).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s0004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, data from this head-to-head clinical trial indicate that the HPV-16/18 vaccine is capable of inducing a higher immune response compared with the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine. Statistical modeling predicts that the immune response induced by the HPV-16/18 vaccine could persist for longer than those induced by the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine. These study results should be interpreted with caution as there is currently no defined immunological correlate of protection. Comparative studies including clinical endpoints would be needed to determine whether differences exist between the vaccines in terms of duration of vaccine-induced protection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s0005"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="s0005-0001"><title>Study design, immunogenicity and safety assessments</title><p>Study participants, ethics, study design and vaccine composition have previously been reported.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref> Briefly, this phase III, observer-blind, randomized, age-stratified, parallel group trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00423046) was initiated in January 2007 and data for the Month 60 analysis were collected up to May 2012 in the USA. Women stratified by age (18-26, 27-35 and 36-45&#x000a0;y) were randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive 0.5&#x000a0;mL of HPV-16/18 vaccine or HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine according to their recommended 3-dose regimens (Months 0, 1 and 6 or Months 0, 2 and 6, respectively). In order to maintain the blind, women received one dose of placebo (aluminum hydroxide) at either Month 1 or 2, as appropriate.
