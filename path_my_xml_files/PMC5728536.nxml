Other groups at risk of developing iron deficiency are infants, young children, adolescents, elderly with a poor nutrient intake, vegetarians, athletes and pregnant women [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Anemia affects an estimated two billion people, and causes approximately 0.8 million deaths a year worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although iron deficiency is not the only cause of anemia, the WHO estimates that iron deficiency is responsible for approximately 50% of all anemia cases [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This approximates to 1 billion cases of iron-deficiency anemia worldwide. Consequences of iron deficiency, and primarily iron deficiency anemia, are diversified and range from fatigue [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and decreased aerobic performance [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], to altered cognitive functions [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], immune system alterations [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and increased risk of maternal and child mortality [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In order to improve iron status by dietary means, iron deficient individuals are recommended to eat foods rich in iron or in combination with food components that increase the bioavailability of the dietary iron, where the latter has shown to be of major importance [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Ascorbic acid [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and meat [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] are examples of dietary factors that have shown to enhance non-heme iron absorption, whereas calcium [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], polyphenols [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and phytic acid [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] inhibit non-heme iron absorption. Another factor that may increase the absorption of iron is probiotics [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The definition of probiotics is, according to FAO/WHO, "<italic>live micro-organisms which</italic>, <italic>when administered in adequate amounts</italic>, <italic>confer a health benefit on the host</italic>" [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract hosts an astounding amazing &#x0003e;100 trillion (10<sup>14</sup>) microbes. In the human colon more than 1200 bacterial species have been identified, with each healthy individual harboring at least 160 shared species [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In iron deficient and anaemic women in southern India it was observed that the amount of faecal lactobacilli was significantly lower than in a control group but there was no difference between the two groups with respect to other investigated bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Earlier human meal studies have also shown that intake of lactic acid fermented vegetables and cereals give a significant increase in iron absorption [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. An intake of a lactobacilli may therefore increase the iron absorption and this has been investigated in earlier trials using the strain <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> 299v (Lp299v). Lp299v has been shown to possess the ability to survive the passage through the gastrointestinal tract [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], to colonize human intestinal mucosa [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and also to increase the absorption of iron [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] when present live in fermented oat gruel and in fruit drinks.</p><p>The use of probiotics in food products poses some challenges when it comes to shelf-life, especially at room temperature. One potential alternative is to use freeze-dried lactobacilli in a capsule, with a shelf-life of 24 months. However, it is not known if freeze dried probiotics included in a capsule will increase the iron absorption similar to what has been shown for probiotics added directly into foods. The working hypothesis of the present study was that non-heme iron absorption from a meal is promoted by a simultaneous intake of freeze-dried <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> 299v (Lp299v).</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>General protocol / design</title><p>The study was executed by a nutritionist and a research engineer at the laboratory of the Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. The study was designed as a single blinded placebo controlled sequential iron absorption trial in healthy, Swedish female volunteers of reproductive age. The subjects were students recruited at two Swedish universities, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, and Chalmers University of Technology. The methodology used was a double isotope technique [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], where iron absorption from two different meals (A and B) is determined by labeling the meals with either <sup>55</sup>Fe or <sup>59</sup>Fe. One of the benefits of this technique is that each subject becomes her own control. The double isotope technique can be considered the present golden standard in iron absorption methodology. With the double isotope technique iron absorption is assessed by calculating the difference between the administered radioactivity and the radioactivity measured either in blood (iron incorporation in erythrocytes) or in the total body (in a whole body counter). When using the whole body counting the iron absorption from the <sup>59</sup>Fe (a &#x003b3;-emitting isotope) labeled meal is calculated as the percentage of detected whole-body radioactivity, corrected for physical decay and background radioactivity. However, absorption from <sup>55</sup>Fe, which is a &#x003b2;-emitting isotope, cannot be detected by whole-body counting. Thus, after WBC, a blood sample is drawn in which the relative absorption of each of the two isotopes is determined using a liquid scintillator. This relative absorption is then used to calculate the total body <sup>55</sup>Fe absorption.</p><p>A light meal, consisting of two breakfast buns with table margarine and orange marmalade, and a glass of water, were served on four consecutive mornings to fasting subjects. During the first two mornings, together with the light meal, the fasting subjects were served capsules containing no lactobacilli (A), whereas capsules containing 10<sup>10</sup> colony-forming units (cfu) Lp299v (B) were served on morning 3 and 4. The reason for chosing the order AABB was to avoid any remaining lactobacilli effect that may occur if Lp299v were administered before the placebo capsules [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Also, comparative studies have shown that iron absorption from two different meals labeled with either <sup>55</sup>Fe or <sup>59</sup>Fe does not differ between individuals regardless of administration order [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In order to reduce the day-to-day-variation in iron absorption [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] each meal (i.e. with and without Lp299v) was administered during two consecutive days from which the mean daily iron absorption was calculated. Two separate studies with the same protocol were performed. The number of subjects included in each of the two studies was 18 and 36, respectively. For study 1 participant were recruited during January&#x02013;February 2014, and the study was executed during February&#x02013;March 2014. For study 2 participants were recruited during April&#x02013;May 2014, and the study was executed during May&#x02013;June 2014. The study was registered at Clinical trials (NCT02131870). The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Meal content</title><p>Each meal consisted of two breakfast buns (made from a total of 80 grams of low extraction wheat flour, 56 grams of water, 5.2 grams of yeast, 2.6 g of sugar, and 0.8 g of NaCl) with Flora table margarine (15 grams), orange marmalade (20 grams) and a glass of water (200 mL). When baking the buns, they were fermented for 2 x 30 minutes, and then baked at 240&#x000b0;C for 10 min. After baking the buns were kept frozen at -20&#x000b0;C and thawed before serving. In addition the meal contained 0.6 mg iron, 21 mg Ca, and 2.6 mg ascorbic acid, the two latter being dietary factors known to influence iron absorption. The phytate content in the buns was negligible since a low extraction wheat flower was used and the dough was fermented twice [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The recipe for making the buns / wheat rolls has been used by our research group for almost 40 years and it was specially developed at our lab as to maximize the reduction of phytates [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It was also the basis from which the iron absorption algorithm by Hallberg and Hulth&#x000e9;n was developed [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. During the 35 years that the wheat rolls has been used by our research group the same individual in our staff has been involved in baking them. In our experience, there would not be any difference in phytate content in the meals between study 1 and 2.</p><p>Together with each meal a total of 3 capsules were administered.

Also when solely including subjects having S-ferritin &#x0003c;60 ug/L there was no statistical difference in iron absorption between the capsule meals with Lp299v in the two studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Discussion</title><p>There seem to be a close relationship between diet, microbiota and health status [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], where dietary components are able to alter the gut microbiota [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, survival and viability of externally added probiotic bacteria in gastric and pancreatic juice is often rather poor in <italic>in vitro</italic> trials [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Likewise, during refrigerated storage some probiotic strains exhibits loss in viability [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Freeze drying and microencapsulation, on the other hand, increases probiotic viability and stability [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], making these feasible methods for delivering the probiotic cultures in the right location of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Earlier studies have shown iron absorption enhancing properties of Lp299v when not lyophilized [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A previous study by Bering <italic>et al</italic> observed no effect on iron absorption from adding lyophilized Lp299v to oat gruel [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The explanation for lack of effect given in the publication was that the bacteria might not have been in a comparatively active state. However, the present study demonstrated that freeze-dried <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> 299v (Lp299v) is capable of increasing non-heme iron absorption from a concurrently administered meal. This is probably related to that the freeze-dried bacteria this time was included in a capsule and could be released in the stomach and thus had the possibility to reach the small intestine in an active state.</p><p>The increase in iron absorption was from a cereal meal already having a relatively high iron bioavailability since it contained a low content of phytates, the main contributor to low iron availability in cereals. Theoretically, when added to a meal with low iron bioavailability, the positive effect on iron absorption may be even more pronounced as has shown to be the case with ascorbic acid [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Consuming a meal of low iron bioavailability results in more iron residing in the GI lumen. By increasing the bioavailability of the iron in the diet by providing Lp299v, the dose of iron in the diet could be lower, reducing the amount of iron passing the GI tract without being absorbed. From an oxidative state of view, there are indications that redundant amounts of iron in the GI tract can result in an increased oxidative stress, with its negative aftermath [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p>By administering a fermented oatmeal drink with Lp299v to subjects for 4 weeks, Goossens <italic>et al</italic> significantly increased the number of lactobacilli in the fecal flora of the subjects within 1 week. However, this effect disappeared within 1 week after cessation of intake [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. So, in order to detaining a steady colonization of Lp299v, and by that the positive effects, it seems to be necessary to keep supplying the lactobacilli.</p><p>The enhancing properties of Lp299v on iron absorption can probably be attributed to the persistency of Lp299v in the intestine. In order to reduce the day-to-day-variation in iron absorption in the present study mean absorption from two identical meals administered on two consecutive days was calculated. However, by using this methodology it is not possible to determine exactly how the Lp299v effect is mediated. Does it occur in the same way as other dietary factors influencing iron absorption, i.e., only in the common pool of the administered meal and thus having a transitory effect (i.e., same enhancing effect on day 1 as on day 2), or is it a more prolonged effect caused by intestine persistency? If the latter is the case, it could mean that the enhancing effect of administrating Lp299v differs between day 1 and day 2.</p><p>Interestingly, <italic>in vitro</italic> results recently showed that <italic>Lactobacillus fermentum</italic> has a ferric-reducing activity. This activity is proposed to be executed via an excreted molecule, p-hydroxyphenyllactic acid, which reduces ferric iron into the more bioavailable ferrous iron, and thereby boosts Fe(II) absorption through the DMT1 channels in the intestines [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. If Lp299v also has a ferric-reducing activity is not known today.</p><p>The basis for including only women of reproductive age in the present study was the fact that this group is at higher risk of developing iron deficiency due to iron losses during menstruation. The presently used iron absorption methodology has been used extensively over the years and has been thoroughly discussed by Hallberg [<xref rid="pone.0189141.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and others. To the best of our knowledge there is nothing indicating that iron absorption would differ by mere gender. Thus, the present result is most likely applicable to other groups beside women of reproductive age.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to unexpected technical problems at the whole body counter facilities the intention to utilize the whole body counter for the present study had to be abandoned. Instead the iron absorption was solely assessed from radio iron incorporation into erythrocytes, which can be seen as a limitation of the study since it requires two important estimations. These are the percentage of absorbed iron that is incorporation in erythrocytes, and the actual blood volume of the subject. Estimates for blood volume are usually calculated from sex, weight, and height. In healthy subjects having normal iron status, approximately 80% of absorbed iron will be incorporated into erythrocytes. However, this figure can differ depending on e.g. iron status, or presence of inflammation or infection. Nevertheless, since each subject is her own control, this limitation has most likely only a potential effect on the accuracy, not the iron absorption ratio between meal A and meal B, which is the primary outcome of the present study.</p><p><italic>In conclusion</italic>, the results brought forward in the present study further strengthen the evidence that Lp299v enhances iron absorption when concurrently added to a meal. Thus, Lp299v provide a valuable alternative for increasing iron bioavailability in the diet of vulnerable individuals who are in need of increasing their iron uptake due to high requirements. By increasing the bioavailability of iron in the diet by providing Lp299v it could be possible to lower the amount of iron added to a meal, and therefore reduce the amount of iron residing in the GI tract leading to negative health consequences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0189141.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Bilaga 2- STUDY PROTOCOL.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0189141.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0189141.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Bilaga 2- STUDY PROTOCOL ENG.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0189141.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0189141.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Trendstatement_TREND_Checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0189141.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0189141.s004"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Data&#x02014;Study 1.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0189141.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0189141.s005"><label>S2 Data</label><caption><title>Data&#x02014;Study 2.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0189141.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge Elisabeth Gramatkovski at the University of Gothenburg for her valuable technical assistance in connection with all aspects in performing this study.
