both interventions, relative to the control group, on the primary outcome of weight
gain over the average of 3 years of follow-up; moreover, weight in the Large Change
condition was significantly reduced relative to the Small Change condition. In the
present study, we hypothesized that the Large Change intervention would produce the
most positive effects on CVD risk factors in association with its effect on weight
change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S7"><title>Design</title><p id="P8">SNAP was an NIH funded clinical trial conducted at 2 clinical sites (UNC
at Chapel Hill and The Miriam Hospital Providence RI) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>); Wake Forest
University Health Sciences was the coordinating center. The study was approved
by the IRBs at each of these locations. SNAP targeted 600 young adults who were
randomly assigned with equal probability to 1 of 3 groups: Control, Small
Changes, Large Changes. Assessments were completed at baseline, 4 months, and
then annually. However, lipids, glucose and insulin were assessed only at
baseline and 2 years and thus those time points are the focus of the present
analyses. Change in CVD outcomes was a pre-specified secondary outcome for this
trial. The design has been described in detail and consort diagram provided in a
prior publication.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>
Participants were recruited from 2010 to 2012 and data were analyzed from 2015
to 2016.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Participants</title><p id="P9">The SNAP study recruited individuals who were aged 18&#x02013;35, with a
BMI of 21 to 30.9. Normal weight and overweight young adults were included since
both weight groups are at increased risk of weight gain relative to older
individuals. Other eligibility criteria included access to Internet, English
speaking, no history or current anorexia or bulimia nervosa and completion of
screening and baseline assessment visits. Of the 599 participants in SNAP, 76
did not have measured weight at 2 years and an additional 52 had neither blood
pressure nor blood work at this time, bringing the sample for this analysis to
N= 471.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Interventions</title><p id="P10">The interventions have been described in detail.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The Control group attended one face-to-face meeting
where they were introduced to both the small and large changes approaches to
prevention of weight gain, but this group did not receive any further assistance
with weight gain prevention. The two active interventions were both based on
self-regulation; participants were encouraged to weigh themselves daily and to
use the information from the scale to make changes in diet and physical activity
as needed.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Both interventions began with
10 face-to-face group meetings over the first 4 months. The &#x0201c;Small
Change&#x0201d; intervention group was introduced to a variety of strategies to
reduce daily intake by approximately 100 calories each day (e.g. omitting a
slice of cheese from sandwich; selecting wine rather than a mixed
drink).<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> They were given pedometers and
taught to increase their daily steps by 2000 steps per day (thereby expending
approximately an additional 100 calories in activity) through changes such as
using the stairs and parking further from their destination. The &#x0201c;Large
Change&#x0201d; intervention was encouraged to lose 5 pounds if normal weight
and 10 pounds if overweight to produce a buffer against the expected weight
gains.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The weight
loss was produced by prescribing an initial weight loss calorie goal and
encouraging gradual increases in moderate to vigorous activity until achieving a
goal of 250 minutes per week. At the end of the 4 months, participants in both
groups were instructed to report their weight at least once a week via web or
SMS. They received monthly e-mail feedback on their weight based on a
color-coded system<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and were either reinforced for
their success, encouraged to use problem solving, or recommended additional
strategies that were consistent with the small or large change approach to help
reverse weight gain. Participants who gained above baseline were encouraged to
contact us for additional guidance, but few participants used this option. In
addition, after the initial 4 months, both interventions were offered two 4-week
on-line refresher courses each year to help them reinstate the large or small
change strategies. Approximately 50% of participants joined these
optional refreshers, with comparable participation in Large and Small
Changes.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Clinical measures</title><p id="P11">Assessments were completed by research staff members who were masked to
the intervention assignments. Weight was assessed in kilograms in to the nearest
.1 kg, in light clothes, without shoes, using a calibrated scale, and height was
determined in centimeters to the nearest .5 cm with a wall mounted stadiometer.
Two measures of weight and height were taken and averaged; if the two measures
differed by more than .2 kg or .5cm, a third measure was taken and all three
were averaged. Blood pressure was assessed with a Dinamap Monitor Pro 100. Cuff
size was determined by arm circumference. Three measures were taken with a
30-second interval between and averaged. Fasting blood samples were collected at
baseline and two years for analysis of lipids (total cholesterol; HDL-C;
triglycerides and calculated LDL-C) and glucose and insulin levels. These
measures were analyzed at the Northwest Lipid Metabolism and Diabetes Laboratory
at the University of Washington. We calculated HOMA-IR [(mg/dl) * (uU/mL)]. All
participants brought their prescription and non-prescription medications to the
assessment visits. Following each assessment, participants were sent written
feedback on their baseline and subsequent values and the ideal ranges for each
measure.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="P12">All analyses were completed on the 471 participants who had weight and
at least one CVD risk factor assessed at baseline and year 2. Baseline
descriptive statistics were computed overall and by treatment group. Means and
standard deviations were obtained for continuous variables; frequencies and
percentages for categorical variables. Differences at baseline among the
treatment groups were assessed using ANOVA for continuous measures, and
chi-square tests or Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests were used for categorical
measures depending on the adequacy of the sample size. Changes in weight and CVD
risk factors from baseline to year 2 were compared among the three treatment
groups using multiple linear regression; all models included clinic as a
covariate. Additionally, models for blood pressure and lipids excluded
participants who had ever taken medication for that condition (no participants
had ever taken diabetes medication). Both the nominal p-values and the
Bonferroni adjusted bounds (Type 1 error=0.05) required for significance are
provided. In addition, an observational analysis was conducted to examine the
effects of changes in weight on the risk factor changes. Participants were
divided into 5 categories based on percent change in weight between baseline and
year 2 (Lost &#x02265; 5%, Lost &#x0003c;5% to Lost
&#x0003e;1%, Lost &#x02264;1% to Gain &#x02264;1%,
Gain&#x0003e;1% to Gain &#x0003c;5%, Gain &#x02265;5%.
These categories were chosen because they corresponded to the clinically
significant 5% weight change and the .45 kg weight gain used in the
primary statistical analyses,<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and because they resulted in similar sample sizes among the
categories. CVD risk factor changes were compared across the 5 categories,
adjusting for clinic and treatment group. Interactions between treatment group
and percent change in weight categories were assessed. All analyses were
performed using SAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S12"><title>RESULTS</title><p id="P13">Baseline characteristics of these participants are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Few differences among the three groups
were seen at baseline. On average, participants were 28.3 (4.4) years of age and had
a BMI of 25.5 (2.6). Twenty-three percent were males and 25% reported
minority race/ethnicity. In general, this was a very healthy group; on average, they
had blood pressures of 110/71 mmHg, total cholesterol of 173 mg/dl, and fasting
glucose of 90 mg/dl. The N=471 included in this analysis represented 78%,
77% and 81% of the participants who were originally randomized to
Control, Small Changes, and Large Changes, respectively, and contained a greater
proportion of participants from UNC than from Providence relative to those not
included; site was used as a covariate in subsequent analyses. No other differences
at baseline or in weight changes during the trial were observed between those with
2-year data and those without these data.</p><sec id="S13"><title>Weight Change</title><p id="P14">The weight change data have been reported previously<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> but are presented here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) to show results for the 471
participants included in this manuscript. Mean (SE) weight changes at 2 years
(when blood work was completed) were +0.49 (0.37), &#x02212;1.00 (0.37) and
&#x02212;1.58 (0.37) kg in Control, Small, and Large Changes, respectively. The
overall p-value for the comparison of changes in weight from baseline to 2 years
among groups was p&#x0003c;.001, and Control differed significantly from both
Small (p=.005) and Large Changes (p&#x0003c;.001); the difference between Large
and Small Changes was not significant at 2 years (p=.27). These weight losses
are very similar to what was previously reported for the full sample.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Changes in CVD risk factors by treatment group</title><p id="P15"><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows the changes in CVD
risk factors from baseline to 2 years in each of the three groups. Changes in
glucose (p=.05), insulin (p=.03), and the HOMA-IR ratio (p=.02) differed among
the three groups, with greater improvements from baseline to two years in Large
Changes than Control. However, after adjusting for either multiple comparisons
or for weight change at 2 years, there were no significant differences in CVD
risk factor changes among the treatment groups.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Changes in CVD risk factors by Weight Loss</title><p id="P16">We next examined the effect of percent change in weight over 2 years of
follow-up on the changes in CVD risk factors. Collapsing across the three
treatment groups, we divided participants into the following categories based on
their percent weight change from baseline to 2 years: Lost &#x02265; 5%
(N=103), Lost &#x0003e; 1 to &#x0003c; 5% (N=130); No change (Lost
&#x02264; 1% to gain &#x02264; 1%) (N=62); gain &#x0003e;
1&#x02013;&#x0003c; 5% (N=103); gain &#x02265; 5% (N=73).
Intervention condition and clinic were both associated with the proportion of
participants in each of the weight categories and were thus entered into the
subsequent analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table S1</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table
3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> show the
differences among the weight change categories for the CVD risk factors and
provide the nominal p-values. With Bonferroni adjustments, larger weight loss at
2 years was significantly associated with more positive changes in HDL-C,
triglycerides, insulin, HOMA-IR and SBP. There were no significant interactions
between the weight change categories and intervention condition or clinic; thus,
weight change per se, not the type of intervention, was associated with the
changes in CVD risk factors.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S16"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P17">This study shows that weight changes over 2 years in young adults are
strongly related to changes in CVD risk factors and suggests that interventions to
prevent this weight gain, especially if resulting in weight loss, can impact the
health of this age group. Although the mean changes in CVD risk factors were not
large in this sample which had normal CVD risk factors at baseline, the worsening in
CVD risk factors occurred over just 2 years, raising concern about the longer-term
consequences of continued weight gain with age in young adults. However, our data
also suggest that weight losses of just 5% or more lead to significantly
greater improvements in lipids and glycemic control relative to remaining weight
stable or gaining weight.</p><p id="P18">We also showed that the Large Change approach led to significant weight loss
at 2 years relative to the Control group. Whereas on average participants in the
Control group gained 0.49 kg, those in Large Changes lost &#x02212;1.58 kg. The
difference in weight loss at 2 years led to greater improvements in glucose, insulin
and HOMA-IR in Large Changes than Control. However, after adjusting for multiple
comparisons, none of the effects of intervention condition on risk factor change
were statistically significant. Our findings suggest that interventions that result
in greater weight loss relative to Control groups are needed to produce significant
differences in CVD risk factors.</p><p id="P19">As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, the Large Change
approach was associated with marked weight loss at 4 months and then gradual regain
from month 4 to 2 years. However, we found no evidence that the initial (4 month)
weight change in the Large Change condition contributed either positively or
negatively to the changes in glucose, insulin or insulin resistance at 2 years,
independent of the weight changes at 2 years (data not shown). In contrast to these
findings, in Look AHEAD, a study of 5,145 overweight/obese individuals with type 2
diabetes, half of whom were randomized to lifestyle intervention, we found that
individuals who had the largest weight losses from baseline to one year had the most
positive effects for glycemic control at 4 years, even if they regained this weight
between years 1 and 4.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> This
difference between the outcomes in the two studies may relate to the characteristics
of the participants (in particular Look AHEAD participants all had diabetes and were
older) or to the magnitude and timing of weight loss/regain. Moreover, the current
study, like others,<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> failed to find any adverse effects
of weight loss followed by weight regain (or &#x0201c;weight cycling&#x0201d;) on
the CVD risk factors. Rather, in this study, the effects of weight loss on CVD risk
factors appeared to be due entirely to weight losses at the time of the assessment
of the CVD risk factor and did not differ according to the pattern of earlier weight
changes.</p><p id="P20">The Control group in this study gained 0 .49 kg over 2 years. This was less
than anticipated, and less than seen in the CARDIA study.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> It is
possible that the initial education session, the feedback on weight and risk factors
after each assessment, or the fact that all participants had joined a weight gain
prevention study, blunted the weight gain. The smaller weight gain in the Control
group relative to CARDIA may also reflect temporal trends in weight gain.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, it is important to note
that in the Control group, 46% gained weight and 39% lost weight
over the two years. In contrast, in the intervention groups 34 &#x02013; 36%
gained weight and over half of the participants lost weight (54 and 56%).
Thus, these interventions produced a favorable shift in the distribution of weight
changes experienced over two years.</p><p id="P21">Strengths of this study include the large sample size, randomized design,
and 2-year follow-up. The major limitations relate to the generalizability of the
results to the broader population of young adults which may have more abnormal CVD
risk factors and less interest in weight gain prevention than our participants. In
addition, the supporting analyses comparing changes in CVD risk factors across
weight change categories has the potential to be affected by unmeasured confounds,
such as family history of CVD and level of motivation to lose weight. Finally, we
measured CVD risk factors only at baseline and 2 years; the differences in CVD risk
factor changes among the 3 intervention groups may have been much greater at 4
months and 1 year, when the groups differed more dramatically in their weight
changes. Given the impact of weight change on the changes in CVD risk factors in
young adults, more research is needed to develop stronger weight gain approaches.
These efforts could include strategies to increase the initial weight loss and/or
prevent the subsequent weight regain that occurred in the Large Changes group or to
produce additional periods of weight loss in future years by reinstating Large
Changes. Alternatively, strategies to produce better maintenance of behavior changes
and consequently better maintenance of weight with Small Changes might be effective
longer-term if the Control group continues to gain weight as anticipated. The SNAP
trial is continuing to provide intervention to the Large and Small Changes groups
and will follow all participants through 6 years with repeated measures of CVD risk
factors at Year 6. This will provide important information on the effects of the
interventions on longer term weight change and on the association between weight
change and change in CVD risk factors in these young adults.</p><p id="P22">In conclusion, these analyses show that weight change over 2 years is
strongly related to changes in CVD risk factors over the same time period and
suggests that interventions that reduce weight gain over time, especially if
resulting in weight loss, will have positive impact on CVD risk in young adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><media xlink:href="NIHMS882848-supplement-supplement_1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e423" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN2"><p id="P23"><bold>Trial registration</bold>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>,

the magnitude of weight change rather than to a specific intervention. Thus,
interventions that result in greater weight loss, relative to Controls, are
needed to produce significant improvements in CVD risk factors.</p></sec></boxed-text></floats-group></article>
