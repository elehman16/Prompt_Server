It can be caused by excessive time spent on a task, circadian factors and sleep deprivation. It also correlates with a person's motivation and emotional status.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Work-related stress can also occurs when coping with job-related stressor results in imbalance between the demands made on an individual, and the individual's ability to meet that demand.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Adverse effects of persistent stress include: Physical illness such as hypertension, emotional deterioration manifested by chronic anxiety, depression, labile personality, drugs or chemical substance abuse and absenteeism.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] It had been documented that sleepy, exhausted anesthesiologists tend to have longer response latencies and greater variability in appropriateness of their responses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate how different work conditions affect personnel exhaustion by studying a sample of anesthesiologists comparing them with ophthalmologists and ancillary hospital staff working at the same facility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After approval of the local research and human ethics Committees and a written informed consent from the participant. A self-reporting questionnaire for assessment of socio-demographic factors and validated scales for fatigue and general health were used. Anonymity was completely preserved. None of the studied participants had a history of neither neurological nor psychiatric disorders or taking any medication that affects nervous system.</p><p>Work related exhaustion and mental health were measured by validated instruments which are Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory Scale (MFI 20) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ12) respectively. The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI 20)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] is a multidimensional test designed to measure five aspects of fatigue that include general, physical, reduced motivation, reduced activity and mental fatigue. Each aspect contains four items, it is a 5 point scale ranging from strongly agrees (5) to totally disagree (0). The sum score of each aspect ranges from 0 to 20 and hence the total fatigue (TF) ranges from 0 to 80. Participants were instructed to indicate how they felt in the last month prior to the questionnaire day. The scale does not contain any somatic items, designed to provide a complete description of the fatigue experience. The higher the scores the higher the degree of exhaustion, more concentration problems, reduced motivation and/or low level of activity.</p><p>General Health Questionnaire (GHQ12)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] developed by Goldberg and it was used in the present work to assess different aspects of mental health of the participants. The most important reasons for using the (GHQ 12) are its brevity, intelligibility, and its psychometric properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The reliability coefficients for the General Health Questionnaire ranged from 0.78 to 0.95.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The General Health Questionnaire used in the present study includes 12 items; each item has the following 4 answer choices: Not at all, no more than usual, more than usual, and much more than usual, given a possible range of scores ranging from 0 to 12. Mental distress was considered if the participant score four or higher.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size calculation using G*Power 3.1.0 indicated that 50 subjects are required per group in order to detect a difference of 0.3 in the mean of total fatigue score between the groups. The alpha error was set at 0.05 and Type II error was set at 0.20. The results were analyzed using SPSS version 14 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical analysis had been done using Chi-square or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) whatever appropriate. If ANOVA Test was significant, Tukey HSD Multiple Comparisons Test was used to compare different groups. For all tests of significance, a <italic>P</italic> value of 0.05 was used as the level of significance. Numerical data were expressed as a mean value and standard deviation (SD) while categorical data were expressed as number and percentages.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Demographic data are shown in [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>], Ophthalmologists were significantly older compared to the other groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001).

Most of the currently studied anesthesiologists were significantly younger than the ophthalmologists. This was supported by previous work of Nyssan and Hansez who proved that age correlated negatively with fatigue symptoms, in their study younger anesthesiologists showed higher rate of fatigue compared to their older colleagues.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] A previous work on general Norwegian population reported weak correlation between age and fatigue.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>No statistically significant gender differences were seen either in anesthesiologists or the other two studied groups. On the contrary Lindfors and colleagues proved that women had higher stress symptoms including exhaustion than men.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Another study found female anesthesiologists feeling higher task related stressors at their work.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] A previous study concerning Portuguese anesthesiologists had pointed out the conflicts between home and work responsibilities as a major source of stress.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Loge and colleague showed a strong positive correlation between women and fatigue in Norwegian population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] The difference could be attributed to the difference in the culture and to the instrument used.</p><p>Higher score of work related exhaustion scale in anesthesiologists could be attributed to the fact that they usually work for long and intense duty periods, suffer from loss of sleep, and develop mental, psychological and physical stress.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Some indirect evidence links fatigue with impaired medical decision making[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] and reduced patient safety.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Unlike other specialists, anesthesiologists continue to have on-call commitment until the age of retirement. Frequent on-call showed strong positive correlation with severe stress symptoms.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>General Health Questionnaire (GHQ12) was significantly higher in anesthesiologists when compared with the other studied groups. In the same line with our results, Coomber and colleagues showed that 20%-60% of doctors exhibiting clinically important levels of mental distress at any one time depending on their threshold for morbidity and the specialty in which they work.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The work of Nyssen and colleague found that 40% of the studied anesthesiologists were suffering from high emotional exhaustion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Many researches had outlined the negative physiological and psychological consequences of dysfunctional occupational stress.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] It affects cognitive performance, and makes one prone to mental disorders such as depression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>The results of our study are limited by the fact that working conditions and subjective perception of working conditions may change with national culture, hospital culture, and departmental culture among others. Furthermore, the multitude of additional stressors from family life was not assessed in details.</p><p>In conclusion, work-related exhaustion under the current study is more obvious among anesthesiologists. Ophthalmologist and ancillary hospital employees feel less stress at their work.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
