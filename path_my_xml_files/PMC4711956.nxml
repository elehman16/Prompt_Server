Acute stroke treatments with intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular therapy are proven to reduce disability, however a critical limitation on their effectiveness is the narrow time window for administration, which is 4.5 hours and 6 hours respectively from the onset of symptoms. Our overarching goal is to reduce pre-hospital delays to acute stroke treatments in economically disadvantaged minority communities where the greatest delays exist, using Hip Hop Stroke.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods</title><p id="P2">Hip Hop Stroke (HHS) is a school-based, child-mediated, culturally-tailored stroke communication multimedia intervention developed using validated models of behavior change and designed to improve stroke literacy (knowledge of stroke symptoms, the urgent need to call 911, and prevention measures) of 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> grade students and their parents residing in poor urban communities. Children in the intervention arm will receive the HHS intervention, while those in the attentional control arm will receive standardized nutrition education based on the USDA's MyPyramid program. Children will be trained and motivated to share stroke information with their parents or other adult caregiver. Both children and parents will complete a stroke knowledge assessment at baseline, immediately following the program, and at 3-months post-program. The primary outcome is the effect of the child mediation on parental stroke literacy.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P3">Stroke literate children, a captive audience in school systems, may represent a viable channel for spreading stroke information into households of poor urban communities where mass media stroke campaigns have shown the lowest penetration. These children may also call 911 when witnessing a stroke in their homes or communities. The HHS program may highlight the potential role of children in the chain of stroke recovery as a strategy for reducing prehospital delays to acute stroke treatment.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Health disparities</kwd><kwd>Randomized trial</kwd><kwd>Stroke health education</kwd><kwd>Child-mediated communication</kwd><kwd>Health communication</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S4"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death and the leading cause of serious long-term adult disability in the US, and it has a 2-fold greater incidence in Blacks when compared to the majority of Americans [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. An estimated 795,000 new and recurrent strokes occur in the US each year [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

The economic burden is immense, with the combined direct and indirect cost of stroke totaling more than $33 billion in 2011 [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Intravenous thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is a proven treatment for acute ischemic stroke patients up to 4.5 hours after symptom onset [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Following an ischemic stroke event, the administration of t-PA can improve the patient&#x02019;s odds of having minimal to zero disability at 3 months by 31%&#x02013;50% [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Approximately 7% of diagnosed ischemic stroke events currently receive t-PA therapy [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], due mostly to the public&#x02019;s lack of knowledge about the treatment and the inability to identify and respond appropriately to stroke symptoms when they occur [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. If the rate of all ischemic stroke patients receiving t-PA increased to only 10%, the realized annual cost savings to taxpayers would be more than $45 million [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p id="P6">A critical limitation to the effectiveness of treatment with t-PA is the narrow treatment window. For the majority of stroke patients, this window is 3&#x02013;4.5 hours from the onset of symptoms. However, recent studies support the extension of this window to 6 hours for patients who are eligible for endovascular therapies [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It is critical that a person experiencing or witnessing a stroke be able to identify the symptoms and know to immediately to call 911. It has been estimated that interventions designed to educate patients to seek treatment sooner when a stroke occurs may increase thrombolysis rates to 57%, if emergency medical system response times and in-hospital response times are optimized [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="P7">In 2002, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) targeted expediency of stroke recognition to increase t-PA use, with a goal of 70% of stroke patients arriving at the hospital within three hours by 2013 [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Unfortunately, this goal is not close to being met, with recent data suggesting that only 22% of patients typically arrive within 3 hours of last known well [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. New and effective interventions that improve the behavioral response to the acute stroke situation in a cost-effective manner are necessary to meet these goals, given the strong relationship between early hospital arrival and acute stroke treatment [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><sec id="S5"><title>Bridging a health literacy gap: Child-mediated health communication</title><p id="P8">Children can serve as community health educators: A growing body of literature supports the potential utility of children as conduits of health information for their elders and communities [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], yet young people are often overlooked as sources of important health information. One of the few attempts to engage children in health prevention was an asthma education program &#x0201c;Open Airways for Schools,&#x0201d; which positively influenced parental health behaviors [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Given the low rate of parental attendance at school sessions, investigators held six sessions for students aged 8 to 11 years with asthma at school, and gave the children homework assignments to complete with their parents at home to teach the parents and build support for children&#x02019;s self-management efforts. Another study which delivered hypertension education to school children showed that children improved parents&#x02019; knowledge about hypertension and increased the likelihood that the parents will consult their physician about their blood pressure [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p id="P9">Expanding on these strategies, NINDS suggested that stroke-educated children could improve their own stroke risk and possibly educate their parents and relatives about stroke [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It has been found that up to 45% of public stroke knowledge is derived from family and friends [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], suggesting that children may be an underutilized means of stroke education in their homes and communities. In response to this health education paradigm, we created the Hip Hop Stroke program.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Innovation</title><p id="P10">We aim to reduce the aforementioned pre-hospital delays using Hip Hop Stroke (HHS), [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] a novel behavioral intervention to improve symptom recognition and response in a high-risk, minority, economically disadvantaged population. Despite the abundance of available stroke education materials, studies continue to reveal severe deficiencies in stroke literacy (i.e., knowledge of symptoms, urgent action, and prevention measures) [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Expensive mass media stroke education campaigns are not sustainable for this purpose, particularly in economically disadvantaged populations, which they are often not tailored to penetrate. As such, this study intervenes in elementary schools with 4<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade children, ages 9 to 11. HHS delivers stroke education around key program centerpieces comprised of rap songs and two animated musical cartoons that incorporate stroke knowledge. This multimedia intervention teaches the five cardinal stroke symptoms and the correct course of action when they occur. It also highlights time-dependent acute stroke treatment with &#x0201c;clot busters&#x0201d; and the potential therapeutic benefit of early hospital arrival. The intent of the intervention is that the children will then educate their parents and community members with the stroke knowledge they have gained.</p><p id="P11">In preliminary research, we found that children aged 9&#x02013;11 years can rapidly learn and retain the information well for at least 15 months [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our recent pilot study showed that 74% of children in the pilot (N=182) communicated the material to a parent, and that this communication significantly improved the parent&#x02019;s stroke literacy [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Having demonstrated the efficacy of the HHS intervention in a smaller pilot sample, the current study will use a randomized controlled trial of this health intervention to evaluate the effect of the HHS intervention on: (1) children&#x02019;s ability to learn and retain the information, (2) the likelihood that children participating in HHS can and will engage their parents and teach them the warning signs and symptoms of stroke and the appropriate &#x0201c;911&#x0201d; response to these symptoms, and (3) parents&#x02019; ability to learn and retain the information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P12">HHS is based on two models that have been demonstrated as important predictors of behavior change. Theory of Reasoned Action suggests that a series of related cognitive constructs operate to produce an intention to act, which is clearly a precursor to the desired outcome, namely engaging in the act (i.e., making use of the stroke information as part of standard practice) [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The second is Self-Efficacy Theory, which posits that control over one&#x02019;s outcomes produces a sense of mastery for those behaviors (in our case recognizing stroke and calling 911, and communicating this information to parents); and that increased self-efficacy predicts increased motivation to engage in the desired behaviors, as well as a demonstrated increase in the behavior itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Study design overview</title><p id="P13">This protocol is for Hip Hop Stroke (HHS), a school-based intervention aimed at educating 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> grade students about stroke symptoms, urgent &#x0201c;911&#x0201d; response and prevention measures. We term this stroke literacy. The intervention will be delivered in a school auditorium or gym setting, using an innovative, modular, multi-media program that contains embedded cartoons and music teaching stroke recognition, appropriate action, availability of time dependent treatment, and prevention, all visually presented via Microsoft PowerPoint with a projector in conjunction with a pair of facilitators consistent throughout the study and whose performance is monitored internally through quality assurance measures. In addition, students will be given specific mediating tools for parental learning. These are home-based activities to complete with their parents to increase parental stroke literacy. There will be a total of four days of programming per school with one hour of instruction on each day: an initial 3-day program and a 1-day booster session three months later.

Administrative leadership in schools and school districts has welcomed this program and the setting has proved to be ideal for the delivery of the intervention in our pilot studies. School officials are motivated to provide the support for several reasons, including the requirement to implement health education curriculums with strong primary prevention in their schools, which has been incorporated into this program.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Recruitment and randomization</title><p id="P15">Randomization will occur at the school level, rather than by child or classroom, to ensure minimal cross-contamination between intervention and control groups.

To assess the primary outcome of parental knowledge, we will recruit at least 860 parents across 22 schools.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Informed consent and assent</title><p id="P20">Informed consent will be obtained from parents for the enrollment of their child and themselves into the study. If recruited in-person, the RA will give the parent a consent form, describing the study and the details of participation. The RA will tell the parents what their informed consent entails, including the purpose of the study, the risks and benefits of participation, the voluntary nature of their participation, and the fact that participation does not affect their child&#x02019;s grades in school. If recruited via the student session, the parent will complete the consent form and return it with their child.

Modules incorporate multimedia and are assembled into curriculums that address either stroke treatment (recognition and action) or stroke prevention (primordial). Modules include a variety of songs, cartoon videos, comic books and a video game. Each module has been tailored culturally and contextually, taking into account the issue of health illiteracy and low overall literacy.

Schools will be rated for overall experience of the program and data collection as well as the research team&#x02019;s perception of their own performance.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Data safety and monitoring board</title><p id="P35">To ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data, a data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) has been established. The DSMB includes five senior investigators with expertise in stroke, biostatistics and clinical trials. The DSMB will perform the following activities: (1) review the research protocol and plans for data and safety monitoring, (2) evaluate the progress of the interventional trial, including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, performance of trial sites, and other factors that can affect study outcome, (3) make recommendations to the investigators concerning continuation or conclusion of the trial, and (4) protect the confidentiality of the trial data and the results of monitoring.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Measures</title><sec id="S31"><title>Stroke symptoms and response knowledge</title><p id="P36">For both parents and children, we will assess pre- and post-test knowledge of stroke symptoms and recommended action (i.e., calling 911), including stroke localization (Where in the body does a stroke occur?), signs and symptoms of stroke, and appropriate response to a hypothetical stroke scenario. Knowledge of signs and symptoms will be derived from the widely used BRFSS stroke knowledge instrument [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and assessed using seven Yes/No questions, five real symptoms and two distracters, including blurred vision, facial droop, slurred speech or confusion, imbalance and severe headache, versus chest pains and coughing hard. Knowledge of stroke prevention measures will be assessed by six Yes/No questions, five real and one distracter, that ask subjects about the relationship between stroke risk and fruit and vegetable consumption, exercising every day, smoking avoidance or cessation, exercising once-a-week, medication adherence, and adding salt to meals.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Self-efficacy</title><p id="P37">Children&#x02019;s and parents&#x02019; self-efficacy to appropriately recognize and respond to stroke will be assessed at baseline, immediate post-test and the three-month follow-up. We will ask parents and children about their confidence related to being able to tell that someone is having a stroke, knowing what to do if someone is having a stroke, telling the 911 operator why they think that someone is having a stroke, and teaching parents or friends about stroke.</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Barriers to calling 911</title><p id="P38">We will also assess parents&#x02019; barriers to calling 911 at baseline. Parents will be presented with seven hypothetical scenarios. Each scenario begins, &#x0201c;If I think that I am having a stroke, I would not call 911 because&#x02026;&#x0201d; and then a different possibility is suggested. For example, he/she believes that an ambulance costs too much, personal religious beliefs prevent him/her from calling 911, or he/she knows someone who previously had a bad hospital experience.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Child-mediated communication</title><p id="P39">At immediate and delayed follow-up, we will assess whether the child has talked with one of the adults in the household about what he/she learned in school. Parents will be asked whether their children shared any information about the program as well as whether they brought home any activities from the program to complete with them at home.</p></sec><sec id="S35"><title>Demographics</title><p id="P40">At baseline, parents will be asked to report their age, gender, number of adult residents living in their household, race/ ethnicity, education level, occupation, stroke experience, health literacy, telephone number, email address and home address.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S36"><title>Sample size and power analysis</title><p id="P41">Primary analysis will focus on the change in adults&#x02019; knowledge of stroke symptoms and the recommended response. Based on our pilot data [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], we will use a conservative estimate of the intervention effect. We will assume a 4% baseline rate for knowledge of all five cardinal stroke symptoms plus chest pain as a distracter symptom, plus calling 911 in response to a hypothetical stroke-in-action scenario, and a 24% increase over this rate in the intervention arm.</p><p id="P42">Based on an observed 2% increase in knowledge of the five cardinal symptoms in one community as a result of non-targeted public education efforts over a six year period [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we hypothesize a less than 2% change in control parents' knowledge. Children in the control condition will have poor baseline knowledge of stroke symptoms and will not receive any formal stroke education, so the chances of them communicating meaningful stroke information to their parents will be negligible. Parents in the control condition will likely get stroke information only from existing public education efforts in the form of television or radio outreach, and overlapping local stroke outreach efforts unknown to us.</p><p id="P43">Based on our assumptions and using a significance level of 0.05, a sample size of 860 parents from 22 schools (11 intervention; 11 control) will provide 90% power to detect a difference between the intervention and control conditions in the parents&#x02019; ability to name all five cardinal symptoms of stroke, plus 1 distracter, and appropriately calling 911. Given that we will randomize schools, rather than individual participants, the sample size calculations include adjustment for the cluster randomization scheme using an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.10. Power for secondary hypotheses is addressed below.</p></sec><sec id="S37"><title>Data analysis plan</title><p id="P44">The approach to analysis of binary outcomes will be generalized estimating equations (GEE) with a logit link, a generalization of logistic regression that allows for clustering. In this case, as the randomization will be by school, the analysis procedures will account for the possibility of having multiple parents per child and repeated assessments per parent/child. For continuous outcomes, we will use mixed-effects models, a generalization of regression that accommodates clustering. Unless otherwise noted, all hypothesis testing will be two-sided.</p><sec id="S38"><title>Hypothesis 1</title><p id="P45">No differences in baseline knowledge will exist between the parents assigned to the intervention and control arms or between the children assigned to the intervention and control arms. A mixed-effects model will compare intervention and control arms with respect to parents&#x02019; and children&#x02019;s baseline knowledge, taking into account the clustering of children within school and parents within children. The comparison will be expressed as the mean baseline knowledge difference and corresponding confidence interval. This analysis will utilize all children and parents included in the study at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="S39"><title>Hypothesis 2</title><p id="P46">Children in the intervention arm will demonstrate greater knowledge concerning stroke symptom identification and response immediately after and at three months following the intervention compared to those in the control arm. GEE will compare children's knowledge of stroke symptom identification (coded as success/failure, answering all questions correctly) between the intervention and control arms 1-week following the intervention and at three months. Baseline knowledge will be included in the analysis as a covariate. The comparison will be expressed as an odds ratio with corresponding confidence interval. This analysis will utilize all children included in the study. Assuming that 27.3% of children in the intervention arm remember 100% the symptoms and zero percent in the control arm, there will be &#x0003e;99% power to detect a difference between the groups using a 5% type I error rate.</p></sec><sec id="S40"><title>Hypothesis 3</title><p id="P47">Compared to students in the control condition, children in the intervention arm will be more likely to communicate stroke information to their parents (assessed at 1-week follow-up). GEE will be used to compare the probability that stroke information is communicated to children's parents, as assessed at 1-week of followup, between the intervention and control arms. The comparison will be expressed as an odds ratio with corresponding confidence interval. This analysis will utilize all children-parent dyads included in the study. Assuming that 30% of children in the intervention arm will pass on the stroke information and zero percent in the control arm, there will be &#x0003e;90% power to detect a difference between the groups using a 5% type I error rate.</p></sec><sec id="S41"><title>Hypothesis 4</title><p id="P48">In homes in which such communication has been enacted, parents in schools assigned to the intervention arm will demonstrate greater ability to name the symptoms of stroke and appropriate action, compared to their baseline knowledge, at 1-week and at 3-months follow-up, compared to parents in the control arm. GEE will be used to compare the probability that parents remember the symptoms of stroke (coded as success/failure, answer all correctly) at 1-week and 3-months follow-up between the intervention and control arms. We will conduct a repeated measures analysis including the one-week and three-month follow-up time points in a single model and use contrasts to make the specific time point comparisons. The comparisons will be expressed as odds ratios with corresponding confidence intervals. This analysis will utilize approximately 30% of homes included in the study, the percentage in which we expect communication to be enacted. The power for the comparison at three months was discussed in the section on statistical power. Assuming the difference in increased knowledge is greater at the one-week follow-up time point than at three months, we will have at least 90% power to detect a difference between treatment groups at one-week of follow-up with a 5% type I error rate.</p></sec><sec id="S42"><title>Mediation analyses</title><p id="P49">We will also include analyses to establish if the effect of intervention on adult knowledge is mediated by improvement in children's knowledge. In general, these analyses involve three regression equations: (1) regression of adult knowledge on the intervention, (2) regression of children's knowledge on the intervention, and (3) regression of adult knowledge on both the intervention and children's knowledge. For our analyses, we will need extensions of the classic single mediator model due to the multilevel structure of our data and categorical outcomes. The necessary modern mediation methods including these extensions are reviewed by MacKinnon et al. [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S43"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P50">Since stroke patients activate 911 themselves only 2%&#x02013;7% of the time [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the emphasis of stroke education campaigns must include the general public. Stroke literate children, a captive audience in school systems, may add to the acute stroke witness/bystander pool that is mostly responsible for calling 911 in the event of a stroke and teach their parents and grandparents about stroke symptoms and their urgency, thereby improving overall household stroke literacy in high stroke risk communities.</p><p id="P51">Targeting children to intervene with their parents has been rarely and sporadically attempted in various content areas. These interventions have used traditional teaching methods that do not engage the children, and little success has been reported. In contrast, the HHS intervention was designed in collaboration with school-aged children, children&#x02019;s education media experts, as well as public health experts, school principals and neurologists. As a result, not only is the targeting of children for this purpose an important innovation, but so is the careful development of materials designed to appeal to them. Moreover, we note that utilizing children as a &#x0201c;transmission vector&#x0201d; for carrying out interventions aimed at their parents has the potential to serve as the basis for interventions in any number of other areas, including medication adherence, healthy eating and weight loss and treatment of diabetes. Thus, the significance of the proposed trial addresses the public health problem under study-stroke symptom identification and response-as well as development and refinement of a more general model of intervention, especially in instances in which targeting the parents themselves has proved ineffectual.</p><p id="P52">Behavioral health interventions have often proven efficacious in trial, yet, by one criterion, must be considered failures as they rarely survive the funding period. There are several reasons for this, including high costs, poor cost-effectiveness and a lack of ability on the part of most researchers to translate their results into a commercially viable, or otherwise sustainable, intervention. In contrast, our intervention requires low maintenance costs for delivery given its media-heavy curriculum that can be downloaded from an online platform. It targets a captive audience of school children, removing the need for special arrangements to be made in the community for the delivery of the intervention. In addition, the principals of these schools are required by both state and federal law to conduct health education programs that include core measures addressed by HHS. Finally, state and federally designated stroke centers are required to provide community stroke education within their catchment area at least bi-annually and often suffer from a dearth of proven stroke education tools that they can utilize to meet these goals.</p><p id="P53">The HHS programs shows promise to address the challenges of community stroke education among high risk economically disadvantaged groups in the United States and improve prehospital delays to acute stroke treatment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="conflict"><p id="P54"><bold>Conflict of Interest</bold></p><p id="P55">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn></fn-group><ack id="S44"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p id="P56">This study is supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (1 R01 NS067443-01A1).
