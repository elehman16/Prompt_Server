The current therapies are inadequate in managing atopic dermatitis and often have associated adverse effects or drug tolerance development. Chinese medicine is expected to have promising prospects in the management of atopic dermatitis and recent studies have shown encouraging results. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a newly formulated Chinese herbal formula, RMIT Chinese Medicine-106 (RCM-106), in the management of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in children aged 6&#x02013;18&#x02005;years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-armed clinical trial. Participant, investigator and assessors will remain blinded to the treatment assignment until after the study has been completed. After a 2-week run-in period, 90 participants will be randomised, using block randomised sequences generated by computer, to receive either RCM-106 or matching placebo capsules, twice daily, for a treatment period of 8&#x02005;weeks and followed up for 4&#x02005;weeks. Primary outcome measures include the evaluation of disease severity and extent using two validated scoring instruments&#x02014;Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) and Patient-Oriented Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (PO-SCORAD). Secondary outcome measures include the evaluation of quality of life using the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI); occurrence of adverse events and total usage of other therapies as recorded in the participants&#x02019; daily diary and laboratory studies which include eosinophil count, total IgE, full blood count and liver and kidney function tests. Intention-to-treat analysis will be applied to all data analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This trial has received human ethics approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of RMIT University (Project number 15/12).

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>SCORAD</p></list-item><list-item><p>PO-SCORAD</p></list-item></list></p><p>Secondary outcome measures include the evaluation of quality of life using the validated CDLQI; occurrence of adverse events and usage of other therapies as recorded in the daily diary and safety components which include full blood count, eosinophil count, total IgE and liver and kidney function tests.</p><p>Participants will be required to complete the SCORAD, PO-SCORAD and CDLQI at each visit, six times in total (during initial assessment, weeks 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9). The PO-SCORAD and CDLQI will also need to be completed and returned via post at the end of the follow-up period. Participants will also be required to complete their daily diaries from the start of the run-in period until the end of the treatment period. Blood tests for full blood count, eosinophil count, total IgE and liver and kidney function tests will be conducted at initial assessment and during the final clinic visit (week 9).</p><p>All adverse events will be followed up from the date it is brought to the investigator's attention until the adverse event has been resolved. In the occasion of a severe adverse event, the event will be recorded and immediately reported to the RMIT HREC, followed by a detailed written report. Participants will be identified by their ID codes to maintain confidentiality.</p><p>Participants may be withdrawn from the trial by the investigator if a serious adverse event occurs. Participants are also permitted to withdraw at will at any time of the trial. All withdrawn cases who have received the intervention will be contacted 4&#x02005;weeks following withdrawal, as the follow-up period, to obtain information with regard to their condition using PO-SCORAD and CDLQI.</p></sec><sec id="s3m"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The trial data will be processed and analysed by an independent statistician, who will be blinded to participant allocation, under the supervision of the School of Mathematical and Geospatial Sciences at RMIT University. Intention-to-treat analysis will be applied to include all randomised participants. Data will be summarised as means and SDs and analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, Windows V.19.0). The statistical procedure to be employed is repeated measures analysis of variance utilising the General Linear Model (GLM). Data from non-repeated measures will be analysed by t tests. Outcome measures with categorical responses will be analysed using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> and Fisher exact tests. All p values will be two-tailed and at &#x003b1;=0.05. To assist safety monitoring, interim analysis will be conducted.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study protocol was designed to suit the paediatric population. To facilitate blinding and ease of drug dosing and delivery, we have chosen to administer RCM-106 as small, size #1 capsules. To reduce the risk of choking hazards, the ability to swallow capsules has been included in our participant criteria. On advice from a paediatric allergist from the Royal Children's Hospital, as a precaution against false reports of the ability to swallow capsules by eager participants or their parents/legal guardian, this protocol includes a &#x02018;swallow-test&#x02019; during screening to ensure that the included participants are indeed able to swallow capsules without difficulty. The protocol also offers an optional &#x02018;capsule-swallowing training programme&#x02019; for potential participants who are unable to swallow capsules on screening. Anecdotal evidence suggests that children aged 6&#x02005;years or younger would be able to take solid dosage forms with adequate support and training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>; furthermore, studies on various methods of pill-swallowing training have been shown to be successful.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27 R28 R29">27&#x02013;29</xref></p><p>The previous systematic reviews on Chinese herbal medicine for AD concluded that the quality of trials were poor, and therefore did not allow for valid conclusions. The systematic reviews highlighted several methodological and reporting aspects to be improved and these have been incorporated in this clinical trial. These include, but are not limited to the use of validated diagnostic criteria and outcome measure instruments; the use of capsules to improve compliance; and dosage determination based on the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> Furthermore, the reporting of the trial will abide by the relevant CONSORT guidelines.</p><p>The primary outcome measures include SCORAD and PO-SCORAD which are validated instruments to assess disease severity and extent through a scoring system. A higher score represents a more severe condition. SCORAD is the assessment by a third-party assessor, whereas PO-SCORAD is the assessment by the patient.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> SCORAD and PO-SCORAD scores corelate well to each other.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> The SCORAD and PO-SCORAD will assist in the evaluation of the efficacy of RCM-106.</p><p>The secondary outcome measures include the evaluation of quality of life using CDLQI, occurrence of adverse events, total amount of other therapies used and laboratory tests. The CDLQI consists of 10 questions to determine the impact of dermatological conditions on the quality of life of affected children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> Each question can be given a score of 0&#x02013;3, with a total score of 30. A higher score represents a lower quality of life or a higher impact on quality of life. Although the CDLQI was intended for children up to the age of 16&#x02005;years,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> it has shown to be applicable to children up to the age of 21&#x02005;years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref> For this trial, the CDLQI will be used for children up to 18&#x02005;years. Participants aged 6&#x02013;11&#x02005;years will be given the English cartoon version of the instrument, while the participants aged 12&#x02013;18&#x02005;years will be given the English text version. The CDLQI is used to evaluate whether RCM-106 is able to improve the quality of life of patients with AD.</p><p>The daily diary will include records of trial intervention intake, other treatments used and occurrence of adverse events. The record of trial intervention compliance will assist with the evaluation of the acceptability of the intervention and reflect the efficacy of the intervention; the record of other treatments used will provide an insight on whether RCM-106 is able to reduce the requirement for other remedies, and thus suggests its efficacy; the record of adverse events will assist with the assessment of tolerability of RCM-106.</p><p>The laboratory tests that would be assessed include full blood count, eosinophil count, total IgE and liver and kidney function tests. Increased eosinophil count is more highly observed in patients with AD than in healthy individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref> Total IgE is measured as AD is defined as the IgE-related form of dermatitis by the World Allergy Organisation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>; and elevated serum IgE is seen in up to 85% of AD cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref> The full blood count, liver function test and kidney function test are to assist with safety monitoring and assessment of tolerability of RCM-106.</p><p>The results of this RCT will provide clinical data on the efficacy and safety of RCM-106 in reducing the severity of AD and improving the quality of life of patients with AD. Positive results from the RCT can lead to a better management of AD to help patients. This RCT will also contribute to the understanding and treatment of AD from Chinese medicine perspectives.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e195" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003906.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e196" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003906.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to express their gratitude to the dermatology expert panel set up by the Guangdong Provincial Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences as well as Professor Jerry Zhang (RMIT University), who have provided valuable advice with regard to the formulation of RMIT Chinese Medicine-106 (RCM-106).
