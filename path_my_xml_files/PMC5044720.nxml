In this study, 60 patients, aged between 2 and 10 years, belonging to the American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) Grade I and II, undergoing lower abdominal surgery, were enrolled.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included parental refusal; history of developmental delay or mental retardation, which could make observational pain intensity assessment difficult; children with known allergy to local anesthetics; infection at the local site; children with coexisting medical illness, preexisting neurological disease, coagulation disorders, and anatomical abnormalities of spine and sacrum.</p><p>During preoperative visit, patient's age, weight, and baseline vital parameters were recorded. Detailed history, general physical and systemic examinations were done. Routine laboratory investigations such as hemoglobin, bleeding time, and clotting time were carried out for all patients. All patients were kept fasting as per institutional protocol (2 h for clear liquid and 6 h for semisolid and solid) and midazolam syrup 0.5 mg/kg body weight was given 30-45 min before surgery.</p><p>Randomization was done using a computer-generated list and all children were evenly assigned into two groups R (ropivacaine) and RD (ropivacaine plus dexmedetomidine). A person not participating in the study kept the computer-generated table of random numbers and prepared all medications. According to the weight and randomizing table, the volume to be injected in the caudal block was prepared in syringes with labels indicating only the serial number of the patient.</p><p>On arrival of patient in the operating room, ASA standard monitor was attached and baseline parameters including heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and respiratory rate (RR) were recorded. Induction of anesthesia was achieved with 8% sevoflurane in oxygen with spontaneous ventilation, IV line was secured with appropriate size cannula (22-gauge, 24-gauge) and ringer lactate was infused at a rate of 4 ml/kg/h and an appropriate-sized laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was inserted. After the LMA insertion, sevoflurane concentration was reduced to 3% with fresh gas flow of 3-4 l/min, patients were placed in left lateral decubitus position and under all aseptic precautions single-dose caudal block was performed using a 23-gauge short-beveled hypodermic needle according to the group assigned.</p><p>

</p><p>The time at which caudal block was performed was noted and patients were turned to supine position. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane in oxygen/air (50:50) mixture. The inhaled concentration of sevoflurane was adjusted to maintain hemodynamic changes &#x0003c;20% of baseline value. No other narcotics, analgesics, sedatives, or anti-emetics were administered intraoperatively. At the beginning of skin closure, sevoflurane was discontinued. After completion of surgery, during emergence from anesthesia, LMA was removed and the patient was transported to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit.</p><p>The onset of block was assessed by applying mechanical stimulus at surgical site after 5, 10, 15, and 20 min of the caudal block. The onset of the block is defined as the time in minutes between local anesthetic injection and the absence of motor response or absence of &#x0003e;20% increase in HR on application of mechanical stimulus. Skin incision was allowed after the onset of the block. Failure of caudal block was defined as any increase in HR more than 20% of the preincision values and presence of motor response at 20 min. Patients with failed caudal block were excluded from the study.</p><p>Vitals (HR, BP, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and RR) were recorded before induction, just before and after skin incision and every 5 min for &#x000bd; h, and every 15 min for 1 h. The anesthesia time (the time from induction of anesthesia to the end of surgery when the sevoflurane was discontinued), emergence time (the time from discontinuation of sevoflurane to opening the eyes on calling the patient's name), and a delayed anesthetic emergence (defined as &#x0003e;20 min elapsing from the end of surgery to exiting the operating theater) were also noted. Postoperative recording of vital parameters, assessment of postoperative pain using the pediatric observational face, legs, activity, cry, consolability (FLACC) pain scale[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] with its 0-10 score range and postoperative sedation using Ramsay Sedation Scale[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] were done every hour till 6 h, every 3 h till 12 h, and every 6 h till 24 h. The duration of adequate caudal analgesia (from the time of onset of the block to time at which FLACC score was 4 or more) was recorded, and syrup paracetamol 10 mg/kg was administered at FLACC pain score &#x02265;4, also total doses of rescue analgesic administered in observation period were recorded. Duration of motor block (from the time of onset of the block to time at which patient began to move his leg) was also recorded.</p><p>Adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension, and urinary retention were looked for, recorded, and treated accordingly. Postoperative respiratory depression was defined as a decrease in SpO<sub>2</sub> of &#x0003c;95% requiring supplementary oxygen. Fall in BP and HR by &#x0003e;20% from the preoperative value was defined as hypotension or bradycardia, respectively, and was treated by fluid bolus, ephedrine, or atropine, as necessary. Nausea and vomiting was treated with IV ondansetron.</p><p>The sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 30) was calculated to detect a 65% reduction in the analgesic requirement during the first 24 h from 75% in the ropivacaine group with &#x003b1; = 0.05 and &#x003b2; = 0.20.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The data obtained was tabulated and analyzed using the computer software (SPSS for Windows, Version 16.0.

Historically, children have been under treated for pain because of the wrong notion that they neither feel pain nor remembered the painful experiences to the same degree as an adult do. The concept of postoperative pain relief and its utilization in the pediatric age group has improved dramatically over the recent years.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Adequate postoperative analgesia provides pain relief and allows the patients to breathe and move freely to enhance early restoration of function. Till date, various methods have evolved for providing postoperative analgesia in children.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Among the methods, caudal epidural block is the safest and most reliable technique.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Several studies have been reported about the caudal usage of opioids, ketamine, midazolam, neostigmine, &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-agonists, and other drugs in children to improve postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Although the use of caudal opioids did prolong the duration of analgesia, it was also associated with side effects such as respiratory depression, pruritus, urinary retention, and nausea and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Hence, other drugs such as &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-agonists have been used to improve analgesia in the postoperative period while avoiding the side effects associated with usage of opioids.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist and when added to local anesthetic agents enhances their effects without increasing the incidence of side effects.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Its mechanism of action differs from clonidine as it possesses selectivity, especially for the A subtype of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> receptor, which causes it to be a much more effective sedative and analgesic agent than clonidine without undesirable cardiovascular effects from &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> receptor activation even with higher doses.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In addition, dexmedetomidine is a shorter-acting drug than clonidine and it is unique that its sedative effect can be reversed by atipamezole. Dexmedetomidine, although currently approved for IV use only, has been successfully used in neuraxial blocks in experimental and clinical studies without neurological deficits encouraging its use by the epidural route.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Nevertheless, there are still some concerns regarding its safety.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Compared to bupivacaine, ropivacaine is safer, has less motor blockade, less cardiovascular or neurological toxicity and similar duration of analgesia. It can be used safely for regional anesthesia and analgesia in pediatric ambulatory surgery.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, we administered dexmedetomidine 2 &#x003bc;g/kg along with ropivacaine 0.25% (1 ml/kg) caudally and observed that the duration of postoperative analgesia (FLACC &#x0003c;4) without the need rescue analgesic was significantly longer in group receiving ropivacaine-dexmedetomidine mixture (median [95% CI] 750 (771.08-926.92) min) than the group receiving ropivacaine alone (median [95% CI] 390 (414.95-483.05) min).
