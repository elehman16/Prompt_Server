They provide a better view of the larynx and may facilitate tracheal intubation, but there is no adequately powered study comparing different types of video-laryngoscopes in a difficult airway scenario or in a simulated difficult airway situation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The objective of this trial is to evaluate and to compare the clinical performance of three video-laryngoscopes with a guiding channel for intubation (Airtraq&#x02122;, A. P. Advance&#x02122;, King Vision&#x02122;) and three video-laryngoscopes without an integrated tracheal tube guidance (C-MAC&#x02122;, GlideScope&#x02122;, McGrath&#x02122;) in a simulated difficult airway situation in surgical patients. The working hypothesis is that each video-laryngoscope provides at least a 90% first intubation success rate (lower limit of the 95% confidence interval &#x0003e;0.9). It is a prospective, patient-blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled trial in 720 patients who are scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia, requiring tracheal intubation at one of the three participating hospitals. A difficult airway will be created using an extrication collar and taping the patients&#x02019; head on the operating table to substantially reduce mouth opening and to minimize neck movement. Tracheal intubation will be performed with the help of one of the six devices according to randomization. Insertion success, time necessary for intubation, Cormack-Lehane grade and percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score at laryngoscopy, optimization maneuvers required to aid tracheal intubation, adverse events and technical problems will be recorded. Primary outcome is intubation success at first attempt.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We will simulate the difficult airway and evaluate different video-laryngoscopes in this highly realistic and clinically challenging scenario, independently from manufacturers of the devices. Because of the sufficiently powered multicenter design this study will deliver important and cutting-edge results that will help clinicians decide which device to use for intubation of the expected and unexpected difficult airway.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT01692535">NCT01692535</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Video-laryngoscope</kwd><kwd>Difficult airway</kwd><kwd>Airtraq</kwd><kwd>A.

Difficulty in tracheal intubation is the most common factor related to serious airway complications during general anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recently, the combination of the fiberoptic bronchoscope and the laryngoscope led to the development of video-laryngoscopes, providing a video-based view of the glottic opening, with or without additional guidance of the tube towards the tracheal opening. Six devices are under prominent focus in recent publications.</p><p>1) The Airtraq (Prodol Meditec SA, Vizcaya, Spain) was the first video intubation device that featured a channel guiding the tube towards the tracheal opening. The blade of the Airtraq is disposable. One study published in 2007 in <italic>Anesthesiology</italic> showed a 100% success rate at first attempt when using manual inline stabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>2) The A. P. Advance Video-laryngoscope (Venner Medical SA, Singapore) is based on a standard Macintosh laryngoscope that can be used as a stand-alone direct laryngoscope, or as a video-laryngoscope with a monitor attached to the handle and includes a &#x0201c;difficult airway&#x0201d; blade. A manikin study showed short intubation times for certified paramedics with the A.P. Advance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], but large adequately powered, randomized controlled trials in difficult airway scenarios are lacking.</p><p>3) The C-MAC (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) features size 2, 3 or 4 Macintosh blades or a &#x0201c;D&#x0201d;-blade (Difficult Airway Blade). The D-blade failed at first attempt in 30% of patients who showed a Cormack-Lehane grade 3 or 4 in a study by the inventor of the design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. One study shows a 93% success rate with the C-MAC using size 3 and 4 blades, compared to 84% for direct laryngoscopy when using manual inline stabilization, but intubation took longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>4) The GlideScope (Verathon Inc., Bothell, WA, USA) is a widely used non-guided video-laryngoscope consisting of a curved video blade (single-use or reusable) and a special stylet to be used with the tracheal tube. An observational study in 50 patients showed a 100% success rate of the GlideScope in a difficult airway model using stiff extrication collars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It also reduced intubation times compared with the conventional Macintosh laryngoscope in patients under manual inline stabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>5) The King Vision (Kingsystems, Noblesville, IN, USA) features either a channeled or a regular, disposable blade size 3. To date, there are no randomized controlled trials available for this device.</p><p>6) The McGrath MAC (Aircraft Medical Lt., Edinburgh, UK) is a non-guided video-laryngoscope that features disposable blades. It has been developed from the McGrath Series 5. In a randomized controlled trial with patients with a Mallampati grade of &#x02265;3, the McGrath Series 5 provided a better laryngeal view compared to the C-MAC, but intubation took longer and more intubation attempts where needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. To date, there are no randomized controlled trials available for the McGrath MAC video-laryngoscope.</p><p>These optical intubation devices or video-laryngoscopes (VLS) have dramatically improved the quality of glottic visualization. Multiple studies have proven enhanced visibility but not necessarily faster intubation times. Interestingly, in a study on manikins simulating difficult airway with stiff collars, VLS was not superior to direct laryngoscopy, but the sample size was low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, while VLS improve visualization of the airway, it is important to realize that a good view of the laryngeal opening does not automatically lead to intubation success. For example, in a recent study, the C-MAC VLS showed a good view of the larynx in 95% of cases, but the actual success rate of the intubation was only 88% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These different success rates cannot directly be compared since these studies were performed in different patient populations by different operators, in different settings regarding difficult airways, and with different outcome parameters. Most importantly, the majority of patients enrolled presented with a normal airway, or only manual inline stabilization was used to simulate a difficult airway. No study compared all these devices in the same setting, and no sufficiently powered study used extrication collars to adequately simulate a clinically important difficult airway situation.</p><sec><title>Specific aims of the study are</title><p>1) To investigate which VLS devices reach a clinically acceptable minimal first attempt success rate of 90% in a simulated difficult airway scenario (primary outcome). We assume this lower limit of &#x0201c;90% first attempt success rate&#x0201d; is the lowest tolerable success rate in a difficult airway scenario.</p><p>2) To compare primary and overall success rates, view on the tracheal opening and time until intubation with the help of the guided vs. unguided VLS devices.</p><p>3) To evaluate possible adverse events, complications and side effects.</p><p>According to these specific aims, we propose the following hypotheses:</p><p>1) For our primary outcome, we assume that the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the first attempt success rate is not lower than 90%. The null hypothesis states that the 95% CI of first attempt success rate is below 0.9.</p><p>2) Successful tracheal intubation takes more time using unguided VLS compared with the other VLS devices that guide the tube towards the tracheal opening. The secondary null hypothesis states that there is no statistically significant difference in time until intubation success between a guided and an unguided VLS (two-sided). Other secondary outcome-hypotheses include that the overall attempt success rates are higher in guided VLS compared with unguided VLS.</p><p>3) Minor airway injury rates are within a maximum of 10% comparing guided vs. unguided VLS. The null hypothesis states that the differences of minor airway injury rates are higher than 10%.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The SWIVIT trial is a prospective, patient-blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled trial at the anesthesia departments of the University Hospital of Bern, the University Hospital of Lausanne and the University Hospital of Geneva, all in Switzerland.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient population</title><p>With ethics committee approval (KEK Bern ref. nr. 106/12 on 11 September 2012; Chairperson: Prof. Dr. N. Tueller) and written informed consent, we will include adult patients of both genders, ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status I to III, and scheduled at one of the participating hospitals for elective surgery under general anesthesia requiring tracheal intubation.</p><p>Patients are not eligible if they are at risk for aspiration (non-fasted, severe gastro-esophageal reflux disease, hiatal hernia), with known or presumed difficult airways (body mass index &#x0003e;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, Mallampati &#x0003e;III, thyromental distance &#x0003c;6 cm, interincisor distance &#x0003c;3.5 cm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], known difficult mask ventilation or difficult laryngoscopy, or scheduled for awake tracheal intubation), or if they refuse to participate or are unable to give informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Most previous studies have based sample size calculations on differences of the intubation difficulty score (IDS), developed by Adnet in 1997 for direct laryngoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, a retrospective study by McElwain has raised concerns about the validity of the IDS with VLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The most important outcome parameter for VLS or any guided intubation devices is the success rate. Most available data are from patients with normal airway anatomy and, therefore, not comparable with our setting. Only one study immobilized the patients&#x02019; necks with collars to investigate the C-MAC in 43 patients. That study found an overall success rate of 88% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This is an unacceptable low success rate for the management of a difficult airway, but the study was underpowered: we calculated the 95% CI in that study to be 0.75 to 0.95 for overall success rate.</p><p>In order to rate an intubation device as &#x0201c;successful&#x0201d;, we define that the lower limit of the 95% CI should not be smaller than 0.9. We based our sample size on these values, congruent with our findings in a small pilot sample. We calculated the necessary sample size to obtain a distance of 0.05 to the expected success rate of 0.95, provided a probability of 0.95 and a power of 80% (SAS v.9.1, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). A total of 107 patients per device are necessary for this lower limit of 0.9. A total of 642 (6 &#x000d7; 107) patients will be necessary based on these assumptions, which leads us to include 720 patients to compensate for dropouts or missing data.</p><p>Secondary endpoints include parametric data, such as time necessary until success. Time until success has varied widely among different devices in published studies. Furthermore, that parameter seems to be influenced by the anesthesia provider. Therefore, we based our sample size calculation on first attempt success rate.</p><p>Because available data about our primary outcome, the first attempt success rate in a simulated difficult airway scenario, are scarce, we will recalculate sample size after the first 120 patients, based upon the values obtained from the first 20 patients for each device. In order to reduce bias, all participating investigators will remain unaware of results obtained from these 120 patients.</p><p>We will compare time to intubate in unguided vs. guided VLS as the secondary outcome. There are not sufficient data available to calculate sample size for this secondary outcome parameter. Therefore, we base our sample size calculation on effect size: based on an estimated medium effect size (Cohen&#x02019;s d of 0.5; assuming normal distribution), 64 samples per group are necessary, given a 0.05 level (<italic>P</italic> = 0.05) and 80% power. Because our primary outcome requires 107 patients per group, we are well within the necessary sample size even for this secondary outcome parameter.</p><p>Experience with the device is expected to be a major confounding factor. Only a limited number of experienced anesthesiologists at each study center will perform the intubation. To avoid a learning curve bias and to minimize variation in the performance, only anesthesiologists who have intubated patients without any airway pathology several times with each device until they feel competent with the devices will participate. We did not set <italic>a priori</italic> a fixed figure of intubations for each device because the individual experience with different devices is very divergent between the study centers and the participating anesthesiologists. Ideally, experience with the device should be equal, and prior experience will be recorded. We limit participants per center to a maximum of four physicians.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For the primary outcome, it will be analyzed for each laryngoscope whether the 95% confidence interval of its primary success is below 0.9. For the secondary outcome parameters, the data distribution will determine which statistical test will be used. For frequencies (for example, number of required manipulations, overall attempt success, complications) chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test will be used. Parametric data will be analyzed using ANOVA; for non-parametric continuous data Kruskal-Wallis test will be used. For comparison between two devices, we will use Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test and Mann-Whitney&#x02019;s <italic>u</italic>-test, as appropriate. We will do <italic>a priori</italic> comparisons of the time necessary until success between the unguided VLS and any of the guided VLS.</p><p>Data will be presented as mean with standard deviation, median and interquartile range, or number and percent. Effect sizes (with 95% CI) will be reported as Cohen&#x02019;s d for interval data and as odds ratio for proportions. A probability of 0.05 is considered as statistically significant.</p><p>The patient flow diagram according CONSORT guidelines is provided in Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-14-94-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Detailed study plan</title><sec><title>Consent procedure</title><p>Patients will be recruited from the operating room schedule of the corresponding hospitals.

The allocation sequence will be generated using online randomization software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://randomization.com">http://randomization.com</ext-link>) in blocks of 30 intubations for the devices and stratified for each participating center and for each physician. The allocation will be concealed in sealed, opaque, sequentially numbered envelopes and will not be opened until the patient is anesthetized.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical study procedure</title><p>Premedication will be according to the standard operating procedures of the participating centers. Standard non-invasive monitoring includes ECG, non-invasive arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> and volatile anesthetic level if applicable. A bispectral index (BIS, Aspect Medical Systems, Norwood, MA, USA) or a different processed EEG monitoring will be used whenever available. Anesthesia will be induced with propofol 1.5 to 3 mg/kg body weight and fentanyl 1 to 2 mcg/kg body weight. After facemask ventilation is established, neuromuscular blocking agents (rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg body weight) will be given and appropriate action monitored by neuro-stimulation. The inter-incisor distance at maximum mouth opening will be measured while the patient is asleep. Then, the extrication collar (Stifneck&#x02122;, Laerdal, Copenhagen, Denmark) will be properly adjusted, and a self-adhesive tape will be used to fix the head on the operating table, as done in an earlier study by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The inter-incisor distance will be measured at maximal mouth opening aiming at a mouth opening between 20 to 25 mm.</p><p>If mask ventilation remains adequate and a sufficient level of anesthesia is confirmed (BIS &#x0003c;55, stable hemodynamic parameters, unresponsiveness to jaw thrust), the tracheal intubation will be performed with the help of one of the six VLS, according to randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection of tracheal tube size (Mallinckrodt Hi-Contour Oral/Nasal Tracheal Tube Cuffed, Covidien, Hazelwood, MO, USA)</title><p>Women: 6.5 mm ID (internal diameter)</p><p>Men: 7.5 mm ID</p></sec><sec><title>Selection of blade size</title><p>1) Airtraq: Size #2 in women (6.5 mm tracheal tube does not fit in size #3 device), size #3 in men</p><p>2) A.

Timing of this assessment will be standardized to one hour after post-anesthesia care unit admission. If patients are extubated in the intensive care unit (ICU), the ICU nurse will make the assessments. On postoperative day one, a member of the study personnel will make a further assessment, using the same checklist. In case of ambulatory surgery, assessment will be done by telephone.

Airway management was deemed to be good in only 19% of these cases. This is an unacceptable high failure rate for our patients&#x02019; safety. Therefore, new and supposedly better devices to manage the difficult airway are necessary and continue to enter the market, often without thorough evaluation of their efficacy. In case of use of such devices in a difficult airway situation, it is vital to know which device will perform best. While VLS are marketed to facilitate the tracheal intubation in difficult airway management, there are no adequately powered data available comparing VLS in real difficult airway situations or, at least, adequately simulated difficult airway models. We intend to deliver this evidence. This will be for the benefit and safety of patients presenting with an expected or unexpected difficult airway needing general anesthesia for surgery or interventions.</p><sec><title>Potential problems and limitations</title><p>Because sample size has been calculated based on relatively vague figures, some adjustments in the total, necessary sample size may have to be incorporated when we re-calculate our sample size after the first 120 patients as per protocol. However, the statistical calculation is sound, and our assumptions are based on highly probable clinical expectations. Furthermore, the results of our study will be of clinical relevance regardless of whether our primary hypothesis will be confirmed or not and the much-feared &#x0201c;negative results&#x0201d; should be of no concerns in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Generalizability</title><p>In this clinical trial, we will use a statistical model that may be incorporated in future trials as well. Most clinical airway studies seek to prove a difference between devices, or postulate agreement within pre-defined values, some are designed as so called &#x0201c;non-inferiority&#x0201d; trails. In this study, we pre-define an important clinical value as a benchmark on which all devices studied are compared with the 90% minimal first attempt success rate. We believe an airway device should strive for this success rate, although that would still mean a failure in 1 out of 10. However, standard procedures in the difficult airway model used for this study have been shown to perform even less well: direct laryngoscopy succeeds only in 39.5% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and rigid fiberoptics fail in 9 to 14% (own data, not published yet). Flexible fiberoptic intubation would be the method of choice, however, it is highly operator dependent and time consuming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and showed recently a not that impressive first attempt success rate of only 79% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>At the time of submission, the study was actively enrolling patients. Fewer than 10 patients had been enrolled in total in all three centers.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ASA: American Society of Anesthesiologists; BIS: Bispectral index; BURP: Backward, upward, rightward pressure; CI: Confidence interval; CL: Cormack-Lehane; ECG: Electrocardiography or electrocardiogram; EEG: Electroencephalography or electroencephalogram; ID: Internal diameter; IDS: Intubation Difficulty Scale; POGO Score: Percentage of glottic opening score; SpO2: Oxygen saturation; SWIVIT: Swiss video-intubation trial; VLS: Video-laryngoscopes</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>We received the Airtraq&#x02122; from Prodol Meditec SA represented by MK-MED AG in Switzerland, the A.
