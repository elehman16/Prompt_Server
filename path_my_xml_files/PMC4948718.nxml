This finding by H&#x000f6;gest&#x000e4;tt et al and Ottani et al subsequently expanded the knowledge of the mechanism of action of paracetamol by indicating that it stimulates the ECS by increasing the levels of anandamide through reuptake inhibition by AM404.<xref rid="b1-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Anandamide is a potent ocular hypotensive, and the question arises as to whether paracetamol would, as other cannabinomimetics do, also reduce IOP.<xref rid="b12-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Topical timolol and oral acetazolamide are regarded as the gold standard topical and oral hypotensive agents, respectively, and are both well studied.

The paracetamol group received a single dose of 1 g IV paracetamol (Perfalgan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York City, NY, USA). The acetazolamide group received a single oral dose of 250 mg acetazolamide (Diamox<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Litha Pharma, Midrand, South Africa). The timolol group received a single drop of 0.5% timolol maleate (Glaucosan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Sandoz International GmbH, Holzkirchen, Germany) followed by 2 minutes of punctal occlusion.

The observer was masked to participant&#x02019;s treatment regimens, and IOP measurements were recorded. This was done by appropriately adjusting the tonometer dial to the estimated value and allowing a second observer to record IOP values and then scrambling the tonometer dial thereafter. For an IOP reading to be accepted as valid, two subsequent readings had to be &#x0003c;2 mmHg apart. The average of these two valid measurements was calculated and used as the final value.</p><p>IOP was again measured at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after treatment.</p><p>Primary outcomes included percentage change in IOP from baseline at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after treatment for each of the four groups.

Pearson&#x02019;s chi-square tests were used to compare proportions between the four groups. Multilevel mixed linear regression models were used to assess the determinants of change in IOP over time while adjusting for age, BMI, and sex.

Similarly, the IOP reduction we observed with topical timolol compared well with previous studies by Katz et al and Zimmerman and Kaufman where they showed a reduction in IOP by -16.8% at 1 hour, -26.3% at 2 hours, and -27.8% at 5 hours, and by -34.4% at 2 hours, -44.3.3% at 4 hours, and -27.8% at 5 hours, respectively.<xref rid="b15-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>IOP in the paracetamol group showed a downward trend up to 6 hours after treatment, and the reduction in IOP at that point in the paracetamol group was similar to the other two active treatment arms (paracetamol/acetazolamide, <italic>P</italic>=1.000; and paracetamol/timolol, <italic>P</italic>=1.000).</p><p>In general, the IOP-lowering response of a single standard dose of IV paracetamol was inferior to that of both topical timolol and oral acetazolamide.</p><p>The need for a follow-up study with repeated doses of IV paracetamol and observations beyond 6 hours is evident. Such multiple doses have been proven safe as the safety profile of IV paracetamol compares well with the oral and rectal formulations, and doses of up to 4 g daily are rarely associated with hepatotoxicity.<xref rid="b4-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Sevoflurane and propofol, among other anesthetic drugs, are known to reduce IOP and should be avoided when performing tonometry in patients under general anesthesia.<xref rid="b6-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Similar to sevoflurane and propofol, our results show that IV paracetamol shows a trend toward reducing IOP. Clinicians performing tonometry on patients under general anesthesia should consider enquiring from the anesthetist as to whether IV paracetamol was recently given to the patients before interpreting IOP measurements as patients increasingly receive paracetamol in the perianesthetic period.<xref rid="b4-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Although not a direct finding or conclusion of the study, our results could be explained by the molecular basis of the mechanism of action of paracetamol as proposed by H&#x000f6;gest&#x000e4;tt et al and Ottani et al.<xref rid="b1-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Although probably not widely known, the molecular basis of the ocular hypotensive properties of paracetamol through the ECS is well documented, and the ocular hypotensive properties of its major ligand, anandamide, and the CB1 receptor&#x02019;s abundant distribution in the eye are thoroughly reported.<xref rid="b9-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>If paracetamol indeed interacts with the ECS, as our findings might support, it may influence our understanding of concurrent paracetamol and antiglaucoma medication use as cannabinomimetics, and some commonly used antiglaucoma therapies employ similar molecular mechanics to reduce IOP, which may influence their efficacy.<xref rid="b17-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Further studies to address the theoretical pharmacodynamic interaction of paracetamol with topical &#x003b2;-blockers and prostamides may also be warranted, as many patients on glaucoma therapy, like their non-glaucomatous counterparts, use prescribed or self-medicating paracetamol.</p><p>A high correlation between levels of paracetamol in the serum and levels in the tear film has been shown; this effectively means that the use of systemic paracetamol leads to an unintended ocular topical application thereof which raises interesting questions regarding the ocular hypotensive effects of topically applied paracetamol as it has been shown to readily cross the cornea into the anterior chamber.<xref rid="b3-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b19-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Finally, apart from its role in the regulation of IOP, the ECS has also been implicated in many other ocular conditions and physiological processes.<xref rid="b20-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b27-opth-10-1283" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Whether paracetamol, through its apparent association with the ECS, has an effect on these is yet to be investigated.</p><p>Although our study did not aim to clinically vindicate the molecular mechanism of action of paracetamol, our findings may provide clinical support for the proposal that paracetamol is indeed a cannabinomimetic.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The findings are a result of a single standard dose of IV paracetamol which limits its application to predicting whether, and by how much, chronic paracetamol use or successive doses of IV paracetamol would change IOP. The introduction of IV paracetamol to clinical practice expands its clinical relevance to more than just that of its chronic oral administration. For the purposes of replicating the administration of IV paracetamol in the perioperative period, a single standard dose was accepted as realistic to this increasingly common scenario.</p><p>The exclusion of pediatric patients from the cohort limits the application of the results to an adult population. Whether IV paracetamol, used in pediatric pain management, changes IOP in this special population is still to be investigated.</p><p>Not investigating the possible interactions of paracetamol with common topical glaucoma agents is not seen as a limitation of the study but rather an important clinical question that needs to be addressed by future studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Intravenously administered paracetamol shows IOP-lowering properties over the first 6 hours after administration. Clinicians performing IOP measurements in patients who have received IV paracetamol in the preceding 6 hours should interpret these measurements with caution. Further studies are needed to investigate the IOP-changing properties of paracetamol.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>David Meyer is the inventor of a published PCT patent, the application (number W O2009/019555) of which is filed in the name of the Stellenbosch University, South Africa.
