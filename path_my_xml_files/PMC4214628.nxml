A gradual process of VL urbanization started in the early 1980s in Brazil, initially causing epidemics in the cities of Teresina, Natal and S&#x000e3;o Luis, all located in the Northeast of the country, and later spreading to other major urban centers <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Werneck2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Between 2008 and 2010, 11,581 autochthonous VL cases were reported in 1,392 Brazilian municipalities, with 70% of cases occurring in only 165 municipalities, which had a total population of 40 million persons and included 12 state capitals and 52 cities with &#x0003e;100,000 inhabitants.</p><p>Currently, the VL control program of the Brazilian Ministry of Health recommends two strategies for reducing the risk of transmission: (i) vector population control by means of residual insecticide spraying and environmental management, and (ii) culling of seropositive dogs in areas with moderate to high levels of transmission <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Brasil1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, both strategies have proven unsuccessful in interrupting transmission <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Quinnell1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Barreto1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Costa1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Indeed, a systematic review of studies conducted in Latin America concluded that there is a lack of scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of such interventions <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Romero1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Ten community intervention trials evaluated the effectiveness of dog-culling and residual insecticide spraying strategies, alone or in combination, and findings were contradictory. The authors of the review identified frequent methodological problems, such as small number of clusters for comparison, lack of comparability between groups in terms of exposure to infection, use of inaccurate diagnostic methods for detecting infection in human and dogs, small sample sizes, and high rates of loss to follow-up <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Romero1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Because there are few alternatives for controlling zoonotic VL we attempted to address the methodological problems of previous community intervention studies and designed a cluster randomized trial to assess the effectiveness of dog culling and residual insecticide spraying in the reduction of incidence of human VL infection. The trial was conducted during the years of 2004&#x02013;06 in the city of Teresina, Brazil, one of the largest endemic areas for VL in Brazil.

Its population of 814,230 inhabitants (2010) occupies an area of 1,392 km<sup>2</sup> with a population density of 584.94 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>. The climate is tropical, with mean annual temperature 27&#x000b0;C and annual rainfall 1,300 mm.

In 1980, however, the city was the site of the first large urban epidemic of VL in Brazil <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Costa2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. From 1980 to 1985, almost 1,000 new cases were detected as the population increased from 370,000 to 460,000 inhabitants. The disease remained an important public health problem throughout the 1980s, although the incidence declined to less than 100 cases a year after 1985. There was a second epidemic of 1,200 cases between 1993 and 1995. During the first half of the 2000s, the incidence averaged approximately 20 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, and leveled off after 2005 at around 10 cases/100,000 inhabitants.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Trial design</title><p>A cluster randomized trial was carried out from January 2004 to December 2006 in ten localities (<italic>localidades</italic>) in seven neighborhoods (<italic>bairros</italic>) of the city of Teresina, that had cases of VL reported from 2000 to 2002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003172-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

In each block, around 25 residences were visited and one eligible person in each household was selected for the study by simple random sampling from a list of the names of the residents. Selected persons remained eligible for participation if they had no evidence of previous infection, as indicated by a negative result of a Montenegro skin test (MST) using 0.1 ml of leishmania antigen injected intradermally with reactions measured 48&#x02013;72 hours later <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Melo1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The antigen was prepared from a strain of <italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic> and provided by the Reference Centre for Diagnostic Reagents (Biomanguinhos&#x02014;FIOCRUZ/RJ, Brazil). The diameter of skin induration was evaluated by two experienced and extensively trained professionals. The test was considered positive when induration measure was &#x02265;5 mm in diameter. If the selected person was absent or refused to participate (this occurred less than 5% of the time) or had a positive Montenegro reaction, the next youngest resident on the list was selected instead. At the last visit (18 months) a new MST was performed.</p><p>At the time of the initial visit, all consenting participants had blood samples collected by venipuncture in order to test for the presence of antibodies to <italic>L. infantum</italic> by an indirect immunofluorescent serological test (IFAT) using the Biomanguinhos&#x02014;FIOCRUZ/RJ, Brazil, kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The original plan was to repeat the IFAT test at 6 and 12 months, but due to operational problems, data on IFAT results were not considered valid for the analysis, and serology was not used as a marker of infection in the study. Problems with serology were poor sensitivity and reproducibility. For instance, among the 951 subjects for which an IFAT result was available at baseline, only 16 (1.68%) were positive. This result was deemed incompatible with the knowledge about VL transmission in Teresina, particularly in the studied areas in which transmission is known to occur, and inconsistent with data previously obtained indicating human seroprevalences ranging from 13.9% to 46.0% <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Werneck3" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Costa3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. To check whether the error was in our laboratory, 827 randomly selected sera were sent to a retest at the National VL Reference Laboratory, Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Ezequiel Dias (FUNED), in Belo Horizonte. Again, seroprevalence was also extremely low (1.33%) and agreement between laboratories was considered poor (kappa&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.08). It was unclear whether the problem with serology was due to substandard techniques for handling and storage of the collected sera, problems with test execution or problems with the kit itself. In any case, we decided not to use IFAT results in this study and relied on conversion of the MST at 18 months of follow-up as the only outcome measure, since no clinical cases of VL were detected among the studied population.</p><p>Using a structured questionnaire with pre-coded questions, data were obtained on age, sex, literacy, history of migration (ever lived outside Teresina), time of residence in Teresina, number of people in household, history of VL in the family, and characteristics of the household structure, peridomestic environment, and presence of domestic animals. Written consent was obtained from all participants (or, if they were aged &#x0003c;18 years, written consent was obtained by one of their caregivers along with verbal assent from those above 10 years old).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Interventions</title><p>Four interventions schemes were defined: (i) No intervention, (ii) Insecticide spraying (household and residential annexes), (iii) Culling of seropositive dogs, and (iv) Insecticide spraying+culling of seropositive dogs. Interventions were delivered in the selected blocks every 6 months, for three times, beginning just after each household visit. The last visit (18-month visit) was not followed by any intervention.</p><p>Both culling of seropositive dogs and insecticide spraying were performed according to the routine of the Visceral Leishmaniasis Control Program of the Zoonosis Control Center (ZCC) of the Teresina City Health Department. Teams of health workers of the ZCC with expertise in delivering such interventions were specifically recruited for this study. Interventions were performed in all houses of the blocks selected for receiving that specific intervention, not only in the houses where subjects had been recruited for the study.</p><p>All domiciled dogs in the blocks under the dog culling intervention had blood samples collected by venipuncture for serological testing by indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) using a canine leishmaniasis kit supplied by Bio-Manguinhos, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro. Reactions were considered positive if promastigote membrane fluorescence was observed at a serum dilution of 1&#x02236;40. Positive sera were retested for confirmation.

Those variables showing a statistical difference between any of the intervention groups in comparison to the control group at a p-value &#x02264;0.2 were selected to be adjustment variables in a multivariate analysis for assessing the effects of interventions on the incidence of infection.

In addition, effects of interventions were controlled for the baseline prevalence of infection as assessed by the MST in each block <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Hayes1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Analyses were performed using both intent-to-treat and per-protocol approaches. Although intent-to-treat is usually a preferable approach <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Hollis1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, a per-protocol analysis was considered useful in this setting since one of the interventions, namely culling of infected dogs, would only occur if a dog in a block under this intervention was found to be infected (it might not have happened) and the team of health workers of the ZCC could remove the dog from the environment. Failure to remove infected dogs is not uncommon, since the infected dogs are not detected immediately in the field, but only after two tests performed at the ZCC. When returning to the field, the team might not be allowed by the owner to remove the dog, the house might be closed, or the dog might not be at home.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using Stata/MP, version 11.2 (STATA Corp., College Station, TX).</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Sensitivity analysis of biases</title><p>We used sensitivity analysis to explore quantitatively the likelihood of bias due to loss to follow-up.

A reduction of the magnitude of the incidence of infection in this range might have an effect on the incidence rates of clinical VL, but this would be probably smaller, since susceptibility for developing clinical symptoms after infection is mediated by other factors such as age, genetics and nutrition <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Badaro1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Peacock1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Alonso1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Indeed, a mathematical model estimated that killing 2/3 of the infected dogs, as in our study, would only lead to a reduction of the incidence of human disease by less than 20% <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Dye1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>In general, the results of this study reinforce the generally accepted idea that culling seropositive dogs and insecticide spraying, the pillars of the Brazilian VL control program for at least 50 years, are not effective strategies for interrupting the spread of the disease, at least in the way they are implemented in the country <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Quinnell1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Costa1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Romero1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-DantasTorres1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In fact, the epidemiological situation leaves no doubt of the failure of both strategies. Disease counts have been on the rise since the 1980s, and VL is geographically spreading to areas in which it has not been reported before. From 1980 to 2010, around 80,000 cases of VL were reported in Brazil, with around 4,200 deaths. The mean number of cases reported per year increased from 1,601 (1985&#x02013;1989) to 3,814 (2006&#x02013;2010). In the 1990s, only 10% of cases occurred outside the Northeast region, but in 2010 the proportion reached 50% of cases. From 2009 to 2011, autochthonous cases of VL were reported in more than 20% of the municipalities and in 21 of the 27 states of the country.</p><p>The logic behind the use of such control measures in VL is the assumption that the incidence of <italic>L. infantum</italic> infection in humans is directly related to the number of infectious dogs and the vectorial capacity of the sand fly population to transmit infection from dogs to humans <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Dye1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. On the one hand, insecticide spraying decreases vector longevity, which is the major determinant of vectorial capacity. On the other hand, killing of infected dogs reduces the life expectancy of the reservoir population. Therefore, either vector control or dog culling theoretically can be effective <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Dye1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, many operational problems impair the effectiveness of these interventions such as the well-known inaccuracy of the serological tests used to identify canine infection by <italic>L. infantum</italic> in the field, the usual long time between identification of a seropositive dog and its removal, the fast substitution of sacrificed dogs by new, susceptible ones, insufficient knowledge about sand fly breeding sites and behavior, lack of available equipment and trained personnel for large-scale interventions, low coverage of insecticide spraying, deficiencies in quality control concerning insecticide handling, and lack of sustainability of control actions <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Quinnell1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Romero1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Costa3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-DantasTorres1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Desjeux1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Alexander1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Nunes1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Considering all these problems, the low estimates of effectiveness for both interventions obtained in this study are not surprising, since it was designed to assess their effectiveness as implemented in practice. In this sense, our study provides some basis for comparisons of future studies that attempt to address the extent to which such operational problems affect the performance of interventions.</p><p>A point that deserves further attention is that not all infected dogs become infectious and the usual serological tests used in practice do not separate infectious from non-infectious animals <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Quinnell1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Courtenay1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Courtenay2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Control measures targeting infectious dogs could be a more effective approach since interventions focused on just those animals that contribute mostly to transmission tend to be more efficient <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Courtenay2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Woolhouse1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Koopman1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Actually, highly infectious dogs can be distinguished from non-infectious dogs adopting quantitative PCR for detecting parasite loads in ear tissue <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Courtenay2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, a control strategy oriented to remove from the environment just the highly infectious dogs might not be sufficient to interrupt transmission, since asymptomatic dogs can also transmit <italic>Leishmania</italic> to sandflies.</p><p>The relatively low effectiveness of dog culling (38%, considering the results from intent-to-treat analysis, a generally more accepted approach) leads to the question of the ethics of maintaining this strategy for VL control <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Costa1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Passantino1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In settings with low prevalence of canine infection, as in our study, the moderate specificity of the tests usually used in the field <xref rid="pntd.0003172-daSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Ferreira1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, in particular to detect asymptomatic infection, leads to a low positive predictive value and, consequently, the sacrifice of many dogs that are actually not infected. Removing such dogs that are actually not contributing to transmission may have even an undesirable effect, since most of them will be replaced by new susceptible ones. This problem, along with the growing lack of acceptability of dog culling by the communities, makes the sacrifice of dogs an increasingly difficult control strategy to be sustained in Brazil.</p><p>In light of the low effectiveness of the dog culling strategy, a further point that might also be considered is the possibility that other reservoir mammals contribute to VL transmission in urban settings. Studies have confirmed that humans, crab-eating foxes, opossums, domestic cats, and black rats can transmit <italic>L. infantum</italic> to sand flies although their importance has been minimized <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Quinnell1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, in certain scenarios these secondary reservoirs could conceivably play a role in sustaining transmission, and further studies on their infectious potential are needed.</p><p>In spite of the geographic expansion and increase in number of cases of VL in Brazil in recent years, it is possible that the situation would have been even worse in the absence of these interventions. Therefore, any decision concerning the discontinuation of either of these control measures or their substitution by others, such as dog collars impregnated with insecticides, treatment of dogs, or dog vaccination, should be accompanied by a detailed monitoring of canine infection and human cases at the local level.</p><p>Several limitations of this study need to be highlighted. First, since 38% of the eligible population was lost to follow-up, selection bias is a threat to the validity of the study results. Indeed, sensitivity analysis using single imputation of the outcome, assuming random missingness, generated results compatible with non-effectiveness of all interventions evaluated. It should be noted, however, that the point estimates for the dog culling strategy still showed a protective effect of 27% (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.073, intent-to-treat analysis) and 41% (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.056, per-protocol analysis), making it difficult to conclude about the complete ineffectiveness of this control measure. Losses to follow-up were also common in other intervention trials in Brazil, ranging from 24% <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Dietze1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> to 44% in one year <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Costa3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, which stresses the difficulties of performing this type of study among urban population living in deprived areas. The majority of the losses in this study were due to migration to other neighborhoods within the city, as reported by the neighbors. Second, the lack of results of serological tests at each 6 months of follow-up impaired the ability to verify the potential short-term effect of the interventions, since an antibody response to infection is built rapidly after infection <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Hailu1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Third, monitoring the effect of interventions on the incidence of VL was not possible due to the relative rarity of clinical disease. Based on incidence rates of VL in these neighborhoods from 2000 to 2002, one would have expected around 0.5 cases per 1,000 persons in a period of two years, making analysis of this outcome unfeasible in this study. This limitation needs to be taken into consideration when using the results of this study for informing decision on whether to interrupt or change the current interventions against VL, since the impact of an intervention on MST conversion and its impact on clinical VL might not be the same. Fourth, the high incidence of infection should be considered with caution, since hypersensitivity to thimerosal, used as a preservative in the Montenegro antigen, and the sensitization potential of a previous exposure to MST, might have contributed to the occurrence of false-positive cases <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Jose1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Fagundes1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. However, there is no objective reason to believe that such error would happen differentially between the intervention areas, suggesting that the estimates of effectiveness might have well been underestimated <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Szklo1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Finally, due to the high baseline prevalence of infection, high rates of loss to follow-up and a high intraclass correlation coefficient in the actual data (0.057), the final sample size provided low statistical power to detect as significant observed differences between the interventions. Indeed, power ranged from 15% (when comparing insecticide spraying alone and no intervention) to 53% (when comparing dog-culling alone and no intervention). Such variation in the statistical power occurred mainly because the number of subjects actually followed-up and the differences observed in the incidence of infection varied between areas of intervention.</p><p>Despite these limitations, this study overcomes some methodological problems of previous studies, in particular regarding the number of clusters randomly allocated to different interventions. For instance, except for one study <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Costa3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, all other controlled trials in Latin America evaluating the same control measures as our study used either a before-after approach in just one area <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Grimaldi1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> or a 1&#x02236;1 or 2&#x02236;1 comparison of intervention and control areas <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Dietze1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Ashford1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Feliciangeli1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-DeSouza1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. These approaches are inadequate for evaluating interventions, due to the high risk of lack of comparability between areas in terms of transmission intensity, but also because of the impossibility of making statistical inferences without assessing between-cluster variation <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Hayes1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. A minimum of four clusters per intervention arm has been recommended for cluster randomized trials <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Hayes1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Also, some of the above studies did not evaluate the effect of interventions on human infection or disease <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Grimaldi1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Feliciangeli1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, which are the most appropriate outcome measures for public health purposes. Advantages of our study as compared to a previous one in the same area <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Costa3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, include a larger sample size and the use of clusters not restricted to just one neighborhood, which decreases the odds of contamination between interventions in neighboring clusters <xref rid="pntd.0003172-Hayes1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, the continuous spread of VL in Brazil after more than 40 years of large scale deployment of insecticide spraying and dog culling indicates an urgent need for revision of the Brazilian VL control program. While waiting for the development of an effective human vaccine, effectiveness of other control measures, such as insecticide impregnated dog collars, topical insecticides for dogs, canine vaccines, and impregnated nets for humans should be evaluated in trials using solid methodologies and powered for detecting effects of such intervention on clinical outcomes. The delivery of interventions should be modified according to the different transmission scenarios, preferably targeting the areas at highest risk. Efforts to solve operational barriers to the adequate implementation of preventive measures are paramount. Finally, a broad commitment of both scientific and civil societies is necessary to interrupt the seemingly relentless progression of VL towards becoming one of the most serious infectious diseases of Brazilian urban populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0003172.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>(A&#x02013;H) Schematic representation of the sampling process.
