Patients met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD, had a current episode of depression of at least 4 weeks&#x02019; duration, and a Montgomery-&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score &#x02265;30. The study comprised a 1-week, single-blind, placebo lead-in, 8-week double-blind treatment, and a 2-week down-taper. The primary and secondary efficacy measures were change from baseline to Week 8 in MADRS and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) total scores, respectively, analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures approach.

Levomilnacipran ER was generally well tolerated. More levomilnacipran ER patients vs placebo reported AEs; the most common AEs for levomilnacipran ER were nausea (17%) and headache (16%).

Levomilnacipran is the more active enantiomer of milnacipran, an SNRI that is approved for the treatment of fibromyalgia in the US (prescribing information: Savella [milnacipran hydrochloride], 2011; Forest Laboratories, Inc: St Louis, MO). Milnacipran is not approved for the treatment of MDD in the US; however, it is approved for this indication in many other countries. Milnacipran studies in MDD were conducted more than a decade ago and no head-to-head trials with levomilnacipran ER have been performed. As such, no valid comparison of levomilnacipran ER and milnacipran can be made based on the clinical data.</p><p>The clinical development program for levomilnacipran ER for the treatment of MDD has included four Phase II/III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-<sup><xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> or fixed-dose<sup><xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> trials in which the pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint was met. Levomilnacipran ER at the doses evaluated was generally safe and well tolerated. In an additional flexible-dose study conducted concurrently with the positive trials, levomilnacipran ER failed to achieve statistically significant separation from placebo on the primary efficacy measure; the efficacy, safety, and tolerability results of this study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00969150) are reported here.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S7"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This Phase III randomized, double-blind, controlled trial comparing flexible doses of levomilnacipran ER 40&#x02013;120&#x02009;mg/day with placebo was conducted in adult outpatients with MDD. The study was conducted at 24 centers in the US between September 2009 and October 2010 in full compliance with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Each center&#x02019;s institutional review board approved the study, and all patients provided written informed consent.</p><sec id="S0007-S2001" disp-level="2"><title>Study design</title><p>Following a 1-week, single-blind, placebo lead-in, patients who continued to meet eligibility criteria were randomized (1:1) to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with levomilnacipran ER or placebo. Patients were randomized by a computer-generated list of numbers and assigned to identically appearing levomilnacipran ER or placebo. Investigators and patients were blinded to allocation of the investigational product throughout treatment and down-taper periods. The blind was maintained via a secured randomization code list and was broken only in the case of emergency; unblinding disqualified a patient from further study participation.</p><p>All patients randomized to levomilnacipran ER received 20&#x02009;mg on Days 1 and 2, and 40&#x02009;mg beginning on Day 3. At the end of Week 1 or Week 2, the dose could be increased to 80&#x02009;mg/day based on patient response and tolerability. At the end of Week 4, the dose could be increased to 80&#x02009;mg/day for patients who were previously receiving 40&#x02009;mg/day or to 120&#x02009;mg/day for patients who were previously receiving 80&#x02009;mg/day. No dose increase was permitted after Week 4, but dosage could be decreased to the previous level at any time if the Investigator determined that there were significant tolerability issues. After 8 weeks of treatment, or at premature discontinuation of the study, patients entered a 2-week down-titration period in which doses were gradually down tapered every 3&#x02013;7 days unless the Investigator felt this was clinically not indicated.</p></sec><sec id="S0007-S2002" disp-level="2"><title>Key inclusion criteria</title><p>Male and female outpatients who were 18&#x02013;80 years of age, inclusive, and met the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)<sup><xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> criteria for MDD were eligible to participate; the diagnosis of MDD was confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)<sup><xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.

Statistically significant differences were also observed on secondary efficacy measures, and many or all additional measures in all studies.</p><p>The most salient difference between the current trial and the positive studies just described was the magnitude of placebo response. The mean reduction from baseline in MADRS total score for levomilnacipran ER 40&#x02013;120&#x02009;mg in the current study was 15.7 points, which is comparable to the magnitude of change observed in the positive clinical trials. By comparison, in the current study patients receiving placebo experienced a mean MADRS total score reduction from baseline of 14.2 points, which is 2&#x02013;3-points greater than the mean reductions observed for placebo groups in the positive levomilnacipran ER trials.</p><p>The increasing occurrence of robust placebo response in antidepressant clinical trials has been well documented<sup><xref rid="C29" ref-type="bibr">29&#x02013;31</xref></sup>. This phenomenon is of particular concern because high placebo response, as seen in this trial, interferes with the sensitivity of the study to detect the efficacy of active treatment. In trials of marketed antidepressants submitted to the FDA, fewer than half demonstrated statistically superior efficacy for the active compound<sup><xref rid="C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Meta-analyses suggest that high placebo response, rather than poor response to medication, explains much of the variability in drug&#x02013;placebo differences in clinical studies<sup><xref rid="C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>.</p><p>High and variable placebo response rates contribute to the likelihood of ambiguous findings in antidepressant clinical trials, which may hinder the development of new antidepressant treatment options. Several factors have been evaluated to determine if specific aspects of study design and conduct influence placebo response and treatment effect in clinical trials of antidepressants. Baseline depression severity, flexible- vs fixed-dose regimens, where and when the study was conducted, study duration, patient age, and the permitted use of sedatives or anxiolytics are among the factors that have been suggested as contributors to high placebo response<sup><xref rid="C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>.</p><p>A greater likelihood of receiving placebo, greater severity of baseline depression, and earlier year of study publication appear to be associated with greater antidepressant&#x02013;placebo separation at the end of treatment<sup><xref rid="C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Analyses of fixed- vs flexible-dosage schedules on treatment effects have yielded equivocal results. Khan <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref rid="C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> reported success rates of 59.6% for MDD trials with a flexible-dose design vs 31.4% for fixed-dose trials; conversely, an analysis by Khin <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref rid="C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> found a slightly higher success rate in fixed-dose (57%) vs flexible-dose (51%) trials. Generally, fixed- vs flexible-dosage schedules, trial duration, and patient age do not routinely appear to influence trial outcome<sup><xref rid="C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. The use of a placebo run-in phase, restricting study design to two treatment arms with 1:1 randomization, and limiting patient expectation of improvement through explicit consent practices have also been posited as potential ameliorators of high placebo response, but investigations of these factors have yielded conflicting outcomes<sup><xref rid="C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and more study is warranted.</p><p>Based on these findings, the study design used in the current trial should have minimized a majority of the factors that have been mentioned as possible reasons for high placebo response. Single-blind placebo was administered during the 1-week, placebo run-in period to minimize placebo response and allow a preliminary evaluation of patient compliance with investigational product dosing. After the screening period, patients were randomized 1:1 to only levomilnacipran ER or placebo. Additionally, the population consisted of patients whose mean baseline MADRS total score (36) exceeded the threshold typically used to delineate severe depression (baseline MADRS total &#x02265;30)<sup><xref rid="C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>, which would suggest a study population with highly symptomatic and at least moderately severe depression. Since more severe depression is one of the factors that has been shown to be significantly related to positive antidepressant trial outcome<sup><xref rid="C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, baseline level of depression severity may not be an important factor in the outcome of the current trial.</p><p>It has been suggested that limiting the number of rating scales and shortening the length of study visits may help minimize the high placebo effect<sup><xref rid="C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Although the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of levomilnacipran ER vs placebo, several additional efficacy measures were used in this study to evaluate MDD-associated impairment that occurs across several life and health domains. While it is not possible to determine if this influenced the rate of placebo response, the inclusion of additional efficacy measures to evaluate functional as well as symptomatic improvement was warranted. Of note, in positive levomilnacipran ER clinical studies, the use of multiple efficacy measures did not appear to influence the ability to detect a positive result on the primary measure<sup><xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;17</xref></sup>. Additionally, the rate of response (MADRS &#x02265;50% improvement from baseline) for levomilnacipran ER patients was slightly lower relative to other levomilnacipran ER studies (39% in this study vs 42&#x02013;47% in other studies), which suggests that there may have been additional undetected factors that influenced study results. While the negative finding on the primary outcome in this study appears to be related to a high rate of placebo response, the reason for this and other contributing factors remains unclear.</p><p>Similar to findings from the positive levomilnacipran ER studies mentioned, levomilnacipran ER was generally well tolerated in the current study. The most common TEAEs were typical of agents that selectively inhibit serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake<sup><xref rid="C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>, and most were judged to be mild-to-moderate in intensity. No SAEs, suicides, or suicide attempts occurred during the study. Levomilnacipran ER was weight neutral, an important finding in light of the high percentage of patients who rate weight gain as a bothersome AE associated with antidepressant use<sup><xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p><p>Sexual dysfunction is another common and troublesome AE associated with depression and antidepressant use. This is the only levomilnacipran ER trial reported to date that has used the ASEX, a standardized measure of sexual function, to prospectively and categorically assess sexual experiences. Patients receiving levomilnacipran ER or placebo showed small improvement in ASEX total score after 8 weeks of treatment. No decrease in sexual function and change similar to placebo are relevant findings pertaining to the good tolerability profile of levomilnacipran ER. Using an alternate sexual functioning measure, sexual dysfunction TEAEs (male patients only) were reported for levomilnacipran ER patients vs placebo patients: ejaculation disorder (7.9% vs 0%) and erectile dysfunction (5.3% vs 1.5%).</p><p>Although a high rate of placebo response contributed to the lack of statistical separation between drug and placebo observed in this flexible-dose trial of levomilnacipran ER, no specific methodological or design issue has been identified as an explicit reason for the negative outcome. Limitations of the study include the short duration of double-blind treatment, inclusion and exclusion criteria that may limit generalizability, and no active comparator. In light of the highly successful clinical development program for levomilnacipran ER, this negative study appears to be an anomaly, albeit one that has occurred more frequently in recent antidepressant clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, numerically greater improvements were consistently observed across efficacy measures, suggesting a trend toward improvement for levomilnacipran ER relative to placebo, but between-treatment differences were not statistically significant. Levomilnacipran ER was generally safe and well tolerated. A relatively low incidence of sexual AEs was reported, in addition to small improvements in sexual functioning, using a prospectively defined sexual dysfunction outcome measure; this result is relevant to the overall tolerability profile of levomilnacipran ER, since sexual dysfunction is commonly associated with depression and antidepressant use. The findings from this negative trial should be viewed within the context of the four robustly positive levomilnacipran ER placebo-controlled trials and the current clinical trial environment in which nearly half of all placebo-controlled antidepressant trials do not demonstrate significant antidepressant separation from placebo on the primary efficacy outcome measure.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to acknowledge writing assistance and editorial support for the preparation of this manuscript was provided by Adam Ruth, PhD, and Carol Dyer, MS, of Prescott Medical Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois, contractors of Forest Research Institute.</p></ack><sec id="S11"><title>Transparency</title><sec id="s1a"><title>Declaration of funding</title><p>This study was funded by Forest Laboratories, Inc.
