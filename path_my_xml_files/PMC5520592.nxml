Hence, this randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare the onset and duration of a supraclavicular brachial plexus block when tramadol and clonidine in a dose of 1 and 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg were added as adjuvants to local anesthetic solution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>This was a double-blind randomized study conducted over a period of 1 year from August 2011 to August 2012 in a tertiary center. Institutional Ethical Committee approval was taken before conducting the trial. Following ethical committee approval, ninety patients posted for routine or emergency orthopedic forearm and hand surgeries lasting for about 90 min were included in this study. All surgeries were performed under a tourniquet. The patients who belonged to the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II and were between 18 and 50 years of age were selected for this study. Patients who did not meet the above criteria or patients who had hypersensitivity/allergy to any drug used in the study or those who were on analgesics before the study were excluded from the study. Patients with cardiovascular or respiratory diseases and patients suffering from renal or hepatic derangements or diseases of central nervous system or bleeding disorders were excluded from the study. Each patient was given all information and details about the anesthetic procedure and the drugs used and were freely allowed to clarify any doubt or question they had. A written informed consent in the local language was taken from all the patients. Patients taking part in the study underwent a thorough preoperative assessment including detailed case history, physical examination, and baseline investigations such as hemoglobin, bleeding time, and clotting time.</p><p>The patients were randomly assigned to three different groups of thirty each by a computer-generated randomized sheet. Concealment was done using sealed envelopes. No premedication was administered. A stock solution with a volume of 40 mL of local anesthetic solution was prepared as follows:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>15 mL of 2% lignocaine adrenaline sodium bicarbonate solution (with adrenaline in a concentration of 5 &#x003bc;g/mL of lignocaine solution and 1.25 mL of 7.5% of sodium bicarbonate per 15 mL of the lignocaine solution); 15 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine; 10 mL distilled water.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Patients received 0.7 mL/kg of the above solution for the supraclavicular block.</p><p>Adjuvants were added to the final volume of the local anesthetic to be administered depending on the group;</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Group A: These patients received 1 mg/kg tramadol as adjuvant;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group B: These patients received 1 &#x003bc;g/kg clonidine as adjuvant;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group C: These patients received 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg clonidine as adjuvant;</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>All drug solutions were prepared by an anesthesiologist not involved in the administration of anesthesia, patient care, and data collection.</p><p>The patients were administered a brachial plexus block under all aseptic precautions using a nerve locator. The patient was made to lie supine with a pillow below the shoulders with the head turned to opposite side. The arm to be blocked was kept along the side of the body. After sterile preparation of the site, the following landmarks were palpated:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The midpoint of the clavicle</p></list-item><list-item><p>The pulsations of the subclavian artery 1&#x02013;2 cm above the midpoint and just lateral to outer border of scalenus anterior muscle.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The preprocedural pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, saturation, and sedation were recorded. Using a nerve locator, an insulated 22-gauge injection needle was introduced just lateral to the pulsating subclavian artery in a downward and posterior direction till motor response of the forearm with flexion of the first, second, third, and fourth fingers was elicited. The drug was injected when motor response was elicited at a current of 0.4 mA. The needle was removed and gentle massage was given manually over the site of injection for 5 min to ensure uniform spread of the drug.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Sensory blockade was assessed by sterile pinprick along the sensory distribution of median, radial, and the ulnar nerves every 30 s till the onset of the block and the every 30 min till its offset. The onset of sensory block was defined as the time between administering the drug and the time there was no sensation to a pinprick in the distribution of all three nerves.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Motor blockade was evaluated by Bromage scale[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (0 = normal motor function with full flexion and extension of elbow, wrist, and fingers; 1 = decreased motor function with ability to move the fingers only; 2 = compete motor block with inability to move the fingers) every 1 min till the onset followed by 30 min till its offset. The onset of motor block was defined as the time between administering the drug to the time the Bromage scale was 2. Surgery was started after the onset of both sensory and motor components of the block.</p><p>Patients were not given any sedation during the study period. Pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, saturation, and sedation (evaluated according to The Ramsay sedation scale[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]) were recorded every 15 min for the first hour followed by every 30 min for the next 3 h. Hypotension and bradycardia were defined as a fall in blood pressure and heart rate, respectively, by more than 20% from the preoperative values. In addition, the incidence of nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression was recorded. Respiratory depression was defined as a decrease in respiratory rate below 10 or a fall in saturation to &#x02264;90%.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The time for rescue analgesia, that is, the period from the administration of the block till the time the patient complained of pain was recorded postoperatively in each patient. Injection diclofenac sodium (1.5 mg/kg) was then administered intramuscularly as rescue analgesic.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Ramsay sedation scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-33-197-g001"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Duration of postoperative analgesia was used as the outcome measure to calculate the sample size.

The time for rescue analgesia was the longest (statistically significant) in patients who received 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg of clonidine. The increase was by an average of 3 h when compared with tramadol and 21 min when compared with 1 &#x003bc;g/kg clonidine. This dose thus provided the maximum postoperative analgesia out of three doses. A similar result was arrived at by Singelyn <italic>et al</italic>. in 1996.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] A meta-analysis of the randomized trials on clonidine in peripheral nerve blocks concluded that addition of clonidine considerably prolonged postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The results of this study are in accordance with the present study. In the present study, a statistically significant earlier onset of sensory and motor block was observed when clonidine was added in a dose of 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg.</p><p>A meta-analysis on previous studies conducted by P&#x000f6;pping <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] in 2009 on clonidine reported a decrease in onset time of about 2 min with 90 &#x003bc;g of clonidine as compared with controls who did not receive adjuvants. The onset of sensory and motor block in these studies was about 12 and 17 min, respectively. The difference in onset time from our study could be due to the fact that other studies used bupivacaine, ropivacaine, or mepivacaine as local anesthetics. In the present study, a combination of lignocaine-bupivacaine was used. The faster onset of action of lignocaine may be one factor responsible for this difference in onset time. Furthermore, most of the studies included in the meta-analyses used the axillary approach while we used a supraclavicular approach in the present study. Tramadol has been shown to increase the duration of peripheral nerve blocks though the time to onset of the block was not decreased.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In the present study when compared with tramadol, clonidine in either of the two doses resulted in a greater prolongation in the duration of sensory and motor blocks. Clonidine in a dose of 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg resulted in an average duration of 315.7 &#x000b1; 26.9 min of sensory block. This is in accordance with other studies and meta-analysis, where 90 &#x003bc;g of clonidine provided an average duration of sensory block of 343 min.</p><p>In previous studies, depending on the local anesthetic used the increase in motor blockade ranged from 1.5 to 4 h with the maximum increase seen with bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] A total of 150 &#x003bc;g clonidine were also found to increase the duration of axillary plexus block by Duma <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In 2005, Iohom <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] found that clonidine added to mepivacaine for axillary brachial plexus block enhances both anesthesia and postoperative analgesia. Interestingly, there are studies which conclude the effect of Clonidine varies depending upon the local anaesthetic used with no effect seen with ropivacaine[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>As far as dose-responsiveness is concerned, in consonance with other studies,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] the difference in the duration of the block was not statistically significant thus failing to demonstrate a dose-responsiveness.</p><p>All patients were hemodynamically stable throughout the study period. No incidence of sedation or respiratory depression was observed in the present study. This is in accordance with most studies state that the ill effects of hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation are limited up to a dose of 150 &#x003bc;g.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>However, this study was a single-blinded study, so observer bias could have possibly affected the results. The pain was not quantified using a visual analog scale (VAS) score. Any time the patient complained of pain, the rescue analgesic was administered. Ultrasonography assistance was not used for block administration in this study. The use of USG-guided blocks may further validate the result.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>From the present study, it can be inferred that when compared with tramadol, the addition of clonidine to a local anesthetic mixture produced a faster onset and prolonged duration of both of the sensory and motor components of a brachial plexus block with fastest onset seen with a dose of 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg of clonidine. However, there was no significant increase in the duration of the block when a higher dose of clonidine was used. In addition, in a dose of 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg body weight clonidine provided maximum postoperative analgesia. Patients were hemodynamically stable when 1 or 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg of clonidine was used.
