function of patients with chronic back pain. [Subjects and Methods] This study evenly
divided a total of 20 patients with chronic back pain into a conservative physical therapy
group that received conservative physical therapy, and a high intensity laser therapy
group that received High Intensity Laser Therapy after conservative physical therapy. All
patients received the therapy three times a week for four weeks. For the high intensity
laser therapy group, treatment was applied to the L1&#x02013;L5 and S1 regions for 10 minutes by
using a high intensity laser device while vertically maintaining the separation distance
from handpiece to skin at approximately 1&#x02005;cm. A visual analog scale was used to measure
the pain and Oswestry Disability Index was used for functional evaluation. [Results] In a
within-group comparison of the conservative physical therapy and high intensity laser
therapy groups, both the visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index significantly
decreased. In a between-group comparison after treatment, the high intensity laser therapy
group showed a significantly lower visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index than
the conservative physical therapy group. [Conclusion] High Intensity Laser Therapy can be
an effective nonsurgical intervention method for reducing pain and helping the performance
of daily routines of patients who have chronic back pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Low back pain</kwd><kwd>High intensity laser therapy</kwd><kwd>Oswestry disability index</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Back pain is a frequently observed disease. Statistics tell us that most people have
experienced back pain at least once in their lifetime. The disease affects almost all age
groups, inflicting mental and physical burdens on people<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Risk factors of spinal pain include physical characteristics,
general medical health, mental condition, and working environmental factors where age,
weight, injury, occupation, or posture can make people experience the pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Back pain resulting from these factors
causes productivity loss and impairment of quality of life as it limits mobility in people&#x02019;s
daily routines<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Symptoms of back pain not
only affect sacroiliac articulation and the lumbar region, but also accompany radiating pain
that progresses to the lower limbs<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Popular treatments for back pain include acupuncture, traction, percutaneous electrical
nerve stimulation, massage, ultrasonic waves, and low-intensity laser treatment. Surgery is
recommended when these treatment methods are ineffective or when symptoms are very
severe<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. High Intensity Laser Therapy
(HILT) has photochemistry effects that stimulate oxidation of mitochondria and ATP creation
by delivering high energy output inside tissues. HILT can cause quick absorption of edema
and removal of exudates through increased metabolism and blood circulation<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although many nonsurgical treatments for
chronic back pain have been introduced so far, there is a paucity of research on HILT. To
help answer this shortcoming, this study conducted an experiment to prove the effects of
HILT on patients with chronic back pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Among the hospitalized patients and outpatients in S Orthopedics located in Daegu City,
Korea, research subjects of this study included 20 patients between the ages of 30 and 65
who were diagnosed by their doctors with chronic back pain, based on clinical findings and
X-ray findings that persisted for more than three months. Excluded from the sample were
patients who had surgical history in the lumbar region, had a spinal tumor or disc
infection, or had inflammatory diseases such as rheumatism as well as those who had previous
fractures and those who had contraindications for manual therapy. Ethical approval for the
study was granted by the U1 University institutional review board. All subjects read and
signed consent forms, in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p><p>The patients with chronic back pain were randomly and evenly divided into a Conservative
Physical Therapy Group (CPTG) that received conservative physical therapy, and a
High-intensity Laser Therapy Group (HLTG) that received both conservative physical therapy
and HILT. The treatment was applied three times a week for a total of four weeks. The CPTG
subjects had an mean age of 47.1 &#x000b1; 9.6&#x02005;years, an mean height of 164.4 &#x000b1; 10.0&#x02005;cm, and an mean
weight of 62.7 &#x000b1; 15.6&#x02005;kg. For the HILT subjects, mean age was 48.3 &#x000b1; 9.0&#x02005;years, mean height
was 160.1.3 &#x000b1; 5.5&#x02005;cm, and mean weight was 62.6 &#x000b1; 10.2&#x02005;kg. CPTG received a 20-minute hot pack
treatment, 15-minute interference wave treatment, and 5-minute deep heat injection treatment
using ultrasonic waves. HLTG received high intensity laser therapy after the identical
conservative physical therapy was applied. A HILT device (SALUS-Heallaser, Remed Inc.) was
applied to the L1&#x02013;L5 and S1 regions for 10 minutes while vertically maintaining the
separation distance from handpiece to skin at approximately 1&#x02005;cm. The laser was applied in
three phases including initial phase, trigger point, and final phase, with a total energy of
1,378&#x02005;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig.

week for four weeks.</p><p>In this study, a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to investigate the intensity of pain
and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was used to evaluate the function of patients with
chronic back pain. VAS and ODI of both of CPTG and HLTG were measured before and after the
four-week treatment using identical methods. As for the statistical analysis in this study,
paired t-test was conducted to examine the within-group change and independent t-test was
conducted for the between-group comparison. SPSS/PC Ver. 13.0 was used for statistical
treatment in this study where significance level &#x003b1; was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study, VAS and ODI significantly decreased in a within-group comparison of CPTG and
HLTG (p&#x0003c;0.05). In a between-group comparison after the treatment, VAS and ODI of HLTG
were significantly lower than CPTG (p&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the VAS and ODI within

recognition of avoiding surgery and side effects. This study attempted to find out how high
intensity laser therapy affects the pain and function of patients with chronic back
pain.</p><p>Alayat et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the HLTG
included exercise showed increased ROM, reduced pain, and functional disability compared to
the HLTG, and the Sham Laser Group that included exercise. Alayat et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> applied HILT to female patients with chronic
back pain and reported its effectiveness in pain reduction. In this study, applying HILT to
patients with chronic back pain for four weeks resulted in statistically significant
improvement of VAS in HLTG. It is conjectured that HILT increased metabolism and stimulated
blood circulation through systemic vasodilatation, causing reabsorption of unnecessary
tissue-liquid that was accumulated in body and quick removal of exudates<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, function of patients with
chronic back pain that was measured by ODI showed a statistically significant difference in
HLTG. Kheshie et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> compared between
HILT and low-intensity laser treatment using 53 female patients with degenerative knee
arthritis as a sample and reported that HILT is more effective in pain reduction and
functional improvement. Alayat et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>
applied HILT to 72 female patients with chronic back pain and reported its effectiveness in
enhancing the range of mobility and function, supporting the results of this study. Here,
HILT affected homeostasis as it enhanced ATP production by inducing thermal effects through
photothermal interaction<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. It can also be
attributed to the fact that HILT relaxed stiffened tissue by increasing expansibility inside
collagen tissue through a stimulation of metabolism of cells that was caused by decreased
infection and increased temperature of the local area<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the number of subjects was small. The sample
only included patients who visited our hospital during one four-week period. Second, we
could not perfectly control the daily routine of the subjects. Third, as the treatment
duration was short, we could not check the long-term effects. We believe that many new
studies on the effects of HILT will be required in order to complement the limitations of
this study.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Sims</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Moorman</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name></person-group>:
