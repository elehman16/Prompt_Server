The primary clinical outcome is need for MROP, defined as the placenta remaining undelivered 15&#x02009;min poststudy treatment and/or being required within 15&#x02009;min of treatment due to safety concerns. The primary safety outcome is measured blood loss between administration of treatment and transfer to the postnatal ward or other clinical area. The primary patient-sided outcome is satisfaction with treatment and a side effect profile. The primary economic outcome is net incremental costs (or cost savings) to the National Health Service of using GTN versus standard practice. Secondary outcomes are being measured over a range of clinical and economic domains. The primary outcomes will be analysed using linear models appropriate to the distribution of each outcome. Health service costs will be compared with multiple trial outcomes in a cost-consequence analysis of GTN versus standard practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval has been obtained from the North-East Newcastle &#x00026; North Tyneside 2 Research Ethics Committee (13/NE/0339).

Following failure of active or physiological management, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence recommends that retained placenta should be treated by the operative procedure of manual removal of placenta&#x000a0;(MROP).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This procedure requires skilled personnel, an operative environment and, compared with spontaneous placental delivery, has its own attendant risks, including bleeding<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and infection.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> There is often a delay in undertaking the operation, which leads to further haemorrhage,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and the procedure itself is costly in terms of staff time. Furthermore, the infrastructure required for this operative intervention is not available in all delivery settings, and the invasive nature of this procedure has the potential to delay or interrupt mother&#x02013;baby bonding in the immediate postpartum period. To reduce the number of women requiring MROP, there is therefore a need for new (and effective) medical treatments for retained placenta. The reduction in operative interventions would potentially have cost benefits for the National Health Service (NHS) and also for women in terms of increased satisfaction, less separation between mother and baby immediately after birth and reduced morbidity.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Rationale for study</title><p>Observational studies along with results from small randomised controlled trials have suggested that nitric oxide donors including glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) given intravenously might be effective for the management of retained placenta with success rates ranging between 94% and 100%.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;10</xref> Although intravenous GTN appears to be efficacious for retained placenta in these small studies, this route of administration is not practical in all settings and intravenous administration causes unacceptable side-effects including symptomatic hypotension at higher doses.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> More recently, sublingual administration has been trialled, with studies reporting experience with sublingual GTN tablet and spray. Using a sublingual GTN tablet, two small studies suggest a beneficial effect of sublingual GTN tablet; however, a third larger study does not (ISRCTN34755982; 37.3% vs 20.4%; GTN vs placebo; p&#x0003e;0.05; n=105 women).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The alternative preparation for sublingual administration is GTN spray.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Compared with the tablet preparation, sublingual GTN spray has several advantages including stability at room temperature, significant reduction in latency of onset with onset beginning at 30&#x02013;45&#x02009;s, peaking at 90&#x02013;120&#x02009;s and lasting up to 5&#x02009;min,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref> and fewer objective and subjective side-effects.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> GTN spray is an&#x000a0;accepted obstetric management in other scenarios where rapid tocolysis is required such as uterine relaxation for release of a trapped head in breech delivery or at caesarean section.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Furthermore, anecdotal reports suggest that GTN spray may also have a use in management of retained placenta.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p><p>To summarise, although a growing body of evidence supports GTN use for the treatment of retained placenta, much of this evidence is based on anecdotal case&#x000a0;reports or clinical studies which are non-randomised, do not include a placebo arm and are underpowered. There is therefore a need to undertake a well-designed, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind pragmatic group sequential UK-wide (GOT-IT trial) to definitively determine whether sublingual GTN is (or is not) clinically and cost-effective for management of retained placenta.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The aim of this placebo-controlled, double-blind, pragmatic group sequential UK-wide trial is to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of GTN for treating retained placenta and avoiding MROP.</p><p>The hypothesis being tested is that sublingual GTN spray is clinical and cost effective in treating retained placenta after vaginal delivery, reducing the need for MROP following failure of current management.</p><p>The primary objectives are to: (1) determine the clinical effectiveness of sublingual GTN in treating retained placenta and avoiding MROP in women with vaginal delivery following failure of current management (clinical domain), (2) determine the side-effect profile for GTN given to treat retained placenta (safety domain), (3) assess patient satisfaction with GTN given for retained placenta (patient-sided domain) and (4) assess the net costs (or cost savings) to the NHS of using GTN for the treatment of retained placenta compared with standard practice (economic domain).</p><p>The secondary objectives are to assess NHS costs in relation to the primary outcome and range of secondary outcomes which are expected to differ between the two arms of the trial, using a cost-consequence balance sheet approach.</p><p>The trial contained an internal pilot, which commenced in October 2014 and was completed in April 2015. The aim of this internal pilot, which recruited from eight sites across the UK, was to provide reassurance on all the trial processes, including recruitment, consent, randomisation, delivery of treatment and follow-up assessments to ensure that all were running smoothly. Recruitment to the substantive trial is ongoing and is due to finish in September 2017.</p><p>A nested qualitative study was undertaken during the internal pilot to adjust strategies to (1) maximise recruitment into the main trial, (2) refine the recruitment and consent pathway and (3) ensure staff are given appropriate training and support to help promote the successful delivery of the main trial. In-depth qualitative interviews were undertaken with staff (n=27) involved in trial recruitment, consenting and/or trial delivery and with trial recruits (n=22) within, when possible, 4&#x02009;weeks of randomisation. The results of the qualitative research have been published and have informed the delivery of the main trial.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref>

Women are identified as being potentially eligible for the trial if, following vaginal birth, they have a retained placenta and are at risk of needing a MROP after failure of current management of the third stage of labour. If eligible for the trial, women are treated with either the study drug or a placebo in a double-blind fashion. Following administration of the study medication, if the placenta still remains undelivered after 15&#x02009;min, the treating clinician determines ongoing clinical management as per standard care.</p><p>The prespecified group sequential monitoring plan requires the Data Monitoring Committee to look at accumulating unblinded data on five occasions. The Data Monitoring Committee is using the results of these analyses to advise the Trial Steering Committee on adapting the trial design to either (1) stop prematurely for futility (no prospect of establishing a treatment effect of at least 10%) or (2) stop prematurely if proof beyond a reasonable doubt is established that there is a convincing treatment benefit of at least 10%. Assuming the trial recruits to its maximum size, we are aiming to recruit 1100 participants (maximum number randomised 1086, with the uplift to 1100 to account for a small allowance for withdrawal of consent or other rare loss to follow-up) over 42 months.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study population</title><sec id="s2b1"><title>Setting</title><p>We are recruiting women from delivery wards in UK maternity hospitals.

Recruitment is scheduled to conclude when 1100 subjects are recruited to the trial.</p><p>We initially followed the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology best practice recommendations for recruitment and obtaining consent for intrapartum research studies.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> These recommendations were based on the work by Vernon <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> who developed a consent pathway for women with retained placenta who were recruited to the RELEASE trial of umbilical vein oxytocin for RP.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> We refined this pathway in light of our qualitative research<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> so that the consent and recruitment pathways were tailored to the specific requirements of this trial. In brief, where possible, outline information about the trial (including researcher contact details) is made available to women antenatally, particularly those identified as being at high risk of retained placenta, for&#x000a0;example, maternal age&#x000a0;&#x0003e;30 years, preterm birth and stillbirth.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> More detailed information is available in antenatal clinics, on labour wards and the study website with information posters in the hospital reception areas and antenatal clinics. Following diagnosis of a retained placenta, a clinician or midwife who has received GOT-IT study training (which has sponsor-approved GCP-training embedded within it) invites women to participate in the trial, provides an explanation of the study and gives potential participants an abbreviated and/or full version of the patient information sheet.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Informed consent</title><p>The patient information leaflets explain that the trial is investigating whether sublingual GTN spray is useful for treating retained placenta. If a woman wishes to participate then written or verbal consent is obtained. If verbal consent is obtained, this is followed up by written consent as soon as possible in the postnatal period. Such an approach has been endorsed by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in recent guidance about obtaining consent in perinatal research where consent is time critical in which it is stated that &#x02018;[in acute circumstances]&#x02026;provision of antenatal information to women with brief oral consent at the time of the complication is appropriate. Full written consent is then obtained at a later stage&#x02019;.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Permission is sought to inform the woman&#x02019;s general practitioner that she is taking part in this trial. Due to the emergency nature of the condition (retained placenta), women are eligible to take part if they fulfil the inclusion criteria, understand what trial participation involves and give fully informed consent. A minimum time period is not feasible for trial consideration by potential participants. If a woman cannot give informed consent (eg, due to incapacity), she is not eligible for participation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Randomisation and allocation</title><p>The study drug is a metered dose sublingual spray containing 400&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/dose of GTN&#x000a0;and a matching placebo spray. The formulation consists of GTN, peppermint oil BP (88%), 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA) and ethanol BP (96%). The placebo is identical to the active product minus the GTN. Both the study drug and the matching placebo are manufactured by Pharmasol Limited and labelled by Sharp Clinical Services (UK) Limited.</p><p>Study drugs are kept on the delivery suite and are provided to site pharmacies in prepacked randomised permuted blocks. After consent of each participant, the investigator or trained clinical practitioner randomises eligible and consenting women to one of the two study groups by taking the next box off the shelf. After priming the pump and demonstrating its use, the clinician gives the study drug to the women to self-administer. The study is double-masked, so neither the participant, investigator nor trained clinical practitioner know which treatment has been allocated. The boxes are numbered and labelled so that the identity of the drug can be determined later. The number on the box is logged in the study database. Breaking of the study masking is only performed where knowledge of the treatment is absolutely necessary for safe management of the patient.</p><p>A central emergency unblinding interactive voice response system is operated by the Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials (ChaRT) in Aberdeen. Only senior clinicians can unblind trial participants. The name of the clinician requesting the unblinding, the reasons for it and notification of any unblinding is sent to the chief investigator via email. Reasons for unblinding are recorded in the participant&#x02019;s sources documents and in the Investigator Site Master File. Unless there is a clinical requirement, masking will not be broken until after all study data entry is complete, the validity of the data is checked, all queries resolved and the patient populations agreed.</p></sec><sec id="s2c4"><title>Administration of study intervention</title><p>Women who have a retained placenta after vaginal birth or miscarriage following failure of management of the third stage of labour (failure of active management defined as the third stage lasting more than 30 min and failure of physiological management defined as the third stage lasting more than 60 min, plus a further 30&#x02009;min of active management) are considered for eligibility for the trial.</p><p>Baseline observations (maternal blood pressure (mm&#x000a0;Hg) and heart rate (beats per minute)) are taken prior to study drug administration to confirm that the woman fulfils the haemodynamic inclusion criteria (heart rate&#x000a0;&#x02264;119&#x02009;bpm and systolic blood pressure &#x0003e;100&#x02009;mm Hg) for trial entry.</p><p>Following confirmation of eligibility, women self-administer two puffs of either GTN (800&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g) or placebo spray as a once-only, sublingual intervention via a pump spray. Maternal temperature and a blood sample to measure haemoglobin are measured at baseline. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure and temperature (<sup>o</sup>C) are recorded at 5 and 15&#x02009;min after administration of the study drug.</p><p>Sublingual GTN is maximally effective in causing uterine and cervical relaxation by 5&#x02009;min postadministration. Thus, if spontaneous delivery of the placenta is going to occur, we expect this to happen around 5&#x02009;min after drug administration. If spontaneous placental delivery has not occurred, a further attempt to deliver the placenta by controlled cord traction is made. If the placenta remains undelivered 15&#x02009;min after administration of the treatment we think that it is highly unlikely that it will deliver spontaneously thereafter&#x02014;we consider that any further delay risks haemorrhage. Thus, the decision that MROP is needed (primary clinical outcome) is made and the participant transferred to theatre for the definitive management of MROP as soon as possible. Additionally, if there are clinically significant side-effects (eg, haemorrhage, symptomatic maternal hypotension and/or tachycardia) before 15&#x02009;min have elapsed after GTN/placebo treatment, the participant is transferred to theatre for immediate MROP.</p></sec><sec id="s2c5"><title>Follow-Up procedures</title><p>On the first postnatal day, a haemoglobin sample is collected.

Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant are used to enquire about AE/SAE occurrence at discharge. The 6-week postnatal questionnaire also asks participants if they have seen their general practitioner, been admitted to hospital or been prescribed any medication. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event is recorded. AEs and SAEs are also identified via information from support departments, for example, laboratories.</p></sec><sec id="s2d3"><title>Recording AEs and SAEs</title><p>When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the principal investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital notes, laboratory and diagnostic reports) related to the event.

The primary safety outcome (measured blood loss between administration treatment and transfer to the postnatal ward/other clinical area) is recorded immediately prior to transfer from theatre to the postnatal ward or other clinical area (eg, labour ward high dependency). The primary patient satisfaction outcome is collected at 6&#x02009;weeks by a self-completed satisfaction questionnaire and the primary economic outcome will be computed from costs incurred at initial management of retained placenta and management of further complications and self-reported health service usage and side-effects recorded from the postnatal patient questionnaires.</p><p>Outcome data are collected on an electronic case report form and paper-based questionnaires by research midwives and nurses who have been specifically trained in data collection for the trial. The electronic case record form comprises the following sections: baseline data, clinical observations and placenta delivery, first post natal day, discharge, 6-week postnatal check, safety events, discharge and follow-up questionnaires. Health service use in the 6&#x02009;weeks following discharge is collected via a small number of resource use questions included in the postnatal questionnaires. Resource use will be evaluated using routine sources of nationally relevant unit costs. Women are permitted to receive all standard care medical treatments for postpartum complications including any given for medical management of retained placenta. Concomitant medications are recorded from 24&#x02009;hours prior to signing of the consent forms until 24&#x02009;hours after administration of the study drug. Analgesic or antibiotic medications are recorded from 24&#x02009;hours prior to signing of informed consent until 6&#x02009;weeks after administration of study drug.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Sample size, proposed recruitment rate and milestones</title><sec id="s2g1"><title>Sample size</title><p>The trial uses a group sequential design as opposed to a fixed sample design to allow for the uncertainty of two critical factors. First, there is considerable uncertainty about how many women who are eligible for the trial will actually go on and require surgery due to (1) lack of knowledge of the frequency of spontaneous delivery of the placenta beyond the time frame that GTN is known to have a pharmacological effect and (2) the effect of variations in local clinical practice in relation to organising MROPs. Second, the magnitude of the benefit from GTN spray is unknown. To properly reflect these uncertainties, we are using a group sequential design. This design maximises our chances of efficiently detecting and estimating the true benefit of treatment in the quickest time with the right number of participants and gives us the opportunity to abandon the trial if it turns out that no worthwhile treatment effect exists (via futility analyses).</p><p>In discussion with clinicians and women, a minimally clinically important difference of an absolute reduction of 10% in the need for MROP would need to be observed in order to accommodate this intervention (sublingual GTN) in clinical practice. Given that the maximum variability in a binary outcome (yes or no) occurs at a 50% rate in the placebo spray arm, a fixed sample approach would need 1038 women (519 in each group) to demonstrate a 10% change from 50% on placebo to 40% on GTN spray. As the outcome (surgery occurred&#x02014;yes or no) takes place 15&#x02009;min after the intervention has been administered, there will be minimal loss to follow-up and, therefore, no requirement for a trial much larger than this. Using a group sequential design incorporating a Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with O&#x02019;Brien-Fleming boundaries, our trial has a maximum sample size of 1086 (with a small inflation to 1100 to allow for withdrawal of consent of other rare loss to follow-up). This allows for five planned interim evaluations by the Data Monitoring Committee of accruing data at 218, 436, 652 and 870 participants with a final look (if the trial proceeds to full size) at 1086 women.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Analyses plan</title><sec id="s2h1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The statistical analyses will be according to the intention-to-treat principle and will be governed by a statistical analysis plan which will govern all statistical aspects of the study, including the statistical methods for the analysis of all the outcomes, approaches to missing data and sensitivity type analyses to investigate the robustness of any findings reported. The statistical analysis plan will be finalised (including the decision to undertake prespecified subgroup analyses or not) prior to the data being locked for final analysis. The interim analyses will be specified within the Data Monitoring Committee Charter and the result of the interim analyses will be in strict confidence and unknown to the trial research group apart from the study statistician. The primary outcomes, clinical (MROP), safety (blood loss), patient satisfaction and economic (NHS costs), will be analysed using generalised linear models appropriate to the distribution of each outcome. These models will adjust for relevant baseline factors, and sensitivity analyses will assess the robustness of the findings to any missing data (which is expected to be very low as the primary outcome is measured within minutes of receiving the intervention). The interim analysis will be performed in East<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and all remaining analysis will be done in Stata.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Significance will be defined as p&#x0003c;0.05. In the event prespecified formal subgroup analyses of the primary outcome are undertaken, we will formally assess subgroup(s) by fitting a subgroup * randomised group interaction term and these interactions will be assessed against a stricter level of significance of p&#x0003c;0.01&#x02009;to guard against chance findings.</p></sec><sec id="s2h2"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>While the cost of GTN is low, there will still be costs associated with its administration and the monitoring and management of women thereafter. Should the intervention prove effective, it will be important in the context of scarce maternity resources to explicitly quantify the net costs (or cost savings) associated with its use. We have therefore made provision to carry out a simple cost analysis using clinical and resource use data, which is being collected for individual participants recruited to the trial. This analysis will explicitly quantify the difference in mean costs between the active intervention and placebo arm. Research costs associated with placebo delivery will be factored out of the analysis to estimate the incremental cost (or cost savings) of the active intervention versus standard practice.</p><p>Resource use associated with the alternative management strategies will be estimated from the time of randomisation through to 6&#x02009;weeks postpartum. This will include: (1) staff time for administering the drug to patients; (2) resource use associated with any complications arising following administration of the study drug (eg, blood pressure and/or heart rate monitoring); (3) subsequent costs associated with delivery of the placenta (either spontaneously or operatively) and (4) subsequent health service contact relating to retained products of conception up to 6&#x02009;weeks postdischarge. Resource use collected for individual participants will be valued using accepted national unit costs for drugs, staff time, MROP and subsequent healthcare contacts.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;28</xref> The total cost of care for each participant will be calculated for each individual.</p><p>The mean costs will be summarised by treatment allocation group, and the incremental cost (or cost saving) associated with the use of GTN will be estimated using an appropriately specified general linear model. The cost data will be presented alongside the primary and secondary outcome data in a cost-consequence balance sheet, indicating which strategy each outcome favours.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
