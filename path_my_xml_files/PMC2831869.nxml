They mainly occur in elderly people due to osteoporosis. Their incidence will probably continue to increase in the near future because of population aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The goal of treatment is fracture reduction and stable osteosynthesis to allow immediate mobilization. For many years, the sliding hip screw and plate had been the gold standard in treating pertrochanteric fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Nowadays, there is an increasing interest in intramedullary nailing, especially for the unstable pertrochanteric fractures. There are several studies comparing intramedullary hip screw (IMHS, Smith &#x00026; Nephew) to other intramedullary devices or sliding hip screw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. No data are available in the literature about the ENDOVIS (Citieffe) nail. No study has prospectively compared the IMHS to the ENDOVIS nail, specifically in the unstable fracture patterns.</p><p>This is a prospective randomized study in order to compare the clinical results of these two intramedullary devices, which have different design characteristics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>Between July 2005 and June 2007, 261 consecutive patients who sustained a pertrochanteric fracture were operated. Inclusion criteria for the study were patients over 60 years old with a pertrochanteric fracture after a fall that was considered low energy injury. Forty six patients with pathologic fractures, or a high energy injury and patients under 60 years old were excluded. In 110 patients it was used the IMHS and in 105 the ENDOVIS nail. The patients were randomly dispersed to one of the two treatment options by the use of sealed envelopes containing cards, indicating the treatment for each patient.</p><p>In the IMHS treatment group, 34 were men and 76 women. In the ENDOVIS group there were 33 men and 72 women. The mean age was 83.5 years (range 69-95 years) in the IMHS group and 83.9 years (range 71-96 years) in the ENDOVIS group.</p><p>Fracture stability was assessed according to the Evan's classification as modified by Jensen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

The nail is used with a standard AMBI/CLASSIC lag screw, compression screw and 4.5 mm locking screws. A sleeve, which is held by a set screw, passes through the nail and over the lag screw. The sleeve helps prevent rotation, while allowing the lag screw to slide. Standard IMHS is available in two angles (130-135 degrees), in four distal diameters (10, 12, 14, 16 mm) with a proximal diameter of 17.5 mm. Its length is 21 cm.</p><p>ENDOVIS is made of titanium alloy with a cervico-diaphyseal angle 130 degrees, a metaphyseal angle 5 degrees and total length 195 mm. The diameter proximally is 13 mm and distally 10 mm. There are two holes for cephalic screw insertion and one for the distal screw. The cephalic screws are available in nine length sizes, 7.5 mm diameter, self-drilling and self-taping. The distal screw is available in four sizes, 5 mm diameter, self-drilling and self-taping. The distal tip of the nail has a diapason section.</p><p>Operations were performed on a fracture table under spinal anesthesia and image intensifier control. After closed reduction of the fracture, a longitudinal incision started proximal to the greater trochanter apex and extended proximally about 4-10 cm, depending on the size or obesity of each patient. After splitting the aponeurosis, the entry point was made just on the tip of the greater trochanter. The nail was inserted into the femur diaphysis without reaming. Our goal was to insert the hip screw under the midline of the femoral neck, advancing the tip of the screw close to the subarticular surface of the femoral head. Tip to Apex Distance (TAD) was measured from the tip of the guide wire. When TAD value was less than 25 mm, we proceeded to reaming and insertion of the cephalic screw. Fluoroscopic control was performed to ensure that joint line was not penetrated after screw placement. Distal locking was made preferably with 2 screws.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data were recorded and statistically analyzed.

Many authors consider the sliding hip screw with a plate the best choice, extenuating its favorable results, the low rate of hardware failure and non-union. A recent metaanalysis compared the sliding screw and plate with intramedullary nails (IMN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Total fixation failure rate was higher in the IMN group, without reaching statistical significance. However, intramedullary nails gain a continuous popularity for both stable and unstable fractures, due to certain theoretical advantages and ease surgical technique. Additionally, the small incisions result in less blood loss intraoperatively. A variety of intramedullary devices have been used with different design characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, the adequacy and stability of fixation plays an important role, determing the success of the surgical treatment of pertrochanteric fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The right position of the lag screw near the centre of the femoral head and neck, in both anteroposterior and lateral views, is critical and has been emphasized by many authors. Baumgartner et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] indicated the significance of tip-apex distance value in the placement of the proximal lag screw and Den Hartog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] showed that this optimal position prevents the rotation of the femoral head and neck during the lag screw insertion. In our series, although initial drill guides were placed in an optimal position according to intra-operative TAD value measurements, the appropriate position of the cephalic screw was better achieved with IMHS nail (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Probably this is attributed to the cannulated screw design. In contrast, the compact form of ENDOVIS cephalic screws resulted in a significant number of screw malposition associated with increased cases with screw cut-out. When we compared the failure rate (in each treatment group) with the fracture stability (stable vs. unstable), no association with type of fracture was detected.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Comminuted unstable pertrochanteric fracture treated with ENDOVIS nail</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1749-799X-5-9-3"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Fracture alignment, with restoration of cervical-diaphyseal angle and anteversion is achieved by closed means</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1749-799X-5-9-4"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Guide wire, for screw reaming, is inserted just bellow midline in AP, close to the articular surface</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1749-799X-5-9-5"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Guide wire, for screw reaming, is inserted in the midline in lateral view, close to the articular surface</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1749-799X-5-9-6"/></fig><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>At final x-rays, the 2 proximal screws were inserted slightly convergent and retroverted</bold>.

These factors allow direct contact between the fracture fragments; promote healing, decrease the moment arm and the stresses on the implant. Compression at the fracture interface can be done intra-operatively by tightening the compression screw, adding stability to the bone-hardware construct. ENDOVIS doesn't provide the ability for intra-operative compression. Compression occurs during the healing process, under fracture loading. However, this phenomenon was not controlled and cephalic screws back-out or joint penetration was noticed in 8 cases, although initial screw placement in the femoral head was considered optimal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). In contrast no such complication was noticed in the IMHS group.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Pertrochanteric fracture treated with ENDOVIS nail</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1749-799X-5-9-8"/></fig><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Impaction of the fracture during weight bearing resulted in screw joint penetration three months postoperatively</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1749-799X-5-9-9"/></fig><p>The frequency of Z-effect and reverse Z-effect is not negligible and it has been reported by several orthopaedic surgeons using trochanteric intramedullary rods which possess two proximal lag screws [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In our series the use of ENDOVIS nail stressed these complications and resulted in an increased number of revisions. In contrast, the single femoral head screw of IMHS eliminates these complications and moreover provides an ease and safe solution, particularly in narrow femoral necks, where the positioning of two cephalic lag screws is not always feasible.</p><p>Lindsey and Rosson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] have pointed out the difficulty for secure placement of the distal locking screws. Any error may result in the drilling of unnecessary holes and creates an additional stress riser that influences the bone mechanical properties. Lacroix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] stated that distal screws should be used only when the fractures requires an extra stability. In our series failure of ENDOVIS distal locking had the result of an increased number of femoral shortening and rotational instability. The great number of distal screws misplacement is probably due to ENDOVIS small diameter. These features caused an eccentric position of the nail, mainly in wide medullary canals and directed the tip of the drill out of the distal hole. On the other side, IMHS has a more compact form and provides more diameter options. Thus, not only secures the femoral distal locking but also retains the fracture's rotational stability even if the distal locking fails.</p><p>A femoral shaft fracture during intramedullary nailing or postoperatively is a common complication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In this study there was such a fracture only with the use of IMHS nail. Regarding the size of the nail, we commonly used 10 mm diameter nails. In cases with much widened diaphyses secondary to senile osteoporosis (as was the vast majority of our patient, mean age &#x0003e;80 years old), we easily inserted unreamed nails with a 10 mm or larger diameter. This explains why we had only one intra-op diaphyseal fracture in the IMHS group, in a patient with a narrow medullary canal.</p><p>The ambulatory status after an operation for an pertrochanteric fracture depends on different factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Specific parameters such as the patients' preoperative walking capability, their medical condition and comorbidities were similar to both groups. The overall walking competence in patients treated with IMHS was superior to ENDOVIS group which was statistically significant. The favorable results of IMHS group are probably explained by design differences. It seems that IMHS allows for a more accurate nail placement, secure and stable fixation with lesser complications and failures. Subsequently this is reflected to the greater walking independence of the patients and their advanced rehabilitation.</p><p>Devices combining the general principles of the sliding hip screw with an intramedullary nail constitute a safe and accurate mode of fixation for pertrochanteric fractures. Certainly, further investigations are necessary in order to prove the ideal treatment method for these fractures. However, this study indicates the IMHS device as suitable for the treatment of stable pertrochanteric fractures, those with reverse obliquity, comminuted fractures and those with a subtrochanteric extension. The features of the implant and the instrumentation for screws and nail insertion, allows for accurate and ease fracture fixation with a low rate of complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KM carried out the data collection, participated in the design of the study and drafted the manuscript.
