An estimated 40,000 legs are amputated each year in India, of which 75% are because of neuropathy and secondary infection and these are potentially preventable.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In terms of expenditure, patients without diabetic foot problem spent 9.3%, whereas patients with foot problem spent 32.3% of their total income on their treatment.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] This underscores the importance of prevention of diabetic foot.</p><p>In a previous study,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] from our institute, a tertiary care hospital in India, it was found that 33% of diabetes patients attending our outpatient department (OPD) had loss of protective sensations, 19% had peripheral vascular disease, and 10% had both. More alarmingly, 95% had never received foot care advice. In another study,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] the average knowledge about diabetic foot care of our patients was poor.</p><p>It is reported that consultation time given by the treating doctors to their patients with diabetes was &#x0003c;5 min in nearly 50% of cases, and foot care education to prevent complications was least emphasized by doctors.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] This could be attributed to high patient load and lack of time and resources. On the other hand, simple foot care education measures have been shown to reduce foot problems such as corns and callosities and promote healing of foot ulcer.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Above studies[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] highlight the importance of delivering foot education in patients with diabetes in our setup which can fit into present health-care delivery system. This prompted us to develop a patient education module on diabetes foot care and to assess the effectiveness of this module on foot care knowledge and practice in patients with diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>Adult patients (&#x0003e;18 years age) with the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 attending endocrinology OPD, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, from July 2015 to December 2016, ready for follow-up at 1 and 3 months, were included in this study. Diabetes was diagnosed according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2014 criteria.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Patients with history of previous or present foot ulcer, cognitive, and visual or hearing impairment were excluded from the study. Participants were recruited after obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee and informed consent from participants.</p><p>Based on previous study,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] the average knowledge score of diabetic foot care is likely to be 5 &#x000b1; 3 out of a total score 14 among patients with diabetes. After intervention of 3 months, expecting this knowledge score improves to 8 &#x000b1; 3.5 among cases, while in controls, it improves to 6 &#x000b1; 3.5, we required 50 subjects in each group to detect a significant difference in the knowledge scores at 3 months postrandomization in two-sided Student's <italic>t</italic>-test with 5% alpha error and 80% power. After giving an allowance of 20% loss to follow-up, we needed to randomize 125 patients into two groups.</p><p>Patients were divided into intervention and control groups using block randomization. The size of the blocks was variable from 2 to 8. The sequence of random number generated was transferred to a sealed opaque envelops for the implementation of randomization. At baseline, both intervention and control groups were given a questionnaire to fill up. Then, both groups received routine care which consisted of education regarding glycemic control, dietary advice, exercise, medications, and foot care provided by the health-care personnel in the OPD. In addition, the intervention group was shown a short audio-visual display and given a pamphlet on diabetic foot care. After 1 month, both groups once again filled up the questionnaire following which they received routine care. In addition, the intervention group was again shown the audio-visual display. At 3 months, both groups filled up the questionnaire for the third time [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consort diagram of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJEM-22-74-g001"/></fig><p>The questionnaire had two parts: the first part had 14 questions on knowledge, yes/no type &#x02013; each right answer scored one and wrong response scored zero; the second part had five questions on practice &#x02013; the best answer scored two, the wrong one zero, and for other response score was one.

One[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] of them showed reduction in incidence of foot ulcer (risk ratio 0.31, 95% Confidence interval 0.14&#x02013;0.66) Over 1-year follow-up and rest of the studies did not demonstrate any benefit.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] They concluded that the knowledge and foot care score were positively influenced in short term by patient education, but evidence for clinically significant reductions in diabetic foot ulcer and amputation incidence by patient education was insufficient. Another recent systematic review on 30 controlled (of which 19 rct) and 44 uncontrolled studies on prevention of first and recurrent plantar foot ulcers found no benefit of a single session of patient education but some evidence of benefit of integrated foot care (i.e., A combination of professional foot treatment, therapeutic footwear, and patient education).[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The strength of our study is that our patient education module is easily replicable and does not need much investment. It can be implemented in routine care outpatient setting in Indian context. However, we could not follow these patients on long-term basis to note the impact of improvement in knowledge and practice on development of foot ulcer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>To have persistent change in foot care behavior, the patients need reinforcement on regular basis. Audio-visual aids on diabetic foot education shown on a routine basis in OPD waiting hours is an effective way to achieve this. Our study clearly demonstrates significant improvement in diabetic foot knowledge and foot care behavior in the patients who received foot care education through audio-visual aid. Regular reinforcement of foot care education through audio-visual aid in OPD waiting hours is a good option.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec
