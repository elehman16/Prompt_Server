muscle strength, swiftness, agility, speed, flexibility, and physical balance. Although
plyometric training and weight training are implemented as representative training methods
for improving swiftness and agility, most studies of it have been conducted with players
of other sports. [Subjects] The study subjects were 10 throwing event athletes attending K
physical education high school. The subjects were randomly assigned to a control group of
five subjects and an experimental group of five subjects. To analyze the body composition,
an Inbody 3.0 instrument (Biospace, Korea) was used as experimental equipment to measure
heights, weight, body fat percentages, and muscle masses and a Biodex system 4.0 (BIODEX,
USA) was used to measure isokinetic muscle-joint and lumbar muscle strengths. The
plyometric training consisted of 15 techniques out of the training methods introduced in
the &#x02018;Power up plyometric training&#x02019;. The plyometric program was implemented without any
training load three times per week during daybreak exercises for the experimental group.
The number of times and the number of sets were changed over time as follows: three sets
of 10 times in the 1st &#x02212;4th weeks, three sets of 15 times in the 5th&#x02013;8th weeks, and five
sets of 15 times in the 9th&#x02212;12th weeks. [Results] According to the ANCOVA results of
lumbar extensor muscle strength at 60&#x000b0;/sec, the overall reliability of the model was
significant. According to the ANCOVA results of lumbar flexor muscle strength at 60&#x000b0;/sec,
the overall reliability of the model was significant. [Conclusion] Plyometric training
positively affected high school throwing event athletes. To summarize the study findings,
the application of plyometric training with high intensity and loads improved the results
of athletes who perform highly intensive exercises at normal times.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Plyometric</kwd><kwd>Lumbar extensor</kwd><kwd>Throwing athletic</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The purpose of all sports training is the maximization of the physical and mental elements
required to perform exercises or play games. Therefore, the application of specialized and
specific training suitable for sports is important. In particular, the acquisition of
maximum muscle strength and power is an essential element of all sports. Plyometric training
is widely used as a method of developing explosive power capacity in those sports that
require jumping ability such as athletics, basketball, and volleyball<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Most sports require various kinds of fast and slow muscle strength and speed<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although typical training methods for
increasing the muscle strength of athletes include weight training, such as resistance
exercises and plyometric training<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, the
power necessary for explosive jumping refers to the power exhibited in dynamic states<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Plyometric training is a type of muscle strength exercise that can improve basic physical
strength and it has been extensively studied for the improvement of exercise performance
ability. It is an explosive and repetitive rebounding load type exercise that uses the
muscles&#x02019; stretch reflexes and stretch-shortening cycles to develop lower extremity
muscles<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stretch reflexes are used to promote motor unit mobilization in
order to reduce differences between speeds and muscle strength<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In athletics, diverse efforts have been made to try and enhance records through active
studies and the development of training methods. With increasing interest in athletics, the
importance of athletics scientification has been recognized. Desired records in athletics
cannot be achieved only with natural movements and efforts, but also require more reasonable
and scientific training content and methods<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The physical strength elements required for athletic throwing
events include muscle strength, swiftness, agility, speed, flexibility, and physical
balance. Although plyometric training and weight training are implemented as representative
training methods for improving swiftness and agility, most studies of it have been conducted
with players of other sports.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to identify the effects of lower extremity
plyometric training for 12 weeks, performed by high school throwing event athletes, on
isokinetic lower extremity muscle strength and lumbar muscle strength in order to develop
more efficient training methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study subjects were 10 throwing event athletes attending K physical education high
school. The subjects were randomly assigned to a control group of five subjects and an
experimental group of five subjects. The experimental group performed 12 weeks of lower
extremity plyometric training in addition to general physical strength training programs
implemented during school hours. The control group performed training other than lower

The plyometric program was implemented without any training load three times
per week during daybreak exercises performed by the experimental group. The number of times
and the number of sets were changed over time as follows: three sets of 10 times in the
1st&#x02212;4th weeks, three sets of 15 times in the 5th&#x02212;8th weeks, and five sets of 15 times in the
9th&#x02212;12th weeks.</p><p>To measure kinetic lumbar muscle strength, a Biodex System 4.0 was used to measure average
power. When stabilized after warm-up exercises, the subject&#x02019;s body regions other than the
lumbar region were fixed using adjustable pads so that they would not be subject to external
force during extension and flexion movements. The lower extremities and the chest were fixed
using straps to restrict the actions of the other muscles. The rotation axis of the joint
being tested was aligned with the rotation axis of the dynamometer, and the subjects were
encouraged to exert maximum efforts. The average power of flexion and extension was
calculated from the values of 4 repeated measurements of lumbar extension and flexion at
60&#x000b0;/sec.</p><p>The data obtained were processed using the SAS ver 9.12 statistics program. The means and
standard deviations of the two groups were calculated. To examine differences between the
groups and between measurement time points, the results of the prior test were set as
covariates and analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were conducted. Post hoc tests of differences
between the groups were conducted using the least squares mean (LSM) method only when the
assumption that the gradients of regression lines were statistically the same within the
groups was established, and improvement rate independent t-tests were conducted to examine
differences in records between athletes of different items. The statistical significant

or there was a problem in motor control. Gresswell and colleagues<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that functional activities caused changes in
intra-abdominal pressure and that the TrA was activated before the Erector Spinae Muscle was
activated when loads were imposed on the spine.</p><p>Maffiuletti et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that four
weeks of plyometric training performed by 10 female volleyball players improved lower
extremity muscle strength by 20%. Although most studies of plyometric training examined the
degree of improvement of lower extremity muscle strength, the present study revealed good
results from an examination of lumbar flexor/extensor muscle strength. We consider that the
increase in core muscle strength improved the athletes&#x02019; motor abilities.</p><p>Plyometric training positively affected the performance of high school throwing event
athletes. To summarize the study findings, the application of plyometric training with high
intensity and loads improved the performance of athletes who perform highly intensive
exercises at normal times.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>HY</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Effects of plyometric training on ankle joint motion and
