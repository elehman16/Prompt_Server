In addition, noisy or brightly-lit environments may restrict the practical utility of both modalities. Therefore, it is important to study the effect of proprioceptive cue modalities consisting of miniature hidden vibrating devices that apply rhythmic vibrations to the skin synchronized with the step. These stimuli are synchronously applied with the steps while walking on a treadmill, which imitates the real life situations and provide an additional proprioceptive cueing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] This study examined the influence of paired proprioceptive cues on gait parameters of individuals with PD. The hypothesis was that enhanced proprioceptive stimuli (vibratory stimuli and treadmill) may improve spatio-temporal parameters of gait and lower limb angular excursion and consequently increase the quality of life of patients with PD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>Thirty levodopa-dependent PD patients (9 females, 21 males), with ages ranging from 49 to 70 years (62.5 &#x000b1; 6.1 years), represented the sample of the study. The participants were recruited from the Department of Neurology at the Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt. The patients were randomly assigned into 2 equal groups (G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub>). With their eyes closed, subjects were randomized by self-selecting a card corresponding to one of the 2 groups. Subjects and examiner were blinded during randomization, except for a nurse who prepared the groups cards. All the patients were subjected to clinical neurological examination, which included a review of medical history, mentation (using Mini Mental State Examination), a motor examination, and assessment of activities of daily living using the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), by a well-trained neurologist [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The individuals who were able to walk independently for 6 minutes on the treadmill (Enraf-Nonius B.V. Germany) without interruption, suffered from mild to moderate disability according to UPDRS ADL/motor scores with duration of illness ranging from 3 to 5 years with interest in participating, and ability to give their informed consent participated in this study. Patients with any of the following criteria were excluded from the study: Any other neuro-musculoskeletal disorder, which could potentially cause gait disorders;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] epilepsy; mental and cognitive impairment; marked rigidity (more than 3 according to the rigidity UPDRS subscale; poor visuo-spatial abilities; dyskinesias; anorexia; uncontrolled blood pressure, or cardiovascular disorders.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] For all participating subjects, all PD medications were kept stable during the course of the study and assessment, and treatment were done in &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; stage of medications. This study was approved by the research review boards of the Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Reporting trials diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AIAN-15-267-g001"/></fig><p>Qualysis ProReflex motion capture (Qualysis Medical AB, Sweden) system in the motion analysis laboratory of the Faculty of Physical therapy Cairo University, Egypt was used for gait analysis of all participants after completion of the physiotherapeutic programs. The patients in the control group (G<sub>2</sub>) were treated with an individually designed physiotherapy program of mild intensity exercises conducted by a neuro-physiotherapist. This low-intensity exercise program consisted of: Passive prolonged stretch; balance training and weight shifting exercises; and graduated active exercises for the axial muscles to maintain/increase the muscle strength. The functional training included: Standing up and sitting down; turning around using a large arc of movement, or using full body movements, the &#x0201c;clock turn strategy;&#x0201d; traditional gait training including instructions to walk with long steps, even stride length and swinging the arms. The patients were instructed to walk at least 2 times a week for 30 min; focus on maintaining long strides and adequate ground clearance, maintain upright posture by consciously attending to standing upright, checking posture in a mirror and reinforce physiotherapy strategies in the home and community. Participants attended 45minutes sessions 3 times per week for 8 weeks.</p><p>The participants in the study group (G<sub>1</sub>) received proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation techniques and vibratory stimuli during walking on the treadmill in addition to the same designed physiotherapy program as G<sub>2</sub>. The vibratory devices (VDs) (OPTEC Co. Ltd., Japan) were inserted into the patients&#x02019; shoes and were activated in the push off-phase of the gait. The VDs deliver supra-threshold stimulation through 1 little toe sensor, which stimulates 3 VDs below the heel and forefoot without delay. The patients were asked to pay attention to the vibratory stimuli which are activate when the foot is in the swing phase. The time of gait training on the treadmill started at 6 minutes followed by 5 minutes rest. The walking speed was selected according to the ability of each patient, and then its progression is self-selected by each subject. The treadmill walking time was increased gradually from 6 to 25 minutes at the end of the program. Participants in G<sub>1</sub> attended 51-70 minutes sessions, 3 times per week for 8 weeks, including the low and moderate intensity exercise programs.</p><p>An International Business Machines (IBM) compatible PC was used to store and analyze the 3D data. The data were imported to Q-gait software for analysis. The kinematic parameters of gait, including cadence and stride length, were calculated. Hip/ knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion angles during different gait sub-phases were also measured. The walking distance and speed were recorded by the treadmill before treatment for both groups and at the end of the treatment programs.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The Social Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) was used to analyze the data. Descriptive statistics such as means, standard deviations as well as percentages were used to describe the participants. Statistical measures of the mean scores and standard deviation were calculated for the baseline and post-intervention for each participant. The simple t test was used to compare the means of the cadence, stride length, walking distance, and speed measured in G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub>. It was also used to compare the pre/post measures of the hip, knee, and ankle angular excursion. The between-group comparison was also performed using the same test.

This agrees with the research outcomes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] that attribute this to the efficacy of exercises in increasing the availability of dopamine in the striatum and protecting neurons from further neuronal degeneration by activating endogenous antioxidant systems in the brain. Exercise also reduces the behavioral impairments elicited by the dopaminergic neurotoxins and the loss of dopamine neurons. This is also in a close agreement with Tajiri <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] and Al-Jarrah <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] who showed in histological studies that potentiated proprioceptive feedback-induced alterations in both dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission.</p><p>The results of the current study confirm our hypothesis that application of vibratory stimuli during treadmill training has a positive effect on the angular excursion and spatiotemporal parameters of gait. The improvements in G<sub>1</sub> were better than those in G<sub>2</sub>.This can be attributed to the effect of using external somatosensory cues. These cues trigger conscious control mechanisms and attention strategies and reduce automatic control during walking. The automatic control of movement involves the supplementary motor area (SMA), which receives its major input from the BG. In PD patients, the conscious control of walking bypasses the inefficient SMA and activates the dorsolateral premotor control system. This system receives its major input from the sensory cortical area. This agrees with previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] We attribute the potent effect of external stimuli on the gait pattern of PD patients to the efficacy of attention in generating cortical plasticity in the primary somatosensory and motor cortex, and improvement in the motor memory. Holschneider <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] stated that long-term exercise training elicits plastic changes in the brain. Such changes would result in a combination of increases in the efficiency of neural processing (sensorimotor cortex, striatum, vermis) and enforcement of the cerebellar-cortical circuit.</p><p>The improvement in the PD gait parameters in the present study can also be ascribed to the potent effect of external cues on activating an alternate pathway involving the cerebellum, sensorimotor cortex, and lateral premotor cortex.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] In this pathway, the cerebellum is responsible for movement timing, and the premotor cortex may be responsible for scaling the motor activity when facilitated by somatosensory cues related to the task (walking). This means that the recruitment of these structures can compensate for an inefficient BG in PD.</p><p>Lewis <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] ascribed the improvement in PD patients&#x02019; pattern of gait in response to somatosensory cues to the dominancy of the cerebellar-cortical pathways. In the normal condition, externally generated tasks are mainly processed through cerebellar-cortical circuitry, with minimal recruitment of the BG-cortical circuitry. Internally generated tasks are mainly encoded in the BG-cortical pathway, with minimal recruitment of cerebellar-cortical circuitry. In PD patients, externally generated tasks are also processed primarily via the cerebellar-cortical pathway with an enhanced activity in the cerebellum and lateral premotor cortex areas. Internally generated tasks in PD patients neither adequately activate the BG-cortical pathway nor recruit the cerebellar-cortical pathway. These results contradict Yogev <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] who reported that external cues support a more automatic form of motor control. This inconsistency may result from the use of dual tasks in the study of Yogev <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] These dual tasks may disturb the patient's attention to and focus on walking, which elicit the automatic control of walking.</p><p>The results of the present study can be ascribed to the facilitation of the frontal-lobe cognitive strategies (working memory) by externally cueing the sequential movement (gait). This agrees with Campos-Sousa <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] and Wegen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] The frontal lobe areas can select a motor program in response to an external stimulus, and send it to the primary motor cortex, which is responsible for the execution of sequential movements. External cues also contribute to sensorimotor integration that requires organizing and processing of proprioceptive inputs in working memory.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] This explanation contradicts Yogev <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] who stated that intrinsic regulation of sequential movements by the BG cannot be adequately compensated by the parkinsonian nervous system. Holschneider <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] using brain imaging, showed that there are increases in perfusion in the prefrontal cortex, deep cerebellar nuclei, thalamus, and hippocampus, which compensate for a functionally disrupted BG, which support our findings.</p><p>The improvement in the gait pattern of PD patients can be attributed to stretch of the hip flexors and ankle plantar flexor muscles by the moving treadmill running-belt.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] This stretch increases the gait-related unconscious proprioceptive impulses from these muscles. Augmentation of the sensory inputs stimulates the gait central pattern generator. The hip joint flexion and ankle joint plantar flexion at the end of the stance phase are facilitated by increased efferent impulses. It has also been reported that treadmill walking facilitates many forms of proprioceptive information.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>] It rhythmically stimulates pressure load receptors of the feet, muscle spindles, and Golgi tendon organs. Vestibular input from the vestibular system and input from neck muscle proprioceptors are activated during treadmill training. These rhythmic inputs are transferred to neuronal circuits and increase the strength of inputs converging on pyramidal tract neurons.</p><p>The results of the current study show that vibration has a positive effect on the angular displacement of the lower limb joints during walking. This can be attributed to enhancement of cortico-spinal excitability and increased tonic activities in the foot muscles in response to vibration applied to PD patients. This result agrees with Ivanenko <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>] and Thompson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>] who reported that increased tonic activities in the muscles can induce a tonic vibration reflex within the triceps surae muscle group. It is also in agreement with Bogaerts <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>] who proved that vibration is associated with an extensive sensory stimulation and that efficient use of the proprioceptive feedback loop could modify the cortico-spinal output and muscles activities.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Limitations</title><p>An important limitation of this study was the small sample size. Nevertheless, we were able to the show benefits of using paired proprioceptive cues on the gait pattern of the participants of PD. This trend of changes we observed warrants further study with a larger sample size to enable a more discerning statistical analysis. Studying sensorimotor area excitability after the application of external cues is needed to reveal the central effect of such stimuli and the role of central sensorimotor integration on the gait impairment in individuals with PD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Potentiated proprioceptive feedback improves parkinsonian gait kinematics and the angular excursion of lower limb joints. The vibrating devises can be easily implanted within the patient's shoes to be used all over the day as a reminder for proper gait pattern.
