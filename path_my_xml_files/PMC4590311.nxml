Although clinical guidelines treating PPH are available, their implementation remains a great challenge in resource poor settings. A better understanding of the factors associated with PPH maternal mortality is critical for preventing risk of hospital-based maternal death. The purpose of this study was thus to assess which factors contribute to maternal death occurring during PPH. The factors were as follows: women&#x02019;s characteristics, aspects of pregnancy and delivery; components of PPH management; and organizational characteristics of the referral hospitals in Senegal and Mali.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A cross-sectional survey nested in a cluster randomized trial (QUARITE trial) was carried out in 46 referral hospitals during the pre-intervention period from October 2007 to September 2008 in Senegal and Mali. Individual and hospital characteristics data were collected through standardized questionnaires. A multivariable logistic mixed model was used to identify the factors that were significantly associated with PPH maternal death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Among the 3,278 women who experienced PPH, 178 (5.4&#x000a0;%) of them died before hospital discharge. The factors that were significantly associated with PPH maternal mortality were: age over 35&#x000a0;years (adjusted OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.16 [1.26&#x02013;3.72]), living in Mali (adjusted OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.84 [1.13&#x02013;3.00]), residing outside the region location of the hospital (adjusted OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.43 [1.29&#x02013;4.56]), pre-existing chronic disease before pregnancy (adjusted OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.54 [2.54&#x02013;22.44]), prepartum severe anemia (adjusted OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.65 [3.77&#x02013;11.74]), forceps or vacuum delivery (adjusted OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.63 [1.19&#x02013;5.81]), birth weight greater than 4000 grs (adjusted OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.54 [1.26&#x02013;5.10]), transfusion (adjusted OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.17 [1.53&#x02013;3.09]), transfer to another hospital (adjusted OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;13.35 [6.20&#x02013;28.76]). There was a smaller risk of PPH maternal death in hospitals with gynecologist-obstetrician (adjusted OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.55 [0.35&#x02013;0.89]) than those with only a general practitioner trained in emergency obstetric care (EmOC).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings may have direct implications for preventing PPH maternal death in resource poor settings. In particular, we suggest anemia should be diagnosed and treated before delivery and inter-hospital transfer of women should be improved, as well as the management of blood banks for a quicker access to transfusion. Finally, an extent training of general practitioners in EmOC would contribute to the decrease of PPH maternal mortality.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Postpartum hemorrhage</kwd><kwd>maternal mortality</kwd><kwd>Sub-Saharan Africa</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Maternal mortality remains a major health problem worldwide, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where more than 50&#x000a0;% of maternal deaths occurred and where the lifetime risk of maternal death is 10 times higher than that in high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Obstetric hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Most hemorrhages occur during the postpartum period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and are generally related to uterine atony, retained placenta and/or genital lacerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Clinical guidelines to treat post-partum hemorrhage (PPH) are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], but their implementation remains a great issue in resource poor settings.</p><p>There are three delays occurring during the diagnosis and management periods of PPH that are generally associated with a greater incidence in maternal mortality: delay in deciding to seek care (delay 1), delay in reaching the health facility (delay 2), delay in receiving quality emergency obstetric care (delay 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Delay 3 is known to contribute more to maternal mortality than do delays 1 and 2 in SSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Late diagnoses, lack of drugs and supplies, referral delays, inadequate care or severe mismanagement and/or limited blood supply for transfusion are the most common problems observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] during the delay 3 in SSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In addition to this, the general maternal health status exerts a strong influence on the severity of PPH. For example, women presenting anemia, which is highly prevalent in SSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], are at better risk for severe PPH than others.</p><p>A better understanding of the factors associated with maternal death during PPH would help health care providers to rapidly identify women at highest risk for dying and provide appropriate care. To our knowledge, no previous studies have specifically addressed this question. Our objective was thus to identify the factors associated with maternal death occurring during PPH in referral hospitals in Senegal and Mali. The factors we tested were as follows: women&#x02019;s characteristics, aspects of pregnancy and delivery; PPH management; and organizational characteristics in maternity units,</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Setting</title><p>This is a cross-sectional study nested in the one-year pre-intervention period of a multicentre cluster-randomized trial (QUARITE trial). The objective of this trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted educational intervention for reducing hospital-based maternal mortality in Senegal and Mali.</p><p>46 public referral hospitals (22 in Mali and 24 in Senegal) with more than 800 deliveries a year and a functional operating room were recruited from Sept 1, 2007, to Oct 30, 2011. The trial consisted of a 1-year pre-intervention or baseline period, a 2-year intervention period, and a 1-year post-intervention period.</p><p>The study protocol has already been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. QUARITE trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number ISRCTN46950658. Ethical approval for QUARITE and this sub-study was granted by the ethics committee of Sainte-Justine Hospital in Montreal, Canada, and by the national ethics committees in Senegal and in Mali. The participating hospitals were included on the basis of informed consent by the local authorities. Collection of clinical data from hospital registers and medical records is authorized by the hospital authorities and does not require patient consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The 46 participant hospitals were representative of the existing public health referral system in both countries. The public health referral system, which is almost the only provider of modern health-care services in both countries, is based on district hospitals, regional hospitals, and national or teaching hospitals. These hospitals offer comprehensive emergency obstetric care in theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, transfusion could be sometimes unavailable due to lack of blood products.</p><p>PPH cases are managed in the units where the complications arose. In district hospitals, the patients who require more specialized health care services (i.e. intensive care unit) are usually transferred to regional or national hospitals.</p><p>The intervention was not implemented during the baseline period of the trial. Therefore, there were no specific guidelines implemented by the research team during this period.</p><p>The participant hospitals represented 94&#x000a0;% of all referral hospitals in Mali and Senegal and covered approximately 10&#x000a0;% of all deliveries in both countries. According to available statistics in Mali and Senegal, among the remaining 90&#x000a0;% of deliveries, approximately 50&#x000a0;% occurred at home and 50&#x000a0;% in community health care centers in Mali and approximately 68&#x000a0;% occurred at home and 32&#x000a0;% in community health care centers in Senegal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Population</title><p>All women who delivered in the participant hospitals during the study period were enrolled in the QUARITE trial.</p><p>In the present study, we only included women with PPH who delivered in participating hospitals during the baseline period (year 1, from October 2007 to October 2008). PPH was clinically assessed by the caregivers according to the visual estimation of excessive blood loss and patient status. The data collector recorded PPH only if the clinicians noted it in the clinical file. Women with uterine rupture or ante-partum hemorrhage (abruptio placentae or placenta praevia) or who died before delivery were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data collection</title><p>Characteristics of women, pregnancy, labor and delivery and PPH management were extracted from hospital registers and medical records and were registered every day by local trained data collectors (nurses or midwives) in a standard form. The standard form included a list of diagnoses related to the most frequent pathologies during pregnancy and delivery in Senegal and Mali and defined according to the Tenth International Classification of Diseases.</p><p>Hospital-based maternal deaths were identified among all the female deaths that occurred in the facility using the various registers available: admissions, hospitalizations (maternity and other services), operating rooms, and morgue. The cause of death was assessed by a doctor.</p><p>The quality and the completeness of the data were regularly controlled by the trial coordinator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Missing data accounted for less than 1&#x000a0;% of cases. Available resources for each hospital were registered at inclusion by the trial coordinator using the standard inventory developed by WHO for the global survey for monitoring maternal and perinatal health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

Our findings suggest that some women&#x02019;s characteristics, aspects of pregnancy and delivery; PPH management; and organizational characteristics of hospitals are determinants of hospital-based PPH maternal death. In particular, these include the level of accessibility to the hospital, woman&#x02019;s health status before PPH, the mode of delivery and birth weight. Availability of a gynecologist-obstetrician on staff is associated with a decreased risk of death, while transfusion and inter-hospital transfer are linked to an increased risk of death.</p><p>Our study showed that living in Mali is associated with a higher risk of PPH maternal mortality than in Senegal. No difference in the characteristics of women, pregnancy and childbirth between the two countries could explain this result. However, the prevalence of PPH in our study is higher in Senegal than in Mali. PPH definition might differ between the two countries. In Senegal, PPH diagnosis is mainly based on visual estimation of blood loss (i.e. estimation over 500&#x000a0;mL), while in Mali, this is mainly based on visual estimation and patient status. The definition in Mali may lead to detect more severe PPH cases than in Senegal. This could explain why the case fatality rate is higher in Mali than in Senegal. In addition, the number of regional hospitals participating to the QUARITE Trial is higher in Senegal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] than in Mali [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], while the number of district hospitals is higher in Mali [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] than in Senegal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Health care professionals are globally more qualified in regional hospitals than in district hospitals, and they are able to diagnose PPH cases more likely in the higher level of care.</p><p>Our study showed that several women&#x02019;s characteristics, aspects of pregnancy and delivery are associated with PPH maternal mortality. This could help care providers in referral hospitals in Mali and Senegal to strengthen both diagnosis and treatment of PPH among women at high risk. Some characteristics are already known as risk factors for severe PPH: age over 35&#x000a0;years old, pre-existing disease before the occurrence of PPH including severe anemia, instrumental delivery and birth weight over 4000&#x000a0;g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Chronic diseases alter the physiological health status of the woman and increase the risk of organ dysfunctions when a hemorrhagic complication arises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Moreover, a forceps or vacuum-based delivery or a birth weight greater than 4000&#x000a0;g increases the use of episiotomy or vaginal lacerations and thus more blood loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. From this arose the need of careful monitoring during immediate post-partum period.</p><p>The level of accessibility to referral hospitals is also a well-known risk factor for maternal death in SSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Long transport times between home and health care facility, increase the odd of poor health status of the women when admitted to the referral hospital. The inherent issues of communication existing between the health care facilities in SSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] also increase care delays and may lead to dramatic high case fatality rate (50&#x000a0;% in our study). In such a context, it is necessary to improve identification of women who require transfer, to ensure an efficient transfer organization and the quality of transportation. Particularly, the non-pneumatic anti-shock garment could make a significant contribution to help women survive delays due to transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Paradoxically, our findings showed transfusion is associated with a higher risk of maternal death. Transfusion is however an essential care in the management of PPH. It helps to maintain appropriate blood pressure in case of significant blood loss. This association may thus reflect an indication bias because transfusion is more likely performed among women presenting the most severe PPH. From this, we believe that a significant proportion of maternal deaths was probably related to severe PPH and that transfusion may have been performed too late or with insufficient quantity of blood products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In our study, a gynecologist-obstetrician on staff is significantly associated with a decreased of risk of PPH maternal mortality. When a physician specialist is not available in the hospital, a trained general practitioner (GP) is in charge for the maternity unit. These results suggest that training in emergency obstetric care of GPs is probably insufficient. In both countries this training essentially allows to overcome the lack of obstetrician in the district hospitals. However, this training is informal and lasts over a few months. There is no examination or certification of achievement or degree. Knowledge of these physicians is thus limited and may not allow them to quickly diagnose PPH and provide quality care. This can also increase delays in decision-making and particularly the use of surgical treatments (arterial ligation, hysterectomy). Our findings confirm that the GPs are more likely employed in district hospitals than obstetricians, where a small annual amount of deliveries occur (data not shown), with less qualified care providers and limited drugs and supplies. The QUARITE trial showed that health care professionals training in emergency obstetric care had led to a significant reduction in maternal mortality in the district hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>This study presents several strengths. Data were collected from 46 referral hospitals in Senegal and Mali, which were representative of the existing health system in both countries. Thus, this approach ensures the external validity of the study, whose findings could be easily generalized to health systems with similar characteristics. Sample size was large enough to perform hierarchical analyses with high statistical power (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3278 women). Moreover, information on the vital status of women came from various sources, as a consequence, the number of hospital-based maternal deaths was considered exhaustive.</p><p>However, our study also presents some limitations. First, blood loss was measured only with a subjective method by care givers and PPH may have been underestimated in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The reported rate of PPH in our study was relatively small with 3.9&#x000a0;%. That rate was lower than that observed in African health care facilities as shown in Calvert et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Second, it remains possible that diagnoses were under-reported in medical files. That bias may reduce the strength of the association between studied maternal characteristics and PPH case fatality. Third, we did not assess if the care providers were aware of the active management of the third stage of labor recommendations for PPH prevention and whether or not it was implemented. Fourth, a large part of the between-hospital variability in PPH maternal mortality remained unexplained. This heterogeneity may be due to differences in medical practices that were not measured in our study. Younger physicians working alone in rural settings may have different practices than older ones working in urban settings. Taking this information into account would improve the performance of our predictive model. Finally, most women in this study were discharged from the hospital two days or less after delivery. Maternal deaths occurring at home were not recorded. Data analyzed included information only from women who sought care at participant facilities, and excluded information on those delivered at home or referred from another health care facility after delivery. Therefore, maternal mortality in the population cannot be inferred and these results should be used only by clinicians to reduce hospital-based mortality related to PPH.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings may have direct implications for clinicians in resource poor settings. We demonstrated that women&#x02019;s characteristics, aspects of pregnancy and delivery; PPH management; and organizational characteristics of hospitals are risk factors for PPH maternal mortality in SSA. We suggest that severe antepartum anemia should be diagnosed more accurately and treated before delivery, while effort should be put on improving the capacity of the blood banks and making blood quickly accessible when needed. Early detection of PPH and timely decision-making for transfusion are critical. It is also important to improve the identification of women who need to be transferred to another facility and transportation system. Finally, our findings suggest that training in emergency obstetric care of GPs is probably insufficient. If that training may respond to the shortage of obstetricians, whose training is time and money consuming; on the other hand it prevents the same quality care. A better supervision and extensive training are essential keys to reduce gaps in knowledge and to prevent PPH maternal death.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>AD, MT and PF participated in developing the QUARITE trial.
