Exclusion criteria were any acute disease and no willing to participate in the study. Detailed interviews were conducted by trained cardiology resident to obtain information of each participant.

In addition, education-based behavioral interventions could modify salt and vegetable intake as well as taking antihypertensive drug regularly. However, the literatures reported that printed educational materials and SMS.</p><p>We found an improvement in dietary components including vegetable and salt intake as well as regular antihypertensive drug taking by face to face self-care training course. In addition printed educational material could impact on salt intake. Although there were no significant differences between vegetable intake and the frequency of patients with high salt food consumption at the baseline, vegetable intake was significantly higher at the end of study through face to face consultations and pamphlets. In addition, the patients reduced high salt food consumption after face to face education of self-care behaviors. So that the mean vegetable intake increase 0.5 time/day in the participants who trained in the clinics which is about 5 times more than the participants who received pamphlets and SMS. Furthermore the regular medication adherence and using low salt diet improved in about &#x000bc; of participants. However, other lifestyle behaviors including smoking and physical activity had no changes during the study. Warren-Findlow <italic>et al</italic>. reported that low-salt diet intake, medication regimens adherence, doing physical activity and quitting smoking increased during hypertension self-care intervention,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] which was inconsistent to our finding except for in low&#x02013;salt diet intake. It seems dietary modifications are the most practical self-care intervention, while and smoking and physical activity need more health personnel's regards and participants&#x02019; self-efficacy.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>In line with dietary modifications and medication adherence, SBP and DBP decreased via face to face self-care intervention and only we found DBP reduction using pamphlets education. Consistent to our finding several reviews demonstrated the self-care benefits on BPs, especially short-term effect.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] According to these reviews the long-term effects of self-care education in 12 months were uncertain, thus it is necessary that these interventions be done continuously.</p><p>Moreover, we found no significant changes in all investigated self-care behaviors as well as BPs using educational SMS. Conflicting to our results several studies reported the beneficial effects of self-care education on medication adherence and other clinical relevant outcomes,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and hence that Bobrow <italic>et al</italic>. suggested using mobile phone technology via SMS is a novel, low cost method to convey the intervention and manage contact with patients mainly in a low-resource setting.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] However, some studies utilized SMS as a reminder after face-to-face education.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Therefore, it appears in our population using SMS as a reminder may support people with hypertension in self-care management and improving outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>LIMITATIONS</title><p>One limitation of this study was that we had no blindness since it was not applicable among our interventional groups. Using short questionnaire was our limitation because completing long questionnaire was complicated in the clinics; therefore we asked only the most important components of self-care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-6"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Health professional in the clinics played an important role in training self-care behaviors, especially dietary modifications, medication adherence as well as BP regulation. While the printed educational materials and SMS could not affect favorably on lifestyle changes and hypertension control. However, the integration of the self-care management education into the usual care in the clinics and extension of the learning into the home by the means of SMS and other educational materials will increase the potentials of such interventions in the efficient and effective adherence strategies and therefore the healthcare will be available and accessible to all.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This study was residency thesis of H.
