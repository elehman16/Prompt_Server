A randomized controlled trial was conducted among 2-1-1 callers (n = 500) assigned to control or intervention conditions. 2-1-1 information and referral specialists collected baseline data and delivered the intervention consisting of 3 mailings and 1 coaching call; university-based data collectors conducted follow-up interviews at 3 and 6 months post-baseline. Data were collected from June 2013 through July 2014. Participants were mostly female (87.2%), African American (61.4%), and smokers (76.6%). Participants assigned to the intervention condition were more likely than controls to report a full ban on smoking in the home at both 3- (38.1% vs 19.3%, <italic>p</italic> = &#x0003c; .001) and 6-month follow-up (43.2% vs 33.2%, <italic>p</italic> = .02). The longitudinal intent-to-treat analysis showed a significant intervention effect over time (OR = 1.31, <italic>p</italic> = .001), i.e. OR = 1.72 at 6 months. This study replicates prior findings showing the effectiveness of the minimal intervention to promote smoke-free homes in low-income households, and extends those findings by demonstrating they can be achieved when 2-1-1 information and referral specialists deliver the intervention. Findings offer support for this intervention as a generalizable and scalable model for reducing secondhand smoke exposure in homes.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 CA154282</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kegler</surname><given-names>Michelle C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Cancer Institute&#x02019;s (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/">http://www.cancer.gov/</ext-link>) State and Community Tobacco Control Research Initiative (grant number U01 CA154282).

Our recent vanguard RCT of the Smoke-Free Homes (SFH): Some Things Are Better Outside Program tested a minimal intervention among callers to United Way 2-1-1 of Greater Atlanta, a social services

multi-state survey of 2-1-1 callers showing a relatively low prevalence of smoke-free home bans.[<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The objective of the current North Carolina effectiveness trial was to examine the extent to which delivery of the minimal Smoke-Free Homes intervention by 2-1-1 information and referral (I&#x00026;R) specialists had an effect on the adoption of home smoking bans.</p><p>In the vanguard RCT, 2-1-1 staff conducted study recruitment and enrollment, while intervention and follow-up interviews were conducted by university personnel.[<xref

months post-baseline (with bans validated via air nicotine monitors at 3 months).[<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The reduction in SHS exposure was similar to effects

external validity of interventions.[<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165086.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165086.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Although an intervention tested in an efficacy trial with tight controls and intervention delivery by university staff may show an impact, the extent to which that impact will generalize across varied settings, contexts and populations should be established.[<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165086.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Important steps in this process include testing interventions in real-world settings with non-research staff delivering the program, identifying core elements of an intervention, confirming its theory of change, assessing cost-effectiveness, and testing generalizability across different populations.[<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] For SHS exposure in the home, the latter means different geographic regions with varied tobacco control contexts, diverse racial/ethnic groups and varied household compositions.</p><p>2-1-1, the delivery setting for this Smoke-Free Homes intervention, is a national information and referral service connecting individuals to community social and health services, reaching approximately 93% of the US population, and addressing 15 million calls per year.[<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Relative to the general population, 2-1-1 callers are disproportionately low-income, unemployed, uninsured, have fewer years of education, higher smoking rates, and lower likelihood of having a home smoking ban.[<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165086.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165086.ref027"

delivering, and ultimately sustaining interventions to reduce risk and improve the lives of low-income persons.[<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Thus, 2-1-1 call centers provide an excellent setting for assessing the efficacy, effectiveness, and generalizability of health interventions for vulnerable low income populations with higher risk of exposure to smoking and secondhand smoke.[<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165086.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Although SHS exposure in US nonsmokers was reduced by half

Respondents had a full ban if smoking was not allowed anywhere inside their home, a partial ban if smoking was allowed in some places or at some times, and no ban that smoking was allowed anywhere or there were no rules in the home.[<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]</p><p>Secondary outcome measures: Secondary outcomes, not overtly targeted by the intervention but measured because they were possible spillover effects, included self-report of participants&#x02019; SHS exposure in the home, smoking bans in vehicles, and how often someone in the household talked about making the home smoke-free.[<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165086.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] Among smokers, cessation attempts, number of cigarettes smoked per day, and self-efficacy for quitting also were measured.[<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165086.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165086.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]</p><p>Descriptive measures. At baseline, smoking status and demographic characteristics were collected, including participant&#x02019;s gender, race/ethnicity, employment status, household income, education level, marital status, age, and household composition. Additionally, at 3- and 6- month follow-up participants were asked about enforcement issues; &#x0201c;How often are your smoking rules broken by someone?&#x0201d; with response options never, rarely, sometimes, and very often.</p><p>Intervention process measures. During the 3-month interview, intervention group participants who reported having received the coaching call and/or mailings were asked the proportion of materials reviewed (not any, some, most, all), their relevance and usefulness (not at all, a little, somewhat, very), the relevance and usefulness of and satisfaction with the coaching call (not at all, a little, somewhat, very), as well as whether they had taken intermediate behavioral actions recommended by the intervention (e.g., listing reasons to have a smoke-free home, posting the pledge).</p><p>Passive air nicotine monitors, utilized in the previous Atlanta trial after the 3-month interview, validated self-reported home smoking bans, but were also found to be challenging and costly to implement and were, therefore, omitted from this trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Power and Statistical Analyses</title><p>Statistical power analyses were conducted with SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) using the GEE-Size macro. Minimum sample size was estimated assuming a .10 difference between intervention and comparison groups in the proportion of homes that adopt a smoking ban. Rho and psi parameters were included to adjust for autocorrelation between adjacent observations; the dampened exponential correlation structure was used for the correlation structure among repeated measures, and two-sided alpha = .05.</p><p>A total sample size of 340 (with 170 participants each in treatment and control groups) would have achieved 80% statistical power to detect a difference of 10% between control and intervention groups to implement a family smoking ban over the 12-month study period. Ultimately we recruited a conservatively large sample of 500 participants.</p><p>The analysis plan replicated that of the Atlanta trial. Descriptive statistics of all variables of interest were calculated. Univariate and bivariate distributions were examined for all relevant variables for each time point. Hierarchical Linear Growth Modeling (HLGM) was used to assess the intervention impact on all primary and secondary outcomes (intent-to-treat) using binary logistic (full/no full ban), ordinal logistic (full/partial/no ban), Poisson (days exposed to SHS, # of quit attempts), and linear (number of cigarettes per day, confidence to quit smoking, talked about SFH) multilevel models.[<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] HLGM allows modeling of all available data (intent-to-treat) and thus includes all participants for whom at least baseline data are available, i.e. all randomized participants. The analyses modeled linear change over time (which was appropriate based on preliminary investigation of trajectories), as well as a cross-level interaction effect of time and group assignment to model the effectiveness of the intervention. Two sensitivity analyses making more conservative assumptions were employed. The first sensitivity analysis assumed that all participants who did not have follow-up data failed to make their home smoke-free. The second sensitivity analysis also assumed that those who reported enforcement problems did not make their home smoke-free. The same growth curve models were used for the sensitivity analyses. In addition, we investigated patterns of missing data as well as group differences due to randomization for all baseline demographics. Analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4, and HLM7.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec008"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Participants</title><p>Of 3,422 callers assessed for eligibility, 27.7% were eligible, of whom 15.5% declined to participate or ended the call before completing eligibility screening or the enrollment process.

To evaluate reaction to the intervention, we asked follow-up questions during the 3-month interview of intervention participants who reported having received the materials and/or coaching call. In their answers regarding print materials (n = 198) and coaching call (n = 148), 87.4% said intervention mailings were &#x0201c;somewhat&#x0201d; (25.8%) or &#x0201c;very relevant&#x0201d; (61.6%); 92.4% said the materials were &#x0201c;somewhat&#x0201d; (19.2%) or &#x0201c;very useful/helpful&#x0201d; (73.2%). The coaching call was rated as somewhat (32.4%) or very (58.1%) relevant by 90.5%, and somewhat (21.0%) or very (70.3%) useful/helpful and 91.3% of participants respectively; 93.9% said they were &#x0201c;somewhat&#x0201d; (15.5%) or &#x0201c;very satisfied&#x0201d; (78.4%) with their call.</p><p>High proportions of intervention participants at 3-month follow-up (n = 198) reported taking intermediate behavioral actions recommended by the intervention: 83.3% reported having a smoke-free homes talk with family, 67.7% used the provided stickers, 61.6% came up with a list of reasons to have a smoke-free home, and 59.6% put up signs. While the intervention did not attempt to get people to quit smoking, 17.2% of participants reported themselves or someone in their household calling smoking cessation services.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Intervention Impact</title><p>Primary outcome; household smoking bans. Participants in the intervention group were more likely to have a smoke-free home at both follow-up points: At 3 months, 38.1% in the intervention group (versus 19.3% in the control group, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001) had full bans; full ban rates were higher for both groups at 6 months compared to 3 months with significantly more full bans in the intervention group than the control group (43.2% vs. 33.2%, <italic>p</italic> = .02). The longitudinal intent-to-treat analysis showed a significant intervention effect over time (OR = 1.31 per follow-up wave, <italic>p</italic> = .001), i.e. OR = 1.72 at 6 months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165086.t002">Table 2</xref>). The sensitivity analyses showed that when defining those lost to follow-up as failures, i.e. not having a full ban, results were still significant at 3 months with 30.0% of intervention participants versus 16.7% of control participants creating a smoke-free home (<italic>p</italic> = .001). However at 6 months, the difference was not statistically significant (31.5% vs. 26.3%, <italic>p</italic> = .19). When defining success even more stringently by restricting success to only those reporting a full ban and no enforcement issues, a similar pattern emerged with significantly more intervention than

With training, technical assistance and quality control provided by Emory and North Carolina university-based staff and the support of the Smoke-Free Homes custom-built online data collection and tracking application, 2-1-1 I&#x00026;R specialists engaged in the subsequent North Carolina trial proved capable of, and enthusiastic about, recruiting for and delivering this intervention.</p><p>Demographic characteristics of study participants were consistent with the overall demographics of NC 2-1-1 callers. Given the demographic and somewhat different cultures and tobacco control climates between Atlanta and North Carolina (i.e., North Carolina has a comprehensive smoke-free air law), the two trials conducted to date suggest generalizability across settings and extension of intervention effects when delivered by 2-1-1 staff vs. university personnel. Future research will compare the effects of intervention moderators and intervention population/catchment area differences on intervention results across trials in Atlanta, North Carolina, and a third trial in Texas to further establish generalizability.</p><p>In both trials, intervention participants progressed, with increases in proportions of homes moving from no ban to partial ban or from partial ban to full ban by 6-month follow-up. Three months post-baseline, with 83.3% of NC intervention participants reporting they had a talk with their family about adopting a smoke-free home policy and more than half engaging in several other intermediate behavioral actions recommended by the intervention, these are indications that even in cases where participants did not successfully adopt a total home smoking ban, the intervention brought about discussion of a ban and steps toward making changes to home smoking policies and behaviors. These process data also support the intervention&#x02019;s theory of change with &#x0201c;have a family talk&#x0201d; the second step in the change process. Of note, outcomes were achieved with a less intensive intervention than previously tested interventions involving multiple or more intensive counseling sessions targeting families with young or medically compromised children.[<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165086.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165086.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165086.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165086.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]</p><p>While secondary outcomes such as SHS exposure, smoking cessation behavior, and car smoking bans were not direct targets of the intervention, they nevertheless were impacted by the intervention. At both follow-up points, intervention participants had significantly less self-reported SHS exposure than those in the control group. As compared to the control group, intervention participants who smoke also reported more quit attempts, greater confidence to quit smoking, and smoking fewer cigarettes per day. Full or partial car smoking bans, while not addressed directly by the intervention, could be viewed as an extension of a home smoking ban, were reported by significantly more intervention participants at 6 months, and may be considered for inclusion in future interventions.</p><sec id="sec013"><title>Additional findings</title><p>An unexpected finding of this study was an observed reactivity effect: to a greater extent in the NC trial than in the Atlanta trial, the proportion of homes in the control group with full bans rose substantially from 3-month to 6-month follow-up interview, from 19.3% to 33.2%. Furthermore, intervention group participants reported significantly more quit attempts than in the control group at 3 months, but no significant difference was found at 6 months. We suspect this may have been an effect of the 3-month interview serving as an intervention itself.</p><p>During the 3-month interview, all study participants were asked a series of detailed questions about their home environment and barriers to adopting and enforcing a smoke-free policy that may have prompted them to think about the importance of making their home smoke-free. The interview itself, even in the absence of mailings and coaching call, appeared to encourage families to discuss and adopt smoke-free home policies, supporting the notion that engaging the 2-1-1 client population, whether with a minimal intervention or an interview, can have a substantial impact on their/their family&#x02019;s health. Our findings suggest that secular changes in the culture supporting tobacco control and reactivity to participation, especially measures, may promote change even without the formal intervention. We have seen similar results in previous trials addressing reduction in SHS exposure, [<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] but further analyses of pooled trial data are warranted to further explore these findings. They are further supported by Hovell <italic>et al</italic>.&#x02019;s findings[<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] that asthma intervention participants randomized into minimal measures, full measures, and full measures plus treatment for reduction in SHS exposure experienced as large an effect from measures as from treatment.</p><p>While differences between intervention and control group&#x02019;s ban status were diminished by the aforementioned measurement effect, the statistically significant difference between intervention and control groups at 6 months is a good indicator of the program&#x02019;s effectiveness with intervention participants having 72% higher odds of having a full smoking ban in their home than control participants. These results were achieved despite the intervention group having more households where all adults were smokers (which would likely make achieving a home smoking ban more difficult) than the control group.</p><p>This trial was limited by the use of self-report measures without validation of air nicotine monitors, and follow-up assessments may have been inflated by socially desirable responses. In the Atlanta trial, air nicotine monitors confirmed accuracy of self-reports, but were difficult and costly to implement, and therefore were not used in this trial. This deletion, however, moved this trial more fully into the class of a systematic replication and extension toward an effectiveness trial. Furthermore, our final follow-up assessment was conducted 6 months post-baseline, which may be insufficient for assessing long-term effects. We saw, however, increases in bans rather than decreases between our 3- and 6-month assessments, indicating a minimal diminished effect over time.</p><p>Overall, this minimal intervention to promote smoke-free home policies was well received by intervention participants and by the 2-1-1 call centers that delivered it. This trial&#x02019;s findings indicate that 2-1-1 staff could not only recruit participants but deliver the intervention successfully. Of the various types of replication studies identified by Valentine et al. (2011)[<xref rid="pone.0165086.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] (i.e., statistical, generalizability, implementation and theory development), this study can be described as an implementation replication study with variation centered on who delivers the intervention. It also includes elements of a generalizability replication with a slightly more diverse study population and a different tobacco control context than in the original efficacy trial. The results of a second effectiveness trial in Texas will provide additional findings regarding the generalizability of the intervention (allowing for pooled data analyses across trials) setting the stage for a national dissemination program. This Smoke-Free Homes research program and the related series of replication studies serves as a model for translational research following efficacy trials conducted by traditional university researchers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0165086.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0165086.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0165086.s002"><label>S1 Trial Protocol</label><caption><title>Brief Intervention to Create Smoke-Free Home Policies in Low-Income Households: North Carolina Effectiveness Trial.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0165086.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank United Way of North Carolina 2-1-1 for their enthusiastic cooperation and participation in this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0165086.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</collab>. <article-title>Vital signs: nonsmokers' exposure to secondhand smoke&#x02014;United States, 1999&#x02013;2008</article-title>. <source>MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep</source>. <year>2010</year>;<volume>59</volume>(<issue>35</issue>):<fpage>1141</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>6</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20829748</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0165086.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">US Department of Health and Human Services.
