balance and gait of elderly women to suggest a more effective balance exercise method.
[Subjects] Twenty elderly Korean women who could walk independently were recruited from
the community dwelling. [Methods] The motor dual-task balance training (experimental)
group stood on an Aero-step, and performed gym ball bouncing, catching, and throwing,
while the simple task balance training (control) group merely stood on the Aero-step.
Participants performed 45 minutes of training, 2 times a week for 6 weeks. Balance (fall
index) was measured using a TETRAX. Gait variables were recorded on a GAITRite walkway at
self-determined walking speed. [Results] The fall index of the experimental group was
significantly lower than that of the control group. Step length, stride length, velocity,
and cadence of the experimental group improved significantly more than those of control
group. [Conclusions] We found that motor dual-task balance training improved balance and
walking ability more than simple balance training. Further studies should investigate
motor dual-task training with kinematic and kinetic data, and muscle activation based on
motor strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Elderly</kwd><kwd>Motor dual-task</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Balance control is a necessary component of stable walking. Many adults change their
walking pattern as they age, and this is expressed as decreases in walking velocity, step
length, and adaptive responses that ensure safe gait<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Falls greatly restrict functioning and reduce the quality of life
of older people<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Falls often lead to
physical injury, such as fractures, and cause considerable morbidity and mortality<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Activities of daily living (ADL) require balance maintenance during the concurrent
performance of two or more tasks. Older people who perform poorly under dual-tasks are at
increased risk of falls<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Dual-task training is defined as the ability to perform two or more cognitive and motor
activities simultaneously while maintaining postural control<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The dual-task methodology is the primary approach used to
investigate interactions between cognitive processing and motor performance<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Bowen et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> compared walking speed and balance of stroke patients between
performance with and without a verbal cognitive task. Kizony et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> introduced cognitive load and dual-task training during
locomotion for stroke patients using a functional virtual environment. A number of studies
have examined the ability of older adults to concurrently perform motor function and task
demanding cognitive attention. Most studies have shown decreases in walking ability related
to changes in postural stability, gait velocity, cadence, and stride length<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
ability to divide one&#x02019;s attention between two or more concurrent tasks is an important
aspect of functional movement during ADL. The functional capacity of older people is
stressed when performing several tasks simultaneously, due to their limited capacity to
perform the tasks, either because they require greater attention resources, or due to
limitations in their information processing capacity of older peoples<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Silsupadol et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> emphasized the
importance of balance training based on dual-task conditions. They suggested that
interventions to improve dual-task balance performance are essential components of fall
prevention programs for the elderly. Several authors have researched dual-task balance
training<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. None of these studies investigated the effects of motor dual-task
balance training on the balance and gait of elderly women. Therefore, the purpose of the
present study was to investigate the effect of a motor dual-task balance program using a gym
ball on the balance and gait of elderly women, as well as to suggest a more effective
balance exercise method for their well-being life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty elderly women who could walk independently were recruited from community dwellers in
Gyeongsangnam-do, Republic of Korea. The selection criteria were as follows: the ability to
walk independently without an assistive device; and a score of more than 24 on the Korean
Version of the Mini-Mental State Exam (KMMSE). The exclusion criteria were as follows: past
or present neurologic disorder; a musculoskeletal disease that might have interfered with a
daily activities; significant visual or auditory impairments; taking drugs that would have
influenced the results of this study; and a participation in regular exercise programs
within the last six months. Ethical approval was obtained from the Inje University Faculty
of Health Science Human Ethics Committee, and all subjects signed an informed consent form
prior to their participation.</p><p>Subjects of the experimental group were aged 78.6&#x000b1;5.58&#x02005;years (mean&#x000b1;SD), and had a height of
147.71&#x000b1;6.11&#x02005;cm, body weight of 50.06&#x000b1;9.64&#x02005;kg, and KMMSE score of 26.1&#x000b1;1.45. Subjects of
control group were aged 79.8&#x000b1;3.58&#x02005;years, and had a height of 146.17&#x000b1;5.28&#x02005;cm, body weight of
48.67&#x000b1;5.35&#x02005;kg, and KMMSE score of 25.4&#x000b1;0.97.</p><p>Balance (fall index) was measured using a TETRAX (Sunlight Medical Ltd., Ramat Gan,
Israel). The fall index score shows the degree of risk of falling, which is measured on a
0&#x02013;100 point scale (0&#x02013;35: low risk, 36&#x02013;58: moderate risk, 59&#x02013;100: high risk). A higher index
score means a more unstable posture. Eight different postures were evaluated in the test and
each posture was measured for 32 seconds. Gait parameters were recorded using the GAITRite
system (CIR System Inc, Easton, PA, USA). Velocity, cadence, step length and stride length
were recorded subjects&#x02019; self-determined walking speeds. Participants started and finished
walking 2&#x02005;m before and after the start and end of the mat to avoid the effects of
acceleration and deceleration. After one practice trial, participants performed five
measurement trials<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All subjects participated in the 45-minute training sessions, 2 times a week for 6 weeks.
Exercise programs were composed of a warm-up, the main exercises, and a cool-down period.
Stretching was used for the warm-up and cool-down exercises. The main exercise employed in
this test was the modified dual-task program of Yang et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> The motor dual-task balance training (MDBT) group stood on an
Aero-step (TOGU, Germany Inc., Germany) and performed gym ball (diameter: 45&#x02005;cm) bouncing
(right hand, left hand, and both hands), catching, and throwing. Two participants caught and
threw the gym ball separated by a distance of 1.5&#x02005;m. If they successfully performed the task
over 80% of the time (eight out of ten times), the distance was increased to 2&#x02005;m. The simple
task balance training (SBT) group simply stood on the Aero-step. Statistical analysis was
performed using the SPSS statistical package (version 18.0 for Windows, Chicago, IL, USA).
The differences in balance and gait parameters were analyzed using the independent t-test
for comparisons between groups and the paired-t test for comparisons within groups.
Significance was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results for the fall index and gait parameters of the MDBT group and the SBT group

women who could walk independently without any assistive device. The post-intervention
balance of the MDBT group was significantly better than that of the SBT group. Walking
ability also showed a significant improvement when compared to that of the STB group.
Performance of a dual-task requires information processing capacity that allows the
efficient allocation of attention between the two tasks. Focusing on body movements (i.e.,
adopting a so-called internal focus) during the execution of a motor skill is relatively
ineffective because it interferes with automatic control processes<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study used MDBT based on the external focus method.
Significantly increased balance ability and decreased postural sway were evident, indicating
that attention was effectively allocated between balance and the second task.</p><p>Achieving effective postural control while bouncing, catching, and throwing a ball, and
standing on the Aero-step involve complex interactions among the visual, somatosensory, and
vestibular systems, which control the relationships between the different body segments, and
spatial aspects with respect to gravity and the body and the environment<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The sole of the foot is one of the
important areas of proprioceptive input for postural control<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Oh<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> also
showed that proprioceptive exercise on the Aero-step resulted in improved balance, and that
is in agreement with our present results.</p><p>Viswanathan and Sudarsky<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
balance and gait disturbances in the elderly are particularly important, because they
compromise independence and increase the risk of fall and injury. Gait characteristics of
older people are influenced by balance control, leg muscle strength, ankle range of motion,
and the availability of sensory information<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study showed that balance was improved in MDBT group
after the intervention. We consider that walking ability improved due to improved balance,
and our results support the hypothesis that changes in gait patterns are influenced by
balance ability.</p><p>We also found that performing a proprioceptive-balance motor dual-task using a ball led to
increased ankle mobility through center-of-weight shifting and reaction forces occurring
during rapid upper limb movement. For this reason, the gait velocity also increased.
Westlake et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> examined the effects of
sensory-specific balance training for older people. The tasks were performed standing or
walking on different support surfaces, and their results suggest that there were
improvements in velocity sensing. The study by Yang et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> examined the effect of a dual-task program on the gait performance
of chronic stroke patients, and found that all measured gait parameters of the motor
dual-task group significantly improved.</p><p>In contrast to our findings, the study by Bond et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported decreased walking ability during performance of a motor
dual-task in patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD). The reason for the differences in the
walking velocity results may be due to the fact that subjects in our study were older
adults, while the subjects in the study of Bond et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> were patients with PD. Many people with PD have difficulty in
automatically regulating their movement. If the basal ganglia are disordered, then automatic
movement becomes tardy, or reduced in amplitude, or both aspects deteriorate. The other
reason for the differences in walking velocity may be due to that the present study having
had a dual-task intervention lasting 6 weeks, while the study of Bond et al. did not perform
an intervention.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, there was no follow-up period. We do not know
whether the subjects in the experimental group were able to maintain the improvements we
observed in their gait. Second, the sample size used in this trial was small, which implies
that caution should be exercised when interpreting or generalizing the results. Third, this
study only measured standing balance under specific sensory conditions in eight positions.
No measurements were made of motor strategies during a perturbed stance. Therefore, we do
not know the effect of dual task on motor strategy patterns.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the 2013 Inje University research grant.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Barak</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Wagenaar</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Holt</surname><given-names>KG</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Gait characteristics of elderly people with a history of
