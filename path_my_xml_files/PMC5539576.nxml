People with diabetes mellitus (DM) may be candidates for neurodynamic exercises to address common DM-related impairments such as reduced lower extremity range of motion (ROM) and altered neural mechanosensitivity. However, no studies have examined the safety and immediate effects of neurodynamic exercise in people with DM. This study aims to determine the feasibility of applying neurodynamic exercises in adults with DM by evaluating the rate of adverse events and quantifying immediate changes in straight leg raise (SLR) ROM.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This quasi-experimental study included 20 people with DM who performed a series of neurodynamic exercises on their right leg. Their left leg was used as an internal control. SLR testing was performed before and immediately after these exercises.

Specifically, adults with DM, both with and without the presence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), demonstrated less nerve movement during ankle dorsiflexion in varied hip positions that mimic the straight leg raise (SLR) compared to healthy controls.<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9,10</sup></xref> Additionally, adults with DM may be less responsive to progressive increases in mechanical loading of neural tissues during the SLR.<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> When neural tissues are loaded to a greater degree during the SLR by dorsiflexing the ankle prior to flexing the hip, healthy individuals exhibit less hip flexion range of motion (ROM).<xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12&#x02013;14</sup></xref> This decrease in hip flexion ROM is thought to be a protective response to the increased neural tissue load.<xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13,14</sup></xref> However, the protective response to ankle dorsiflexion preceding hip flexion during SLR was diminished in people with DM regardless of the presence of DPN and was absent in people with DM with signs of severe DPN.<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><p>Additionally, adults with DM often have reduced lower extremity mobility that may impact their health status.<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15&#x02013;17</sup></xref> For example, reduced ankle mobility is commonly associated with DM<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16&#x02013;18</sup></xref> and may be a risk factor for developing diabetic foot ulcerations <xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19,20</sup></xref> that in turn significantly elevate the risk for morbidity (e.g. amputations) and mortality.<xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21,22</sup></xref> Reductions in limb mobility may be related to non-neural structures (i.e. fascia, muscles, and joints) or to neural structures due to increased mechanosensitivity. The latter may be amenable to neurodynamic exercises. However, it is unclear if people with DM can tolerate neurodynamic exercises and if this intervention is safe and appropriate for this population, regardless of the presence of DPN. Recognition of mobility impairments and understanding responses to neurodynamic exercises in adults with DM is important in designing treatments that are not only efficacious but are also safe. However, no study to date has examined the immediate effects and safety of neurodynamic exercises in people with DM.</p><p>Therefore, this study aimed to determine the safety of applying neurodynamic exercises in adults with DM by evaluating (1) the rate of adverse events, including symptom provocation and (2) the immediate changes in lower limb ROM as measured by the SLR neurodynamic test after a series of active neurodynamic exercises.

Study participants attended one session that consisted of a series of five neurodynamic exercises. Occurrence of adverse events was assessed during and after the intervention. Neurodynamic testing was assessed before and immediately after the intervention. All participants performed the interventions on their right lower extremity and received no direct intervention to their left lower extremity, which acted as the within-participant comparison control. Neither the examiner nor the participants were blinded as to which limb received the intervention. However, SLR mobility results were withheld from the participant until the end of the session to minimize biasing the outcome by knowledge of performance.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0004"><title>Participants</title><p>A sample of convenience was recruited through local print, electronic, and radio advertisements.

The presence of neuropathy was not required for participation in this study as DM was the main risk factor of interest. Potential participants were excluded if they had chemical, drug, or alcohol dependency; medical diagnosis of a herniated disk in the back; trauma to the nerves of the lower extremity; current neck or low back pain; history of lumbar surgery; chemotherapy use within the past year; complex regional pain syndrome; lower extremity amputations proximal to the metatarsophalangeal joint; open wounds; infection in the lower limbs; or were currently pregnant.

Pillows and folded towels supported the participant&#x02019;s neck and limbs in a comfortable position and assured that the thoracolumbar spine was in neutral alignment. Neurodynamic exercises that simultaneously slacken from one end of the nerve while tensioning from the opposite end are thought to facilitate a sliding movement between the neural tissue and the adjacent non-neural interfacing tissue (<italic>sliding technique</italic>)<xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1,2,29,30</sup></xref> and are associated with relatively lower levels of nerve strain.<xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1,2,29,31</sup></xref> The exercises included ankle, knee, and/or neck sagittal plane motions performed in various hip and knee positions. Each neurodynamic exercise was performed in a cyclical fashion where each end alternated between tension and slackening (Figure <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplemental Video). This series of neurodynamic exercises were selected to gradually and progressively preposition the participant into an increasing amount of preloading of the posterior neural structures<xref rid="C32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32,33</sup></xref> by introducing hip and knee positions that are components of the SLR test. The participant performed all movements actively with instructions to create as large a motion as possible without provoking discomfort. If symptoms or discomfort were provoked, the exercise was modified by reducing the ROM to allow movement without symptom provocation.</p><fig id="F0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Neurodynamic exercises.

The participants rested for 60&#x000a0;s between each exercise. The total duration of the interventions was approximately 10&#x000a0;min.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0007"><title>Adverse events</title><p>In participants with neuropathy, adverse events included any reproduction or exacerbation of the participant&#x02019;s neuropathy symptoms. For all participants, any reported discomfort or pain from the neurodynamic exercises was also considered an adverse event. Participants described the quality, location, and time to resolve or return to baseline for all neuropathic symptoms or other sensory responses they experienced. Symptoms of stretch or tightness during the SLR testing or during the exercises were not considered to be adverse events as long as the sensation was directly associated with movements into a specific position and resolved immediately once out of that position.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0008"><title>Neurodynamic testing</title><p>The SLR test was used to assess pre-intervention to post-intervention changes in ROM.

Two variations of SLR were performed.<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11,13,34,35</sup></xref> The participant&#x02019;s ankle was manually placed in full dorsiflexion and then again in full plantar flexion as determined by end range resistance by the examiner. A handheld inclinometer was placed on their anterior leg just distal to the tibial tuberosity. The pelvis was not stabilized during SLR testing to mimic clinical examination procedures. The passive SLR (hip flexion with knee in full extension) was performed up to the point that the participant indicated the first onset of any symptoms or sensory response. The motion was held at that position for 5&#x000a0;s to obtain a measure from the inclinometer and to allow the participant to report any symptoms or sensory responses. Then, the limb was slowly returned to the start position followed by a two-minute rest period between measurements. The handheld inclinometer has excellent reliability and validity when used for SLR testing compared to a highly precise digital inclinometer in healthy individuals.<xref rid="C34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> To determine the measurement properties of handheld inclinometer in this study, two measurements were performed on each limb before the intervention was applied.

There were no significant adverse events associated with a single session of neurodynamic exercises in our sample. None of the participants with documented neuropathy experienced a provocation of their symptoms with these exercises. None of the participants (regardless of neuropathy status) experienced pain during the exercises, and only one reported discomfort in the form of a calf cramp that resolved quickly upon ceasing that specific exercise. That participant completed the remaining exercises without any further discomfort. A sensation of stretching was noted frequently with the last of the exercises (#5), but this sensory response was transient and directly associated with movement into ankle dorsiflexion with neck extension and resolved immediately when participants moved out of that position. None of the participants that felt this stretching sensation required any modifications to the neurodynamic exercises. After completing the exercises, no participants reported symptoms or residual sensory responses provoked by the exercises. In addition, subsequent SLR testing after performing neurodynamic exercises did not alter sensory responses and did not trigger neuropathic symptoms compared to pre-intervention testing. The sensory responses provoked during the SLR tests were similar to previous studies in people with type 2 DM<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and healthy, asymptomatic people without diabetes.<xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p>SLR ROM data after the intervention provide further support for the safety of neurodynamic exercises for people with DM. Reductions in SLR ROM after the intervention could be a sign of decreased tolerance to mechanical loading of lower extremity tissues. Because only one participant experienced a reduction in PF/SLR ROM (decreased by 3&#x000b0;) beyond measurement error and no participants experienced a reduction in DF/SLR ROM after the intervention, it is evident that the neurodynamic exercises were well tolerated by the participants in this study. There is evidence that various forms of exercise can be safe for people with DM and peripheral neuropathy,<xref rid="C38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38&#x02013;43</sup></xref> but none of these studies investigated neurodynamic exercises. Our findings are the first evidence for the safety of the included neurodynamic exercises for people with DM.</p><p>Immediate improvements in SLR ROM suggest that neurodynamic exercise may improve lower extremity ROM and alter mechanosensitivity in lower extremity neural tissues in this population. Admittedly, the ROM increases seen in the PF/SLR test may be additionally due to non-neural structures accommodating greater elongation, such as the hamstring muscles or the hip joint structures. However, it is theorized that when ankle dorsiflexion pre-positioning reduces the amount of hip ROM (during DF/SLR compared to PF/SLR), this is more reflective of the nervous system&#x02019;s contribution to ROM limitations.<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11,13,32,33</sup></xref> Thus, DF/SLR can be used to track changes in ROM that can be, at least in part, attributed to changes in the nervous system&#x02019;s mechanosensitivity. In the present study, the increase in DF/SLR ROM after neurodynamic interventions supports the conclusion that mechanosensitivity improved in these individuals with DM. This suggests that, despite the presence of DM with or without mild-to-moderate neuropathy, the nervous system has the capacity to adapt and allow for more symptom-free movement. In other words, the results of the study demonstrate that this impairment is not fixed.</p><p>Although statistically significant, the approximately 5&#x000b0; average improvement in SLR ROM on the experimental limb may not be clinically meaningful in all patient circumstances. However, there is previous evidence that people with DM have mean reductions in ROM during the SLR of 2&#x000b0; to 13&#x000b0; depending on the testing methods.<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11,13</sup></xref> It is therefore conceivable that a 5&#x000b0; improvement in SLR mobility may be clinically meaningful in some patients as it could at least partially normalize this particular mobility impairment. However, it is also important to recognize that 15&#x02013;30% of participants did not experience an increase in SLR mobility above the MDC of 2&#x000b0;. Additional research is necessary to determine whether this modest change in SLR ROM has any link to more meaningful functional changes within this population.</p><p>Because all five neurodynamic exercises were performed before post-testing of SLR ROM and sensory responses, it is not clear whether the observed changes in the experimental limbs were related to a combination of all five exercises or to the effects of one or more of the exercises. The sequence, number, and order of the exercises were not meant to be used as a protocol, but rather determine the feasibility and safety of each in participants with DM. Since all of the neurodynamic exercises in this study were tolerated well, it is recommended that clinicians choose based on the patient&#x02019;s ability to perform the exercise without provoking any symptoms, similar to the parameters used in this study. Additionally, biomechanical principles can be considered when choosing neurodynamic exercises. Neurodynamic exercises #2, #3, and #5 are likely to have greater biomechanical effects on the lower extremity neural tissues because pre-loading of the nervous system included both hip flexion and knee extension (exercises #2 and #5) or because a knee extension movement was performed with the hip pre-positioned in flexion (exercise #3).<xref rid="C44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44,45</sup></xref> Therefore, it would seem reasonable clinically to initially consider these (or other similar) neurodynamic exercises when greater loading of the nervous system is indicated and tolerated. Neurodynamic exercises #1 and #4 (or other variations) could be explored when those initial exercises are not tolerated. Further research is needed to determine optimal neurodynamic exercise choice (or combinations of neurodynamic exercises) and appropriate dosage for improving outcomes in patients with DM. Furthermore, it is necessary to determine the safety of performing neurodynamic exercise over multiple treatment sessions and whether that can lead to greater and longer-lasting improvements in lower extremity ROM in this population.</p><p>It is important to note that the present study sample included adults with either no neuropathy or mild-to-moderate neuropathy, as rated by the MDNS, without the presence of ulcerations. This sample covers a wide spectrum of patients who may consult a physical therapist with a musculoskeletal disorder that also have DM as a comorbid condition. It is unclear if performing these exercises would be safe in other populations of people with DM such as those with severe neuropathy, ulcerations, or in children. Further research is necessary to elucidate the safety and efficacy of these neurodynamic exercises in different populations.</p><p>The limitations present in this study warrant caution when attempting to extrapolate these findings beyond the study sample. Such limitations include not knowing whether functionally relevant improvement is associated with this type of exercise, whether the changes noted would be greater and/or maintained through neurodynamic exercises over multiple sessions, what dosage of such exercises will optimize outcomes, and whether safety and efficacy transfer to other populations of patients who have DM. In addition, we did not control for medications during this single-session trial and the examiner was not blinded to which limb the intervention was applied. Despite these limitations, this is the first study to demonstrate that a single session of neurodynamic exercises can be both safe and effective at creating immediate improvements in lower extremity ROM and improvements in neural tissue mechanosensitivity in people with DM. Results from this study provide a foundation for further investigation into the impacts of neurodynamic exercises in people with DM.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="S0016"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>The supplementary material for this paper is available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.10.1080/10669817.2016.1180772">http://dx.doi.10.1080/10669817.2016.1180772</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="S0017"><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflict or competing interests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM0320"><caption><title>VIDEO: NDexer5.wmv</title></caption><media xlink:href="YJMT_A_1180772_SM0320.wmv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM0254"><caption><title>VIDEO: NDexer4.wmv</title></caption><media xlink:href="YJMT_A_1180772_SM0254.wmv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM0144"><caption><title>VIDEO: NDexer3.wmv</title></caption><media xlink:href="YJMT_A_1180772_SM0144.wmv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM9957"><caption><title>VIDEO: NDexer2.wmv</title></caption><media xlink:href="YJMT_A_1180772_SM9957.wmv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM9927"><caption><title>VIDEO: NDexer1.wmv</title></caption><media xlink:href="YJMT_A_1180772_SM9927.wmv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Erin Carlson, Felicia Ferlin, George Haras, Amaya James, and Amanda Welch for their assistance with data collection and analysis.
