Of these agitation is the most common and difficult to manage. The presence of agitation is associated with fewer visits from relatives, poorer quality of life and social isolation. It is recommended that agitation is treated through psychosocial interventions. Dementia Care Mapping&#x02122; (DCM&#x02122;) is an established, widely used observational tool and practice development cycle, for ensuring a systematic approach to providing person-centred care. There is a body of practice-based literature and experience to suggests that DCM&#x02122; is potentially effective but limited robust evidence for its effectiveness, and no examination of its cost-effectiveness, as a UK health care intervention. Therefore, a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) of DCM&#x02122; in the UK is urgently needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A pragmatic, multi-centre, cluster-randomised controlled trial of Dementia Care Mapping (DCM&#x02122;) plus Usual Care (UC) versus UC alone, where UC is the normal care delivered within the care home following a minimum level of dementia awareness training. The trial will take place in residential, nursing and dementia-specialist care homes across West Yorkshire, Oxfordshire and London, with residents with dementia. A random sample of 50 care homes will be selected within which a minimum of 750 residents will be registered. Care homes will be randomised in an allocation ratio of 3:2 to receive either intervention or control. Outcome measures will be obtained at 6 and 16 months following randomisation. The primary outcome is agitation as measured by the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, at 16 months post randomisation. Key secondary outcomes are other BSC and quality of life. There will be an integral cost-effectiveness analysis and a process evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The protocol was refined following a pilot of trial procedures. Changes include replacement of a questionnaire, whose wording caused some residents distress, to an adapted version specifically designed for use in care homes, a change to the randomisation stratification factors, adaption in how the staff measures are collected to encourage greater compliance, and additional reminders to intervention homes of when mapping cycles are due, via text message.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN82288852">ISRCTN82288852</ext-link>.

Of the people living with dementia, up to 90 % experience one or more behaviours that staff may describe as &#x02018;challenging&#x02019; to support (BSC), during the course of their condition. BSC include behaviours such as agitation, aggression, restlessness, hallucinations, delusions, depression, anxiety and apathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The most common of these, with reported prevalence rates of over 60 % in nursing home residents with dementia, is agitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which includes a cluster of extremely problematic behaviours such as aggressive and physically non-aggressive behaviours and verbal agitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The presence of agitation in a person with dementia is associated with fewer visits from relatives, poorer quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and social isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, it puts the person who is agitated at risk of triggering responses from other residents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], causing potential serious risk of harm not only to the person who is agitated, but to other residents and staff. Agitation and other BSC are not an inevitable consequence of dementia, they reflect an expression of unmet needs by a person with dementia in response to poor quality care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It is recognised that the presence of agitation in individuals with dementia in care home settings is associated with poorer levels of organisational aspects of care and the care culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is, therefore, recommended that agitation is treated through the use of psychosocial interventions that address the quality of care practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Person-centred care is an effective psychosocial approach in dementia care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and is considered a best practice method for reducing agitation and other BSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Person-centred care means providing a supportive social environment within a care setting where people with dementia are valued, treated as individuals, and staff are encouraged to see the world from the person&#x02019;s perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Raising staff knowledge, skills and confidence levels around person-centred ways of working with BSC is, therefore, a national priority area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Training staff in person-centred approaches has been found to be effective in improving the delivery of person-centred care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, whilst effective person-centred care training can produce immediate practice benefits, evidence suggests that alone it might not sustain change over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and additional support is required in order to facilitate sustained benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] over an extended period of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Dementia Care Mapping&#x02122; (DCM&#x02122;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] is an established and widely used intervention, directed at care homes, for ensuring a systematic approach to providing individualised person-centred care, and is recommended by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence/Social Care Institute for Excellence (NICE/SCIE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. DCM&#x02122; is an observational tool, set within a practice development cycle, which includes five phases: (1) briefing, (2) observation, (3) analysis, (4) feedback, and (5) action planning. This cycle is repeated every 4&#x02013;6 months to monitor and revise action plans. Once initial training and skills development in the method are completed, those trained to use DCM&#x02122; (mappers) are able to conduct these practice development cycles (mapping) independently. This means that DCM&#x02122; requires no external input over the long term and is, therefore, potentially less resource intensive and more likely to be readily implemented in real-world dementia practice than other interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Whilst DCM&#x02122; has been used in dementia care for nearly 20 years, including implementation in care home settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and has strong face validity within the practice field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], there is limited robust evidence of its efficacy in relation to clinical outcomes such as reduction of BSC. Practice implementation suggests that the benefits of DCM&#x02122; include the improvement of well-being in service users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and helping staff see care from the point of view of the person with dementia, leading to evidence-based feedback and action planning that motivates staff and helps them to feel more confident to implement person-centred care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>To date there are only five published studies that examine the benefits of using DCM&#x02122; for improving clinical outcomes. A Dutch pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] utilising a One-Group Pretest-Posttest design found DCM&#x02122;, used alone, reduced verbal agitation and anxiety in people with dementia and improved care staff feelings of connection with clients. An Australian pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] in three care homes, employing a Pretest-Posttest design, found improvements in the quality of staff interactions and reductions in agitation and depression through the use of DCM&#x02122;. There are three full RCTs of the effectiveness of DCM&#x02122; published to date. A cluster RCT conducted in 15 care homes with 289 residents (loss to follow-up of 18 % at 10 months) in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] (UC&#x02009;=&#x02009;5, UC&#x02009;+&#x02009;person-centred care training&#x02009;=&#x02009;5, UC&#x02009;+&#x02009;DCM&#x02009;=&#x02009;5), found that at 10 months post randomisation, DCM&#x02122;, when used alone was associated with significantly reduced agitation and falls among residents with dementia compared to UC. A Norwegian cluster RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] in 15 care homes (5&#x02009;=&#x02009;control group, 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;person-centred care framework implementation, 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;DCM) and with 446 residents (loss to follow-up of 29 % at 10 months) found a significant reduction in neuropsychiatric symptoms as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and on the NPI sub-scales of agitation and psychosis compared to controls. It also found a significant improvement in quality of life, compared to controls after 10-month follow-up. However, both the Norwegian and the Australian study had a follow-up period of only 10 months, limiting the potential for impact given the length of time that changes within practice can take to implement and thus potential benefits to be observed. Additionally, both trials had explanatory designs involving researcher-led cycles of DCM&#x02122; with variable degrees of input from trained care home staff. This restricts generalisability of the results to usual implementation of DCM&#x02122; in care practice, which is practitioner-led. A cluster RCT study in 34 units, from 11 care homes in the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], with 434 residents (loss to follow-up 35 % at 12 months) found no difference in residents&#x02019; agitation between the DCM&#x02122; intervention and control homes. However, staff in the intervention group reported significantly fewer negative emotional reactions and significantly more positive reactions towards people with dementia over time. This trial reported potential intervention fidelity issues in the DCM&#x02122; care homes, indicating less than desirable implementation of the intervention in some of the clusters. A limitation of all three RCT studies is that they were exploratory studies and each only included two full cycles of DCM&#x02122; before final follow-up, reducing the time for potential change and impact to be realised.</p><p>Despite their limitations, these studies provide promising data on the effectiveness of DCM&#x02122; in Australian, Norwegian and Dutch care home settings. They do not provide, however, a robust evaluation of effectiveness of DCM&#x02122; in UK settings. In particular, the Australian study used DCM&#x02122; alone rather than alongside person-centred care training, which is recommended in DCM implementation guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This reflects the Australian context at the time of the study, where staff access to person-centred care training was the exception rather than assumed good practice, but it highlights the lack of comparability of Usual Care between UK and non-UK care homes. In addition, there are distinct funding models of dementia care across countries and, therefore, the economic evaluation data from these RCTs are not directly applicable to a UK context. Therefore, a definitive RCT of DCM&#x02122; in the UK, building on previous work, is needed to inform the delivery of person-centred dementia care within UK care homes. The additional knowledge to be gained from this trial, beyond that within research conducted to date, is that:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It will reflect conditions of DCM&#x02122; implementation in usual practice, being a pragmatic trial, compared to the explanatory designs of previous trials; in particular with care home staff rather than researcher led cycles of DCM&#x02122; implementation.

In the first stage, catchment areas within each recruitment hub, defined by postcode prefix for West Yorkshire, boroughs for London and geographical area for Oxfordshire, will be selected in rotation. In the second stage, all the care homes within catchment areas will be randomly ordered and, at each rotation, a batch of 12 care homes from the catchment area will be sent invitation information by post. This method ensures geographical closeness of care homes approached for recruitment at the same time, which will support multiple short recruitment visits to be undertaken with minimised travel. Sampling and care home approach will be staggered across the recruitment period.</p><p>Researchers will contact homes invited to participate by telephone after sending an initial postal invitation. For interested care homes, the researcher will complete initial eligibility screening via telephone and then visit the care home to determine full eligibility and complete the recruitment process. Once all the care homes within a catchment area batch have been contacted and a decision regarding participation made, the researcher will move onto the next batch from the next catchment area until sufficient homes have been recruited. In this way, it is intended that the care home sample will be representative of the entire region sampled, and that any deviations from this will be known and can be adjusted for. The target is for four homes to be recruited per month across the whole trial.</p><p>Given that DCM&#x02122; is designed to be used alongside training in person-centred dementia care, all care homes will be audited using a training audit tool designed by the research team. This will ensure that each home in the trial meets at least minimum dementia training levels defined in terms of both content of the training and proportion of staff trained (minimum 20 % of direct care staff). If the training audit finds that a home has not provided staff with a minimum level of dementia awareness training, staff will be provided with a half-day dementia awareness course. Based on existing published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], we expect up to 20 % of homes to require this dementia awareness package.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Resident recruitment</title><p>Following the training audit, the researcher will meet with the care home manager and/or relevant senior staff member to identify all eligible residents to be approached to take part in the trial. All residents will be reviewed for eligibility by the researcher through discussions with the manager, whilst maintaining anonymity. All eligible residents will then be approached to participate. It is expected that approximately 15 residents will be recruited at each participating care home. Reasons for ineligibility will be recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Staff recruitment</title><p>Care home staff can be recruited into four roles: (1) as proxy informants, providing data about resident participants, (2) as a staff participant providing data about him or herself, (3) as a mapper who will be responsible for implementing the intervention, and (4) as a nominated consultee (see informed consent). Role 4 is mutually exclusive from all other roles, so any staff member recruited as a nominated consultee will not be permitted to undertake any other role within the trial. Roles 1 and 3 are also mutually exclusive, so staff recruited as mappers will not be permitted to act as proxy informants. Recruitment to all staff roles will occur at baseline and at subsequent time points where necessary due to withdrawal. For role 2, recruitment will take place at baseline and at each further data collection point, due to the expected annual turnover rates of staff in each care home.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Relative/friend recruitment</title><p>The resident (where possible), or the care home manager, will be asked to identify a relative or close friend of the resident, who visits at least once per week, to be approached to provide proxy data for the trial. The relative/friend will be contacted by post with information about the trial and asked to return a signed consent form to the care home if they agree to take part. The person providing proxy data may differ from the residents&#x02019; personal consultee, where one is appointed (see informed consent).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Dementia Care Mapping (DCM&#x02122;)</title><p>DCM&#x02122; will be implemented according the standard procedures identified in the DCM&#x02122; 8 User&#x02019;s Manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The intervention comprises training two care home staff in use of DCM&#x02122; followed by implementation of three full mapping cycles. Two eligible staff members will be identified as mappers in all homes prior to randomisation and will be consented at baseline. After completion of the standard 4-day DCM&#x02122; training course, the mappers will run briefing sessions 1&#x02013;2 weeks prior to undertaking the mapping observations. During the briefing session, mappers will consult with staff about selection of appropriate residents to be mapped. Residents chosen for inclusion in mapping observations do not have to be trial participants and verbal consent from residents to be observed will be gained by the mappers ahead of mapping observations commencing. Mapping involves the mappers continuously observing between two and five people with dementia, over a period of four to six consecutive hours, in communal living areas only. The mappers will then analyse the data they collect and present it in a report that will be fed back to the staff team. During the feedback session, an action plan will be produced in collaboration with the staff team, which will detail areas that the home aims to improve, based on the DCM&#x02122; data. Progress on these actions is monitored during the next mapping cycle. The first cycle should be completed by approximately 3 months post randomisation and the second and third cycles at approximately 8 months and 13 months post randomisation, respectively. An expert mapper, who is a practitioner experienced in the implementation of DCM&#x02122;, will provide support to each care home during completion of their first cycle of mapping in order to maximise intervention fidelity across all homes. Telephone/email support for DCM&#x02122; implementation will be available to all care homes thereafter through the DCM&#x02122; lead for the trial, if required. Mappers will be asked to complete and return data on mapping practice for all three mapping cycles including: information on numbers of staff in the care home receiving DCM&#x02122; briefing; number of hours of mapping; number of residents mapped; number of staff attending feedback sessions and number of action plans developed. Mappers will be provided with a standard reporting template to gather this information.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Usual Care</title><p>UC is defined as normal care delivered within the setting (as measured by training audit, a bespoke UC Questionnaire and the Care Home Context and Organisational Questionnaire). No restrictions will be imposed on current practices or on homes undertaking additional development or training as part of UC, with the exception of control arm homes being required not to implement DCM&#x02122; during their trial involvement period. Person-centred care is considered best practice within dementia care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and as such care homes are expected to provide staff with appropriate training to deliver care of this type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Registration and randomisation</title><p>Residents will be registered centrally with the Clinical Trials Research Unit (CTRU) at the University of Leeds after care home recruitment, the care home training audit, confirmation of eligibility, informed consent and collection of resident baseline data.</p><p>Once all residents within a care home have been registered, care homes will be randomised centrally at the CTRU to receive DCM&#x02122;&#x02009;+&#x02009;UC or UC, leading to two sources of clustering: cluster-randomisation and DCM&#x02122; treatment provision. The former occurs at randomisation (care homes are nested within treatment arms), the latter afterwards (care homes are partially nested within arms) so we anticipated that the clustering effect will vary across arms, and assumed a higher design effect in the intervention arm. Care homes will be randomised on a 3:2 basis. A computer-generated minimisation programme incorporating a random element will be used to ensure treatment arms are balanced for the following care home characteristics: (1) home/unit type (general residential/nursing, specialise in dementia care), (2) size (large at least 40, medium/small fewer than 40), and (3) provision of dementia awareness training by research team (yes, no), (4) recruitment hub (West Yorkshire, Oxfordshire, London). The latter was changed from prior use of DCM&#x02122; in the last 5 years as balancing the intervention across recruitment hubs was considered more important. Following randomisation, a member of the research team will inform the care home manager of their allocation and for those homes allocated to DCM&#x02122;&#x02009;+&#x02009;UC, the staff consented to take on the role of mappers will also be informed, so arrangements for attendance at DCM&#x02122; training can be made.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Data assessments</title><p>Assessments will be undertaken at screening (prior to consent); baseline (prior to resident registration); 6 months post randomisation and 16 months post randomisation.

To ensure consistency, where possible the same staff member will be asked to complete resident measures at each data collection point. All data will be gathered by trained researchers in discussion with the informant with the exception of the staff measures questionnaires, which will be completed independently by staff. To ensure reliability and to restrict the potential for researcher bias, intra-rater reliability will be achieved for all researchers at training. Effort will be made to blind all trial researchers to allocation status. The researcher conducting the observations for the PAS and abridged CMAI will be independent and will remain blind. Any unblinding will be recorded and unblinded researchers will not conduct any further follow-up data collection in those care homes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size calculations were based on assumptions of an average of 40 residents in each care home, and that at least 60 % of these would meet the eligibility criteria and 65 % of those eligible would be willing to provide informed consent (i.e. 15 residents recruited from each care home). Calculations were based on a normally distributed outcome: the mean difference in CMAI scores between arms at 16 months. Fifty care homes, each recruiting 15 residents, will result in 750 residents overall and provide 90 % power to detect a clinically important difference of 3 CMAI points (standard deviation (SD) 7.5 points) with a two-sided 5 % significance level. This allows for 25 % loss to follow-up (cluster size of 11 residents available for analysis) based on Chenoweth et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] leading to an inflation factor of 2.0 (intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) no greater than 0.1). The assumption that the ICC will be no larger than 0.1 was based on an ICC for CMAI reported by Fossey et al.

Sensitivity analyses will be carried out to assess the impact of the choice of imputation model and of assuming data are Missing Not at Random (MNAR) as appropriate.</p><p>The impact of cluster randomisation is expected to be equal across arms but that of treatment provision is not. As such, the principal method for handling clustering effects will be to fit a multilevel model that allows care home- and resident-level variances to differ across arms. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted fitting a random intercept model assuming equal total variances. The resident-level primary outcome of agitation (continuous CMAI score) will be analysed at 16 months post randomisation using a linear two-level heteroscedastic regression model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], adjusting for design factors, with a contrast for intervention and control. The model will be adjusted for the following fixed effects: care home (level 2) covariates (home type and size, provision of dementia awareness training and hub) and resident (level 1) covariates (severity of dementia, age and baseline CMAI score). Unadjusted and adjusted ICCs, treatment effect estimates and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals will be presented.</p><p>For residents where a PAS and an abridged CMAI score are also available, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted replacing the CMAI score in the primary analysis with the PAS and abridged CMAI scores looking for consistency in the size and direction of effect.</p><p>Secondary outcome measures will be analysed using a similar modelling strategy as described for the primary analysis. Where outcomes are continuous, linear models will be fitted; where binary, logistic models will be fitted. Change in primary and secondary outcomes over time (6 and 16 months) will be analysed with three-level multilevel models with contrasts for treatment, time and the treatment-by-time interaction, in which outcomes are nested within residents and care homes. A similar correlation structure will be assumed for care homes and residents, but correlation over time will also be considered at the outcome level.</p><p>A number of exploratory subgroup analyses are planned which will be specified in detail in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

The primary economic analysis will be a cost-utility analysis over 16 months presenting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) for intervention (UC&#x02009;+&#x02009;DCM&#x02122;) versus control (UC), with effects expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The analysis will adopt the health care and personal social services perspective. Analysis of the uncertainty surrounding the ICER will be undertaken using non-parametric bootstrap simulation (10,000 simulations) and presented on a cost-effectiveness plane and a Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curve (CEAC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>].

The assumption for the analysis will be that the local authority pays for the provision of care home care for residents. We will include a sensitivity analysis where a proportion of residents are considered to pay toward their care home costs. Researchers will collect health care resource use data for each resident participating in the trial at baseline, 6 and 16 months using individual care home records and care plans. This will be supplemented by care home-level data collection, which will enable some validation of individual-level data.

An independent Trial Steering Committee will be established to provide overall supervision of the trial, including trial progress, adherence to protocol, resident safety, and consideration of new information. The trial sponsor will ensure responsibility and accountability for trial conduct and procedures associated with the protocol. Individual care homes remain responsible for participant care as usual.

Two care homes (one in West Yorkshire, one in London), were recruited to the pilot 2 months ahead of start of the planned recruitment phase. Three review periods followed: the first focussed on care home screening and recruitment processes, the second assessed trial burden to participants, and the third adherence to determine if data collection needed to be adapted or reduced. The trial procedures described above were followed, and experiences reviewed by the trial team. The changes made are summarised below. Pilot homes will be included in the final analysis.</p><sec id="Sec38"><title>Screening and recruitment review</title><p>One change made as a result of this review was improvement to the Case Report Forms (CRFs). Changes to the content and structure of some CRFs and creation of new forms ensured that all CRFs reflected actual processes and procedures that the researchers needed to follow to accurately complete the complex screening and recruitment process. A second change was made to care home eligibility criteria. Originally, the criteria stated that to be eligible a care home should have a minimum of 24 permanent residents of whom at least 60 % were estimated to have dementia. However, this did not always ensure that recruited care homes would be able to provide an adequate number of trial participants. For example, large residential homes where the general resident population did not include many people with dementia, but contained a smaller specialist dementia unit failed to reach the threshold of 60 % of residents with dementia within the care home overall but could still achieve a viable cluster size of residents with dementia within the specialist unit. Likewise, in smaller homes, an adequate cluster of eligible residents was not always available when both the 24 permanent residents and the &#x02018;60 % of residents with dementia&#x02019; criteria were met, due to eligibility exclusions based on other, resident-level, criteria. This was particularly the case for nursing homes where residents had a range of significant additional physical health problems. On the other hand, the criteria also led to the exclusion of some smaller dementia-specialist care homes that would have been able to provide an adequate cluster size despite having less than 24 permanent residents in total. As a result, care home eligibility criteria were replaced with the following:</p><p>&#x02022; Has a sufficient number of permanent residents with dementia (based on a formal diagnosis or Functional Assessment Staging of Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease (FAST) score of 4+) eligible to participate in the study in order to achieve a minimum of 10 residents registered to take part prior to care home randomisation</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Burden review</title><p>The burden review was undertaken shortly after the return of the baseline measures. Researchers and relatives/friends were asked to provide details of the time taken to collect each of the measures. A review of the mean, mode and range of time taken to complete each questionnaire was completed (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The number of returned relative/friend measures was low and the data on time taken to completion was varied and inconsistent.

However, the researchers advised that proxy measures could be completed with a staff member in multiple sessions of 15&#x02013;20 min over one or more days and longer completion times were often associated with staff choosing to provide detailed responses to measure items. Therefore, given the necessity of each of the individual measures within the trial, it was not possible to identify a suitable way to reduce this burden in any meaningful way.</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Adherence</title><p>Only two residents of a possible 26 (7.7 %) did not complete self-report measures; one declined to answer any of the item questions at all and one stopped half way through the administration of the first questionnaire. It was judged that the burden on the residents was not overly demanding and that the measures used were likely to be completed by a majority of trial participants. Therefore, no changes were made to the number of measures administered with residents. The researchers identified two questions in the QOL-AD that appeared to be causing anxiety/distress to some residents and were leading to missing data on these items. The items related to a question about satisfaction with management of their own finances (which the resident may no longer be in control of) and relationship with the residents spouse (who may no longer be alive). Thus, a modified version of the QOL-AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>] specifically designed for use with people with dementia in care homes was identified and implemented. It excludes the two questions causing distress and includes four additional questions on relationships with staff, ability to live with others, taking care of yourself and the ability to make choices in your life.</p><p>Other changes to the protocol implemented following the pilot include a modification to the randomisation stratification criteria which originally included &#x02018;use of DCM&#x02122; in the home over the last 18 months to 5 years&#x02019; and replacing it with &#x02018;recruitment hub&#x02019; to ensure spread of intervention homes across the three hubs, removing a possible regional effect. The staff measures collection process has been adapted to include the option for staff to post their questionnaires directly back to the CTRU, as some staff stated they felt uncomfortable leaving their replies in the care home where other members of staff might have access to them. Lastly, an additional process of reminding intervention homes of an upcoming mapping cycle by text message was implemented, in addition to sending of newsletters and intervention paperwork via the post, to increase potential intervention implementation.</p><p>To conclude, the pilot proved valuable for the researchers to implement proposed trial processes and documentation and to suggest adaptations, which have been implemented in a timely manner. This has been important in ensuring smooth running of the trial once recruitment rates have increased.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Trial status</title><p>This is the protocol of a current trial; recruitment of participants is on-going.</p></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Additional notes</title><p>A Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) checklist is included for this protocol (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) checklist</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1416_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Trial sponsor</title><p>Leeds Beckett University</p><p>University Research Office</p><p>James Graham Building</p><p>Headingley Campus</p><p>Leeds Beckett University</p><p>Leeds</p><p>LS6 3QS</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BSC, behaviours that staff may find challenging to support; CDR, Clinical Dementia Rating Scale; CMAI, Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory; CRF, Case Report Form; CTRU, Clinical Trials Research Unit; DCM&#x02122;, Dementia Care Mapping&#x02122;; DEMQOL-Proxy, Dementia Quality of Life measure &#x02013; proxy version; EAT, Environmental Audit Tool; FAST, Functional Assessment Staging of Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease; GHQ-12, General Health Questionnaire &#x02013; 12-item; GLHC, Group Living Home Characteristics; ICC, intracluster correlation coefficient; ICER, Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio; MAR, Missing at Random; MNAR, Missing Not at Random; NICE, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; NMB, Net Monetary Benefit; NPI, Neuropsychiatric Inventory; PAS, Pittsburgh Agitation Scale; PPI, Patient and Public Involvement; QALY, quality-adjusted life year; QOL-AD, Quality of Life in Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease measure; QUALID, Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia; QUIS, Quality of Interactions Schedule; RCT, randomised controlled trial; SAE, serious adverse event; SCIDS, Sense of Competence in Dementia Care Staff scale; UC, Usual Care</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec45"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1416_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments.
