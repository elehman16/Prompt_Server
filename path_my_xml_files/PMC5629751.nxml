Accordingly, we conducted a phase 1 multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate decitabine pre-treatment before standard induction therapy in children with newly diagnosed AML to assess safety and tolerability and explore a number of biologic endpoints.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Twenty-four patients were fully assessable for all study objectives per protocol (10 in Arm A = epigenetic priming induction, 14 in Arm B = standard induction). All patients experienced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The most common grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic adverse events observed were gastrointestinal toxicities and hypophosphatemia. Plasma decitabine PK were similar to previously reported adult data. Overall CR/CRi was similar for the two arms. MRD negativity at end-induction was 85% in Arm A versus 67% in Arm B patients. DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood over the course of treatment tracked with blast clearance and matched marrow aspirates at day 0 and day 21. Unlike end-induction marrow analyses, promoter methylation in blood identified an apparent reversal of response in the lone treatment failure, 1&#x000a0;week prior to the patient&#x02019;s marrow aspirate confirming non-response. Decitabine-induced effects on end-induction (day 35&#x02013;43 following initiation of treatment) marrows in Arm A were reflected by changes in DNA methylation in matched paired marrow diagnostic aspirates.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">This first-in-pediatrics trial demonstrates that decitabine prior to standard combination chemotherapy is feasible and well tolerated in children with newly diagnosed AML. Pre-treatment with decitabine may represent a newer therapeutic option for pediatric AML, especially as it appears to induce important epigenetic alterations. The novel biological correlates studied in this trial offer a clinically relevant window into disease progression and remission. Additional studies are needed to definitively assess whether decitabine can enhance durability responses in children with AML.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">

Historically, the most widely used induction therapy included 7&#x000a0;days of cytarabine plus 3&#x000a0;days of anthracycline (known as &#x0201c;7&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;3&#x0201d;). With this approach, 75&#x02013;80% of children with AML achieve CR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Subsequently, the addition of a third agent such as etoposide to 7&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;3 (ADE), along with expanded supportive care measures, has led to higher remission induction rates of approximately 85%. Of patients who do not attain remission, approximately one-half have resistant leukemia and a substantial proportion will die from complications of the disease or treatment. Thus, there is a need to develop new treatment strategies to improve outcomes for these patients.</p><p id="Par29">Pediatric tumors have been shown to have lower mutation burdens than adult tumors, and many of these mutations occur in the plethora of known epigenetic complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, significant aberrant DNA methylation is also observed in pediatric cancers such as AML including in patients with the poorest risk sub-types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These studies argue for the importance of identifying novel epigenetic therapies that target both histone and/or DNA methylation modifications. Specifically, reversal of promoter DNA hypermethylation and associated gene silencing is an attractive therapeutic approach in adult cancers. The DNA methylation inhibitors decitabine and azacitidine are efficacious for hematological neoplasms at lower, less toxic, doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Experimentally, high doses induce rapid DNA damage and cytotoxicity, which do not explain the prolonged response observed in adult patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Studies have consistently shown that transient low doses of DNA demethylating agents exert durable anti-tumor effects on hematological and epithelial tumor cells and can therefore serve as a &#x0201c;priming&#x0201d; agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated that DNA hypomethylating agents can sensitize/prime resistant cancer cells to cytotoxic agents in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and can enhance chemosensitivity of human leukemia cells to cytarabine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, pre-treatment with a DNA hypomethylating agent may increase the efficacy of pediatric AML induction therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, to date, there are no studies demonstrating the safety, tolerability, or efficacy of decitabine in combination with conventional multi-agent chemotherapy for AML in children. We report here the first phase 1 clinical evaluation of decitabine in children with newly diagnosed AML as a feasibility study to determine the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy when used as epigenetic priming agent before induction chemotherapy. In addition to assessing toxicity and morphologic remission, this study examined decitabine pharmacokinetics and minimal residual disease (MRD) impact. We also performed global DNA methylation analysis to examine how decitabine priming impacted the methylome in end-induction marrows when compared with matched diagnostic marrow baseline controls. We believe that this feasibility study was essential prior to longer-term studies assessing whether epigenetic-directed therapy in pediatric AML can lead to enhanced response rates or more durable responses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient eligibility</title><p id="Par30">Eligible patients were 1 to 16&#x000a0;years of age (inclusive), had histologically confirmed de novo AML with &#x0003e;&#x02009;20% bone marrow blasts, and adequate cardiac function (defined as ejection fraction &#x0003e;&#x02009;50% or shortening fraction &#x0003e;&#x02009;26%). Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (FAB M3 subtype), symptomatic CNS involvement, white blood cell count over 100,000/&#x003bc;l, significant renal or hepatic disease, any prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy for AML, known HIV infection, history of CML, and congenital syndromes known to predispose to AML (for example, Down syndrome, Fanconi anemia, Kostmann syndrome, or Diamond-Blackfan anemia) were excluded.</p><p id="Par31">The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at participating sites and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice, and all local and federal regulatory guidelines. A parent or legal guardian provided written informed consent, with patient assent as appropriate according to institutional requirements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par32">This multicenter, open-label study randomized patients to one of two arms: either 5&#x000a0;days of decitabine followed by standard induction chemotherapy with cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide (Arm A = DADE), or standard induction chemotherapy with cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide without decitabine (Arm B = ADE). The trial was listed under <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier NCT00943553. Twenty-five children age 1&#x02013;16&#x000a0;years with newly diagnosed de novo AML were randomized to receive either Arm A or Arm B. Given the feasibility nature of the study, sample size was selected based on the likelihood of how many patients might be accrued in a reasonable time frame so that future studies could be planned. Patients were stratified by age group and then randomized within each stratum in a 1:1 ratio by an Interactive Voice Response System via a random number generator. Three age strata were used: 1 to &#x0003c;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;years, 2&#x02013;11&#x000a0;years, and 12&#x02013;16&#x000a0;years, with efforts made to balance enrollment among the age groups.</p><p id="Par33">All patients received one cycle of study treatment, which consisted of 15 (Arm A) or 10 (Arm B) days of chemotherapy followed by a 4-week observation period, in the absence of clinically significant disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient/guardian choice to discontinue participation. Patients were not pre-medicated prior to the first dose of decitabine; however, all other supportive care measures were allowed according to institutional standards.

Of all DML in Arm A, 4134 were hypomethylated and 2856 were hypermethylated. In Arm B, 785 DML were hypomethylated and 305 were hypermethylated. There were 795 DML (438 genes) common to both arms. Although about 80% of genes altered by DNA methylation in Arm B were common to Arm A, there were significantly more probes altered for a given gene in Arm A. Moreover, 78% of hypomethylated probes in Arm B were common with Arm A, compared with 56% of hypermethylated probes common between treatment arms. The median delta-beta values for Arms A and B were &#x02212;&#x02009;0.27 and &#x02212;&#x02009;0.28, respectively, indicating modest overall hypomethylation induced by either treatment regimen at the specified delta-beta cutoff. Forty-one percent of DML were hypermethylated after decitabine therapy compared with 28% after chemotherapy only. Regional and functional CpG distribution of DML after therapy in both treatment arms was also examined. Functional distribution relates CpG position to transcription start sites (TSS) &#x02212;&#x02009;200 to &#x02212;&#x02009;1500&#x000a0;bp, 5&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR), and exon 1 for coding genes as well as gene bodies. In both treatment arms, gene body hypermethylation was the most frequent change, followed by gene body hypomethylation and TSS 200 hypomethylation (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S2). Regional distribution of DML was assessed based on proximity to the closest CpG island. In addition to CpG islands, shores are 0&#x02013;2&#x000a0;kb from CpG islands, shelves are 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;kb away, and open sea regions are isolated loci without a designation. CpG island hypomethylation occurred in greater than 68% of DML in both groups.

In these cases, pre- and post-treatment samples co-clustered with its matching sample. One case in Arm A and Arm B clustered with diagnostic marrows, suggesting the marrow was possibly unaffected by therapy, and indeed, the sample in Arm A (1006_1004) was from a patient with stable disease. Overall, these data indicate that decitabine therapy has an epigenetic effect on the recovering end-induction marrow in AML. This was evident when compared with Arm B samples, where DNA methylation was more heterogeneous after standard chemotherapy treatment.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Hierarchical clustering of differentially methylated loci (DML) in Arm A (decitabine + chemotherapy) and Arm B (chemotherapy alone). <bold>a</bold> unsupervised clustering analysis of 6990 DML in Arm A (left panel) and 1090 DML in Arm B (right panel) revealed separation of end of induction recovering marrows at week 3 from screening marrows. <bold>b</bold> Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the top 0.1% most variable loci by standard deviation also separated screening marrows from end of induction recovery marrows at week 3</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13148_2017_411_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

The results trended toward non-inferiority of morphologic and immunophenotypic response, although the small sample size limited statistical analyses. There was also evidence of decitabine-induced effects in end-induction bone marrow aspirates compared with those obtained at diagnosis. Children treated with decitabine as a single agent for 5&#x000a0;days prior to conventional cytotoxic therapy did not have rapid progression of their leukemic burden during the pre-phase, further supporting the feasibility and safety of this approach. Based on these results, a priming dose of 20&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> daily for 5&#x000a0;days could be considered for further testing.</p><p id="Par57">Most non-hematologic AEs reported in this study were mild to moderate in severity, and the safety profile of decitabine in children with AML was consistent with that seen in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In the adult study, Scandura and colleagues evaluated a different backbone chemotherapy regimen than the one used in this trial; however, their study population also included patients with less than favorable risk factors and showed that decitabine induced DNA hypomethylation and complete responses in a high percent of patients. No previously unreported decitabine toxicities were observed in pediatric patients. Drug-related hematologic toxicity, anorexia, and asymptomatic grade 3 hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia were slightly more common in decitabine-treated patients.</p><p id="Par58">This trial was not powered to detect a difference in response between the two arms, and treatment with decitabine prior to standard induction therapy resulted in a similar morphological response compared to standard induction therapy. Of note, there were more high-risk cytogenetic patients in the decitabine arm (4 versus 0), which may indicate a benefit for decitabine priming in these patients. Patients in this study were generally representative of children with de novo childhood AML in regard to age, gender, and biologic features; however, there were slightly more patients with <italic>WT1</italic> and <italic>CEBP</italic>A mutations than previously reported. There was a non-significant trend toward a longer time to recover neutrophil and platelet counts in the decitabine-treated patients, but the 95% confidence intervals were overlapping in all analyses, and the total sample number was small.&#x000a0;No AEs or SAEs were noted as a result of delays in count recovery. These results suggest that exposure to decitabine may have important implications for sensitizing potentially resistant leukemic clones to cytotoxic chemotherapy, resulting in deeper remissions predictive of more favorable outcomes. Larger randomized studies are needed to confirm these findings.</p><p id="Par59">Notwithstanding the fact that the cellular composition of remission marrows differs from that of screening marrows, alterations in DNA methylation patterns in end-induction bone marrow between the two groups of patients suggest important consequences of exposure to decitabine priming on hematopoietic recovery after exposure to intensive chemotherapy. Our data suggest that while chemotherapy alone may have an effect on DNA methylation, the effect is clearly augmented by the addition of decitabine via epigenetic changes that may impact both leukemic, normal hematopoietic progenitors, as well as bone-marrow stromal cells. Additionally, an increased percentage of DMLs were hypermethylated in patients receiving decitabine compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone, suggesting that decitabine has an effect beyond DNA demethylation.</p><p id="Par60">Furthermore, the data suggest that decitabine therapy can be used to measure patient response to therapy by assessing DNA methylation status of specific promoter regions non-invasively in blood. MRD data did not differ between patients in the different arms, but whether or not DNA methylation assessment can serve as a more predictive and sensitive approach to measuring MRD/patient response warrants further investigation. Pathway analysis of differentially methylated genes revealed a number of pathways implicated to neuronal signaling in the decitabine-treated arm only. While the implications of neuronal signaling are not currently clear, we postulate it must be related to the bone marrow niche post-treatment since no dorsal root ganglia or other neuronal tissue exist in the marrow. Presumably, this could be due to ion channel currents that play an important role in bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and hematopoietic progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Our observations further suggest that monitoring changes in normal progenitors may be important in understanding the short- and longer-term consequences of exposure to methyltransferase inhibitors on malignant and normal bone marrow progenitors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par61">The toxicity and PK results observed in the patients in this study suggest that decitabine can be safely combined with standard doses and schedules of anticancer agents in children with newly diagnosed AML. Furthermore, our data suggest that this regimen alters DNA methylation compared to ADE chemotherapy alone, and patients treated with decitabine could have minimal residual disease measured by assessing DNA methylation status of specific promoter regions. Preclinical studies have shown additive or synergistic activity when decitabine is combined with a variety of other anticancer therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and results from trials such as this provide further evidence of feasibility, safety, and possible strategies for larger randomized trials in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent/refractory leukemia, as well as in the minimal disease state during post-remission follow-up. No excess or unexpected toxicities were seen. The most common drug-related grade 3 or grade 4 AEs were hematologic and PK/PD were as expected. Complete remission rates were similar. Patients treated with decitabine prior to conventional chemotherapy had distinct changes in DNA methylation, which may be of interest for further mechanistic study. In conclusion, epigenetic therapy with decitabine is safe for use in children, and the clinical findings together with molecular correlative studies suggest that there may be early signs of enhanced efficacy. However, further studies are needed to definitively determine the long-term patient outcomes of decitabine priming in children with AML.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
