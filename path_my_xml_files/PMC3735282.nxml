In the USA, an examination of the <italic>Medical Expenditure Panel Survey</italic> for the year 2000 revealed a total direct-cost estimate of US$7 billion with a mean cost per care episode of US$1667 and US$3011 for outpatient and hospital-based settings, respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijgm-6-641">3</xref></p><p>Shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS) is a common cause of shoulder pain and dysfunction and is typically caused by an impingement of the rotator cuff tendon under the acromion,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijgm-6-641">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijgm-6-641">5</xref> although other pathologies may contribute.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijgm-6-641">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijgm-6-641">7</xref> Initial treatment of SIS is conservative and consists of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and supervised physical therapy regimens,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijgm-6-641">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijgm-6-641">6</xref> with the goal of reducing pain and inflammation, healing the rotator cuff, and improving shoulder function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ijgm-6-641">8</xref> It has been estimated that about two-thirds of subjects with SIS will demonstrate a satisfactory response to NSAIDs and physical therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ijgm-6-641">8</xref> If symptoms persist, subacromial injection of lidocaine and a corticosteroid may be indicated to relieve pain and allow physical therapy to continue.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijgm-6-641">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijgm-6-641">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijgm-6-641">9</xref> However, despite their frequent use, a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials evaluating subacromial injection of corticosteroids for SIS concluded that these injections may provide a limited and short-term benefit.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijgm-6-641">10</xref></p><p>Pain control is an important first step in the treatment of SIS because fear of pain may contribute to the original pathology as a result of fear of movement, avoidance of movement, and eventual disuse.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijgm-6-641">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijgm-6-641">12</xref> Thus, pain and fear of pain must be removed as obstacles to participation in appropriate physical therapy and exercise programs. One possible adjunct in the management of SIS-associated pain is the heated lidocaine/tetracaine (70 mg/70 mg) patch (HLT patch) that contains a eutectic mixture of the two drugs and has an integrated oxygen-activated heating component that enhances the dermal delivery of the anesthetic agents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijgm-6-641">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijgm-6-641">14</xref> The HLT patch is approved in the USA and Europe and is indicated for use on intact skin to provide local dermal analgesia for superficial venous access and superficial dermatological procedures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijgm-6-641">14</xref> The depth and duration of anesthesia observed in a controlled study of the patch<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijgm-6-641">15</xref> suggest that it may be useful in the relief of pain associated with musculoskeletal structures lying close to the surface of the skin, as has been reported for other patches for the dermal delivery of local anesthetics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijgm-6-641">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijgm-6-641">19</xref> Thus, here we report an open-label pilot study that was designed to investigate the utility of the HLT patch in reducing pain and improving shoulder function in patients with SIS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Quorum Review Institutional Review Board (Seattle, WA, USA).

Additional inclusion criteria included tenderness at the site of rotator cuff tendons, positive Hawkins&#x02019; and Neer&#x02019;s signs, and an average pain score of &#x02265;4 on the zero- to ten-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijgm-6-641">20</xref> over the past 24 hours.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included topical pain medication applied to the treatment area within 3 days of the screening visit, use of injected pain medication within 14 days of the screening visit, allergies or contraindications to any of the study drug components, clinically significant illness within 14 days of the screening visit, use of any class I antiarrhythmic agent, history of severe hepatic disease, and participation in a study of an unapproved drug within 30 days of the screening visit.

At the screening visit, patients underwent a problem-based physical examination, and medical history and concomitant medication use were recorded. Enrolled patients were instructed to apply the HLT patch to the site of tenderness twice daily (about every 12 hours) for periods of 2 to 4 hours. Each evening, patients were instructed to record average and worst pain intensity during the previous 24 hours in their study diary using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijgm-6-641">20</xref> an eleven-point rating scale in which a score of 0 indicates no pain and a score of 10 represents the worst pain imaginable. Pain interference with general activity, normal work, and sleep during the previous 24 hours was also recorded using a similar eleven-point scale in which a score of 0 represents no interference and a score of 10 represents complete interference. In addition, they were instructed to record the use of any concomitant medications during the previous 24-hour period. Limits of internal rotation and abduction of the shoulder were assessed with a goniometer at baseline and on Day 14. On Day 14, patients were asked to grade their satisfaction of treatment by choosing one of the following categories: very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, no preference, satisfied, or very satisfied.</p><p>Patients were allowed to use acetaminophen for acute SIS pain that was not effectively treated by the HLT patch or for other minor pain (eg, headache). However, patients who used acetaminophen for SIS pain on two consecutive days were not included in the per-protocol population. NSAIDs were not allowed during the study, nor were any topically applied medications for the treatment of SIS pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>All 20 patients who enrolled in the study received at least one treatment with the HLT patch and were included in the safety population. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the study. Erythema at the application site was evaluated at the final study visit (Day 14) by medical personnel using a five-point scale (0 = no erythema, 1 = very slight erythema, 2 = well-defined erythema, 3 = moderate to severe erythema, 4 = severe erythema [beet redness] to slight eschar formations [injuries in depth]).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data analysis</title><p>This pilot study was designed to provide information to guide further research into the use of the HLT patch in the treatment of pain associated with SIS and was not powered for rigorous statistical analysis.

One patient was lost to follow-up due to incarceration. All patients were Caucasian. Seven patients were male and 13 were female. The average age of the patients was 51.2 &#x000b1; 10.8 years (range 31 to 75 years). The mean baseline average pain score was 5.5 &#x000b1; 1.1 (range 4 to 8). The per-protocol population included 18 subjects; one subject was lost to follow-up and provided no efficacy data, and one subject used acetaminophen on two or more consecutive days for SIS pain.</p><p>The effects of the HLT patch on measurement of SIS pain are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijgm-6-641">Table 1</xref>. In the per-protocol population, average and worst pain scores decreased by 2.4 &#x000b1; 2.0 and 3.7 &#x000b1; 2.7 points, respectively, from baseline to Day 14. Similar changes were seen for the pain interference scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijgm-6-641">Table 1</xref>). The cumulative response rate for percent decrease in average pain score (ie, percent improvement in average pain intensity) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijgm-6-641">Figure 1</xref>.

On Day 14, Grade 2 and Grade 1 erythema was observed in three and six patients, respectively. Other application-site AEs included irritation and pruritus in two patients each and dermatitis, induration, pain, rash, swelling, and urticaria in one patient each.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this pilot study of the initial treatment of patients with SIS, 2 weeks of treatment with the HLT patch resulted in improvement in pain scores, pain interference scores, and range of motion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijgm-6-641">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijgm-6-641">Figure 1</xref>). The majority of patients were &#x0201c;satisfied&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very satisfied&#x0201d; with the HLT patch. The HLT patch was generally well tolerated.</p><p>The magnitude of the pain response in the present study is within the range considered clinically meaningful. For example, Farrar et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijgm-6-641">20</xref> analyzed the results of ten double-blind studies of patients with pain that used an eleven-point numerical pain rating scale. In their analysis, a change of &#x02212;1.74 points or &#x02212;27.9% was associated with &#x0201c;much or very much&#x0201d; improvement. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijgm-6-641">Figure 1</xref>, two-thirds of the patients in the present study demonstrated at least a 30% decrease in average pain score, suggesting that the HLT patch produced clinically meaningful improvement in most patients.</p><p>Pain or fear of pain may directly contribute to the pathophysiology of SIS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijgm-6-641">12</xref> This concept, which has been described as the &#x0201c;fear-avoidance model&#x0201d; of musculoskeletal pain, is defined as a catastrophic misinterpretation of pain resulting in increased fear of pain, fear of movement, avoidance, and hypervigilance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijgm-6-641">12</xref> This behavior initiates and perpetuates a vicious cycle that leads to an elevation of chronic pain and long-term disability. Lentz et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijgm-6-641">12</xref> studied 142 subjects with unilateral shoulder disorders and assessed pain-related fear with the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia. They found that pain-related fear was statistically significantly associated with self-reported disability after controlling for demographics, pain intensity, and other physical impairment measures. Based on the fear-avoidance model theory, the reduction in pain observed in the present study may have had the direct effect of improvement in range of motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijgm-6-641">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Conservative therapy for SIS involves supervised physical therapy including stretching and gradual strengthening of the shoulder musculature.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijgm-6-641">21</xref> However, pain control is an essential component of a successful physical therapy program.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijgm-6-641">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijgm-6-641">21</xref> Initial pain management typically involves NSAIDs or acetaminophen,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijgm-6-641">9</xref> and if symptoms persist, a subacromial injection of corticosteroids can be administered in combination with a local anesthetic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijgm-6-641">9</xref></p><p>The term &#x0201c;shoulder impingement syndrome&#x0201d; is often used indiscriminately to describe various conditions of chronic shoulder pain or discomfort. The disease it describes is part of a continuum of rotator cuff tendinopathy characterized by mucoid degeneration, collagen loss, and disorganization.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijgm-6-641">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ijgm-6-641">23</xref> Histopathologic examinations of symptomatic rotator cuff tendons have inconsistently shown evidence of inflammation despite substantial degenerative changes in the tendons.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijgm-6-641">22</xref> Khan et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijgm-6-641">22</xref> failed to show histopathological evidence of inflammation, while Murphy and coworkers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijgm-6-641">7</xref> found significant elevation of CD45, a marker of inflammation, in biopsies of the supraspinatus tendon from patients with early stage rotator cuff tendinopathy but not in samples taken from patients with more advanced disease. In addition, immunohistochemical examination of subacromial bursa biopsy specimens from patients with rotator cuff disease shows a clear increase in inflammatory cytokines, as well as in cyclooxygenase 1 and 2, compared with specimens from subjects without SIS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijgm-6-641">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ijgm-6-641">25</xref></p><p>The pathophysiological processes that contribute to the pain of rotator cuff disease are many, and this variation may influence the response to treatment. The less-than-certain role of inflammation in the pathology of SIS calls into question the routine use of systemic NSAIDs, especially in view of their AE profile, and points to the need to explore alternative treatments that target different proposed mechanisms of pain. Other biochemical mediators that may influence nociceptors include glutamate and substance P.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijgm-6-641">26</xref> Local anesthetics, such as lidocaine and tetracaine, are known to relieve pain by inhibiting the depolarization and firing of sensory nerve fibers through sodium channel blockade and possibly targeting substance P/neurokinin-1 signaling via sodium channel blockade.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ijgm-6-641">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ijgm-6-641">28</xref> Additionally, high levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate have been identified by in situ microdialysis in patellar and Achilles tendinopathies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ijgm-6-641">29</xref> and elevated expression of the glutamate receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor type 1 has been associated with tendinopathies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijgm-6-641">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijgm-6-641">31</xref> The NMDA receptor is reported to be involved in chronic pain disorders, and both lidocaine and tetracaine inhibit this receptor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ijgm-6-641">32</xref> Thus, it is possible that the HLT patch might attenuate pain in part by blockade of the NMDA receptor. However, without data regarding receptor expression in SIS, this mechanism of action must remain speculative.</p><p>The HLT patch is designed to have its primary effect on the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, but the present results suggest a drug effect within deeper structures with increased duration of application and twice-daily dosing. Wallace et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijgm-6-641">15</xref> reported that a 30-minute application of a single HLT patch resulted in elimination of pain to a mean depth of 8.22 mm, with this peak effect occurring 60 minutes after HLT patch removal. Longer application times, as were used in the present study, might be expected to result in deeper penetration of the lidocaine and tetracaine. Other investigators have shown that topically applied agents can be detected in structures beneath the skin following application. For example, Sekiya et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijgm-6-641">33</xref> found similar concentrations of ketoprofen in semitendinosus muscle and tendon at 14 hours following the administration of either 40 mg by dermal patch or 150 mg administered as a single, sustained-release oral dose, even though mean ketoprofen plasma concentrations were 17-fold higher in patients who received oral doses.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study limitations</title><p>This study was open-label and of short duration. As no placebo-treated control group was included, it cannot be determined to what degree placebo response contributed to the observed outcomes in this study. Further controlled research is warranted before any firm conclusions can be drawn.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The latest consensus is that SIS most likely represents a rotator cuff tendinopathy. Given our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology relating to tendinopathies and pain, use of anti-inflammatory agents may not optimally target two recently implicated components of SIS pain: glutamate-NMDA signaling and substance P/neurokinin-1 signaling via sodium channel blockade. In this pilot study, patients with SIS demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement in pain intensity, pain interference scores, and range of motion after 14 days of treatment with the HLT patch, suggesting a potential role in this patient population. Further controlled research is warranted to fully characterize the efficacy and benefit&#x02013;risk profile of the HLT patch for the relief of pain associated with SIS.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank ZARS Pharma and Nuvo Research for the support provided for the development of this article.
