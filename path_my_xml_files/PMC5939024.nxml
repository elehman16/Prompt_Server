However, active periodontal therapy may lead to undesirable sequelae such as gingival recession or exposure of dentinal tubules, which leads to the development of dentin hypersensitivity (DH). Pain arising due to the exposed root surface is a most common complaint of the patients after undergoing periodontal therapy.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Although root sensitivity is most common complaint, there is limited clinical research devoted to their treatment.</p><p>According to Addy <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and Canadian Consensus Document (2003),[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] DH is defined as pain derived from exposed dentin in response to chemical, thermal, tactile, or osmotic stimuli which cannot be explained as arising from any other dental defect or pathology. Since DH after periodontal therapy occurring due to denudation of root surfaces is a different condition, the term &#x0201c;root sensitivity&#x0201d; is more commonly used.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Although many studies or systematic reviews have been published indicating high prevalence of root sensitivity, but very few are aimed at intervening the problem.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Lin and Gillam in a systematic review reported that the prevalence of root sensitivity following periodontal therapy was 36.8% after 1<sup>st</sup> week, 33.4% after 2<sup>nd</sup> week, and 29.6% after 4<sup>th</sup> week of the periodontal surgical procedures.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In spite of larger prevalence rates, there is a scarcity of clinical trials aimed at treating them. It can be said that although being most common postoperative finding, it is the most neglected and taken for granted aspect in clinical research.</p><p>Multiple treatment modalities have been used for the treatment of root sensitivity, which have shown variable results. The most commonly used are topical desensitizing agents, but these are not predictable. Over the last decade, these procedures have been supported by a laser-assisted treatment, often combined with topical agents.</p><p>Diode lasers can be used either by direct or indirect method in the treatment of DH. Direct method involves only laser irradiation over the area affected and indirect method involves the application of certain chemical agents followed by laser irradiation of the affected area.</p><p>For the indirect method, commonly used chemical agents are those containing the fluoride ions such as sodium fluoride and stannous fluoride (SnF<sub>2</sub>). The indirect method is based on the idea of combining the advantages of laser and fluoride therapy, thereby achieving as durable results as possible. Fluoride application along with laser helps in the occlusion of the melted dentin due to thermal effects of laser.</p><p>High-power lasers are known to act by, melting that occurs as a result of heat transmission. This interaction results in fusion and resolidification of dentin, with the consequent effect of sealing and reducing the diameter of the dentinal tubules. Thus, the use of combination therapy seems justified where lasers cause melting of dentinal tubules and fluoride agent helping in the formation of calcific barrier.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Low-power lasers do not emit heat and stimulate the normality of cell functions. They act by changing the electrical potential of the cell membrane, activating the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pumps, leading to increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, and bringing about analgesic, potential anti-inflammatory and biomodulation benefits to the cells.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] There is a possibility that low-power lasers may obliterate the dentinal tubules by the effect of photobiomodulation on dental pulp, due to an increase in cellular metabolic activity of the odontoblasts, so that they intensify the production of tertiary dentin.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In addition, it is not known that whether the combination of low-power lasers and fluoride is as effective as the combination of high-power lasers and fluoride therapy.</p><p>Thus, this randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was designed to compare and evaluate the effect of low-power diode lasers with and without topical application of SnF<sub>2</sub> gel in the treatment of DH after conventional access periodontal flap surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 30 patients (14 males, 16 females age range 30&#x02013;55 years) diagnosed with chronic periodontitis and indicated for conventional access flap surgery after phase I therapy, complaining of DH after surgery on the 7<sup>th</sup> postoperative day were selected for the study from the Outpatient Department of Periodontology [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

The results of the systematic review report that root sensitivity is most prevalent during the 1<sup>st</sup> postoperative week.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Thus, the availability of treatment that reduces or eliminates DH within a period of 24&#x02013;48 h would be ideal. Thus, this study was conducted with the aim to treat root sensitivity occurring after periodontal surgery.</p><p>Lasers have been used to treat DH, but in recent year, low-level diode laser has been evaluated and has shown immediate efficacy. Although many different lasers have been evaluated, diode lasers have emerged as more popular form because of their ease in availability and subsequent low cost for treatment. Diode lasers can be used mainly in two forms, which are direct and indirect method, respectively. The direct method involves only the use of lasers and indirect method involves application of certain chemical agents and then irradiating the area with the lasers.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Hypothesis behind the use of fluoride agent in indirect method is that it forms calcium fluoride crystals which are deposited on the open dentinal tubules giving the added advantage of blocking the tubules.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Sodium fluoride is the most commonly used fluoride agent. Results from the previous study have demonstrated significant improvement after using combination of lasers and NaF, but there are some limitations. NaF is known to cause soluble crystals of calcium fluoride that are susceptible to mechanical action or by the action of saliva. Thus, SnF<sub>2</sub> has been evaluated as an alternative agent. SnF<sub>2</sub> also acts by the same mechanism but forms insoluble precipitates of calcium fluoride that are resistant to abrasion. Another added advantage of using SnF<sub>2</sub> is that one-time application of SnF<sub>2</sub> is known to form calcium fluoride crystals within seconds.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, the mean VRS and VAS scores at baseline were not significant which suggest that there was no difference between the three groups and all the pain scores were of the same level. The results of the present study suggest that in both test Group I and test Group II, there was immediate reduction in pain scores after 15 min suggesting the immediate efficacy of lasers. These results are in accordance with previous studies done by Kumar and Mehta [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and Doshi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] wherein they found that lasers had an immediate reduction of root sensitivity. With respect to control group, no reduction in pain scores were noted even though lasers were used as a placebo. This suggests that lasers are effective in immediate reduction of root sensitivity and thus makes them more acceptable form of treatment as there are currently no available topical agents that provide immediate reduction in root sensitivity. In addition, it can be said that in the present study no placebo effect was noted in control group where lasers irradiation was provided without activating the lasers. However, literature suggests that there is some controversy regarding the effect of placebo in DH. Some studies concluded that there is no effect of placebo, whereas some reported that there is possible placebo effect.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, after 15 days and after 30 days, significant results were obtained in all the three groups suggesting that there is a gradual reduction in the root sensitivity after periodontal therapy. The results of the present study are in accordance with the previous reports where gradual reduction in root sensitivity is found over 1 month after periodontal therapy.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] However, the mean reduction of VRS and VAS scores were better in both test group suggesting improved outcomes are obtained after the therapy. These results are comparable to the previous trial conducted by Sicilia <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] where they found that root sensitivity was significantly reduced in all three groups after 1 month.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>The results of the present study suggest that reduction in root sensitivity obtained by lasers and combination of laser with fluoride remains stable for 30 days. These findings are comparable to the previous study done by Yilmaz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] where they found that GaAlAs laser and NaF varnish treatments resulted in a significant reduction in the VAS scores immediately compared to the baseline and placebo treatments and remained stable for longer period of 6 months.</p><p>In the present study, on comparing two test groups after 15 min, at 15 days, and 30 days, it was found that there was no difference between them suggesting that in the present study there was no added advantage obtained after SnF<sub>2</sub> application. These results are in accordance to a previous study done by Raichur <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] where they compared the effect of diode laser alone with diode laser and SnF<sub>2</sub> combination and with potassium nitrate paste. They found that mean reduction was more pronounced in only diode laser group as compared to other two groups. This might have occurred due to inability of SnF<sub>2</sub> to form a calcific barrier, which has been shown in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. It can be said that 0.4% SnF<sub>2</sub> might just not be sufficient enough to form calcific barrier and further studies using higher concentration should be conducted. Another reason can be the methodological difficulty in assessment of pain score where a minor difference of 0.6 is contemplated as statistically significant. However, this is just a possibility and further histological study should be conducted to infer a strong conclusion.</p><p>In the present study, both test groups showed improvement in pain scores in comparison to control group although results were not significant after 15 and 30 days. However, there are many contradictory studies regarding the efficacy of lasers in the treatment of root sensitivity this is because of no general consensus regarding the use of laser parameters and their frequency of application.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Thus, to strengthen the evidence regarding the efficacy of lasers and to draw the attention of researchers toward the most neglected aspect, that is, root sensitivity which might negatively influence the patients' compliance and hamper the postsurgical results, this study was conducted.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>
