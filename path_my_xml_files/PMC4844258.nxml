It was suggested that the substrates of P-glycoprotein or cytochrome P450 3A4 were reduced on a high sodium diet. This study aimed to investigate the influence of high sodium diet on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of fimasartan, which is a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4 but not P-glycoprotein. The study design was a two-diet, two-period, two-sequence, randomized, open-label, and crossover with 1-week washout for diet. Eligible subjects were fed with either low sodium (50 mEq/day) diet or high sodium diet (300 mEq/day) for 7 days in the first hospitalization period and the other diet in the second period. On the seventh morning of each period, subjects received a single dose of fimasartan 60 mg in a fasted state. The serial plasma concentrations of fimasartan, serum aldosterone concentration (SAC), and plasma renin activity (PRA) were measured for pharmacokinetic&#x02013;pharmacodynamic analysis. Sixteen subjects completed the study satisfying the compliance test for diets. Although the mean systemic exposure of fimasartan is slightly (&#x02248;10%) decreased on a high sodium diet, the difference was not statistically or clinically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). The SAC and PRA after fimasartan administration were highly dependent on their baseline levels. The dietary sodium content influenced the baseline of SAC and PRA, but did not influence the ratio change of SAC and PRA after fimasartan treatment. The ratio change of SAC after fimasartan treatment was correlated to the systemic exposure of fimasartan (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), while the correlation between the ratio change of PRA after fimasartan treatment and the individual systemic exposure of fimasartan was not significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). In conclusion, the pharmacokinetics of fimasartan and ratio changes of SAC and PRA after fimasartan treatment were not significantly influenced by dietary sodium content.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>aldosterone</kwd><kwd>renin activity</kwd><kwd>angiotensin receptor blocker</kwd><kwd>aldosterone</kwd><kwd>renin</kwd><kwd>cytochrome P450 3A4</kwd><kwd>P-glycoprotein</kwd><kwd>healthy</kwd><kwd>sodium diet</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The renin&#x02013;angiotensin system (RAS) performs a critical role in the homeostatic regulation of body fluid volume, electrolyte balance, and blood pressure. A low sodium diet (LSD) is one of the stimulating factors of the RAS, and the RAS activation is an important physiological mechanism to guard against blood pressure lowering in a low sodium intake condition.<xref rid="b1-dddt-10-1525" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Therefore, the RAS blockers have been known to enhance the blood pressure-lowering effect on a low sodium intake.<xref rid="b2-dddt-10-1525" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4-dddt-10-1525" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>On the other hand, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of several drugs are also sometimes influenced by dietary sodium intake. High dietary sodium intake had been reported to be related to 20%&#x02013;60% reduction of the oral bioavailability in some cardiovascular drugs, such as verapamil, atenolol, and quinidine, which are substrates of energy-dependent intestinal efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and intestinal metabolic enzyme cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) as reported from the previous clinical studies in humans.<xref rid="b5-dddt-10-1525" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-dddt-10-1525" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The prolonged hypertonic stress in the intestinal mucosal epithelial cells increases the expression of transporters or enzymes, including P-gp and CYP3A, which are involved in raising the intracellular level of compatible osmolytes in the previous in vitro and in vivo studies using human intestinal cell lines and rats.<xref rid="b8-dddt-10-1525" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-dddt-10-1525" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Therefore, modulation of intestinal P-gp and/or CYP3A activities has been suggested as the major mechanism to reduce the bioavailability of those drugs on a high sodium diet (HSD).<xref rid="b6-dddt-10-1525" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Recently, Azizi et al<xref rid="b10-dddt-10-1525" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> reported that the systemic exposure of candersartan, which is a substrate of P-gp but not CYP3A, wa&#x0015d;30% lower on a HSD compared to on a LSD, while no such reduction was observed with valsartan and ramipril, which are neither substrate of P-gp nor CYP3A. These findings suggest that 1) the solitary modulation of intestinal P-gp activity by a high sodium intake could be a significant mechanism of the decreased bioavailability of a drug even without the modulation of CYP3A4 activity and that 2) some of the RAS blockers, such as candesartan, might have more prominent intra-subject variability in the clinical efficacy due to their pharmacokinetic change by dietary sodium content. If the bioavailability of a RAS blocker is reduced by a HSD, it might be a practically important issue. Because the reduction in the clinical efficacy of the RAS blockers when on a HSD is generally reported as a physiologic class even in the RAS blocker whose bioavailability is not affected by dietary sodium intake,<xref rid="b11-dddt-10-1525" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> a RAS blocker which has reduced bioavailability when on a HSD might have additionally lower, sometimes insufficient, clinical efficacy compared to other RAS blockers.</p><p>Fimasartan is a nonpeptide angiotensin II antagonist with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor selectivity. Although the pharmacologic mechanism is comparable to candersartan, fimasartan is known to be a substrate of CYP3A but not a substrate of P-gp unlike candersartan.<xref rid="b12-dddt-10-1525" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Thus, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the influence of sodium intake on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of fimasartan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study population</title><p>The subjects eligible for this study were healthy normotensive Korean male volunteers, aged 20&#x02013;45 years, weighing between 50 and 90 kg and with a body mass index between 19 and 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

All the subjects experienced both 1 week of LSD and HSD periods with 1-week washout interval. The order of the periods (LSD &#x02192; HSD or HSD &#x02192; LSD) of each individual was randomly assigned with a ratio of 1:1. The identical sodium restricted diets (50 mEq/day) with fixed calories and composition of nutrients (2,300 kcal with 60%&#x02013;65% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 20%&#x02013;25% fat) were served twice for subjects in the LSD and HSD periods. To induce HSD, subjects were additionally given sodium tablets (250 mmol/day) for 7 days in the HSD period. On the seventh morning of each period, subjects orally received a single dose of fimasartan 60 mg with ~240 mL of water in the fasting state. The excreted amounts of sodium, potassium, and creatinine in urine for 24 hours were measured on the sixth (baseline) and seventh day (fimasartan treatment) of each period to assess the compliance for having diets and sodium tablets. It was judged for subjects to be in a good compliance if their urinary excreted sodium amount is &#x02264;100 mmol/day in the LSD period and &#x02265;200 mmol/day in the HSD period. The pharmacokinetic blood samples to determine the plasma fimasartan concentrations were serially obtained before dose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dose on the seventh day. The pharmacodynamic blood samples to determine the serum aldosterone concentration (SAC) and plasma renin activity (PRA) were obtained not only before dose and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours on the seventh day but also at the equivalently scheduled timepoints on the sixth day for the baseline assessment.

However, the relationship between the baseline versus after treatment was more fittable to the hyperbolic regression curve than the linear regression line, suggesting that PRA could be saturated after fimasartan treatment in some individuals whose PRA before treatment had been already highly enhanced by the LSD status. An explainable mechanism for this saturated phenomenon might be the negative feedback on the renin production by a direct action of increased angiotensin II level in response to the angiotensin II receptor blockade.<xref rid="b20-dddt-10-1525" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> No correlation between the AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub> h ratios of PRA after fimasartan treatment and systemic exposure of fimasartan in this study seems to be due to this saturated phenomenon of PRA.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The present study had some limitations due to its open-label, single-dose design, and small-sized population with younger healthy normotensive subjects. Although these experimental conditions of the study efficiently contributed to describe the effect of dietary sodium content on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of fimasartan, the results of this study could not be directly generalized to the hypertensive patients with long-term treatment of fimasartan. The study results would be scientifically more robust, if a positive or negative control drug, such as candesartan or valsartan, was applied in the study. The effect of the body fluid status change, one of the confounding factors of dietary sodium intake, was not eliminated from the study results, because the observations of body fluid status change via repeated body weight measurements or water consumption restriction were not performed in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The effect of solitary modulation of intestinal CYP3A4 by a high sodium intake did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of fimasartan. The pharmacodynamics of fimasartan was highly dependent on the baseline level of RAS activation, which is influenced by dietary sodium intake, and no additional reduction on the ratio change of SAC and PRA after fimasartan treatment was found when on a high sodium intake. Further investigations are needed to evaluate the effect of dietary sodium intake on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of fimasartan in the hypertensive patients with long-term treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was sponsored by Boryung Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea.
