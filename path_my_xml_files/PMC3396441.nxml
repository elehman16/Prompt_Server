Nut consumption has positive effects on various cardiovascular disease risk factors, including improvements in triglycerides, total cholesterol (TC)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3"><sup>5</sup></xref>, and LDL cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Moreover, nut consumption in observational studies is associated with a lower risk of developing coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Despite these benefits, many individuals attempting to lose weight may consciously avoid consuming nuts because of their high energy density.</p><p>Epidemiologic studies have shown a negative or inverse relation between nut consumption and body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Mechanisms underlying the relation between nut consumption and weight are unclear but may be related to altered resting energy expenditure, inefficient absorption of energy from nuts, or increased satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). In addition to epidemiologic evidence, controlled feeding studies suggest that nuts do not promote significant weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>).</p><p>Only 3 randomized studies have evaluated the effect of nut consumption in the context of a weight-loss program. Wien et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) randomly assigned 65 participants to consume a liquid formula&#x02013;based low-calorie diet (LCD) enriched with almonds or a liquid-based LCD supplemented with complex carbohydrates and found greater reductions in weight in the almond-enriched group. Li et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) randomly assigned 59 participants following an LCD to enrich their diet with either pistachios or pretzels and found no differences in weight change between the groups. Finally, Pelkman et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>) compared weight-reduction outcomes for 53 participants prescribed a hypocaloric, low-fat (20% of energy) diet or a hypocaloric, moderate-fat (35% of energy) diet enriched with peanuts and found no differences in weight loss between groups. Interpretation of previous findings, however, is limited by their short duration (10&#x02013;24 wk) and small sample sizes (<italic>n</italic> = 53&#x02013;65) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>).</p><p>In the context of an obesity pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) and a public health call for increased nut consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), data from larger samples over longer durations are needed to assess the effects of nut consumption in the context of obesity treatment. The purpose of the current study was to compare the effects of an almond-enriched diet (AED) with those of a nut-free diet (NFD) on body weight, body composition, and cardiovascular disease risk factors in the context of an 18-mo behavioral weight-management program in overweight and obese participants. We hypothesized that the AED would be associated with greater weight loss and improvements in cardiovascular disease risk factors than would the NFD at 6 and 18 mo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were 123 adults (112 women, 11 men) with a mean (&#x000b1;SD) age of 46.8 &#x000b1; 12.4 y and a BMI (in kg/m<sup>2</sup>) of 34.0 &#x000b1; 3.6.

During the first week of treatment, all participants were instructed to maintain their usual eating and activity habits. Thereafter, all participants were prescribed an LCD providing 1200&#x02013;1500 kcal/d for women and 1500&#x02013;1800 kcal/d for men. Beginning in week 4, participants in both groups were encouraged to walk for 20 min 4 times/wk, progressing to 50 min 4 times/wk by week 19. Additionally, both groups were instructed in traditional behavioral methods of weight control, such as self-monitoring and stimulus control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Groups met weekly for 20 wk, biweekly for the next 20 wk, and every 6 wk for the remainder of 18 mo.

Participants were provided two 28-g packages of almonds (&#x0223c;24 almonds per package) to consume daily throughout the study, which were distributed at their group meetings. Over the first 5 wk of treatment, participants received whole, raw almonds only. At week 6, roasted almonds were introduced and, over time, a variety of isocaloric, flavored almonds were used. This group was instructed to abstain from alternative nut consumption. The primary behavioral targets were adherence to the total energy intake goal and consumption of 56 g almonds/d.</p></sec><sec><title>Nut-free, low-calorie diet</title><p>Sixty-two subjects were assigned to receive the NFD.

These models, which included time, treatment, a time-by-treatment interaction, and the respective baseline value as principal explanatory variables, posited an unrestricted structure on the variance-covariance matrix of the residuals for all 123 participants. These analyses included all observed data for each variable on all participants, regardless of attrition. Several sensitivity analyses were conducted. The first was an analysis of covariance (initial values as covariates) performed on all randomly assigned participants who reached a particular visit (ie, 6 or 18 mo), regardless of whether they subsequently dropped out of the study (ie, a completers&#x02019; analysis). The second sensitivity analysis was an intent-to-treat linear mixed-effects model performed on absolute values of the outcome, as opposed to changes in the outcome. The results from these sensitivity analyses were similar to those of the primary analysis in direction and significance. The results of the primary analysis and the completers&#x02019; analysis are reported here. Analyses were conducted by using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute) or SPSS 19.0 (SPSS).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Attrition</title><p>No statistically significant differences in attrition were found between the 2 groups at 6 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.23) or 18 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.57) mo.

First, both the AED and NFD groups experienced significant weight loss at 6 (7%) and 18 (5%) mo. These amounts of weight loss are similar to those observed in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>) but less than that in one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) that incorporated nuts into a weight-management program. The greater weight loss seen in that study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) could have been the result of the inclusion of a portion-controlled (liquid formula) diet in both groups or a low-carbohydrate diet in the nut group only, both of which have been shown to have significant effects on short-term weight loss without the incorporation of nuts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>).</p><p>The NFD group experienced slightly (1.9%) but significantly greater reductions in weight than did the AED group at 6 mo. These findings were in the opposite direction of our hypothesis and may be secondary to the NFD group choosing foods lower in calories for snacks than nuts, which resulted in slightly greater energy deficits. No statistically significant differences in body weight were found between the groups at 18 mo. Whereas the difference between the groups was approximately the same at 6 and 18 mo (1.5 kg compared with 1.8 kg), the variability was greater at 18 mo. The clinical significance of the small difference in weight between groups at 6 or 18 mo (&#x0223c;2%) is unclear, particularly given the lack of differences in body composition between the groups at either 6 or 18 mo. Both groups experienced minimal weight regain (1%) between 6 and 18 mo. Given that the frequency of the group sessions decreased over time, adherence to both diets may have declined.</p><p>The second principal finding was that, despite the slightly smaller weight losses at 6 mo in the AED group, triglycerides, TC, and TC:HDL cholesterol improved more in the AED group than in the NFD group. Specifically, the AED group had a 4% greater reduction in TC and a 12% greater reduction in triglycerides than did the NFD group at 6 mo. The changes are notable given that baseline lipid profiles were close to optimal ranges, which left a restricted range for improvement and/or differences between groups.</p><p>A trend toward a greater reduction in VLDL cholesterol in the AED group was observed at 6 mo, consistent with an effect (at 6 mo) of either reduced hepatic VLDL production or increased VLDL lipolysis. Finally, at 6 mo, TC:HDL cholesterol decreased significantly more in the AED group (&#x02212;0.2 &#x000b1; 0.1) than in the NFD group (0.04 &#x000b1; 0.1), consistent with a cardioprotective effect. As in our study, Wien et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) found reductions in LDL cholesterol across groups but no differences between intervention groups. In our sample, the effects of almonds on LDL may have been attenuated by the effects of weight loss on LDL. Furthermore, the elevated BMI in our sample may have limited the potential cholesterol-lowering effects of nut consumption, which pooled analyses suggest to be more effective in individuals with a lower BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>).</p><p>Mechanistically, the compositional properties of almonds that contribute to improvements in triglycerides and TC remain unclear; however, as above, they appear to be related to effects on VLDL metabolism. Almonds are rich in unsaturated fatty acids, which can influence VLDL metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). The reduction in triglycerides and cholesterol might be expected to reduce cardiovascular disease risk if maintained over a long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, this was the longest and largest study to date on almond consumption in the context of a weight-management program. Both groups achieved significant short-term weight reduction, which was generally maintained at 18 mo. Our study was conducted primarily with female participants, so generalization to males should be conducted with caution. It was also conducted outside of a metabolic ward, precluding objective assessments of dietary adherence, except weight loss. Whereas adherence to intake and activity were discussed in groups, data were not collected in any standardized manner. Self-reported data have been shown to be invalid when compared with objective measures such as doubly labeled water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). The differences in lipid profiles at 6 mo, in the context of comparable weight loss, suggested that patients adhered to the energy-deficit diet and to the instruction to consume almonds (AED) or avoid nuts (NFD). The lack of lipid differences at 18 mo suggests decreased adherence over time.</p><p>In conclusion, incorporating limited portions of almonds&#x02014;an energy-dense food&#x02014;into a behavioral weight-loss program still resulted in significant weight reduction. Moreover, despite a smaller weight loss at 6 mo in comparison with the NFD group, the AED group experienced greater improvements in cardiovascular disease risk factors. There were no differences in weight loss or cardiovascular disease risk factor outcomes between groups at 18 mo.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors&#x02019; responsibilities were as follows&#x02014;GDF, POS, DJR, and AG-T: designed the research; SSVV, KLS, TLO, and BSZ: conducted the research; MRL, GDF, SSVV, KLS, AV, TLO, BSZ, POS, and DJR: provided essential materials; GDF and MRL: wrote the manuscript; and GDF: had primary responsibility for the final content.
