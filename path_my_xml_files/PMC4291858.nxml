A multi-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, 12-week study was conducted. 161 patients who improved with on-demand 200 mg of udenafil according to Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) diary Question 2 and 3 (Q2 and Q3) were randomized into 200 mg on-demand (<italic>n</italic> = 80) or 50 mg once-daily (<italic>n</italic> = 81) dosing groups for 8 weeks. The dosing period was followed by a 4-week treatment-free period. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) erectile function domain (EFD) score. The secondary efficacy endpoints included changes to the SEP diary Q2, Q3, IIEF Q3, Q4, other domains of IIEF, Global Assessment Question, and shift to the normal rate (EFD &#x02265; 26). Vascular endothelial markers were also assessed. The IIEF-EFD score of both groups improved after 8 weeks of treatment (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between two groups. Improvement was not maintained after the treatment-free follow-up period. Similar results were observed in the secondary efficacy endpoints. There was also no significant difference in vascular endothelial markers. Daily udenafil was well-tolerated, and there was no significant difference in the adverse drug reactions and adverse events between the two groups. Flushing and headache were the most frequent adverse events. Both regimens improved ED in diabetic patients and were well-tolerated. Further studies are needed to assess the effect of daily udenafil treatment in diabetic patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>erectile dysfunction</kwd><kwd>International Index of Erectile Function</kwd><kwd>once-daily dosing</kwd><kwd>phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor</kwd><kwd>type 2 diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>udenafil</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the consistent inability to attain or maintain a penile erection of sufficient quality to permit satisfactory sexual intercourse.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> ED is a common complication of diabetes, with an estimated prevalence of 20%&#x02013;85% (ranging from mild to complete ED),<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> which occurs at an earlier age than in nondiabetic men.

The result of between group difference and 95% CI was &#x02212;0.55 (&#x02212;1.76, 0.67), demonstrated noninferiority for once-daily dosing.</p><p>Four other domain scores of IIEF and the mean score of Q3 of IIEF (successful penetration) and Q4 of IIEF (frequency of maintaining an erection) indicated a significant increase in both groups without between-group differences. Successful penetration and successful completion of sexual intercourse improved in both groups. In addition, improved erections were reported in 89.7% of patients in the on-demand group and 92.4% in the daily-dosed group after treatment. After the treatment-free follow-up period, the improvement in erectile function was not maintained in both treatment groups, indicating that once-daily 50 mg of udenafil treatment for 8 weeks did not provide a prolonged advantage over the on-demand udenafil regimen. In addition, there was no clinically significant change in biomarkers of endothelial function. Compliance with treatment was higher in the once-daily udenafil group compared with the on-demand group (97.10% &#x000b1; 11.39% <italic>vs</italic> 91.06% &#x000b1; 14.29%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0039).</p><p>The daily administration of PDE5 inhibitors produced favorable effects in previous clinical studies. McMahon compared the efficacy and safety of daily dosed tadalafil and on-demand tadalafil in the treatment of ED. Both on-demand and daily tadalafil enhanced all efficacy outcomes and were well-tolerated. The change in the IIEF domain score and the successful completion of sexual intercourse were higher with daily dosing. Seventy-two percent of patients preferred daily tadalafil and the main reasons for the preference were sexual spontaneity and efficacy.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> McMahon also reported that 10 mg and 20 mg of daily tadalafil were effective and well-tolerated in men previously unresponsive to on-demand tadalafil<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and proposed that the improvement in the erectile response is most likely related to improved endothelial function. Daily vardenafil<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and another study with tadalafil once-daily,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> also improved ED in patients who previously did not respond to on-demand PDE5 inhibitor treatment. However, there are some conflicting results regarding endothelial function improvement with PDE5 inhibitor treatment in other clinical studies. Zumb&#x000e9; <italic>et al</italic>. compared the efficacy of once-daily and on-demand vardenafil in the treatment of mild-to-moderate ED and evaluated the sustainability of improvement in erectile function after long-term treatment. Although both treatments improved erectile function, there was no significant difference between the groups in efficacy and treatment satisfaction. In addition, once-daily vardenafil treatment for 24 weeks did not provide prolonged advantages over on-demand administration.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Another study with nightly dosing of sildenafil for 1 year demonstrated improved erectile function and endothelial function after a treatment-free follow-up period.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Our study with once-daily and on-demand udenafil did not demonstrate a significant difference between the two groups and the treatment efficacy was not maintained after treatment. Diabetic patients constitute a difficult-to-treat subpopulation in the treatment of ED and have multiple risk factors for ED. Diabetic patients may need longer treatment periods or higher doses of PDE5 inhibitor for a prolonged effect after treatment or recovery from ED.</p><p>Erectile dysfunction is highly prevalent in patients with vascular diseases, such as coronary artery, cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial disease, whereas there is an increased risk of cardiovascular events (angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and intermittent claudication) in patients with preexisting ED. This observation implies an intimate nexus between the two conditions.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The shared etiologic factor with vascular disease is endothelial dysfunction.<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Improvement in endothelial function in diabetes, which is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, is particularly important. The effect of PDE5 inhibitors on endothelial function remains controversial. Some studies on sildenafil and tadalafil have demonstrated improvement in endothelial function assessed with peak systolic velocity, flow-mediated dilatation and biomarkers of endothelial function.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> On the other hand, in a study with coronary heart disease patients, sildenafil did not improve peripheral endothelium-dependent vasomotor or fibrinolytic function.<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Aversa <italic>et al</italic>. have reported improved endothelial function after chronic administration of sildenafil in men with type 2 diabetes without erectile dysfunction.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, another study with once-daily tadalafil in diabetes mellitus and ED patients demonstrated improvement in erectile function; however, there was no significant change in the endothelial biomarkers.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Daily administration of PDE5 inhibitors may have benefits beyond treating ED. Although our study results did not indicate improvement in the biomarkers of endothelial function, recent data suggest that chronic dosing of PDE5 inhibitors may have prolonged beneficial effects on vascular endothelial function. Several factors may have contributed to the results regarding the biomarkers of endothelial function. These factors include diabetic patients being less responsive to treatment for ED when compared with nondiabetic patients as well as a short treatment period and low dosage of daily udenafil.</p><p>Both treatments with udenafil in diabetic patients were safe and well-tolerated. In addition, daily administration of udenafil was not associated with a higher incidence of treatment-related adverse events. The most commonly reported adverse events were flushing and headache, which are similar to previously reported adverse events in treatments with PDE5 inhibitors.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> All the adverse events associated with daily and on-demand udenafil treatment were mild-to-moderate in severity. The ECG and laboratory test results showed no evidence of abnormality related to udenafil treatment.</p><p>The unique feature of this study is that the dose of udenafil was controlled to match the same total dose in both groups. In addition, we compared the efficacy of daily dosing with the on-demand regimen with the integrated result of erectile function and endothelial biomarkers in diabetic patients with ED. The limitations of this study are that it was a two-arm, noninferiority trial that lacked a placebo group, and the number of included patients was relatively small. A larger controlled multi-center trial with longer treatment duration will be needed to assess the effect of daily PDE5 inhibitor administration on endothelial function and the prolonged effect after discontinuation. It would be interesting to determine the optimal treatment dose and duration according to the degree of ED, the number of risk factors, and whether there are special candidates who may benefit from chronic daily administration of PDE5 inhibitors.</p><p>The efficacy of once-daily 50 mg of udenafil was not inferior and was comparable with on-demand 200 mg of udenafil. There was no significant between group differences observed in adverse drug reactions. Udenafil 50 mg once-daily may be an effective and safe treatment option for type 2 diabetic patients with ED. Further studies are required to establish the role and beneficial effects of the PDE5 inhibitor in diabetic patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>KSP, KWM participated in designing the study, conducted the data acquisition, interpreted the data, drafted and revised the manuscript.
