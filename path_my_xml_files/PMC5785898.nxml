By 2030, almost 23.6 million people will die from CVD, mainly coronary heart disease (CHD), and the total number of disability-adjusted life years attributable to CVD is expected to reach approximately 204 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. People with CVD are more likely to develop future cardiac events such as unstable angina, myocardial infarction (MI), and sudden cardiac death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This places a huge burden on healthcare systems, with the US spending US$444 billion on CVD-related treatments in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Improved diagnosis, treatment, and management have substantially reduced the mortality rate of individuals living with CHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; however, those who have experienced an MI have a 20&#x02013;40% risk of a recurrent event or death in the next 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Approximately 80% of CHD is caused by modifiable risk factors including physical inactivity, smoking, unhealthy diet, and harmful alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and effective evidence-based secondary prevention treatments&#x02014;such as implementing lifestyle changes and adhering to prescribed medication regimens (self-management)&#x02014;can aid recovery and reduce recurrent cardiac events. Improvements in lipids, systolic blood pressure, smoking prevalence, and physical activity account for an estimated 47% of the total improvement in case fatality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Management of CHD</title><p id="Par22">Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) encompasses unstable angina, and MI. Following diagnosis of an ACS, patients should receive a range of evidence-based preventive treatments that include appropriate clinical follow-up, as well as referral to programs that provide education and support self-management for the secondary prevention of disease&#x02014;commonly known as cardiac rehabilitation (CR). A core focus of CR is to encourage people to make healthy lifestyle changes to reduce subsequent cardiac events. Lifestyle behavior changes include regular physical activity, eating a healthy diet, stopping smoking, reducing harmful alcohol intake, and taking medications as per a prescribed regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Empowering self-management is critical for people with an ACS to maximize treatment benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">CR is an essential part of contemporary management for people with an ACS. It has been shown to reduce cardiovascular deaths and hospital readmissions by 25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and is cost-effective for those who participate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A Cochrane systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] of CR reported a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality of 26% (odds ratio (OR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.96) and a reduction in all-cause mortality of 13% (OR 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 1.05). This magnitude of effect is consistent with a review of cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Despite these benefits, CR participation is inadequate in all countries in which it has been assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Low levels of patient participation and completion (14&#x02013;43% after MI) have been reported in Australia, France, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand with high levels of dropout after enrollment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Lack of completion reduces the benefits of CR, such as improvements in CVD risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Patient-oriented, medical, and healthcare system factors associated with suboptimal participation include availability, affordability and accessibility of a program, as well as work/domestic commitments and psychological barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Current CR delivery approaches do not suit all people and new models are needed to improve the uptake and completion of CR.

This echoes findings from other reviews of home-based CR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and telehealth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. There is a paucity of research describing the effectiveness of alternative models of CR in rural, remote, and culturally diverse populations. However, evidence suggests that hospital-based strategies may not be able to deliver effective CR to these populations. Local healthcare systems may need to integrate alternative models of CR, such as brief interventions tailored to individual&#x02019;s risk factor profiles, as well as community- or home-based programs, to ensure that choices are available that best fit patient&#x02019;s needs, risk factor profile, and preferences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The potential of mobile phone delivered self-management</title><p id="Par26">While telehealth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and Internet-based programs have been shown to be effective, they are limited due to predominant reliance on desktop and landline communication, whereas technology is now more mobile. Mobile phones are the most common device for communication worldwide&#x02014;including developing countries&#x02014;and are used to deliver behavioral-change programs and improve disease self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Mobile phones have potential to influence behavior at a population level because the technology is widely available globally, inexpensive, and allows instant delivery of information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Text-messaging&#x02014;or short message service (SMS)&#x02014;is the most widely used mobile phone intervention. Two systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] support the effectiveness of SMS interventions across a range of risk behaviors (e.g., smoking) and chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes and asthma). A 24-week text-messaging intervention in the HEART trial increased walking and leisure time exercise in people who were post ACS (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;171), but did not increase maximal exercise capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

This intervention involved delivery of regular semi-personalized text messages providing advice, motivation, and information that aimed to improve diet, increase physical activity, and encourage smoking cessation. While this study represents a good initial evaluation of a text messaging intervention for enhancing CHD outcomes, future work is still required. First, it was conducted in a single center in Australia with many participants excluded due to language barriers or not owning a mobile phone, which limits its generalizability. Second, the intervention was evaluated as a stand-alone strategy, thus it was unclear whether the intervention was more or less beneficial to those in traditional programs. Third, implementation of the intervention in a real-world setting was not assessed in the study.</p><p id="Par28">We previously conducted the Text4Heart randomized controlled pilot trial (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;123) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], of a 6-month theory-based program of daily text messages and a supporting website in addition to usual CR services.

The primary outcome is the proportion of participants adhering to medication at 6&#x000a0;months.

Participants&#x02019; community pharmacy dispensing records will be linked using their unique National Health Index number via the National Pharmaceuticals Collection database. This approach has been used successfully in New Zealand to assess statin use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. To adjust for days not covered due to death or days spent in hospital these periods are subtracted from the 6-month coverage time. The number of days supplied will be estimated from strength per unit and daily dose variables summed from pharmacy claims during the observation period. To account for any previous supply of the medication (before discharge), medication claims in the 3&#x000a0;months prior to admission are collected. The SDR for each class of medication (statins, antihypertensive, and antiplatelet therapies) will be recorded as secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p id="Par48">In a similar manner to the primary outcome, the proportion of participants adhering to medication will be assessed at 12&#x000a0;months.

Self-reported medication adherence will be assessed using the Morisky 8-item Medication Adherence Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. As per the Text4Heart pilot trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], adherence to recommended lifestyle behaviors will be measured using a composite health behavior score adapted from the EPIC-Norfolk Prospective Population Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].

Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to test the robustness of main findings using different assumptions on the missing data if the proportion of missing exceeds 10%. The proportion of participants adhering to medication at 6&#x000a0;months, with or without intervention, will first be summarized as frequency and percentage. Logistic regression will be conducted to evaluate the main treatment effect (OR and 95% CI), adjusting for pre-defined baseline prognostic factors. For all secondary outcomes collected at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months post randomization, generalized linear regression models will be used to test the effect of intervention between two groups, using a link function appropriate to the distribution of outcomes. More specifically, an identity link will be used for continuous outcomes under normal distribution and a logit link for binary outcomes under binomial distribution. Regression models will adjust for baseline outcome value (where collected) and stratification factor. Model-adjusted estimate (mean difference for continuous outcomes and OR for binary outcomes) will be reported at each scheduled visit, with 95% CI and associated <italic>p</italic> value. Missing data will not be imputed on secondary outcomes without adjustment for multiple testing. Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

The incremental cost of making one extra participant adherent to CR using the intervention compared to usual care will be calculated. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, 95% confidence ellipses on the incremental cost-effectiveness plane, and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be calculated to compare the intervention with usual care.

The RE-AIM framework&#x02014;which emphasizes collecting information about the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance of an intervention&#x02014;is an evaluative framework for guiding the evaluation and reporting of health intervention effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Further, RE-AIM provides a framework for determining which programs work under real-world conditions and which programs should be sustained. The RE-AIM framework is an ideal tool to use as the basis for planning and evaluating the success of mobile phone self-management interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. It also aligns with systems-based approaches and allows for assessment of vertical (e.g., adoption decisions within a given organization) and horizontal (e.g., adoption across different sectors) components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The RE-AIM framework includes both individual- and setting/staff-level variables. Two dimensions operate at the individual level (reach and effectiveness).</p><p id="Par61">A mixed-methods approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] will be used to assess the key components of RE-AIM. Qualitative and quantitative data will be combined to thoroughly understand the extent to which the self-management intervention could be successfully implemented within the New Zealand health context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. To achieve this, data will be collected on each RE-AIM dimension as proposed by Kessler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] and Glasgow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Some of these data will be collected as part of the trial (e.g., data to inform reach, effectiveness and costs/resources). Additional data will be collected specifically for the RE-AIM analysis (detailed below).</p><p id="Par62">To determine intervention reach, we will assess the number of people who participate as a proportion of those who are eligible, compare the characteristics of those who do and do not participate, and provide detailed information of reach and recruitment issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. To achieve this, all potential participants approached about the study will be screened and basic information collected. Those who decline participation will have their information permanently de-identified. Screening information will be used to determine the representativeness of those who agree to participate compared to those who decline. Qualitative data will be gathered from those who decline about their reasons for choosing to not participate. For those who agree, a brief semi-structured interview will be conducted to determine their perspectives of the proposed intervention, their current self-management behaviors, and any concerns they might have that would have impacted on their involvement or adoption.</p><p id="Par63">In addition to the primary outcome, biological-, psychosocial-, demographic-, and program-specific parameters will be assessed as potential moderators of intervention effectiveness.</p><p id="Par64">RE-AIM dimensions Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance will be assessed from both provider and organizational perspectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Key informant interviews will be conducted with stakeholders (medical practitioners and allied health staff) to obtain qualitative data from providers across these three RE-AIM dimensions, to determine factors that may enhance organizational adoption and maintenance, and potential adaptations to heighten the likelihood of consistent delivery across providers and locations. Quantitative assessment of implementation will be determined by measuring text-message responses where appropriate. Maintenance at the organizational level will be determined by conducting key informant interviews with stakeholders (e.g., chief executive officers) as well as government and non-government agencies (Ministry of Health, Heart Foundation) examining potential sustainability options for each organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. To evaluate Maintenance at the patient level, patient outcomes will be measured at 12&#x000a0;months via ANZACS-QI. Long-term attrition (%) and differential rates by patient characteristics or treatment condition will be examined. At the organizational level, we will collect data on whether the interventions were sustained at more than 6&#x000a0;months post study funding, or which elements were retained after the program was funded.</p><p id="Par65">Qualitative data collection and analysis will be conducted by a trained and experienced researcher. Interviews will be digitally recorded and transcribed. Data will be entered using NVivo software to enable qualitative analysis. An inductive analysis approach will be used to identify the key themes to emerge from the data. These data will be collated according to each domain of the RE-AIM framework. These data sources will be combined and&#x02014;together with the advisory group&#x02014;investigators will make recommendations to determine the extent to which the self-management intervention achieved the desired RE-AIM outcomes.

Using the RE-AIM framework this trial will provide much needed data and insight into the potential implementation of Text4Heart II to augment existing cardiac services within two major metropolitan hospitals. The protocol, in accordance with the SPIRIT Statement, includes outcomes from recent systematic reviews of mobile health with the aim of adding quality evidence to the body of academic literature.</p><p id="Par67">This trial addresses many limitations/criticisms of previous mHealth trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]; it builds on the Text4Heart pilot trial, is adequately powered, has sufficient duration to elicit behavior change, and the follow-up assessments (6 and 12&#x000a0;months) are long enough to determine the sustained effect of the intervention. We also outline the behavior-change theory used, and intervention content, which will enhance its replicability. Using data linkage (National Pharmaceuticals Collection and ANZACS-QI registries) our Text4Heart II trial will not only provide an objective measurement of medication adherence, but will be one of the first of its kind to provide much needed data on sustained effects on clinical outcomes including hospitalization and mortality. While mHealth is often touted as a low-cost intervention that can be delivered at scale, few studies provide evidence of this. The Text4Heart II trial will also provide much needed data on the cost-effectiveness of this approach, and its potential implementation and scalability as a national service.</p><p id="Par68">In summary, Text4Heart II should produce new knowledge on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an innovative and promising mHealth program to improve self-management of heart disease. It extends previous research by investigating the sustained effects of a text-message intervention, and will offer unique insights into clinical effects. If effective, this approach could substantially reduce deaths and hospital admissions in a group of patients who account for up to one third of all hospital admissions. We will provide much needed insight into the potential of implementing this program at a national level, thereby augmenting existing CVD service delivery.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par69">Recruitment for the Text4Heart II trial opened in July 2016 at Auckland City and North Shore Hospitals (Auckland, New Zealand).
