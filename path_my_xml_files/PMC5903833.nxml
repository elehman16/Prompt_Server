Students were randomized to an intervention group of 20 students receiving small-group yoga/mindfulness activities for 8 weeks between October 2016 and February 2017, and a control group of 32 students receiving care as usual. The Brief Multidimensional Students&#x02019; Life Satisfaction Scale-Peabody Treatment Progress Battery and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) served as outcomes. Teachers were invited to participate in two professional development sessions about introducing yoga and mindfulness into the classroom, and completed a survey following each of the sessions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In generalized estimating equation models adjusted for time, the yoga-based intervention was associated with a 14.17 unit increase in student emotional PedsQL (<italic>p</italic>-value 0.001) and a 7.43 unit increase in psychosocial PedsQL (<italic>p</italic>-value 0.01). Results were not attenuated by adjustment. Teachers and staff reported using yoga more frequently in the classroom following the second of two professional development sessions (<italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.05). Perceived barriers to introducing yoga to the classroom were similar at two data collection time points, while perceived benefits remained high.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The intervention was associated with a significant improvement in emotional and psychosocial quality of life in the intervention group when compared to the control group, suggesting that yoga/mindfulness interventions may improve symptoms of anxiety among students. Yoga/mindfulness activities may facilitate stress management among elementary school students and may be added as a complement to social and emotional learning activities.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>pediatrics</kwd><kwd>behavior modification</kwd><kwd>health related quality of life</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>school health services</kwd><kwd>child health</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Educational reforms and the movement toward evaluation of school performance through student testing have amplified psychosocial demands on children<xref rid="b1-prbm-11-081" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and increasingly schools are seeking to improve social and emotional learning (SEL) programs, which reduce stress while addressing psychosocial development.

Mindfulness and yoga were added to the school&#x02019;s existing empathy-based programming to provide additional targeted intervention for students identified as being in need of supplementary support.

Yoga and mindfulness sessions were provided through a community organization by an experienced children&#x02019;s yoga instructor who provided sessions to teachers, staff, and students.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study population</title><p>The students included in this study were third graders who screened positive for symptoms of anxiety, using the validated Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) scale<xref rid="b30-prbm-11-081" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> administered at the beginning of the 2016 academic year. Following the receipt of parental consent and student assent, students were randomized to an intervention group with 20 total students, which received the yoga and mindfulness intervention, or a control group with 32 students, which received care as usual, including counseling and other activities, led by the school social worker. All 52 students were given a baseline survey in which their basic demographics, prior experience with, and feelings about yoga and mindfulness, and quality of life were assessed.</p><p>Teachers and staff had two professional development sessions about including yoga instruction in the classroom. They were surveyed following each of the professional development sessions. These surveys assessed teaching experience, prior yoga experience and attitude toward yoga and mindfulness activities, experience with yoga in the classroom, and teacher&#x02019;s quality of life. Study authors performed secondary data analysis on data initially gathered by the elementary school during an internal pilot study of their new curricular programming, and provided only de-identified data to the authors.

All teachers and staff were invited to participate in an 1-hour professional development session to introduce a yoga and mindfulness curriculum that could be integrated into their classroom activities. Baseline information on teachers&#x02019; previous experience with, perception of, and interest in yoga/mindfulness, as well as quality of life and indicators of stress were obtained by the school for the evaluation.</p><p>All teachers were offered a second professional development session about using yoga/mindfulness in the classroom, building on the previous session, before the start of the second phase of the student intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><sec><title>Students</title><p>Data were collected from school students through three rounds.

Students were asked six questions about their satisfaction with five domains of their personal lives in addition to one question about general satisfaction with their lives. Responses ranged on a five-point scale from &#x0201c;very dissatisfied&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;very satisfied&#x0201d;. The scores for the individual items were averaged together into the BMSLSS-PTPB total score, which represents overall life satisfaction, on a scale from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. The psychometric properties have previously been reported as robust.<xref rid="b34-prbm-11-081" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) was also used to assess student quality of life at the baseline, midline, and endline surveys.

The responses were combined into six scores, one for each of the four domains, in addition to an overall score and a psychosocial score, which represented a combination of the domains of emotional, social, and school problems. Possible scores could range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating lower average frequency of the problems in a given domain. The validity of this tool, and this method of scoring it, has previously been demonstrated to be high.<xref rid="b36-prbm-11-081" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Teachers/staff</title><p>Data collected from teachers included items from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x02019;s Healthy Days Measures, which is a tool for measuring health-related quality of life.<xref rid="b37-prbm-11-081" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Questions assessed the number of days in the prior month that the respondent would rate their mental health as suboptimal, their physical health as suboptimal, and the number of days on which their mental or physical health prevented them from completing their normal daily activities.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Analysis</title><p>The student intervention and control groups were compared at baseline. Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed, with all randomized subjects analyzed according to their assigned group regardless of adherence to the intervention. Differences in frequencies for categorical variables were assessed with Pearson&#x02019;s chi-square test, except where Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was indicated, and differences in means for continuous variables were assessed using <italic>t</italic>-tests. Change in PedsQL and BMSLSS-PTPB scores was computed at both the midline and endline surveys, and <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed to test for difference in mean change between intervention and control groups. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to model the repeated measurement of the continuous scores. These models allowed for assessing change in exposure status of the students when they received the intervention. Additionally, GEEs accommodate correlation between repeated measurements within individual students.<xref rid="b38-prbm-11-081" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="b39-prbm-11-081" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> The models were adjusted for survey time at which the outcome was assessed, homeroom teacher assignment, and student interest/excitement for yoga at baseline. The <italic>p</italic>-values reported for GEE models are based on score tests, due to the anticonservative nature of Wald statistics with small sample sizes.<xref rid="b40-prbm-11-081" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="b41-prbm-11-081" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Results with a <italic>p</italic>-value of &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant.

There were no significant differences between intervention and control with regard to demographic traits, prior yoga experience, the PedsQL score, the PedsQL subscores, or BMSLSS-PTPB score. The intervention group was significantly more interested in yoga, with 95% rating themselves very or somewhat excited to participate, compared to only 59.38% among the controls at baseline (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01).</p><p>No differences existed in the baseline BMSLSS-PTPB or PedsQL scores between intervention and control groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-prbm-11-081">Table 2</xref>). Mean group scores for the psychosocial PedsQL and emotional PedsQL are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-prbm-11-081">Figure 1</xref>. Groups 1 (Fall) and 2 (Spring) both received the intervention, while group 3 received care as usual. All three groups saw improvement in psychosocial PedsQL from baseline to the midline, but none saw significant improvement from baseline to endline. Both intervention groups 1 and 2 saw net improvement in emotional PedsQL from baseline to endline (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01), while there was no change in the control group.</p><p>At the midline survey, those in the intervention groups had a significantly larger mean improvement in emotional PedsQL score (17.39 for intervention compared to 0.75 for controls, <italic>p</italic>-value 0.005). No other changes in score were significantly different between intervention and control, but physical, psychosocial, social, and overall PedsQL change was higher for the intervention group than for the control group. At the endline survey, a similar pattern was observed. The difference for emotional PedsQL achieved statistical significance, with an 18.27 unit increase in the intervention group from baseline compared to a 0.86 unit decrease in the control group from baseline (<italic>p</italic>-value 0.009).</p><p>The results of the GEE models are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-prbm-11-081">Table 3</xref>. In the model adjusted for the survey at which the outcome was assessed (Fall/Spring), the yoga-based intervention was associated with a 7.43 unit increase in student psychosocial PedsQL (<italic>p</italic>-value 0.01), and this association was only slightly attenuated and remained statistically significant following adjustment for homeroom assignment and baseline interest in yoga (<italic>p</italic>-value 0.02). Likewise, the intervention was associated with a 14.17 unit increase in student emotional PedsQL in the model adjusted for the survey at which the outcome was assessed (<italic>p</italic>-value 0.001). This was not attenuated by adjustment for homeroom assignment and baseline interest in yoga. Results were not statistically significant for the other outcomes, but in models adjusted only for survey at which the outcome was assessed, the yoga intervention was associated with nonsignificant increases in overall PedsQL and social PedsQL.</p></sec><sec><title>Teachers</title><p>The teachers were also surveyed following two professional development sessions on yoga and mindfulness techniques in the classroom held at the beginning and end of the school year (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-prbm-11-081">Table 4</xref>). Teachers were asked about a number of potential barriers to implementing yoga in the classroom, as well ways yoga might help if introduced into the classroom. The results from the two professional development sessions were similar, with teachers and staff on average identifying nearly six ways yoga may help in the classroom including helping students self-regulate, helping students be calm, helping the teacher be calm, or improving the classroom climate. Teachers on average identified fewer than two potential barriers to introducing yoga such as being too busy with academic requirements or lack of self-confidence using yoga techniques. The number of times per week the teachers reported using yoga in the classroom increased from 1.28 to 2.39 (<italic>p</italic>-value 0.03) between the first and second professional development sessions, while the mean number of times per day the teachers reported using yoga in the classroom increased from 0.76 to 1.63 times per day (<italic>p</italic>-value 0.005). The self-reported physical health of teachers was significantly worse at the second professional development session (4.15 days in the past month where physical health was not good at the second session compared to 1.08 at the first session, <italic>p</italic>-value 0.01). Other metrics of teacher health were not significantly different between the two professional development sessions.</p><p>Teachers reported feeling that yoga could be very helpful, with seven of the nine potential benefits exceeding 50% affirmative responses. The barriers most frequently cited as hindering the introduction of yoga into the classroom include being too busy with academic requirements, teacher&#x02019;s lack of self-confidence using the techniques, and student resistance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The data presented indicate that students did benefit from this relatively short intervention, and that teachers and staff derived benefit as well. The students who received the intervention demonstrated significantly greater improvement in psychosocial and emotional quality of life compared with their peers who received standard care. Teachers reported many potential benefits of using yoga in the classroom and also reported using yoga in the classroom more days each week and more times each day following the student intervention.</p><p>Students&#x02019; psychosocial and emotional scores increased as a result of participating in small-group yoga and mindfulness activities at school, and previous studies have not used the specific measures applied in this study. These findings are important because they provide educators with a set of tools that may benefit students dealing with emotional or psychosocial issues. The benefits highlighted in this study lend support to results from prior studies where mindfulness and yoga curricula decreased negative emotional responses and stress, and improved self-esteem in students,<xref rid="b22-prbm-11-081" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-prbm-11-081" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and benefited adults suffering from anxiety and depression.<xref rid="b14-prbm-11-081" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16-prbm-11-081" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The improvement in psychosocial and emotional quality of life may reflect similar reductions in anxiety and stress among the third graders included in this study.</p><p>A recent study explored children&#x02019;s perceptions of stress and the impact of a yoga intervention on decreasing that stress.<xref rid="b42-prbm-11-081" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Researchers employed qualitative methods to understand the experiences of urban students who attended the 16-week program, which included yoga and mindfulness.

One study found no benefit to yoga when compared to physical education class for reducing stress.<xref rid="b44-prbm-11-081" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The lack of significant differences may be due to that yoga intervention failing to focus on stress management and/or the stressor tasks not adequately capturing attenuation of stressor response, where physiologic endpoints were used to assess stress reactivity, as opposed to quality-of-life measures, as used in the present study.</p><p>In a study conducted among fourth- and fifth-grade girls, White reported that mindfulness intervention was associated with a significant increase in appraisal of stress score.<xref rid="b2-prbm-11-081" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> White&#x02019;s results were unanticipated, and contrasted with the results of the present study, may suggest some design issues. The prior study was composed of girls drawn from two schools, and randomization was performed at the school level, precluding any ability of the researcher to distinguish school-related changes in student stress from changes due to the intervention. Additionally, White&#x02019;s study excluded students with prior formal yoga experience or a need for special educational support. In effect, the study was a cluster-randomized trial with a sample size of two (two schools), composed of school-aged white females without baseline medical or psychological diagnoses. The present study randomized individual students, included male and female children of diverse racial backgrounds, and the students were all determined to be at high risk for anxiety at baseline.</p><p>The present study utilized small-group yoga classes that were adapted to the needs of the individual students and their unique age group and environment. Hagen and Nayar presented a recent compilation of the impact of yoga on children&#x02019;s mental well-being and note that yoga instruction should be tailored to the audience, multidisciplinary, and based on children&#x02019;s needs while retaining a playful tone.<xref rid="b45-prbm-11-081" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></p><p>This study has several limitations. Although the sample size was limited, with only 20 subjects in the intervention group, significant differences were identified between intervention and comparison groups. Additionally, the two intervention groups received their intervention at different times of the year. Student perception of their own quality of life may be subject to change during the course of a given school year, so the baseline on which the intervention was administered was not necessarily the same for both intervention groups. The intervention evaluated combined yoga and mindfulness, and this study is, therefore, unable to identify whether one or both of these components was responsible for the improvements in psychosocial and emotional well-being.</p><p>This study has several strengths that deserve emphasis. The first is that the small-group yoga and mindfulness intervention was targeted to the needs of the children who were participating, and likewise, the training for teachers was tailored to educators of children in the local context. The subjects were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control groups, avoiding the self-selection of the exposure. The ITT analysis preserved the benefits of the randomization. The use of a previously studied yoga education curriculum allows the results of this study to be compared with others previously reported. Students&#x02019; quality of life was assessed using previously validated instruments designed for use in children. Finally, the data collected from teachers and staff will facilitate future research by helping ensure that it is tailored to address the concerns and suggestions of the educators.</p><p>This study demonstrated that a yoga-based intervention in an educational setting can improve emotional and psychosocial well-being among third-grade students who screen positive for symptoms of anxiety. Further research should be conducted with diverse and larger populations, including additional age groups, to determine whether this improvement of quality of life remains, and whether the effects of yoga are applicable to a more general population of students. Yoga and mindfulness curricula may provide children at risk of anxiety with a skill enabling them to improve their psychosocial and emotional quality of life. These coping skills, when provided in the school environment, may assist students achieve optimum physical and mental health.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors
