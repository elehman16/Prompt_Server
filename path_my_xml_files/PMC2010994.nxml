It is in this group of patients, with a high risk of recurrence from small residues of cancer left by the surgeon, that immunotherapy should have its optimum chance of success. A total of 92 patients were included in a randomized controlled study. The two groups were comparable in terms of tumour stage at presentation, operation performed and mean age of patients, but the control group had a preponderance of male patients. The study was carried out over 54 months. Treatment resulted in greater side effects than had been predicted, and as a result many patients could not be considered for inclusion.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00439-0019.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="506" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00439-0020.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="507" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00439-0021.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="508" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00439-0022.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="509" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00439-0023.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="510" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00439-0024.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="511" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00439-0025.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="512" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
