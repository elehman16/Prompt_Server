We describe in this report an intervention development project, funded by the <funding-source id="gs1">US National Institute of Mental Health</funding-source>, to address &#x0201c;indicated&#x0201d; prevention of depression in older adults attending rural and urban primary care clinics in Goa, India. Specifically, participants in the &#x0201c;DIL&#x0201d; (&#x0201c;Depression in Later Life&#x0201d;) trial were older adults living with mild, subsyndromal symptoms of depression and anxiety and thus at substantial risk for transitioning to fully syndromal major depression and anxiety disorders. Building upon the MANAS treatment trial (&#x0201c;Promoting Mental Health&#x0201d;) led by Patel et al. in the same locale, we present here lessons learned in the development and implementation of a protocol utilizing lay health counsellors (LHCs) who deliver a multi-component depression prevention intervention organized conceptually around Problem Solving Therapy for Primary Care (PST), with additional components addressing brief behavioural treatment of sleep disturbances such as insomnia, meeting basic social casework needs, and education in self-management of prevalent comorbid chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus. To our knowledge, DIL is the first randomized clinical trial addressing the prevention of depressive disorders ever conducted in a low- or middle-income country.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Indicated depression prevention</kwd><kwd>Lay health counsellor</kwd><kwd>Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Depression in older adults is a growing public health problem in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs), as a result of demographic transitions <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

In developing such an intervention, previous research <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> indicates that acceptability, feasibility and cost reduction have to be factored into depression prevention models. Evidence <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>shows that older adults are known to suffer from substantial depressive symptomatology without meeting diagnostic criteria for syndromal major depression.

<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> on prevention of depression in later life conducted in developed countries but none from Low and Middle Income countries (LMICs). Hence, there is a need to develop a scalable intervention that targets older adults with subthreshold depression, with an aim to prevent the onset of depressive disorders in later life <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">Progress in research <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> among older adults has yielded an accumulation of knowledge on how to identify those individuals with the highest risk of developing a mental disorder, together with several preventive interventions in randomized controlled trials <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> showing that (indicated) prevention may be possible and effective in older adults. One such study was the MANAS (&#x0201c;Promoting Mental Health&#x0201d;) cluster-randomized trial by Patel et al. <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, which showed a relative risk reduction at 6 months of 50% in the incidence of ICD-10 confirmed depression and anxiety disorders in a mixed-age sample of those receiving a collaborative stepped care (12.7%) versus those receiving enhance usual care (25%). We hypothesised that the MANAS intervention, modified to add other evidence-based components <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>and delivered by lay health counsellors (LHCs), is not just a treatment intervention but a preventive intervention as well.</p><p id="p0020">Indicated prevention <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>is aimed at individuals who have sub-threshold depression (i.e. some symptoms of a depressive disorder) but do not meet diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder. Indicated prevention has two objectives; one to reduce the symptoms of emotional distress that place persons at risk for common mental disorders like depression and anxiety, thereby increasing the quality of life; and secondly, to strengthen protective factors in order to prevent the onset of major depression disorder and other common mental disorders, such as anxiety disorders.</p><p id="p0025">In this study, we aimed to extend the incidental prevention results of the MANAS study <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> into a specific hypothesis-driven study. The MANAS study documented a trend worthy reduction in the incidence of depressive and anxiety disorders at six months, incidental to the primary treatment results for prevalent cases. The specific focus on older adults in Goa reflects both their growing numbers in Goa and the high exposure to risk factors for late-life depression. This was the first trial aimed at prevention of depression in older people living in a low or middle income country, using lay health counsellors (LHCs) and exploring a combination of approaches. The primary approach applied in this study is problem-solving therapy as developed for use in primary care settings (PST).</p><p id="p0030">PST is a brief, focused, and scalable psychological intervention <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> that has been used with a variety of patients in primary care settings, including people with depression, chronic illness, and suicidal thoughts and behaviours. In essence, PST is a learning-based psychotherapy that has elements of behavioural activation, aims to improve active coping, and enhances a sense of self-efficacy. While other structured, depression-specific psychotherapies (e.g., cognitive behavioural therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy) have been shown to prevent major depression in indicated prevention trials, PST is briefer and simpler than CBT or IPT and can be delivered by personnel without extensive training in mental health.</p><sec id="sec1.1"><label>1.1</label><title>Objectives</title><p id="p0035">The Depression in Late life (&#x0201c;DIL&#x0201d;) trial was funded by the <funding-source id="gs2">US National Institute of Mental Health</funding-source> through an intervention development grant (R34 MH96997) and a center grant (P30 MH90333).

The objectives of the study were twofold: 1) to develop a scalable intervention (DIL, &#x0201c;Depression in Later Life&#x0201d;), using risk reduction strategies aimed at prevention of depression and frequently co-occurring anxiety disorders by targeting persons with sub-threshold depression; and, 2) to test the feasibility and acceptability of delivering the intervention with LHCs, who had been used to deliver treatment for people with dementia, schizophrenia, and common mental disorders (depression and anxiety) in this region in various other studies <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

Goa has a greater proportion of older adults, and age-related medical and social conditions have become more relevant in this region. Thirty eight percent of the population live in rural areas, and 66% are Hindus. Agriculture and tourism are the main sources of income. We conducted the study at two health centres under the jurisdiction of the Department of Preventive and Social Medicine at the Goa Medical College, the Urban Health Center, St Cruz and Rural Health Center, Mandur and the surrounding communities served by these centers. The urban health center serves a population of around 12,000 while the Rural Health Center caters to a population of 42,000. The participants were recruited by screening those visiting the health centers, as well as from the community in both the rural and urban regions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Study design</title><p id="p0050">We conducted a randomized controlled trial with parallel arms and with equal allocation of participants in each arm.

Our intention was to enroll participants at high risk for a common mental disorder but without a history of current mental illness that would indicate treatment. Approximately 20&#x02013;25% of older adults with subthreshold symptoms are expected to transition to an episode of frank clinical depression <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>or anxiety disorder within 1&#x02013;2 years, while another third will continue to live with chronic mild symptoms which can be disabling in their own right.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><label>3.3</label><title>Sample size and power calculations</title><p id="p0075">We initially set out to recruit a sample of 120 participants (60 per arm), but as the trial progressed with a faster rate of enrollment than originally anticipated, we increased the sample size to 180 (90 per arm) after consultation with NIMH program staff and with the members of our Data Safety Monitoring Board. Assuming that &#x003b1; is set to 0.05, with two-sided tests, then with sample sizes of 60 per group, we could detect, with 81% power, a standardized (pre-post) mean difference of depression measures (GHQ 12 score) between intervention groups to 0.52 sd, which is typically considered to be a medium to large effect size. Increasing to 90 patients per group allows detection of a more modest mean difference of 0.42 sd, -- a more likely effect. If the N's were kept the same (60/group), the power to detect the same 0.42 sd mean difference would be less than 63%.</p><p id="p0080">Therefore, we revised our sample &#x0201c;n&#x0201d; upward to 180 people aged 60 or older. Recruitment took 12 months (an average intake of about 15 participants monthly or 3&#x02013;4 per week). As a pilot study, the randomized prevention trial focused primarily on feasibility, retention, and acceptability, and preliminary estimates of efficacy. We defined recruitment feasibility as meeting 100% of targeted randomization (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;180), with 20% or less of eligible subjects refusing randomization.

Recruitment was extended to the sub-centers under the rural health center and directly from the community in order to achieve the targeted enrollment. Research staff visited every house in a given locality to identify participants eligible for the trial during community screening. The researchers used the standardised General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) to evaluate depressive and anxiety symptoms of respondents. Those who scored 4 or more in the GHQ scale were deemed to have symptoms of depression and anxiety placing them at risk for episodes of mental illness. However, potential participants were further screened using a diagnostic tool, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) 6.0, to rule out active cases of depression or anxiety disorders. Hence only those participants who were negative on the MINI 6.0 and scored 4 or more on the GHQ were eligible. To assess the cognitive ability of the participants, we administered the standardised Hindi Mini Mental State Examination (HMMSE). Those who scored 24 or more were included in the study. As a secondary outcome, we assessed the participant's disability rating using the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule. Informed consent was sought from those participants deemed eligible for the study. The informed consent process was audio recorded to assess fidelity.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><label>3.5</label><title>Baseline assessment</title><p id="p0090">The assessment included collection of demographic data, e.g., age, gender, marital status, educational qualification, and occupation. In addition, we collected data on the number of persons in the household, including children and/or grandchildren, and on self-reported chronic diseases for which participants were currently receiving care, including diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Current medication history was sought before administering the GHQ scale. Medication use, with a particular focus on psychotropic drug use, was ascertained via examination of hospital records and prescriptions, and not merely by self-report of respondents. We also collected the cognitive scores of the participants using the Hindi Mini Mental State Examination (HMMSE) tool and the disability rating using the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.6"><label>3.6</label><title>Summary of trial accrual</title><p id="p0095">We approached 807 persons at the recruitment centres (primary healthcare clinics and the community) (DIL consort diagram shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Of these, 797 were eligible for the screening; after consent refusal, a total of 640 persons were screened for trial eligibility. 577 persons completed the screening, of whom 219 were eligible for the study. The primary reason for non-eligibility was failure to meet the criterion for sub threshold depression (i.e. a GHQ score below 4). This was seen in 274 persons and accounted for 76.8% of persons deemed ineligible. The other notable reason for ineligibility was low cognitive ability, as assessed using HMMSE. Cognitive impairment accounted for 44 (12.3%) of the exclusions.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>DIL Master Consort Chart Denise, please DROP this figure.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0010">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p><p id="p0100">Of the 219 eligible persons, 38 (17.4%) did not consent to the study, leaving 181 (82.6%) participants enrolled in the study.

We developed a local acronym for these three steps, called &#x0201c;SAUD,&#x0201d; which means &#x02018;health&#x02019; in Konkani. Within these three components, all seven steps of INSPIRE were taught and practiced during the session and reinforced during subsequent booster sessions. Altogether, face to face time with the lay health counsellor totalled 6&#x02013;7&#x000a0;h over the course of one year, thus constituting a relatively brief and focused behavioural intervention.</p><p id="p0160">The second component of intervention was social casework. DIL counsellors were provided with all the relevant information and forms for the latest revision of the social resources made available for senior citizens by the Government of Goa. The focus on social case work originated during the formative phase, in which we learned that people in this region are often worried about issues of security, including finances, food and personal care. Thus the majority of participants needed help in navigating to available resources.</p><p id="p0165">The third component of the DIL intervention addressed education and self-management of common medical illnesses. The most common source of anxiety and worry (&#x0201c;tension&#x0201d; in the local Konkani language) for the elderly population related to the burden of chronic disease, such as diabetes, hypertension, and painful osteoarthritis. As part of this component, lay health counsellors were trained in basic information regarding common medical disorders among older adults. They were trained to educate participants about the nature of these disorders and basic non pharmacological self-management. For chronic pain, counsellors demonstrated suitable, gentle exercises during the session.</p><p id="p0170">The formative phase of the DIL intervention also taught us that participants were finding it difficult to follow an intervention which primarily involved verbal counselling. We therefore developed pictorial flip charts to aid the counsellor in engaging participants, especially those with no or very limited literacy. DIL flip charts contained large images for elders to relate to and understand, while the counsellors had images and text to ensure fidelity to the theory of the intervention.</p><p id="p0175">Because poor sleep is a risk factor for developing depressive and anxiety disorders, we believe that improving sleep quality represents an opportunity for prevention <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. A special strategy to overcome sleep problems such as insomnia was taught to participants. Based upon our previous work in older adults attending primary care in the U.S., we used strategies from Brief Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (BBTI), shown to reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms and to improve the quality of sleep <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. DIL lay health counsellors provided participants with basic sleep hygiene information and taught them to monitor their sleep and wake patterns. A simple sleep monitoring chart was used for this purpose, requiring the elders to put a tick mark on the chart. A similar chart was used to monitor their action plan and to motivate the elders to be proactive. Clinically, we have observed a useful synergy between improved sleep and more efficient cognitive functioning required by PST strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3.8"><label>3.8</label><title>Intervention delivery</title><p id="p0180">The DIL intervention was delivered by lay health counsellors (LHCs) who are members of the local community, above 30 years of age, and bachelor's level graduates from any non-health related field (including counselling). We determined desirable characteristics of the LHC based on the findings from our initial qualitative study with the older participants, who defined characteristics of the LHC, with whom they would be comfortable to interact. The use of LHC's addresses the shortage of specialty mental health workers and, hence, the need to task-share and task-shift simple behavioural intervention delivery to less highly skilled persons. The effectiveness of LHCs in treating prevalent cases of common mental disorders has been demonstrated by Patel et al. <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The DIL study now represents an extension of LHC-based intervention models into the realm of prevention. LHC's lacked any prior training in professional mental health but had some experience either living with or working with the elderly. LHCs were recruited by placing advertisements in local newspapers and through word of mouth. Candidates were screened using a structured interview with the site principal investigator, project coordinator, and intervention supervisors, during which they were asked to role play one basic aspect of the DIL intervention which was sent to them 24&#x000a0;h before the interview via email. The selected candidates underwent a one-week training which covered all the aspects of the DIL intervention, including practice caseloads on non-eligible participants. On completion of the training, LHC's underwent competency assessments comprised of highly structured role plays. The counsellors who met the minimum requirement of 80% on the competency assessment progressed to the pilot study. To assess competency, we used the Therapy Quality Assessment Scale (TQS). This tool has been utilised in other studies <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>in the region. Counsellors who failed to attain the minimum requirement received additional training and practise caseload of non-eligible participants until they achieved required standards of intervention delivery.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.9"><label>3.9</label><title>Supervision</title><p id="p0185">Supervision, an important component of LHC-led interventions, was carried out on a weekly basis with one or both local supervisors present at every group meeting. The local psychological intervention specialists were trained by international experts (Jennifer Morse, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Counselling Psychology (MSCP), Chatham University and, Charles F Reynolds III, UPMC Endowed Professor in Geriatric Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh) in PST and BBTI, and they continued to be supervised by one international specialist via Skype every fortnight. Supervision included assessment of the quality of the sessions, using the Therapy Quality Assessment Scale (TQS), based on selected audio-recordings of the sessions followed by a round of peer-led feedback. The LHCs discussed their difficult cases with their peers and local supervisors during group supervision meetings. If intervention-related issues were not addressed by the peer group and local supervisors, then they discussed the same cases with the international experts via fortnightly Skype meetings.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.10"><label>3.10</label><title>Enhanced usual care</title><p id="p0190">The control group received Enhanced Usual Care (EUC). The results of repeated assessments of mood and anxiety among participants randomly assigned to EUC were made known to participants. If the participant was found to have developed a depressive disorder or an anxiety disorder, then we notified their physicians. In addition, we shared a copy of the DIL manual with physicians caring for participants randomly assigned to care as usual. In this sense, care as usual was enhanced by the forwarding of assessments to physicians and patients, to allow them to act as they deemed appropriate. While enhancing care as usual in this fashion may make it more challenging to demonstrate meaningful differences between the intervention and control arms of DIL, we believed it to be ethically necessary to share such clinically actionable information&#x02014;a view shared by NIH reviewers and by our Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.11"><label>3.11</label><title>Minimizing contamination</title><p id="p0195">Contamination of the Enhanced Usual Care arm was reduced by masking the clinic doctor to the allocation status.

Tests of time by intervention and stratification variable by intervention interactions will be employed. If such interaction terms are significant then they will be appropriately included in the final mixed effect models for the comparison of interventions. Other covariates such as age, gender, education, history of previous anxiety and depression will also be explored for potential relationships with outcomes of interest. Tests of the normality of the outcome variables will be employed and if such tests indicate lack of normality, then log or square root transformations will be employed when appropriate.

By implementing a model which uses lay health counsellors, DIL circumvents the challenge of scarce mental health resources and allows more rational and efficient use of these resources, to the potential benefit of a large population of older adults in primary care settings. DIL builds upon the MANAS trial (&#x0201c;Promoting Mental Health&#x0201d;), extending the deployment of lay health counsellors from treating to preventing common mental disorders (depression and anxiety) in rural and urban primary care clinics. DIL's focus on preventing common mental disorders in older adults is based upon a recognition of India's growing population of persons aged 60 and older. In addition, since the treatment of disorders like depression is only partially successful in averting years lived with disability, prevention of depression becomes an important public health priority. Not only is depression a major contributor to the global burden of illness-related disability, it also is now recognized as an important risk factor for the subsequent onset of dementing illnesses and for shortening life expectancy. Thus, it is plausible to suggest that preventing depression in older adults may also repay downstream benefits in terms of both quality and quantity of life. Depression is an important contributor to care-giver burden; thus its prevention may be a benefit to the wellbeing of family members, as well as to at-risk older adults.</p><p id="p0295">Randomized clinical trials of indicated depression prevention conducted in high-income countries have generally shown an incidence rate reduction on the order of 20&#x02013;25% over varying follow-up intervals of 1&#x02013;2 years, in persons living with subsyndromal symptoms. DIL now lays the groundwork for the extension of prevention science into low and middle income countries, via a potentially scalable model using lay health counsellors to reduce the burden of symptoms, improve well-being and health-related quality of life, and delay or prevent the onset of major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and other common mental illnesses. Further down-stream benefits may also accrue, including better adherence with co-prescribed medical treatments.</p><p id="p0300">DIL shares several important features with randomized mental illness prevention trials conducted in high-income countries. Primary among these shared features is the use of a brief behavioural intervention based in learning theory, namely, Problem Solving Therapy (PST). PST is effective in the treatment of prevalent mental disorders like depression; its use in the service of prevention is based upon two considerations: (1) its behaviourally activating effects, and (2) its teaching of problem solving strategies that restore active coping and support a sense of self-efficacy to counteract the &#x0201c;learned helplessness&#x0201d; at the core of depression. Like preventive interventions conducted in high-income countries, PST as adapted for use in India is a brief intervention that entails relatively little face-to-face time with the lay health counsellor, on the order of 6&#x000a0;h, during the initial 5&#x02013;7 sessions and in quarterly booster sessions during the follow up interval.</p><p id="p0305">The adaptation of PST for use in the DIL RCT was based upon lessons learned during the initial qualitative work and open-case series. In particular, these lessons addressed three needs: (1) to simplify the seven steps of traditional PST (&#x0201c;INSPIRE&#x0201d;) into a more easily managed &#x0201c;package&#x0201d; of three steps (&#x0201c;SAUD&#x0201d;) that could be easily taught via the use of pictorial flip charts to elders of limited literacy; (2) to incorporate basic social casework to help elders access needed services; and (3) to impart basic information about commonly occurring medical comorbidities, especially useful and straightforward techniques of self-care. It is our impression that the modification and enrichment of PST contributed to the high retention rates observed among trial participants, with less than a 20% dropout rate (comparable to trials conducted in high-income countries).</p><p id="p0310">In summary, our intervention development research has now achieved its primary goal of adapting the use of simple behavioural interventions to prevent common mental disorders in a low- or middle-income country, for implementation by lay health counsellors, to older adults with subsyndromal symptoms attending rural and urban primary care clinics. The adaptation has necessitated the integration of simple social casework interventions and basic health education in commonly comorbid medical disorders such as hypertension and diabetes. These adaptations have been well received by patients and family caregivers and are seen as responsive to the particular social and medical contexts in which indicated prevention of common mental disorders can unfold in a low- or middle-income country having large proportions of older patients with limited health literacy. Our intervention development work has demonstrated the feasibility of both enrolling and retaining at-risk participants (with dropout rates of less than 20%), together with the safety and acceptability of &#x0201c;indicated&#x0201d; depression prevention. Finally, it is our contention that DIL should be viewed within the larger framework of successful, active aging. Thus, DIL is not only about preventing depression. It also focuses on restoration of a sense of well-being in elders burdened with emotional distress, and it teaches and reinforces skills of active coping with the common challenges of old age.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Trial status</title><p id="p0315"><bold>Conflict of interest</bold>: the authors report no conflict of interest in the conduct of this study.
