The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of <italic>Valerian</italic> for the conscious sedation of dental patients submitted to oral surgery for the bilateral extraction of impacted lower third molars.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was carried out following approval from the Ethics Committee of the Piracicaba Dental School, <italic>Universidade Estadual de Campinas</italic> (Brazil). The study was conducted in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration and all participants signed an informed consent form after receiving an explanation of the general objectives and procedures of the study. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement and is registered at clinicaltrials.gov with number NCT01612130.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample selection</title><p>A study sample comprised of 20 volunteers, of which 8 were males and 12 were females with age ranges between 17 and 31 years of age participated in the study. All subjects had been referred to the Oral-maxillofacial surgery sector of Piracicaba Dental School, <italic>Universidade Estadual de Campinas</italic> (Brazil) for the bilateral extraction of asymptomatic impacted mandibular third molars in similar positions based on the Pell and Gregory classification.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The medical histories revealed that no volunteer exhibited any type of general health problem. The following were the exclusion criteria: Use of any type of medication in the 15 days prior to the onset of the study; history of hypersensitivity to the drugs, substances or materials employed in the experiment; pregnancy or lactation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Treatments</title><p>1 h prior to each surgical procedure, the participant received a single oral dose of 100 mg of <italic>Valerian</italic> or placebo (drugstore Professor Accorsi &#x02013; medicinal plants, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil) in capsule form. Neither the patient researcher nor surgeons knew which medication was administrated in each surgery. The capsules had the same concentration, size and appearance and were coded as medication 1 and 2, which were only identified at the end of the experiment. Randomization was performed by the researcher, who used two envelopes to determine the medication to be employed first and the side of the face to be operated first.</p><p>In both surgeries, 4 mg of dexamethasone (Prodome Qu&#x000ed;mica e Farmac&#x000ea;utica Ltda., Campinas, SP, Brazil) were administered for the prevention of post-operative pain and swelling. Intra-oral and extra-oral antisepsis was performed with an aqueous solution of 0.12% and 2% chlorhexidine digluconate (Pharmacy compounding Proderma Ltda., Piracicaba, SP, Brazil), respectively. For local anesthesia, a maximal volume of 3.6 mL of a 2% lidocaine solution with adrenalin at 1:100.000 (DFL S.A., Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) was employed. Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis was not performed in any cases. The mandibular third molar extractions were performed by three experienced surgeons, with a 30-day interval between the two sides. The same surgical technique was employed in both surgeries.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Assessment of degree of anxiety</title><p>The degree of patient anxiety was assessed through the use of questionnaires and physical parameters. This assessment was carried out in three distinct phases:</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Phase 1</title><p>Baseline: The initial appointment, 1 week prior to the scheduled date of the first surgery. The dental anxiety scale (DAS) was used to classify the participants with regard to their degree of anxiety (not anxious, mildly anxious, moderately anxious and very anxious).[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Moreover, heart rate (HR) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, using the auscultation method) were determined with the volunteer at rest. These measurements served as the baseline data of the physical parameters, which were also used in the assessment of anxiety.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Phase 2</title><p>During each surgery, the researcher and surgeon observed the manifestation of signs and symptoms associated to anxiety (restlessness/agitation/nervous ticks, paleness, excessive perspiration, tingling sensation in hands, feet or lips, change in breathing rhythm or depth). In the presence of one or more of these signs and symptoms, the patient was classified as anxious. If there was no manifestation of anxiety, the patient was classified as calm or relaxed. The patient's vital signs were also assessed at different times. BP and HR were determined 30 min after the administration of the medication and after 15 min of rest following the surgery.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Phase 3</title><p>At the end of each surgical procedure, the volunteers received a self-assessment questionnaire to be filled out the day following each surgery in order to assess the experience provided by both treatments (<italic>V. officinalis</italic> L. or placebo) as well as the occurrence or lack of anterograde amnesia. Moreover, possible adverse or side effects of treatment (sleepiness, dizziness, muscle relaxation, gastrointestinal problems and signs of allergy) and the patient's preference for one of the two surgical procedures were assessed 24 h after the second surgery.</p><p>Due to the possibility of some degree of respiratory depression caused by <italic>V. officinalis</italic> L., a digital pulse oximeter (Medical Supplies and Equipment CO, Houston, Texas, USA) was used to detect signs of hypoxia in susceptible patients or for simple monitoring during the surgery. The percentage of oxygen saturation was monitored during the initial appointment (baseline), 30 min after the administration of the medication and throughout the entire surgical procedure.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis was carried out using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS for Windows, version 17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and involved frequency distribution, association tests and analysis of variance. Since the data did not present normal distribution, measured by the Shapiro-Wilk test, non-parametric tests were used for further analysis. The association between the type of protocol and assessment of anxiety by the surgeon and researcher was determined using the Chi-square test. Agreement between the surgeon and researcher was determined using the Kappa concordance index. Data on cardiovascular parameters (BP and HR) were submitted to Friedman test in partitions subdivided in time and Wilcoxon test for pairwise comparisons, adjusted for multiple contrasts (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0166). The Wilcoxon test was used to compare measures between the two protocols. Level of significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05. In order to determine the clinical significance of results, effect size analyses were carried out comparing the results with the use of <italic>Valerian</italic> and the placebo. This test - proposed in 1992 - quantifies the effect of the difference between two groups in an association between the variation in mean and standard deviation values.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The calculation of the effect was performed (using the formula <inline-graphic xlink:href="JPBS-6-109-g001.jpg"/>, adjusted for repeated measures, <italic>d</italic> &#x000d7; <inline-graphic xlink:href="JPBS-6-109-g002.jpg"/>; <italic>d</italic> = effect size, <italic>m</italic><sub>A</sub> = mean value observed for the experimental group, <italic>m</italic><sub>B</sub> = mean value observed for the control group, &#x003c3; = standard deviation) with the subtraction of the <italic>Valerian</italic> results from the placebo results (placebo mean &#x02013; Valerian mean). Thus, results with a negative sign indicate that the values obtained with the use of the <italic>Valerian</italic> were higher than those obtained with placebo.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>The research was conducted between March and August 2003.

With regard to the occurrence of anterograde amnesia, 85% of the patients recalled all steps of the surgical procedure, 10% remembered the majority of events and 5% remembered very little of the procedures, regardless of the medication administered.</p><p>The mean values for SBP, DBP and HR [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>] remained within the range of biological normality throughout the entire study.

As a more invasive procedure, this type of surgery often generates a greater degree of patient anxiety. Lago-M&#x000e9;ndez <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] observed that patients with high dental anxiety may tend to require longer surgery times and also have poorer postoperative recovery after removal of a lower third molar. In this light, the control of dental anxiety in patients undergoing oral surgery becomes imperative.</p><p>Anxiety during dental treatment can be identified through patient behavior and the assessment or recognition of physical signs, such as dilated pupils, paleness, excessive perspiration, hyperventilation and an increase in HR and blood pressure.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] These signs serve as a parameter for classifying patients as either anxious or calm. Both the researcher and surgeon found that the majority of patients medicated with <italic>Valerian</italic> were calmer and more relaxed in comparison to those who had received the placebo. However statistic significant difference was observed only for researcher observation. The researcher is graduated in pharmacy and trained in anxiety control through conscious sedation and surgeons only have training in dentistry. Perhaps this explains the difference. Gon&#x000e7;alves and Fran&#x000e7;a[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] found a similar result, reporting a significant reduction in anxiety among individuals submitted to minor oral surgery using a medication containing a blend of natural substances, including <italic>V. officinalis</italic> (50 mg). However, the comparison of the data with those of the present study is limited by methodological differences, such as the medication employed and type of surgical procedure.</p><p>The dose of <italic>V. officinalis</italic> L. used in the present study was based on the clinical experience of Kohnen and Oswald,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] who established a single dose of 100 mg administered 90 min prior to the anxiogenic event. The majority of volunteers (85% of cases) reported remembering all events related to the surgical procedure when treated with <italic>V. officinalis</italic> L., which demonstrates that this phytotherapeutic agent does not have the property of inducing anterograde amnesia under the conditions analyzed in the present study. <italic>V. officinalis</italic> L. also demonstrated a good degree of tolerability, as there were no complaints of dizziness, gastrointestinal problems, signs of allergy or the paradoxical effect.</p><p>Some drugs referred to as sedatives may also exhibit antispasmodic and hypertensive action.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In the present study, the mean BP, HR and oxygen saturation values remained within the range of biological normality throughout the entire study, thereby demonstrating the clinical safety of <italic>V. officinalis</italic> L., as previously described by Houghton,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Kennedy <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Wheatley.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] As there were no statistically significant differences between treatments (<italic>Valerian</italic> or placebo) using the traditional null hypothesis test, Cohen's effect size test was carried out in order to understand the clinical significance of the results and to determine whether there were differences in the physiological parameters (SBP, DBP and HR) in the different evaluation times between the two medications. At the end of surgery, <italic>Valerian</italic> presented a better effect than placebo, albeit small (<italic>d</italic> = 0.35, on the reduction in SBP. Concerning HR the difference between groups was moderate (<italic>d</italic> = 0.59), suggesting that <italic>Valerian</italic> offers greater efficacy in the maintenance of HR following surgery [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. Discussion of physiological parameters results with literature is limited once there are no other studies with this methodology.</p><p>Regarding side-effects, the patients described sleepiness and muscle relaxation with both protocols. Valepotriates also exhibit antispasmodic activity, likely by influencing the input of the calcium ion or modifying its binding in the muscle.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] This effect may be beneficial, as, according to Smyth,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] muscle tension is one of the physical symptoms of anxiety and can be reduced or minimized with the use of <italic>Valerian</italic>. Sleepiness was observed in both the patients medicated with <italic>Valerian</italic> and those who received the placebo. It is therefore suggested that this effect may be attributed to the fatigue caused by the surgeries.</p><p>A review of the literature reveals the insufficient amount of information on the quality, safety and efficacy of herbal plants for use in dentistry.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] As this appears to be one of the first studies to assess the anxiolytic activity of <italic>V. officinalis</italic> L. in surgical dental procedures, it is hoped that this investigation can serve as a starting point for future studies involving the use of <italic>V. officinalis</italic> L. and other phytotherapeutic agents in different fields of dentistry.</p><p>The article presents some limitations. Sample size calculation was not performed, both anxious and non-anxious patients (determined by DAS scale) at the first appointment were included in the research even though no statistical difference was found between them. As the DAS scale was not a good parameter to assess anxiety of patients the anxious level was assessed by physiological parameters. Evaluation of other more direct indicators of anxious such as stress hormone should provide better understanding of anxiety and including only anxious patients could show a better result of phytotherapy. This study served as a preliminary trial for the future studies of <italic>V. officinalis</italic> L. in various fields of dentistry. It is believed, however, that <italic>Valerian</italic> showed anxiolytic activity in the volunteers and, perhaps, may constitute an important pharmacological alternative for the management of anxiety during the dental treatment. With new research showing good results as well, in the future it can represent an alternative to benzodiazepine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Considering
