It has no analgesic effect and is also used in intensive care units for sedation of adult patients on mechanical ventilation and in procedures like colonoscopies.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Propofol is widely used in medicine because of favorable effects on the patients&#x02019; recovery and low rates of associated nausea and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] However, the induction of anesthesia with propofol is often accompanied by a significant decrease in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Although a very attractive anesthetic drug, propofol has no neuromuscular blocking properties and a muscle relaxant may be needed to facilitate laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation. Recently, there has been an enthusiasm for the combined use of propofol and remifentanil to avoid the need for short acting muscle relaxants like succinylcholine.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] This combination has also been proposed to avoid complications such as anaphylactic reaction, residual curarisation and awareness, which are sometimes seen with the use of neuromuscular blocking agents during general anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Using a combination of propofol and remifentanil for anesthesia induction however, may have negative synergistic effects on patient's hemodynamic status leading to bradycardia and hypotension.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The rationale behind prophylactic use of a drug to prevent hypotension and bradycardia arises from the detrimental effect of these side-effects which are often missed due to inability of the clinicians to continuously monitor hemodynamic variables in some clinical situations. Most of the anesthetic drugs used for induction of anesthesia result in a transient and rapid decline in BP. This further underscores the importance of preventive strategies in this setting.</p><p>As a vasopressor and sympathomimetic, ephedrine has been used safely and effectively for both prevention and treatment of anesthesia-induced hypotension especially in obstetric anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It can also decrease the hemodynamic responses caused by the administration of bolus propofol.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Ephedrine has been used as a single bolus, continuous infusion or intramuscular injection.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The prophylactic use of high doses of ephedrine has demonstrated its usefulness in the treatment of propofol-induced hypotension, but it may cause marked tachycardia.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Prophylactic use of ephedrine has been also associated with hypertension in some clinical situations.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Other studies concluded that smaller doses of ephedrine prevented hypotension due to propofol induction without significant increases in HR or dysrhythmias.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Since higher doses of ephedrine can cause hypertension and may endanger patients&#x02019; lives, finding its optimal dose to make a balance between the effects and side-effects is crucial. This study was designed to assess the prophylactic effects of two different doses of ephedrine to prevent the hemodynamic changes caused by combined use of propofol and remifentanil for induction of anesthesia when muscle relaxation was considered as unnecessary.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was conducted as a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (IRCT201112061566N3). The trial was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants.</p><p>The eligible candidates for this trial were patients scheduled for short-term elective ophthalmic and orthopedic surgery under general anesthesia in two teaching hospitals. Patients between the ages of 20 and 50 years of American Society of Anesthesiologists class I and II (ASA I and II) and with a weight of 60-80 kg were included in this study. Those with a history of hypertension, angina, heart failure, thyrotoxicosis, reflux, cerebrovascular disease, history of using BP reducing medications, self-reported allergy to eggs and sensitivity to soy were not recruited. Patients with a history of arrhythmia and those who needed muscle relaxants during the surgery were also excluded from the trial.</p><p>A total of 150 patients were selected by convenience sampling, with its inherent bias and were assigned by unrestricted simple randomization to three groups of an equal number. Upon arrival to the operating room, standard monitoring was established including HR, BP and pulse oximetry. 5-7 ml/kg of ringer solution was administered over a period of 10 min. Patients were premedicated by one of the investigators who was blinded to the group assignment and content of the syringes. Patients randomized to the first and second groups received 0.07 mg/kg and 0.15 mg/kg ephedrine, respectively, diluted in normal saline up to 2 ml over a period of 10-15 s, respectively and the third group, considered as the control, received 2 ml normal saline. These doses were similar to the doses used by El-Tahan.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] All three groups received similar medications for anesthesia induction consisting of 2.5 mg/kg propofol (intravenous injection using a syringe pump, 300 ml/h) and 3 &#x003bc;g/kg remifentanil (intravenous injection of 40 &#x003bc;g/ml solution over 60 s).</p><p>Hemodynamic data (HR, Mean Systolic, Mean Diastolic blood pressure) was recorded prior to induction and the second registration of hemodynamic results was performed 2 min after anesthesia induction. Then laryngoscopy and intubation was performed. For the maintenance of anesthesia, propofol (100 &#x003bc;g/kg/min) and remifentanil (0.1 &#x003bc;g/kg/min) were infused. The third and fourth measurements were recorded respectively, 1 and 5 min after the endotracheal intubation. During this 5-min interval, no surgical stimulation was performed. From then and until the end of surgery, the patient's BP was recorded as routine.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using the SPSS software version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The quantitative data are presented as mean and standard deviation and the qualitative data as frequency.

Two patients from the control group and three patients from the low dose ephedrine group were excluded from the trial because of hypotension needing vasopressor therapy. One patient from each of the two groups receiving ephedrine was excluded because of tachycardia up to 150 beat/min requiring treatment with 0.2 mg bolus of propranolol for rate control.</p><p>The participants&#x02019; mean age in the three studied groups was 30.2 &#x000b1; 11.6 in low dose group, 29.9 &#x000b1; 9.3 in high dose group and 28.1 &#x000b1; 8.4 in the placebo group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.55).

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated that the prophylactic injection of ephedrine could reduce the risk of hypotension by 14-37%,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] when spinal anesthesia was used in pregnant patients for cesarean section. Ephedrine has been widely used as a premedication in anesthesia for various operations;[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] however, a detailed literature search failed to reveal studies evaluating the prophylactic effect of ephedrine when a combination of propofol and remifentanil are used for induction of general anesthesia.</p><p>The most critical time to encounter bradycardia and hypotension during anesthesia is immediately after induction and before tracheal intubation when the peak effect of induction drugs with minimal surgical stimulation is anticipated. Thus we measured the BP and HR 2 min after induction of anesthesia (the peak effect of propofol and remifentanil). On the other hand, to examine the safety of ephedrine to prevent these side-effects, we repeated these measurement 2 and 5 min after tracheal intubation, when peak of increase in HR and BP is anticipated.</p><p>We found that the administration of ephedrine (0.15 mg/kg) may have a significant effect in preventing hemodynamic changes after anesthesia induction with propofol and remifentanil in the setting of ASA I and II ophthalmic and orthopedic surgery. However, this effect was not observed with low dose ephedrine (0.07 mg/kg). Different doses of intravenous ephedrine as low as 0.03 mg/kg up to 0.2 mg/kg have been reported to prevent hypotension during anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Our findings are consistent with the study of El-Tahan in showing the effect of ephedrine in preventing hypotension induced by propofol and fentanyl. Investigators in the study by El-Tahan used 0.07, 0.1 and 0.15 mg/kg intravenous ephedrine in patients undergoing valve surgery. However, in the latter study, significant side-effects such as tachycardia and the risk of induced myocardial ischemia were documented. Those findings may be explained by their method of patient selection because the researchers recruited patients aged over 60 years and with ASA III and IV.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Other reasons for the lower incidence of tachycardia in our trial may be the use of remifentanil instead of fentanyl, which can more frequently cause bradycardia.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The results of our study are also in line with the findings of Michelsen <italic>et al</italic>. who studied women above 60 years of age scheduled for minor gynecological surgeries. Ephedrine with doses of 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg, i.e., slightly higher than the doses used in our study, were used 1 min before induction of anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl. They found that both doses of ephedrine had prophylactic effects against hypotension.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Substantial tachycardia was not a major problem and it was considered to be because of the effect of simultaneous use of fentanyl with propofol.</p><p>The effect of ephedrine on intubation and hemodynamic conditions in the rapid induction of anesthesia with propofol and rocuronium was evaluated in the study by Gopalakrishna <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] They studied 100 patients with ASA I between 18 and 60 years of age and found that using ephedrine with doses of 75 &#x003bc;g/kg and 100 &#x003bc;g/kg as premedication might be associated with favorable hemodynamic condition during intubation. However, the prophylactic administration of ephedrine with the used doses was only able to reduce the arterial hypotension after induction of anesthesia, rather than eliminating it entirely. In our study, a dose of 0.07 mg/kg of ephedrine, i.e., a dose close to 75 &#x003bc;g/kg used in the study of Gopalakrishna <italic>et al</italic>., was not effective in controlling the arterial hypotension. The dose of 0.15 mg/kg used in our study, i.e., a dose higher than the two doses used in the above study,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] was effective in controlling the hemodynamic parameters. This difference could be explained by the higher potency of remifentanil to cause bradycardia and hypotension in comparison with rocuronium.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] This may suggest that higher doses of ephedrine are required to prevent bradycardia and hypotension induced by propofol and remifentanil.</p><p>In reference to the side effects of ephedrine, it is suggested that ephedrine can increase BP and HR after intubation. We measured the HR and BP of the patients at 1 min and 5 min after intubation to detect any tachycardia or hypertension that could be induced by ephedrine and intubation. In our study, although there were significant differences between the three groups regarding mean systolic, and mean DBPs 1 min after intubation; however, neither parameter reached its pre-induction values. This effect of ephedrine is clinically favorable and shows its good margin of safety at one of the most vulnerable parts of anesthesia procedure to hypertension (immediately after intubation).</p><p>On the other hand, 5 min after intubation, there was no difference between the groups regarding systolic, and diastolic pressures between the control, low dose and high dose groups. This finding may suggest that ephedrine is not associated with hypertension when used in ASA I and II undergoing general anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. The differences between HR, however, are statistically significant between the three groups at 1 and 5 min after intubation. This is in concordance with others who reported short lived increase in HR with prophylactic use of ephedrine before propofol[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] though this difference is not an important clinical issue (about 10 beats/min).</p><p>Some limitations of this study should be considered. First, study was conducted in healthy ASA I and II class patients with no history of cardiovascular diseases, however, patients with significant cardiovascular disease are at a higher risk. Second, all participants were hydrated adequately before induction of anesthesia, so the result could not be extrapolated to other patients with suboptimal level of intravascular volume status. Third, although dose of 0.15 mg/kg was used safely and effectively in this patient population, we could not comment on the effect of higher doses such as 0.2 mg/kg, as is used in other studies. More studies with different doses in various patients with co-morbidities are required for more precise clinical recommendations.</p><p>Hence to conclude, the findings of this trial suggest that the administration of ephedrine (0.15 mg/kg) may have favorable prophylactic effects in preventing hypotension and bradycardia after anesthesia induction with propofol and remifentanil.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Financial support was solely provided by Shiraz University of Medical Sciences</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>PF</given-names></name><name><surname>Nathanson</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Gouldson</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Propofol.
