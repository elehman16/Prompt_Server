The capsule or tablet formulation of tacrolimus was orally administered, and serial blood samples were collected up to 96 hours after dosing. Whole-blood tacrolimus concentration was determined using liquid chromatography&#x02013;tandem mass spectrometry. The maximum whole-blood tacrolimus concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and the area under the whole-blood tacrolimus concentration&#x02013;time curve from 0 hour to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC<sub>last</sub>) were compared between the two formulations. The similarity factor (f<sub>2</sub>) of the in vitro dissolution profiles was calculated. The geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) of tablet to capsule was 0.9680 (0.8873&#x02013;1.0560) and 1.0322 (0.9359&#x02013;1.1385) for C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>last</sub>, respectively. The IIV of C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>last</sub> of the tablet was smaller than the capsule. The f<sub>2</sub> values were &#x0003e;50 in all media. Both formulations were well tolerated. Thus, the tablet formulation of tacrolimus has smaller IIV in the systemic exposure than capsule, while having comparable PK and tolerability profiles, which may render it as a better treatment option for organ transplant patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>new formulation</kwd><kwd>incrementally modified drug</kwd><kwd>comparative pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>healthy volunteers</kwd><kwd>immunosuppressant</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tacrolimus, a macrolide antibiotic, has been used as an effective immunosuppressive agent for the prevention of graft rejection after organ or bone marrow transplantations.<xref rid="b1-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Similar to cyclosporine, tacrolimus is one of the NTI drugs, which have a restricted range of effective dose window that does not produce adverse toxic effects.<xref rid="b2-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> NTI drugs require close monitoring of the patients, particularly when the IIV in their systemic exposure is large, of which tacrolimus is an example<xref rid="b3-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> partly due to its pharmacogenetic polymorphism.<xref rid="b4-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Developing a new formulation can be a viable strategy to reduce large IIV, particularly for orally administered drugs, such that more consistent dissolution from the dosage form and thereby absorption is ensured.<xref rid="b5-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> For example, poorly water-soluble drugs such as proquazone get dissolved faster in the gastrointestinal tract when administered as granulate or tablet than as capsule.<xref rid="b6-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In addition, patients may have more hard time swallowing a capsule than a tablet because the floating property of the capsule makes it lighter than water, causing the uneasy globus sensation.

Furthermore, it was interesting to know if new tablet formulation could reduce the IIV in the systemic exposure to tacrolimus compared with the conventional capsule formulation. This property, once confirmed, can contribute to more consistent and predictable clinical performance in patients with transplantation.</p><p>Based on this understanding, the objectives of the present study were 1) to evaluate the PK and tolerability profiles of tacrolimus for the new tablet formulation and its IIV in the systemic exposure and 2) to compare them with those of the conventional capsule formulation.

This HPLC system was coupled with an Applied Biosystems API 5000 triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Quantification was conducted in the positive ion MRM mode. Tacrolimus was monitored with an MRM transition of <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> =821.6 &#x02192; 768.7, and ascomycin (IS) was monitored with an MRM transition of <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> =809.6 &#x02192; 756.7. Tacrolimus 5.1 mg and ascomycin 2.11 mg were dissolved in 10 mL of methanol for preparation of standard stock solution and IS solution, respectively. An aliquot of 100 &#x003bc;L human whole blood was added with 20 &#x003bc;L of IS solution (ascomycin, 100 ng/mL) followed by addition of 750 &#x003bc;L of methyl-<italic>tert</italic>-butyl ether.

The evidence is that the interindividual CV in the C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>last</sub> of tacrolimus tablet was 15.8% and 28.2% smaller, respectively, than that of capsule used as reference, which was marginally and statistically significant, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-dddt-11-2861">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dddt-11-2861">Table 2</xref>). It is well known that the inter-individual PK variability of tacrolimus is huge. For example, the absolute bioavailability of tacrolimus ranged from 5% to 93% due to its extensive first-pass effect caused by CYP3A enzyme-dependent metabolism, and the IIV of the apparent clearance and volume of distribution was 39.7%&#x02013;124% in adult organ transplant patients.<xref rid="b14-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Because patients receiving tacrolimus after transplantation require meticulous therapeutic drug concentration monitoring due to its inherently large IIV, the tablet formulation can be useful by ensuring more consistent exposure as seen in the present study.</p><p>Interestingly, a similar finding was previously reported in a study with lopinavir.<xref rid="b15-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Namely, the IIV in the trough concentrations of lopinavir in HIV-infected pregnant women in the third trimester was 18.8% lower with tablet than with capsule (34.6% and 42.6% CV for tablet and capsule, respectively). Based on this finding along with our observation, a couple of hypotheses can be suggested to explain the lower IIV of tablet than capsule. First, faster dissolution of tablet may contribute to its smaller IIV, particularly for drugs with poor water solubility such as tacrolimus.<xref rid="b5-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> For example, the tablet formulations of proquazone showed a significantly faster dissolution of the drug substance than the capsule formulations, which became more apparent with high doses.<xref rid="b6-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> To test this hypothesis, we compared the in vitro dissolution profiles of the tablet and capsule formulations in several pH conditions and water. However, this experiment resulted in an f<sub>2</sub> value of &#x0003e;50 in all media with different pH values, indicating no difference in the dissolution profile between tablet and capsule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-dddt-11-2861">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, the smaller IIV of tacrolimus observed with tablet in this study could not be attributed to the faster dissolution profile of tablet compared with capsule. Second, the differences in the excipient contents between a single tablet and two capsules administered were suspected as a causal factor responsible for the different IIV shown in the present study. For example, one of the most widely used excipients for hard capsules is glycerin, a form of lipid used as a plasticizer during the manufacturing process.<xref rid="b16-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Upon intake of the lipid, such as glycerin-containing substances, the pancreatic juice and bile should be excreted into the gastrointestinal tract to initiate fat digestion<xref rid="b17-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and the IIV in the amount of bile secretion may have indirectly affected the IIV in drug absorption.<xref rid="b18-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, the differences in the excipient contents, including forms of lipid, between the two formulations were minimal (data on file). Therefore, the possibility that differences in the excipients caused differences in the IIV in tacrolimus exposure can be ruled out.</p><p>No matter which mechanisms gave rise to the smaller IIV in the systemic exposure to tacrolimus when administered with tablet, it showed comparable PK and tolerability profiles to those of the conventional capsule formulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dddt-11-2861">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dddt-11-2861">Table 1</xref>). The PK parameters were also comparable to those previously reported, particularly the IIV in tacrolimus exposure with capsule in healthy subjects ranging from 38.4% to 53.1% for C<sub>max</sub> and AUCs.<xref rid="b19-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The comparability in the PK parameters between tablet and capsule, along with the smaller IIV for tablet, suggests that the new tablet formulation can be a useful treatment option to maintain a consistent systemic exposure level of tacrolimus, which may help reduce graft failure in organ transplant patients.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the magnitude of IIV for C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>last</sub> of tacrolimus capsule in the present study (39.9% and 59.2%, respectively, CV%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dddt-11-2861">Table 2</xref>) was larger, particularly for AUC<sub>last</sub>, than those reported previously in Europeans, which ranged 20.2%&#x02013;28.7% and 15.2%&#x02013;30.6%, respectively, for C<sub>max</sub> and AUC.<xref rid="b20-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> We hypothesize that this difference was mainly caused by the fact that the loss-of-function allele for CYP3A5, that is, *3, is much less frequent in Europeans than in Asians.<xref rid="b21-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> No matter how large or small the IIV is, it should be compared within the same ethnic group, not across other ethnic populations, if the magnitude of IIV is evaluated between different formulations as in the present study.</p><p>The present study had several limitations. First, the smaller interindividual PK variability of tacrolimus with tablet may not be reproduced in organ transplant patients because the study was performed in healthy volunteers. However, given that patients tend to have larger IIV than healthy subjects,<xref rid="b22-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> the difference in the IIV between tablet and capsule is very likely to be enlarged further in patients as shown in the comparison of oral tacrolimus in healthy and patients with kidney, liver, and heart transplantation.<xref rid="b22-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Therefore, the smaller IIV in the systemic exposure to tacrolimus taken as tablet in healthy subjects can be still beneficial in patients who underwent organ transplantation. Second, although the present study showed a similar PK profile between the capsule and tablet formulations of tacrolimus, it did not meet the more stringent 90%&#x02013;111% criteria for the bioequivalence of NTI drugs such as tacrolimus.<xref rid="b23-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b25-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> However, the objective of the present study was not to show that the tablet formulation of tacrolimus was bioequivalent to the capsule formulation; rather, it was to assess the PK characteristics of the tablet formulation and to compare its bioavailability with that of capsule using the conventional bioequivalence criteria of 80%&#x02013;125% criteria. Because the mean concentration&#x02013;time profiles of the two formulations almost overlapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dddt-11-2861">Figure 1A and B</xref>), it is likely that the 90% CIs of GMR for C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>last</sub> could fall within the narrower 90%&#x02013;110% range if a larger number of subjects are enrolled, for which future studies are warranted. Lastly, intraindividual, rather than interindividual, variability is important in maintaining a consistent systemic exposure to tacrolimus in an individual, which our study was not able to compare between the tablet and capsule formulations due to the lack of repeated design.<xref rid="b20-dddt-11-2861" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, smaller IIV still has a role to play in patients with organ transplantation, particularly for ensuring that the systemic exposure to tacrolimus does not fall below (ie, subtherapeutic) or above (ie, supratherapeutic or toxic) the recommended therapeutic range.</p><p>In summary, a new tablet formulation of tacrolimus showed smaller IIV in PK parameters than the conventional capsule formulation, while both formulations had comparable PK and tolerability profiles. These beneficial characteristics of the tablet formulation of tacrolimus can make it a useful alternative to the conventional capsule formulation in patients after organ transplantation, who are likely to have much larger IIV than healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The tablet formulation of tacrolimus has similar PK and tolerability profiles as capsule formulation. Tacrolimus tablet can be a useful alternative to capsule for organ transplant patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The first author (Yu Kyong Kim) received a scholarship from the BK21-plus education program provided by the National Research Foundation of Korea.
