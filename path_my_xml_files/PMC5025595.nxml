Nonfatal suicide attempts lead to over 200,000 hospitalizations and 600,000 emergency department visits annually. Recent evidence indicates that responses to the commonly used Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) can identify outpatients who are at risk of suicide attempt and suicide death and that specific psychotherapy or Care Management programs can prevent suicide attempts in high-risk patients. Motivated by these developments, the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network has undertaken a multisite trial of two outreach programs to prevent suicide attempts among outpatients identified by routinely administered PHQ9 questionnaires.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Outpatients who are at risk of suicide attempt are automatically identified using data from electronic health records (EHRs). Following a modified Zelen design, all those identified are assigned to continued usual care (i.e., no contact) or to be offered one of two population-based outreach programs. A Care Management intervention includes systematic outreach to assess suicide risk, EHR-based tools to implement risk-based care pathways, and care management to facilitate recommended follow-up. A Skills Training intervention includes interactive online training in Dialectical Behavior Therapy skills, supported by reminder and reinforcement messages from a skills coach. Each intervention supplements, rather than replaces, usual care; participants may receive any other services normally available. Interventions are delivered primarily by secure messaging through EHR patient portals. Suicide attempts and deaths following randomization are identified using state vital statistics data and health system EHR and insurance claim data. Primary evaluation will compare risk of suicide attempt or death over 18&#x000a0;months according to the initial assignment, regardless of intervention participation. Recruitment is underway in three health systems (Group Health Cooperative, HealthPartners, and Kaiser Permanente Colorado). Over 2500 participants have been randomized as of 1 March 2016, with enrollment averaging approximately 100 per week.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Assessing the effectiveness of population-based suicide prevention requires adherence to the principles of pragmatic trials: population-based enrollment, accepting variable treatment participation, assessing outcomes using health record data, and analyses based on intent-to-treat.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov registration #<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT02326883&#x00026;Search=Search">NCT02326883</ext-link>, registered on 23 December 2014.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Suicide</kwd><kwd>Prevention</kwd><kwd>Pragmatic trial</kwd><kwd>Care management</kwd><kwd>Consent waiver</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UH3 MH007755</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>Gregory E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Suicide remains the 10th-ranked most frequent cause of death in the United States, accounting for over 40,000 deaths per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

In contrast with other common causes of death, suicide mortality has not decreased over the last 25&#x000a0;years.</p><p>While prevention of suicide attempts and suicide death is a public health priority, existing evidence does not clearly support selective or secondary prevention programs. In 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to support the benefits of screening for suicide risk in general medical outpatients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. That review found insufficient evidence both for the accuracy of screening tests and for the effectiveness of interventions in those identified by screening.</p><p>More recent evidence indicates that responses to the commonly used Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) can identify outpatients who are at increased risk of suicide attempt and suicide death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Patients reporting frequent thoughts of death or self-injury (the ninth item of the PHQ9) show a sustained increase in risk, with cumulative hazard approaching 4&#x000a0;% over 12&#x000a0;months. Reflecting this new evidence, the Joint Commission recently issued a Sentinel Event Alert [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] regarding detection of suicidal ideation in health care settings.</p><p>In addition, growing evidence supports the effectiveness of tertiary or indicated prevention interventions for high-risk patients. Structured psychotherapy emphasizing specific behavioral and cognitive skills has been proven to reduce risk among people who have made recent suicide attempts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Outreach and Care Management programs appear to reduce risk among people who have made recent suicide attempts or high-risk patients treated in mental health specialty clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This evidence for tertiary prevention suggests that similar interventions could reduce risk in the broader (secondary prevention) population of patients who are experiencing frequent suicidal ideation.</p><p>Motivated by these developments, the National Institute of Mental Health-funded Mental Health Research Network has undertaken a multisite trial of two population-based programs to prevent suicide attempts among outpatients identified by routinely administered depression questionnaires. Both programs include systematic outreach and regular supportive contact. One focuses on risk assessment and care management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], while the other includes online training in specific skills from Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This pragmatic trial will examine whether either program can reduce long-term risk compared to care as usual.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview</title><p>At participating health systems, outpatients who are at increased risk of suicide attempt are identified using data from electronic health records (EHRs).

Because this validation work was completed prior to health care systems&#x02019; transition from the <italic>International Classification of Diseases, version 9</italic> (ICD-9) to ICD-10 diagnoses, additional work will be necessary in 2016 to revalidate outcome definitions based on ICD-10 diagnostic codes. Given that participants may seek care for self-injury at external facilities, ascertainment will include both insurance claim and EHR data, and the sample is limited to patients who are enrolled in a health system insurance plan.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Analysis plan</title><p>Primary analyses will use the log-rank test to compare risk of diagnosed suicide attempt (defined above) over 18&#x000a0;months following randomization. For each intervention condition, risk among those assigned to the intervention will be compared to risk among those assigned to usual care &#x02013; regardless of level of participation in either intervention. Individuals will be censored at time of health system disenrollment, death from cause other than suicide, or administratively, at 18&#x000a0;months following randomization. We evaluate the effect of each of the interventions compared to usual care using a log-rank test stratified by site and initial response to PHQ9 item 9 (2 versus 3). Sensitivity analyses will use weighted log-rank tests to account for a possible association between prerandomization characteristics (ascertained from EHRs) and censoring. In censoring weights, we will include sex, age group (18&#x02013;29, 30&#x02013;64, and 65 or more), race/ethnicity (Black American, Asian American, Hispanic, other), and visit type at which the initial PHQ9 questionnaire was completed (primary care versus mental health specialty).</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Sample size</title><p>Original sample size estimates were based on previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] suggesting an approximately 4&#x000a0;% risk of suicide attempt over 18&#x000a0;months among those meeting study eligibility criteria. Consultation with health system stakeholders indicated that implementation of a systematic outreach program was unlikely unless a program could be expected to reduce that risk to 3&#x000a0;% (relative risk reduction of 25&#x000a0;%). We used PASS software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] to estimate the sample size required for a log-rank test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] with 90&#x000a0;% power to compare the survival curves assuming a 3.8&#x000a0;% risk over 18&#x000a0;months in the comparison group and a 25&#x000a0;% risk reduction in the intervention group. We assumed 2&#x000a0;% disenrollment rate each month, resulting in approximately 25&#x000a0;% censorship over the 18&#x000a0;months of follow-up. The primary comparison for this trial is each of the interventions compared to usual care; we use a Bonferroni correction to account for the two tests in our primary analysis. Assuming a two-sided log-rank test, with a type-1 error rate of 0.025 and 90&#x000a0;%, we plan on enrolling 6500 patients per arm (total <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;19,500).</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Enrollment progress</title><p>The trial was funded through the NIH Health Care Systems Collaboratory as one of the initial Pragmatic Clinical Trials Demonstration Projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Following a pilot phase to validate outcome definitions and to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention programs, participant enrollment and randomization began at the Group Health site in March 2015, expanding to three sites in July 2015. Approximately 4000 participants have been enrolled and randomized as of 1 July 2016. Approximately 100 participants are enrolled and randomized each week, and that rate is expected to increase to approximately 150 in the fall of 2016.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Ethical and regulatory approval</title><p>Study design and procedures were reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Boards at all three health system. That review process addressed several issues common to pragmatic trials of prevention interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Waiver of informed consent</title><p>Limiting a randomized trial of outreach to those who actively consent to receive outreach would yield a result of questionable validity and generalizability. Consequently, a modified Zelen design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], randomizing all eligible patients without first obtaining consent, is necessary for valid test of the study question. This design, however, requires a waiver of the usual requirement for informed consent prior to enrollment or randomization. While it is not practicable to obtain informed consent prior to randomization, it is practicable to provide appropriate information to participants at the time intervention services are offered. As described above, invitation messages to participants assigned to either intervention include a brief description of the study purpose, study procedures, potential risks, and the right to decline participation. This design, therefore, includes a waiver of consent for enrollment/randomization and a modified consent procedure for receipt of intervention services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Defining minimal risk</title><p>Current regulations regarding protection of human research participants allow waiver of consent for research involving no more than minimal risk. Our proposal to waive the requirement for informed consent in patients who are at risk of suicide attempt led to extensive discussions with health system Institutional Review Boards, leadership of the NIH Healthcare Systems Research Collaboratory, and the federal Office for Human Research Protections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Those discussions helped to clarify four issues:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Research risk versus preexisting risk &#x02013; Given that the trial enrolls patients who are at risk of suicide attempt, we encountered concern that study procedures could not be classified as having minimal risk. To address this concern, we relied on regulatory guidance distinguishing between preexisting risk due to a research participant&#x02019;s health state (i.e., increased risk of suicide attempt) and incremental risk created by study procedures. This distinction led to the appreciation of this trial as evaluating minimal-risk interventions in a high-risk population</p></list-item><list-item><p>Risk of assignment to continued usual care &#x02013; We also encountered concern regarding the ethical acceptability of randomly assigning patients who are at risk of suicide attempt to a usual care control condition. We clarified that a participant assigned to usual care will, by definition, receive the same treatment that she or he would have received if the study were not occurring</p></list-item><list-item><p>Risk of assignment to offer of intervention programs &#x02013; We also encountered concern that assignment to either intervention group might increase risk. Both intervention programs are based on effective interventions and are intended to reduce risk of suicide attempt. Participants are free to receive any other services that are normally available. Nevertheless, it is possible that some participants will experience negative effects from either program. We addressed this concern by clarifying that participants are assigned to the offer of an intervention, with no obligation to participate. Invitation messages clearly identify intervention programs as research activities, make no promise of benefit, and advise that participation is completely voluntary</p></list-item><list-item><p>Intrusiveness or invasion of privacy &#x02013; Different stakeholders expressed concern regarding both inappropriate intrusiveness of repeated outreach and inadequate vigor of outreach given the known increased risk of suicide attempt. In consultation with peer experts, we designed the outreach strategy described above, including up to three cycles of invitation, as a reasonable compromise between these two concerns.</p></list-item></list></p><p>At all participating health systems, notices regarding privacy practices specifically advise members regarding the use of health records for research. Members who have previously requested exclusion from research contact are excluded from the study sample.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Monitoring for adverse events</title><p>In most clinical trials of mental health treatments, a suicide attempt would be considered a serious adverse event, subject to immediate reporting and review to determine the &#x0201c;relatedness&#x0201d; of an individual suicide attempt to study participation. This traditional approach was clearly not appropriate for a large-scale trial of population-based prevention programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. First, record data regarding suicide attempts may not be available for 3&#x000a0;months or more following an event. Second, several hundred suicide attempts are expected to occur among study participants, and review of individual events could not determine causal relationship to study participation. While it is possible that either intervention could paradoxically increase risk of suicide attempt, that could only be determined by comparison to suicide attempt rates in usual care (see below).</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Interim analyses of benefit or harm</title><p>We do not plan any interim analyses to evaluate benefit of the intervention programs. First, early detection of a benefit of either intervention is extremely unlikely. We project that randomization will be complete before complete outcome data are available for half of the participants. Second, early termination of randomization or intervention delivery would not offer any additional protection to current or future study participants. Premature termination would instead return all current and potential participants to care as usual.</p><p>We do, however, plan interim analyses testing for evidence of significant harm (increased risk of suicide attempt) in either intervention group compared to usual care. Clear evidence that either intervention resulted in significantly increased risk of suicide attempt would certainly warrant suspending assignment of patients to that program or suspending delivery of that program to participants already assigned. Interim analyses comparing risk of suicide attempt in each intervention group to that in usual care will be conducted three times per year, beginning 12&#x000a0;months after start of enrollment. Interim analyses will be reported to the National Institute of Mental Health Data and Safety Monitoring Board by the study statistician, but all other study staff will be blinded to these results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Data and resource sharing</title><p>A deidentified version of the analytic dataset will be made available at the time of the initial publication of primary study findings. Consistent with policies of the NIH Collaboratory, all resources (intervention materials, specifications, computer code, etc.) will be shared at or before the publication of study results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Discussion</title><p>This suicide prevention outreach trial addresses a practical question that is relevant to practicing clinicians or health system leaders: Will population-based outreach programs reduce risk of suicide attempt among patients identified as being at risk by routinely administered depression questionnaires? This focus on a practical or pragmatic question has several implications for trial design. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> describes how specific aspects of this trial conform to the characteristics of pragmatic trials described by Thorpe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].
