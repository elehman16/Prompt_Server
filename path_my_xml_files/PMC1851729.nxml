Primary outcomes: At the PTEs the prevalence of BV was consistently lower in treatment than placebo arms irrespective of HIV status. The differences were statistically significant mainly in HIV-uninfected women. Prevalence of BV was also reduced over time in both treatment and placebo arms. In a multivariable analysis that controlled for other covariates, the effect of intravaginal metronidazole treatment gel compared with placebo was not substantial: adjusted relative risk (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83&#x02013;0.97 in HIV-uninfected women and adjusted RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89&#x02013;1.01 in HIV-infected women. Secondary outcomes: Intravaginal metronidazole treatment gel significantly increased BV clearance (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.34, 95% CI 1.07&#x02013;1.67 among HIV-uninfected women and adjusted HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.06&#x02013;1.58 among HIV-infected women) but was not associated with decreased BV recurrence. <italic>Safety:</italic> No serious adverse events were related to use of intravaginal gels.</p></sec><sec id="st8"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Intermittent microbicide treatment with intravaginal gels is an innovative approach that can reduce the frequency of vaginal infections such as BV.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editor"><title>Editorial Commentary</title><sec id="st9"><title/><p>
<bold>Background:</bold> Bacterial vaginosis (BV) results from a change in the normal balance of bacteria in the vaginal tract, and is very common. In pregnant women, it is associated with poorer outcomes in pregnancy, and is also linked with HIV transmission (although it is not certain that BV actually increases the chance of getting HIV&#x02014;just because these two occur together it does not necessarily follow that one causes the other). BV can be treated with metronidazole tablets, although these can cause gut symptoms and should not be taken repeatedly. The researchers wanted to carry out a multiclinic&#x02013;based trial to find out whether a metronidazole gel applied intermittently to the vagina (for five nights every three months) would reduce the frequency of BV among women in Malawi. HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women, recruited from postnatal and family planning clinics, were randomized to receive either metronidazole gels, or equivalent placebo gels, every three months and were then followed up for 12 months. The primary outcome for the trial was the proportion of women with BV at each quarterly follow-up visit, and the researchers intended to compare this outcome between treatment arms at each visit and also to look at the overall changes over time among women receiving either metronidazole or placebo, looking separately at HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women.</p><p>
<bold>What this trial shows:</bold> In total 1,686 women took part in the trial (842 not infected with HIV, and 844 infected with HIV). The proportion of HIV-uninfected women with BV dropped by around 20% over the course of the trial, both in women using metronidazole and in those using placebo. However, when comparing the proportion of HIV-uninfected women with BV between the two arms of the trial, there did not seem to be a consistent effect: differences were statistically significant at some time points and not others. Among HIV-infected women, there was also a drop over the course of the trial in the proportion of women with BV, irrespective of whether they used metronidazole or placebo. Again, when comparing the rate of BV among HIV-infected women between study arms (metronidazole versus placebo), the researchers did not see a consistent trend; differences were statistically significant at some time points but not others. Overall, when comparing metronidazole and placebo in an analysis that controlled for other factors, the metronidazole gel seemed to show a small effect in reduction of BV among HIV-uninfected women, but no obvious effect among HIV-infected women.</p><p>
<bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> Strengths in the design of this trial include the sample size, which was appropriate to detect an important effect of the metronidazole gel (versus placebo) had one existed, and the randomization and blinding procedures, which were designed to minimize the chance that the trialists or women being enrolled could anticipate to which arm of the trial they might be assigned. A key limitation of this study, as the researchers acknowledge, is the absence of a &#x0201c;no treatment&#x0201d; study arm. The frequency of BV dropped over the course of the trial in women using the placebo gel, raising the possibility that the placebo actually has some effect on bacteria in the vagina. However, a trial with a &#x0201c;no treatment&#x0201d; arm would pose its own problems, since trialists and participants would then not be fully blinded as to their treatment status.</p><p>
<bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> This trial adds data on the efficacy of metronidazole gel when used intermittently, and among women in the community who may or may not actually have BV. Previous studies have evaluated treatment with metronidazole among women who already have symptoms or a diagnosis of BV. The findings of this trial rule out a substantial effect of metronidazole gel, as compared to placebo gel, in reducing the frequency of BV in this setting.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Taha TE, Kumwenda NI, Kafulafula G, Makanani B, Nkhoma C, et al.

The vaginal ecology is dynamic, where a <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-dominant flora maintains an optimum acidic pH, which suppresses BV-associated bacteria, and an elevated vaginal pH facilitates growth of sexually transmitted organisms [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The treatment of choice for BV is oral metronidazole. Another treatment option is intravaginal metronidazole gel (0.75%) [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Intravaginal therapy has minimal systemic effects and the cure rates are comparable to the oral regimen [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>We reported, in studies in Malawi, Africa, that disturbances of vaginal flora were common and associated with HIV-1 infection [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Identifying a simple treatment regimen for these vaginal disturbances is a priority. Ideally, the treatment of choice should be safe, easy to use, and effective over a long period of time. Because earlier studies showed that only 11% of women had a normal vaginal flora [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], a presumptive (mass) treatment approach would be practical. We therefore decided on an approach in which all women were randomized to receive either an intravaginal antibiotic gel or an intravaginal placebo gel. We opted to use intravaginal metronidazole gel instead of oral metronidazole in this study because oral metronidazole can cause gastrointestinal discomfort and is difficult to tolerate on repeated use [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Intravaginal metronidazole gel has a substantially lower dose than oral metronidazole. An additional rationale for use of an intravaginal antibiotic was to mimic other vaginal microbicide studies that require daily use of the product, while in this study use of a vaginal product is intermittent.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Nonpregnant HIV-uninfected and -infected women were recruited to this study from the postnatal care and family planning clinics of the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, a tertiary referral hospital, and two health centers in Blantyre, Malawi. All women were counseled and gave consent prior to enrollment. Inclusion criteria were: ability and willingness to give written consent; nonpregnant; willingness to return for follow-up visits; willingness to use the product as instructed; willingness to provide specimens at each visit to test for pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection (STI); and residing in the study area. Exclusion criteria were: inability to provide informed consent; pregnant; and refusal of any of the enrollment inclusion requirements. Although use of metronidazole during pregnancy is generally safe, adequate data are not available on use of metronidazole gel during pregnancy. Therefore, women who became pregnant during this study had product use discontinued and were followed throughout pregnancy.

Women were enrolled at the first (baseline) visit (V1.0) and returned for follow-up visits quarterly, at 3, 6, 9, and 12 mo (V2.0, V3.0, V4.0, and V5.0). Additional post-treatment evaluation (PTE) visits occurred 1 mo after product dispensation, at 1, 4, 7, and 10 months (V1.9, V2.9, V3.9, and V4.9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pctr-0020010-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pctr-0020010-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Study Profile</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pctr.0020010.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study Products</title><p>We used metronidazole vaginal gel (0.75% MetroGel-Vaginal, 3M Pharmaceuticals, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.3M.com/pharma">http://www.3M.com/pharma</ext-link>) buffered to a pH of 4.0 in the treatment arm. Each gram of metronidazole vaginal gel contained 7.5 mg of metronidazole and other ingredients as specified by the manufacturer [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Each full applicator delivers approximately 5 g of gel containing 37.5 mg of metronidazole in solution. The placebo gel was similar to treatment gel but without the antibiotic metronidazole, and is the same placebo that was used for the licensing studies of the active gel. The placebo gel contained the same excipients as the active gel, including preservatives such as methyl and propyl parapens, as well as edetate disodium. It also contained carbomer 934P, which has a buffering capacity to maintain vaginal pH. Study products were used intravaginally once a day (at bedtime) for five consecutive nights every 3 mo. Participants were counseled in this study not to wash the inside of the vagina until the following morning. At each visit participants received one tube and five disposable vaginal applicators. In total, four courses of product were used during this trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Laboratory Procedures</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>HIV testing.</title><p>Prior to enrollment, all women were provided adequate pre- and post-test HIV counseling by trained counselors.

Analyses were also conducted to compare events longitudinally within the same study arms between visits. Chi-square (exact test) and other nonparametric tests were used for these comparisons. Generalized estimating equation log binomial models based on relative risk ratio assessed longitudinal associations of treatment with BV after controlling for other covariates measured at multiple visits to account for repeated visit correlation of these repeated observations.

Nonvaginal intermittent presumptive treatment of STIs has been used in large community-based trials [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this study intermittent treatment with metronidazole gel reduced BV when compared with placebo at the cross-sectional visits or compared longitudinally with baseline frequency. These declines were especially consistent among HIV-uninfected women (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0020010-t002">Table 2</xref>); among HIV-infected women the declines in BV prevalence were less substantial (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0020010-t003">Table 3</xref>). There were also very significant declines from baseline in frequency of BV with placebo, suggesting that the placebo gel may have had a microbicidal effect. It is likely that the placebo, similar to the treatment, may have changed the vaginal environment as a lubricant or chemical barrier. Therefore declines in prevalence of BV with metronidazole gel treatment in this study were in addition to any beneficial effects of placebo.</p><p>Among HIV-uninfected women, treatment was associated with a progressive increase in normal vaginal flora (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0020010-t002">Table 2</xref>), suggesting restoration and maintenance of normal vaginal flora. Among HIV-infected women there was no increase in normal flora (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0020010-t003">Table 3</xref>), possibly due to a weaker immune response, inability to restore vaginal flora, or more persistence of BV [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In multivariable analysis (after controlling for BV at baseline because it is a predictor of subsequent BV infection), <named-content content-type="genus-species">Trichomonas</named-content> infection increased the risk of BV while lower vaginal pH was associated with lower risk of BV (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0020010-t004">Table 4</xref>). These findings are consistent with vaginal pH patterns in which <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. vaginalis</named-content> and BV organisms favor a higher (&#x0003e;4.5) vaginal pH while other organisms such as candida species favor a lower (4.0&#x02013;4.5) vaginal pH [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As reported by others [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the frequency of candida was higher among women who used metronidazole gel, but most of these women were asymptomatic. Treating BV-associated bacteria may also allow other organisms such as candida species to predominate [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Examination of BV prevalence pattern in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0020010-t002">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0020010-t003">3</xref> shows that there was a decrease in BV prevalence following each act of intravaginal gel application (PTE visits) that was followed by an increase at each subsequent quarterly visit (e.g., in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0020010-t002">Table 2</xref> in the treatment arm BV prevalence increased from 35.0% at V1.9 to 38.4% at V2.0 and from 28.0% at V2.9 to 34.4% at V3.0). This suggests either BV recurrence or persistence (i.e., inadequate clearance of BV). Our findings suggest that metronidazole intravaginal gel, compared to placebo, was more effective at clearing BV than preventing recurrences. For example, after controlling for several factors, treatment with metronidazole gel in both HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected women was significantly associated with BV clearance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0020010-t005">Table 5</xref>) but not with BV recurrence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0020010-t006">Table 6</xref>). Among both HIV-uninfected and -infected women the median time to clearance of BV was about three months with metronidazole gel and about four months with placebo gel (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The median times for recurrence were not different by study arm (albeit significantly shorter among HIV-infected [&#x0223c;3 mo] compared to uninfected women [&#x0223c;7 mo]). Vaginal douching was not associated with BV clearance but significantly increased recurrence. It is likely that BV clearance was not influenced by vaginal douching, because women were advised not to douche after application of the intravaginal gel. Because douching is a common practice in this population (&#x0223c;70% reported douching at baseline), women would have resumed regular douching after completion of gel use, enhancing BV recurrence, possibly through changes in vaginal flora [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The lack of a study arm that did not use an intravaginal gel as a control arm is a limitation of this study, as an estimate of true efficacy of the metronidazole intravaginal treatment gel would have required use of no product. This is a challenging aspect of almost all microbicide trial designs [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0020010-t004">Table 4</xref> the overall estimate of efficacy of treatment gel compared to placebo gel was modest. Use of an arm with no intravaginal gel, however, would have weakened the study design due to nonmasking, possible dilution of estimated effect (due to potential contamination), and poor retention. The alternative design of using intermittent oral metronidazole tablets as a comparison arm also has limitations such as nonmasking. Other factors, such as changes in behavior for being in the study, should also be considered for the substantial BV reductions (Hawthorne effect). It is unlikely, however, that the temporal effect of any counseling and clinical services provided during this study has been differential, because these services were for all women and the study personnel were masked. The most plausible explanation for the similar trends in BV reduction in both arms of this study is the inherent activity of the placebo formulation. Despite metronidazole intravaginal gel being more effective, its true efficacy is underestimated in this study due to the residual effect of the placebo gel. Finding a universal &#x0201c;inert&#x0201d; placebo vaginal gel remains a priority for microbicide research.</p><p>The results of this study are unlikely to be influenced by losses of women during follow-up. The losses in each study arm were comparable and there were no differences in demographic and acceptability characteristics of women who completed or did not complete the study. Additionally, the efficacy of treatment was established by both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses when losses were minimal at earlier visits. In this study, we note that a comparable proportion of HIV-infected and -uninfected women became pregnant. Other studies in sub-Saharan Africa, however, reported lower rates of pregnancy among HIV-infected women due to biological factors limiting fertility in HIV-infected women such as failure to conceive and increased pregnancy losses [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Further analysis of our data suggests that multiple factors may have contributed to the comparability of pregnancy rates among HIV-infected and -uninfected women. For example, over 70% of the HIV-uninfected women were using a family planning method (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0020010-t001">Table 1</xref>), prevalence of use was significantly higher among HIV-uninfected compared to -infected women (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), and additionally, HIV infected women who became pregnant were younger, healthier, wanted a pregnancy sooner, and used a family planning method less (unpublished data). We did not assess drug resistance during this intermittent use of the product. Available data are reassuring and suggest that metronidazole is highly active despite its widespread use and development of resistance is rare [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Intermittent use of intravaginal gels should be considered for treatment of vaginal infections. These gels could modify the vaginal milieu, coat vaginal surfaces and potentially prevent attachment of pathogenic organisms to appropriate receptors, and/or physically reduce itching and accompanying trauma inside the vagina or on the vulval surface. Vaginal products, mostly traditional agents, are extensively used in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, intermittent use of vaginal gels would be culturally acceptable.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>The findings of this study can be applied to other populations in Africa. Despite the exclusions we made in this trial as required in the protocol, women enrolled had important characteristics comparable to other populations in Malawi and sub-Saharan Africa, thus enhancing external validity. For example, HIV prevalence among women enrolled in this study was around 26% (similar to HIV prevalence estimates in the antenatal/postnatal clinics in urban Malawi [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]) and BV prevalence in this study was similar to others reported from Uganda and South Africa [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overall Evidence</title><p>BV is a common condition with a poorly understood etiology [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It is not recognized as a typical STI despite being influenced by multiple underlying risk factors that are characteristic of conventional STIs. Likewise, its treatment and prevention remain difficult. We conducted a web-based PubMed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pubmed.gov">http://www.pubmed.gov</ext-link>) literature search focusing on treatment of BV in nonpregnant women to compare with findings from our current trial. In a review article of BV treatment options in nonpregnant women, Joesoef and colleagues recommended oral metronidazole (500 mg twice daily for 7 d), clindamycin vaginal cream (2% once daily for 7 d), or metronidazole vaginal gel (0.75% twice daily for 5 d) [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Subsequent to this review, a randomized prospective study conducted in the US reported no differences in efficacy or safety between once-daily or twice-daily BV treatment for five consecutive days with 0.75% metronidazole intravaginal gel [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Comparison of intravaginal and oral metronidazole treatment regimens also showed no differences in efficacy by mode of administration; however, women receiving oral metronidazole are more likely to experience gastrointestinal side effects, although oral medication may be more convenient [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We opted to use a once-daily intravaginal regimen for five days to simplify the regimen and maximize adherence. We also preferred a topical application instead of oral medication because of our interest in vaginal microbicides and assessment of the intermittent regimen in an African setting where adherence with a daily application of an effective vaginal microbicide could be a challenge. The findings of this study are in agreement with available literature on the efficacy of treatment of BV using intravaginal metronidazole gel [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The longitudinal efficacy estimates of intravaginal metronidazole gel in our study were lower than estimates reported from US studies because we followed a presumptive treatment approach and did not limit enrollment to symptomatic or BV-established women as has been the approach in other studies [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Recurrence of BV is a limitation of existing regimens, and recent data suggest that a more aggressive and extended treatment is needed to manage BV recurrences [<xref rid="pctr-0020010-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our study is unique in assessing the concept of intermittent intravaginal gel and for evaluating this regimen among both HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected African women.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPORTING INFORMATION</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020010-sd001"><label>CONSORT Checklist</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020010.sd001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(51 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020010-sd002"><label>Trial Protocol</label><caption><title>Metro Study Protocol 2001</title><p>(9.6 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0020010.sd002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are indebted to the women who participated in this study.
