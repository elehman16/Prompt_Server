Health risk assessment (HRA), a method successfully used in working-age populations, is a promising method for cost-effective health promotion and preventive care in older individuals, but the long-term effects of this approach are unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of an innovative approach to HRA and counselling in older individuals for health behaviours, preventive care, and long-term survival.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>This study was a pragmatic, single-centre randomised controlled clinical trial in community-dwelling individuals aged 65 y or older registered with one of 19 primary care physician (PCP) practices in a mixed rural and urban area in Switzerland. From November 2000 to January 2002, 874 participants were randomly allocated to the intervention and 1,410 to usual care. The intervention consisted of HRA based on self-administered questionnaires and individualised computer-generated feedback reports, combined with nurse and PCP counselling over a 2-y period. Primary outcomes were health behaviours and preventive care use at 2 y and all-cause mortality at 8 y. At baseline, participants in the intervention group had a mean &#x000b1; standard deviation of 6.9 &#x000b1; 3.7 risk factors (including unfavourable health behaviours, health and functional impairments, and social risk factors) and 4.3 &#x000b1; 1.8 deficits in recommended preventive care. At 2 y, favourable health behaviours and use of preventive care were more frequent in the intervention than in the control group (based on <italic>z</italic>-statistics from generalised estimating equation models). For example, 70% compared to 62% were physically active (odds ratio 1.43, 95% CI 1.16&#x02013;1.77, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), and 66% compared to 59% had influenza vaccinations in the past year (odds ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.09&#x02013;1.66, <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). At 8 y, based on an intention-to-treat analysis, the estimated proportion alive was 77.9% in the intervention and 72.8% in the control group, for an absolute mortality difference of 4.9% (95% CI 1.3%&#x02013;8.5%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.009; based on <italic>z</italic>-test for risk difference). The hazard ratio of death comparing intervention with control was 0.79 (95% CI 0.66&#x02013;0.94, <italic>p</italic> = 0.009; based on Wald test from Cox regression model), and the number needed to receive the intervention to prevent one death was 21 (95% CI 12&#x02013;79). The main limitations of the study include the single-site study design, the use of a brief self-administered questionnaire for 2-y outcome data collection, the unavailability of other long-term outcome data (e.g., functional status, nursing home admissions), and the availability of long-term follow-up data on mortality for analysis only in 2014.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first trial to our knowledge demonstrating that a collaborative care model of HRA in community-dwelling older people not only results in better health behaviours and increased use of recommended preventive care interventions, but also improves survival.

In almost every country, the over&#x02013;60 age group is growing faster than any other age group. In 2000, globally, there were about 605 million people aged 60 or more; by 2050, 2 billion people (many living in low- and middle-income countries) will be in this age group. But old age is not always a happy and healthy phase of life. Sadly, many older people find that their enjoyment of life is curtailed by chronic illnesses and increasing disability. Moreover, many older people die prematurely. In part, these adverse outcomes are linked to avoidable risk factors, particularly unhealthy lifestyles and failure to engage in preventative care. For example, older people commonly are physically inactive, smoke, drink too much alcohol, or do not have regular blood pressure checks or annual influenza vaccinations.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Programs that encourage a healthy lifestyle and the uptake of preventative care among older people are a health policy priority worldwide. But what is the best way to improve health and reduce premature death among older people? One promising approach is &#x0201c;health risk assessment.&#x0201d; In this multidimensional approach, which has been used successfully among working-age populations, older individuals complete a questionnaire to provide information about their risk factors for functional status decline and are subsequently given personalized feedback on how to promote health, maintain function, or prevent disease. Previous studies showed that this approach may improve short-term outcomes such as take-up of preventive care and health behaviors, but the long-term effects on health were unknown. Here, the researchers evaluate the effects of health risk assessment plus counseling on both short-term outcomes and on long-term survival among older people by undertaking a pragmatic randomized controlled trial in Solothurn, Switzerland. A randomized controlled trial compares the outcomes of individuals randomly chosen to receive or not receive an intervention; a pragmatic trial asks whether an intervention works under real-life conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers allocated 874 community-dwelling individuals aged 65 years or older living in a mixed rural and urban area in Switzerland to receive the intervention (the intervention group) and 1,410 individuals to receive usual care (the control group). The intervention consisted of health risk assessment based on self-administered questionnaires and individualized computer-generated feedback reports, combined with nurse and primary care physician counseling over a two-year period. At baseline, intervention group participants had about seven risk factors on average (including unfavorable health behaviors, health and functional impairments, and social risk factors) and 4&#x02013;5 deficits in recommended preventative care. At two years, favorable health behaviors and use of preventative care were more frequent in the intervention group than in the control group, and these differences were statistically significant. For example, 70% of the intervention group were physically active compared to 62% of the control group, and 66% of the intervention group had had an influenza vaccination during the past 12 months compared to 59% of the control group. At eight years, 77.9% and 72.8% of the participants in the intervention and control groups, respectively, were still alive. Comparing the intervention group with the control group, the hazard ratio of death was 0.79. Finally, the researchers calculated that, to avert one death over eight years, 21 individuals would need to receive the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings show that implementation of a collaborative care model of health risk assessment in community-dwelling older people resulted in better health behaviors, increased use of preventative care, and improved survival. Certain aspects of the trial design may limit the interpretation of these findings. For example, a self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the two-year health behavior outcome data, and some participants may have given socially desirable answers (for example, they may have understated their alcohol intake). Also, as the study was undertaken at a single site, these findings may not be generalizable. Moreover, the study was based on complete follow-up information on survival, but no long-term follow-up data were available for functional status outcome. Overall, however, these findings suggest that the use of health risk assessment combined with personal reinforcement of health risk assessment recommendations by specially trained counselors might be an effective and relatively low-cost way to promote good health among non-disabled older people. Moreover, the researchers suggest that it might be possible to adapt this model for use in low- and middle-income countries, where the challenge of a rapidly growing population of older people is greatest.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Additional Information</title><p>This list of resources contains links that can be accessed when viewing the PDF on a device or via the online version of the article at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.xxxxxxx">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001889</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The US National Institute on Aging provides information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health">health and aging</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The UK National Health Service and Age UK (a not-for-profit organization) have produced a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/resources/resources-for-ccgs/out-frwrk/dom-2/healthy-ageing/">practical guide to healthy aging</ext-link>

These adverse outcomes might at least in part be avoidable. For example, recent studies demonstrate a continued high prevalence of unhealthy behaviours and preventive care deficits in older individuals despite evidence supporting the importance of healthy lifestyles and optimal preventive care in later life [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Also, early identification of, and intervention for, previously unknown health and functional deficits may contribute to better outcomes in older people [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The search for, and the implementation of, multimodal programmes for cost-effective disease prevention and health promotion has therefore become a top health policy priority worldwide.</p><p>It has been shown that multimodal interventions may substantially improve health status and reduce mortality for frail or disabled older individuals. For example, one randomised controlled trial found that chronically ill older adults who were offered a community-based nurse intervention had a 25% lower risk of death as compared to control group individuals with usual care [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, for non-disabled older individuals, previous studies have revealed inconsistent findings. For example, a meta-analysis of trials of systematic health checks for general adult populations concluded that these interventions did not have favourable effects on mortality, perhaps since these programmes were organised in parallel to, and not aligned with, primary care [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, systematic analyses of multimodal preventive care home visit programmes found no consistent effects on mortality and other outcomes, although some studies found that these programmes significantly reduced or delayed nursing home admissions in older individuals [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Health risk assessment (HRA) has recently received attention as a method for multidimensional preventive care intervention among older individuals [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Originally developed for workforce health promotion, HRA is based on self-reports to guide risk factor interventions, with subsequent individualised feedback to participants on their health status and on how to promote health, maintain function, or prevent disease [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. HRA is a potentially promising approach for use in older individuals, with scientific evidence for favourable effects on intermediate outcomes such as health behaviours and use of preventive care [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, studies have found that HRA-based interventions were effective for intermediate outcomes only if older individuals received HRA combined with some form of personal reinforcement [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, this was confirmed by the findings of two recent randomised controlled trials funded by the European Union [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. One trial conducted in London (UK) tested the effects of a single HRA. This HRA was combined with an electronic health record reminder system for use in the primary care practice setting, but it is not known to what extent these reminders were actually used for counselling [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. At 1-y follow-up, this study found no or only minimal intervention effects on health behaviours and preventive care use among older individuals, which is consistent with the fact that personal reinforcement was likely minimal [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The other trial was conducted in Hamburg (Germany) [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It also offered an initial HRA in the primary care setting, and, in addition, older individuals in the intervention arm participated in a half-day group counselling session or, alternatively, received an initial home visit with individual counselling. This trial found mild to moderate favourable intervention effects on health behaviours and preventive care among older individuals, which is consistent with the fact that this intervention ensured some amount of reinforcement of HRA-based recommendations [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Although multiple earlier studies have addressed intermediate outcomes of HRA-based interventions, a 2011 systematic analysis found no controlled study with long-term health outcomes of the effect of HRA on mortality or functional status in older individuals [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and, to our knowledge, no new study of this type has been published since then. We designed a randomised controlled study with a system to collect intermediate and long-term follow-up data, using an intention-to-treat approach. The purpose of this study is to confirm whether a HRA-based intervention with a reliable long-term system of reinforcement has favourable effects on health behaviours and preventive care use in community-dwelling older individuals, and to evaluate whether this intervention also results in favourable long-term outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Ethical Review</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Canton of Solothurn (EKO&#x02013;0023) and the Ethics Committee of the Canton of Bern (205/06).</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Study Design</title><p>The study methods and selected baseline findings of the present trial conducted in Solothurn have been previously published [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and the detailed study protocol and analysis plan are available in <xref rid="pmed.1001889.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>.

The two trials conducted in Hamburg and London were designed as short-term trials, and the final results of these trials (including effects on preventive care use and health behaviours at 1-y follow-up) have been published [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Study Participants</title><p>The PCPs generated lists of all patients aged 65 y or older whom they had seen at least once over the past 5 y.

Remaining patients who gave written informed consent were sequentially listed for enrolment by the local study centre based in Solothurn, and were randomly allocated to the intervention and control groups by the study centre based at the University of Bern using a computer-generated allocation sequence.

Experts selected risk factors for functional status decline based on four criteria: potential impact on functional impairment, strength of evidence, potential for risk reduction, and feasibility of assessment. For each risk factor, assessment questions were selected based on reliability, validity, feasibility, and previous use in large studies of older individuals. The risk factors included unfavourable health behaviours, health and functional impairments, and social risk factors (<xref rid="pmed.1001889.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). For health behaviours, questions on participants&#x02019; intention to change unfavourable behaviours were added [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, the expert panel also selected 11 preventive care recommendations for inclusion in the questionnaire based on the 1996 guidelines of the US Preventive Services Task Force [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Field tests among community-dwelling older individuals in the US, the UK, Germany, and Switzerland demonstrated the acceptance and feasibility of the HRA-O questionnaire [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

Based on completed HRA-O questionnaires, individualised computer-generated participant and provider feedback reports were generated and returned to the PCPs and the participants. PCPs used the reports to motivate patients to reduce unhealthy behaviours in collaboration with the nurse counsellors, to implement preventive care interventions (e.g., influenza vaccination, blood pressure measurement), and to refer patients for specialty-based preventive care (e.g., breast cancer screening, ophthalmology referral). Over the 2-y intervention period, nurse counsellors visited participants at home (at baseline and every 6 mo, and additionally if needed) and contacted them by phone (at 3 mo, and additionally if needed) to evaluate risks and reinforce HRA-O-based recommendations. The nurse counsellors had one initial meeting and then meetings each year during the 2-y intervention period with the geriatricians to refine recommendations for each participant. The PCPs and nurse counsellors received training and support from project geriatricians.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Study Assessments and Outcomes</title><p>Baseline data were obtained from practice registers, a brief pre-randomisation questionnaire including questions to calculate the Pra score (a previously validated overall risk score identifying older people at high risk for adverse health outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]), and the Swiss Federal Population Census 2000 through record linkage with the Swiss National Cohort [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. At 1-y follow-up, a long self-administered questionnaire was sent to surviving participants for short-term outcome analysis, but due to a high rate of non-return of these questionnaires, these data could not be used for further analyses (further details in <xref rid="pmed.1001889.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>). At 2 y, surviving participants were sent a short validated questionnaire to measure six health-related behaviours [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], dependency in basic activities of daily living, and self-perceived health status. Nonresponding participants were contacted by trained interviewers blinded to group allocation, and were interviewed face-to-face if possible. Participants&#x02019; adherence to preventive care recommendations usually performed in PCP practices were abstracted from PCP records by data extractors blinded to group allocation. Since PCPs saw patients only during routine clinical care and often not at the time of 2-y follow-up, an initial plan to collect 2-y measurement data in the practice setting could not be realised. For logistic reasons, 2-y follow-up data were not available for participants living in nursing homes at the 2-y follow-up time point. At 2 y, participating PCPs were sent a brief questionnaire on their perception of the intervention.</p><p>At 2 y, primary outcomes were adherence to six recommended health behaviours (physical activity, fruit/vegetable/fibre intake, fat intake, seat belt use, tobacco consumption, alcohol use) and use of six preventive care services (blood pressure measurement, cholesterol measurement, glucose measurement, influenza vaccination, pneumococcal vaccination, faecal occult blood testing). An initial plan to use composite variables (e.g., by calculating an overall adherence rate for summarising the information on adherence to each of the six recommended health behaviours) was dropped because the main study hypothesis was to test the effects on individual, and not on combined, items. Secondary outcomes were nursing home admissions, dependency in basic activities of daily living, and self-perceived health status. At 8 y, the primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcome was cause-specific mortality. Vital status at the end of 2008 was ascertained for all study participants, either through probabilistic linkage with the Swiss National Cohort [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or, if linkage was unsuccessful, from municipal registers. The underlying cause of death was ascertained from the death certificate, based on the International Classification of Diseases&#x02013;Tenth Revision (ICD&#x02013;10).</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Sample Size and Statistical Analysis</title><p>The number of participants needed to demonstrate a 1.3-fold increase in the prevalence of positive health behaviours or preventive care use with 80% power at a significance level of 0.05 was 1,000 individuals in each group, assuming a control group prevalence of 20%, and a 20% dropout rate. For a 1:2 randomisation (intervention to control) ratio, the required numbers were 732 individuals in the intervention and 1,464 in the control group. We changed the randomisation ratio from 1:1 to 1:2 on March 27, 2001, when resource constraints mandated a reduction of the size of the intervention group. Enrolment was terminated on January 8, 2002, when the required sample size was reached.</p><p>Comparisons of the prevalence of healthy behaviours and adherence to preventive care at 2 y were based on modified (i.e., using imputation methods for handling missing data) intention-to-treat analyses based on all surviving participants. We used multiple imputation by chained equations assuming a missing-at-random situation [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Analyses were run on 25 imputation datasets, and the results were combined with Rubin&#x02019;s rule [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In sensitivity analyses we used the complete case dataset, excluding individuals with missing data. Further, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to test the potential impact of attrition bias due to loss to follow-up of individuals at 2 y [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We used inverse-probability-of-attrition weighting to examine the influence of attrition bias on group allocation and 2-y outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Standard intention-to-treat analyses were used for mortality analysis. We used generalised estimating equation models with an underlying equicorrelation structure to compare health behaviour and preventive care outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Survival was analysed using Kaplan-Meier life table methods and Cox regression models, with time from the date of randomisation to the date of death or 31 December 2008, as the underlying timescale. Maximal individual observation time was restricted to 8 y of follow-up. The proportional-hazards assumption was tested by Schoenfeld&#x02019;s test [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. All analyses were unadjusted. A <italic>p</italic>-value of less than 0.05 in two-sided test statistics was considered to indicate statistical significance. The number needed to treat was calculated from absolute risk differences over the follow-up period [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Models accounted for the allocation of individuals living in the same household to the same group. The effect of the intervention in pre-specified subgroups at low and high risk for adverse health outcomes (high risk defined as a Pra score &#x02265; 0.286) was assessed by treatment&#x02013;subgroup interactions.

In the low-risk subgroup, yearly mortality rates were low (intervention group, 1.98%; control group, 2.23%), with a hazard ratio for death of 0.89 (95% CI 0.67&#x02013;1.18, <italic>p</italic> = 0.42; based on Wald test from Cox regression model). The yearly mortality rates were high among participants in the high-risk subgroup (intervention group, 4.99%; control group, 6.67%), with a hazard ratio for death of 0.74 (95% CI 0.59&#x02013;0.92, <italic>p</italic> = 0.007; based on Wald test from Cox regression model). A Cox regression analysis including a treatment&#x02013;subgroup interaction term revealed that there was no statistically significant interaction between group assignment (intervention versus control) and the two pre-specified subgroups (low and high baseline risk) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.32), demonstrating that the relative survival effects of the intervention did not differ between the low- and high-risk subgroups.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Cost of the Intervention</title><p>The cost of providing the full intervention over the 2-y period, based on 2014 costs for personnel and overhead in Switzerland, was US$1,017 per participant. The majority of the costs were related to the time and expenses of the involved health professionals. Only a small amount (US$56) was spent on generating and administering the HRA-O questionnaires and feedback reports (<xref rid="pmed.1001889.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Table</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we evaluated the long-term effects of a collaborative model of care based on HRA in older individuals as compared to usual care. After 8 y, mortality was significantly lower in individuals receiving the intervention than in individuals in the control group. The early detection and successful modification of risk factors for functional status decline identified with the HRA-based intervention and the improvement in recommended preventive care use likely explained this reduction in mortality. In fact, 2-y follow-up confirmed that the intervention group had more favourable health behaviours and used preventive care services more frequently than individuals in the control group. In addition, it is likely the intervention also had other favourable effects contributing to the survival effect, such as early interventions for health and functional impairments uncovered with the HRA system, or improved management of chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) with the nurse counselling integrated into the process of primary care.</p><p>A main strength of this study is the randomised controlled design with an intention-to-treat analysis and fully available long-term survival data on all study participants. Also, the study was conducted in a &#x0201c;real world&#x0201d; setting, with a study population consisting of older individuals registered in PCP practices, and not of a selected group of individuals highly motivated to receive preventive care. It is unlikely that the study overestimates the survival effect of the intervention; on the contrary, it may underestimate the effect for several reasons. First, PCPs received training and gained experience in preventive care, which likely resulted in improved care for individuals in the control group (possible contamination effect). Second, a proportion (14.4%) of participants allocated to the intervention group did not complete the HRA-O questionnaire at baseline, and were therefore not offered the intervention as planned during the 2-y follow-up period. With the intention-to-treat design, the present study might therefore underestimate treatment effects for individuals adhering to the intervention. Finally, an intervention continued over the 8 y of the survival follow-up period likely would have had stronger effects than the intervention limited to a 2-y period, as tested in this study.</p><p>An important question is whether the finding of an approximate 20% reduction in mortality is plausible and consistent with previous findings in the literature. There is no previous research on long-term outcomes of HRA for comparison. However, multiple studies have attempted to evaluate the potential effect of risk factor modification on reduction of all-cause mortality. A recent meta-analysis of influenza vaccination studies concluded that even after adjustment for potential bias, the odds ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.60 (i.e., an approximately 40% reduction of mortality) for vaccinated compared to non-vaccinated individuals in years when the vaccine matched the circulating virus [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A pooled analysis of population-based cohort studies demonstrated that physical activity is related to a 20% to 37% reduction in mortality among adults, with a dose&#x02013;response association [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A systematic analysis of prospective studies on the combined effects of health lifestyle behaviours showed an estimated 66% reduction in all-cause mortality if four healthy risk factors were compared with four unhealthy risk factors [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A study of cardiovascular risk factors found that the adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.49 (95% CI 0.33&#x02013;0.74) for participants with six or more versus one or fewer favourable cardiovascular health metrics [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Overall, these recent analyses, although mostly based on non-randomised prospective studies, demonstrate that a 20% reduction in mortality, as observed in our study, is in the expected range for an intervention modifying health behaviours and preventive care use.</p><p>The present study has several limitations. It was conducted at one single site. However, extensive preparatory work and field tests in the US, Germany, and the UK confirmed that the intervention used in our trial is well accepted and feasible for use in other regions [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A further limitation is the fact that the intervention phase of this study took place more than a decade ago (between 2000 and 2004): publication of long-term outcome data was possible only after long-term outcome data became fully available in 2014. However, the study findings are relevant today since most risk factors and key recommendations have remained unchanged since 2004. An additional limitation is the use of a brief self-report questionnaire for measuring health behaviour outcomes at 2-y follow-up. This approach contributed to a high response rate, but it may overestimate prevalence rates of favourable health behaviours and does not measure effects on the multiple other risk factors for functional status decline that were measured with the baseline HRA-O questionnaire. Also, the fact that we did not collect extensive baseline information among control group individuals limits our ability to analyse in detail intervention effects on HRA-O-based risk factors. In addition, the use of self-report information for the 2-y follow-up outcomes may lead to socially desirable answers and therefore overestimate the prevalence of favourable outcomes. However, since outcome assessment was blinded for group allocation, it is unlikely that this resulted in a bias between the intervention and control groups. Another limitation is the lack of information on specifically which changes in risk behaviours and clinical preventive care use made the biggest contribution to reduced mortality in this multifactorial trial. A further limitation is the validity of cause of death information, which relies on information coded by different attending physicians.</p><p>Our study did not evaluate long-term effects on functional status, quality of life, or actual cost-effectiveness, and did not disentangle which components of the complex intervention tested in this trial were most efficacious. Future studies should address these issues and, in addition, examine the generalisability of the benefits observed in this study to other settings and refine the HRA-O-based intervention to further increase its efficiency and effectiveness. For example, practice-based instead of home-based counselling, use of other forms of reinforcement such as Internet or mobile communication, use of behaviour change techniques (e.g., pedometer step-count and accelerometer) as part of counselling [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], or repetitive group sessions might be effective alternatives or add-ons to the preventive care home visits by nurse counsellors.</p><sec id="sec024"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Many previous studies have revealed the importance of multimodal interventions and coordination of care in disabled or demented older individuals. In contrast, the HRA-based approach tested in the present study was designed for the approximate 80% of the older population without pre-existing disability. The findings of this trial have important implications for policy and practice. Several countries have introduced multimodal preventive care programmes available to healthy older individuals, and are challenged to decide whether, and if so how, these programmes should be continued. For example, the US introduced the Welcome to Medicare and Annual Wellness Visit programs for Medicare beneficiaries [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The favourable results of our study support that implementation should be based on a multidimensional HRA system with adequate personalised reinforcement.</p><p>For practice implementation, a key factor for success is ensuring personal reinforcement of HRA-based recommendations by specially trained counsellors who take into account individuals&#x02019; personal preferences. To ensure synergies with primary care, regionally adapted approaches for integrating HRA into primary care need to be developed. This integration is facilitated by the use of HRA as a comprehensive self-administered tool for initial assessment, the availability of automatically generated, regionally adapted feedback reports, and delegation of health counselling to specially trained health professionals. Our study may also serve as a model for low- and middle-income countries, given the importance of the demographic challenge of rapidly growing populations of older individuals in these countries [<xref rid="pmed.1001889.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Regionally adapted HRA-O approaches might reach large groups of older individuals at relatively low cost.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001889.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Comparison of 8-y survival in study population with survival in general Swiss population aged 65 y and older in the same time period.</title><p>The data for the general population is based on the Swiss National Cohort; mean age of the population was 74.8 &#x000b1; 6.9 (SD) y, with 58.1% women in the census in 2000.
