taping on induced quadriceps fatigue by knee extension exercise. [Subjects and Methods]
Thirty healthy females were randomly assigned to an elastic tape group (ET, n=10), a
non-elastic tape group (NET, n=10), or a no tape group (NT, n=10). Taping groups attached
taping on quadriceps femoris. Three groups are conducted knee extension exercise for 10
times and 3 sets during 10 minutes. Knee extension peak torque measured before and after
knee extension exercise. One-way analysis of variance was used to assess the statistical
significance of knee extension peak torque. [Results] No significant difference in changes
in maximum muscle strength per unit weight from before to after the muscle fatigue
exercise was found in the ET, NET, or NT groups (12.1 &#x000b1; 4.2, 11.7 &#x000b1; 7.1, and 6.7 &#x000b1; 3.4
N/kg, respectively). [Conclusion] Taping facilitated muscle performance, but it also
increased susceptibility to fatigue resulting from greater muscle activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Elastic taping</kwd><kwd>Non-elastic taping</kwd><kwd>Quadriceps fatigue</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Taping is used to improve exercise performance and to prevent sport injuries. The treatment
and preventive mechanisms of taping therapy are achieved both by improving muscle control
and by affecting the transmission functions of the brain, spine, and muscles<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are two types of taping: one uses
elastic tape and the other uses non-elastic tape. Elastic tape increases the space between
the muscles and the skin, leading to improved blood and lymphatic fluid circulation and
thereby improving the motor functions of muscles and relieving muscle fatigue<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Non-elastic tape prevents the application
of excessive force to injured joints by limiting their operation<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, studies examining the effects of non-elastic tape
on the degree of muscle fatigue are insufficient. If non-elastic tape stabilizes joints to
prevent the application of excessive force, the degree of fatigue in the muscles that move
the injured joint can be reduced. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the
effects of elastic and non-elastic taping on quadriceps fatigue induced by a knee extension
exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty healthy females were randomly assigned to an elastic tape group (ET; 10 subjects,
20.7 &#x000b1; 0.7&#x02005;years, 160.8 &#x000b1; 5.7&#x02005;cm, 55.2 &#x000b1; 3.3&#x02005;kg), a non-elastic tape group (NET; 10
subjects, 20.8 &#x000b1; 1.1&#x02005;years, 162.9 &#x000b1; 9.1&#x02005;cm, 57.2 &#x000b1; 7.2k g), or a no tape group (NT; 10
subjects, 20.3 &#x000b1; 0.7&#x02005;years, 159.1 &#x000b1; 5.2&#x02005;cm, 53.5 &#x000b1; 3.7&#x02005;kg). Subjects who could not perform
the exercise because of any leg trauma, lower limb fracture, or ligament injury suffered
within the past 6 months or because of pain were excluded from the study. The study aims and
experimental procedure were thoroughly explained to the subjects. The study received ethics
approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee of Silla University
(1041449-201605-HR-002). The elastic tape used in the experiment was 5&#x02005;cm wide Kinesio tape
(Kinesio Tape Co., Ltd., Japan), and the non-elastic tape was 3.8&#x02005;cm wide Mueller tape
(Mueller M Tape Co., Ltd., Japan). Both tapes were attached to the skin above the anterior
inferior iliac spine and the tibial tuberosity with the knee slightly flexed to ensure that
the tape would not be stretched. Maximum muscle strength was assessed in the ET and NET
groups with the tape in place and in the NT group without tape using a Biodex dynamometer
(Biodex Corp., Shirley, NY, USA) before and after the knee extension exercise, which was
designed to induce muscle fatigue. Three sets of 10 repetitions of the knee extension
exercise were performed on an NK table with resistance set at 10 RM<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. No rest time was allowed to ensure muscle fatigue. The data
were processed using SPSS ver. 20.0 for Windows. One-way analyses of variance was conducted
to compare changes in maximum muscle strength between before and after the muscle fatigue
exercise among the three groups. Statistical significance was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>No significant difference in changes in maximum muscle strength per unit weight from before
to after the muscle fatigue exercise was found in the ET, NET, or NT groups (12.1 &#x000b1; 4.2,
11.7 &#x000b1; 7.1, and 6.7 &#x000b1; 3.4 N/kg, respectively).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Although the differences among groups were not significant, elastic and non-elastic taping
led to a greater decrease in muscle strength than did the use of no tape. In general,
elastic tapes are effective for improving muscle flexibility and strength. Yoon and Hong
showed that changes in the strength of the quadriceps muscle from before to after exercise
were smaller with elastic taping than with no taping<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. This was because the gamma motor nerves in the skeletal muscle
beneath the skin were excited, increasing the tension of the muscle fibers themselves;
hence, the muscles contracted more without muscle fatigue. However, Seo et al. showed that
muscle fatigue increased more with elastic taping than with no taping<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. This suggests that the excitation of gamma nerves caused by
elastic tapes during exercise induced more muscle activity, leading to greater muscle
fatigue. In the present study, taping activated the quadriceps muscle, resulting in
increased muscle performance. Therefore, although tape attached to the muscles can increase
muscle tension, it may also induce muscle fatigue faster because of overactivation. In
addition, there were no differences in muscle fatigue between the elastic tape and
non-elastic tape groups. Thus, taping facilitated muscle performance, but it also increased
susceptibility to fatigue resulting from greater muscle activation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Fu</surname><given-names>TC</given-names></name><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Pei</surname><given-names>YC</given-names></name><etal>et
