Concomitant medications had to be stable for &#x02265;3&#x02005;months. Women could not be pregnant or lactating. Patients with other serious medical conditions and those taking additional medications, including DMARDs, that could interfere with PK outcome measurements were excluded.

The allocation sequence was created by Medpace using a Williams design to balance variance from potential carry-over effects. At the time of enrolment, investigators selected dose based on patient's then-current oral MTX regimen (10, 15, 20 or 25&#x02005;mg weekly). Each patient received one dose of MTX via each of three routes: oral MTX (tablets), SC MTX into the abdomen and SC MTX into the thigh. Blood samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis predose and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24&#x02005;h after dosing.</p><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was in compliance with Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.

Secondary objectives were to compare the time of peak concentration (t<sub>max</sub>), apparent terminal rate constant (&#x003bb;<sub>z</sub>) and terminal half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of MTX for the three methods of administration. PK parameters were calculated with standard non-compartmental methods.

Plasma concentrations as determined by AUC from time 0 to the last measurable concentration (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>), or extrapolating to infinity (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>) and the maximum observed concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) for each dose level were compared. The linear trapezoidal method was used to calculate AUC when concentration data were increasing or constant, and the logarithmic trapezoidal method was used if concentration data were decreasing. Geometric mean and geometric coefficient of variation percentage (CV%) were calculated for the AUCs and C<sub>max</sub>. The geometric CV% was calculated as 100&#x000b7;(exp [SD<sup>2</sup>] &#x02013;1)<sup>0.5</sup>, where SD is the standard deviation of the log-transformed data.

Adverse events (AEs) were monitored and severity, relationship to study drug, action taken, outcome and classification as serious or non-serious were recorded. An AE was considered to be treatment-emergent (TEAE) if it started on or after the first dose. Changes in safety laboratory parameters and vital signs were monitored, and administration sites were examined. During the MTXAI treatment periods, injection site assessments were performed predose and at 0.25, 1, 12 and 24&#x02005;h postdose.</p><table-wrap id="ANNRHEUMDIS2014205228TB1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients in the safety population</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char=" " span="1"/><col align="char" char=" " span="1"/><col align="char" char=" " span="1"/><col align="char" char=" " span="1"/><col align="char" char=" " span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</th><th align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1">MTX</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Overall (N=49)</th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10&#x02005;mg (n=13)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15&#x02005;mg (n=12)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20&#x02005;mg (n=12)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25&#x02005;mg (n=12)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean age,* y (SD)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.9 (12.51)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.4 (7.49)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.0 (10.40)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.0 (11.53)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.4 (10.53)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Women, n (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (84.6)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (41.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (66.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (58.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">31 (63.3)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">White, n (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (92.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (91.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (83.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (91.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">44 (89.9)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Black, n (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (7.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (8.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (16.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (8.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (10.2)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean (SD) BMI, kg/m<sup>2</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.7 (7.64)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.1 (5.35)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.5 (5.54)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.6 (7.43)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.7 (6.39)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean (SD) duration of RA,* years</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.9 (9.29)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.4 (7.33)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.6 (8.76)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.4 (10.32)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.3 (8.78)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*At informed consent.</p></fn><fn><p>BMI, body mass index; MTX, methotrexate; RA, rheumatoid arthritis.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A sample size of approximately 48 patients (12 randomised patients per dose level, with no replacements) was planned to provide a sufficient number of patients to determine the relative bioavailability, safety and tolerability of MTX administered via the three methods. For comparisons among treatments, a mixed-model analysis that took into consideration sequence, treatment and treatment period as fixed effects and subjects nested within sequence as a random effect was used to compare dose-normalised logarithmically transformed values for C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>. Least-squares (LS) mean for each treatment, differences between treatment LS means and 90% CIs for differences between treatment LS means were obtained. Results were transformed back to the original scale to obtain geometric LS means, point estimates of the geometric test and LS mean ratios, and 90% CI for these ratios. Relative bioavailability comparisons were based on route and/or location of administration at each dose level using analysis of variance (ANOVA). For bioequivalence assessments of abdomen and thigh SC administration sites, the dose-normalised PK parameters were used in the ANOVA model. Bioequivalence was established if the 90% CI for point estimates of the geometric test and reference LS mean ratios were within the prespecified range of 80% to 125%. If bioequivalence was established among the SC injection sites, the data from the SC injection sites were pooled for comparison with oral administration.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients participated from May through August 2012.

Subcutaneous MTX exhibited a linear, dose-proportional increase in exposure with no plateau. At each dose level, SC administration achieved higher MTX exposure than the comparable oral dose and continued to increase through doses of 25&#x02005;mg/week. Potential confounders of the comparison of dosage forms were minimised by the random sequence crossover design. No increases in AEs were observed with SC MTX. These findings suggest that the SC administration may overcome some of the limitations of oral MTX and allow for optimisation of MTX in the treatment of RA as defined in treatment guidelines.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
