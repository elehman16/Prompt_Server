The study took place in 4 centres: South Wales, and areas of the South West, East Midlands, and South East of England, within 50km of the universities of Swansea, Cardiff, the West of England-Bristol, Nottingham and Surrey.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were elected local politicians representing deprived electoral wards which had high pedestrian injury rates in 2000&#x02013;2003 for vulnerable groups (children aged 4&#x02013;16 years and adults over 60s) in local authorities in the four areas of the UK described above. There are different local government arrangements within England and between England and Wales. Multi-tier local authorities are common in parts of England whereas single tier authorities operate throughout Wales and parts of England. Multi-tiered authorities involve a complex mixture of responsibilities divided between counties (higher tier) and districts (lower tier). Road safety is usually the responsibility of the higher tier but is often shared between tiers. Local politicians are elected to represent electoral wards in both tiers of government. County wards are generally larger than district wards. A county ward may overlap with two or more district wards. Local politicians are elected to represent district or county wards, and in some cases represent both. All local politicians representing electoral wards at district level or county wards which covered all or part of the district electoral wards in the study areas were included. The district local authority was chosen as the unit of randomisation as this was common across all areas.</p><p>Vulnerable pedestrian casualty rates (aged 4 to 16 years and 60+ years ) were calculated using police recorded road crash statistics (STATS19) for 2000&#x02013;2003, held in the UK data archive (UK data archive). <xref rid="pone.0060158-UK1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> Data for pedestrian casualties were mapped onto the boundaries of the 8800 electoral wards in England and Wales using ArcView 3.2. Each casualty was assigned to an electoral ward, casualties per electoral ward aggregated and rates per 1000 population calculated using population estimates from the 2001 census.</p><p>Deprivation scores in the form of Townsend Index Scores were obtained for each of the 8800 wards. <xref rid="pone.0060158-Townsend1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> The Townsend Index was devised by Townsend et al in 1988 to provide a material measure of deprivation and disadvantage. The Index is based on four different variables taken, originally from the 1991 UK Census. <xref rid="pone.0060158-Townsend1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The four variables that comprise the Townsend Index are: unemployment as a percentage of those aged 16 and over who are economically active; non-car ownership, as a percentage of all households; non-home ownership as a percentage of all households; and household overcrowding. Z scores are used to standardize the component variables. The z score is simply the &#x02018;observation&#x02019; (percentage or proportion for the ward on a given measure) minus the mean observation divided by the standard deviation. The Townsend Score is a summary of the four component z scores.</p><p>The 8800 wards were then ranked by the deprivation scores and vulnerable casualty rates. Electoral wards in the most deprived third with injury rates in the highest third were then identified (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1902) and distance to the nearest study centre calculated.</p><p>To facilitate data collection, only electoral wards within 50km of one of the four study centres were eligible for inclusion (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;319). These were then grouped into local authorities and the numbers of eligible electoral wards within each local authority calculated. Where more than 8 electoral wards in any local authority were eligible, 8 were randomly selected for inclusion to reduce burden on authorities with limited resources and capacity for action.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>The intervention group (all local politicians representing intervention electoral wards within intervention local authorities) received a postal package to promote advocacy in October 2005. This contained tailored information, specific to their electoral ward, as well as general pedestrian injury information. Specific information included the high injury rate, a map of vulnerable pedestrian injury locations for their electoral ward for 2000&#x02013;2003, and the estimated monetary value of preventing such injuries. General information included pedestrian injury risk factors, details of evidence based interventions, the role of local government in implementation and advice on who to contact within the local authority to facilitate action. An example of an intervention information package is included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0060158.s001">Appendix S1</xref>. Information in the package was reinforced during a telephone interview 1&#x02013;3 months later. Control group local politicians received general information on children&#x02019;s home and road injuries and advice on prevention measures and government policy from the Child Accident Prevention Trust, shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0060158.s002">Appendix S2</xref>.

However, in 2006 the Ordnance Survey stopped collecting these data; hence the number of kilometres of road with traffic calming features and the total number of kilometres of road per ward were used as these were available for 2005 and 2007. The Ordnance Survey divides all roads into segments which are the road lengths between consecutive junctions. The data contain an indicator as to whether (and when) each segment has been traffic calmed using any type of vertical hump.</p><p>Secondary outcomes were measured at school or local politician level and comprised:</p><p>A.

The survey instruments distinguished between interventions which preceded or were put in place during the study. Data on local politician level outcomes was ascertained from semi-structured telephone interviews and a postal survey 1&#x02013;3 months post provision of the information and advocacy package, and semi-structured telephone interviews 17&#x02013;22 months post intervention in the intervention group, and a postal survey 25&#x02013;27 months post intervention in both intervention and control groups. The baseline interviews to all councillors were based on structured questionnaires which sought to explore the relative importance of road safety issues amongst other common issues in neighbourhoods based on the Audit Commission&#x02019;s quality of life survey and on current provision for child pedestrian a safety such as safe routes to school, pedestrian training and 20 mph zones. <xref rid="pone.0060158-Audit1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Subsequent questionnaires sought similar information to see how responses to this changed among councillors in the different treatment groups. Among councillors who had received the tailored information about child road safety in their ward semi-structured questionnaire based interviews were used to explore their views about the information pack such as whether or not they had found it interesting, if they had learned anything new, was it presented effectively and what were their plans for child road safety. For these open response questions a coding frame was developed based on initial interviews so that the responses could be categorised into positive and negative aspects and as a means of characterising their views on how they were going to address children&#x02019;s road safety.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Methods used to Enhance the Quality of Measurements</title><p>All questionnaire and interview schedules and the contents of the package to promote advocacy were pilot tested on local politicians, road safety officers, and teachers from outside the study areas and subsequent modifications made.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Samples Size and Interim Analyses</title><p>The estimated sample size for this study was 117 electoral wards per treatment group. Sample size calculations were based on the results of an earlier pilot study undertaken in two areas of Wales. This pilot study measured the number of traffic calming features in electoral wards and found that there were on average 21 features per electoral wards (SD 27.2). <xref rid="pone.0060158-Lyons2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> An effect considered to be of public health importance would be a standardised difference of 0.35 between the mean number of new traffic calming features in intervention and control electoral wards. <xref rid="pone.0060158-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> Using this as the measure of effect, then a 1 sided significance test (based on assumption that the intervention can only improve new traffic calming features) at &#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05 and power of 80% requires 102 electoral wards in each treatment group. Assuming an average of 4 electoral wards per local authority and an intra class correlation coefficient of 0.05, the design effect is 1.15 and the required sample size is 117 electoral wards per group. <xref rid="pone.0060158-Gulliford1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> No interim analyses were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Local authorities were randomised to intervention or control groups, stratified by study centre (4 strata) and local authority size (2 strata: 1&#x02013;3 electoral wards; more than 3 electoral wards). The randomisation schedule was computer generated using the StatsDirect package by a statistician (CC), blind to the identity of the local authorities. Randomisation was blocked within each stratum to ensure equal numbers of local authorities in each arm of the study. The block size was the number of local authorities in the stratum, if even or the number +1 if odd. This ranged from 5 to 14.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Allocation Concealment</title><p>A study team member (DK) generated random numbers for each local authority to allocate them to treatment groups.

The data on the percentage of kilometres of road traffic calmed were highly skewed and a cube root transformation was used in a random effects linear regression analysis as this satisfied the assumptions of the analysis.

However, this did not lead to a significantly increased implementation of road safety measures over a 25&#x02013;30 month period. The findings of this study provide evidence that local politicians recognise that road safety and speeding are major concerns in deprived communities. They are receptive to information about risk in their areas and the majority report being willing to advocate for improved safety interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and Weaknesses of the Study</title><p>The Advocacy for Pedestrian Safety Study represents a rigorously designed and implemented cluster randomised trial. The intervention was based on sound theoretical individual-level behaviour change models and the acceptability of the messages was successfully piloted with politicians from other areas prior to adoption. <xref rid="pone.0060158-Gielen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> Primary outcomes were collected in an unbiased manner as data were either obtained from independent sources (traffic calming) or from road safety officers and teachers blinded to intervention status.</p><p>Cost restrictions on the design of the study meant that information on secondary outcomes collected by semi-structured interviews 17&#x02013;22 months after the intervention could only be collected from intervention politicians and it was not possible to determine what proportion of control politicians would also have reported being involved in supporting safety interventions. We explored the potential for verifying self reported involvement in road safety interventions through the use of council minutes and websites, but these varied greatly across councils and hence were not considered sufficiently reliable for use.</p><p>Another important limitation of this study was the length of time it was possible to follow up outcomes. The four year grant which supported this work meant that it was possible to follow up the primary outcome (traffic calming) only to 25&#x02013;30 months post intervention. Given the time it takes to design the intervention and to affect change through council planning structures our study may have been too short to detect important effects. Longer term research funding streams are required to evaluate complex interventions with long time frames.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Strengths and Weaknesses in Relation to Other Studies, Discussing Important Differences in Results</title><p>This study represents an innovative approach and a rare example of translational public health research using political advocacy as a tool to improve the uptake of effective interventions for high risk groups in deprived communities. <xref rid="pone.0060158-Milward1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> There appears to be only one previously published paper of an evaluation of a political advocacy approach to improving child health tested within a randomised trial in Illinois, US. <xref rid="pone.0060158-Jason1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> Whilst there are some similarities between this study and ours, there are also important differences. The Illinois study involved sending a letter to senators prior to a vote on child safety restraints in 1982. In that study, 79% of 29 senators in the intervention group voted for the bill, compared to 53% of the 30 senators in the control group (p&#x0003c;0.05). <xref rid="pone.0060158-Jason1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> The results of the secondary outcomes of our study are consistent with this finding, with those in the intervention group reporting significantly greater interest in child injury prevention, and belief that they could take action to improve pedestrian safety in their localities. The positive impact on senator activity in the Illinois trial may differ from our findings for our primary outcome measures as the Illinois trial required only a single action to be undertaken shortly after the delivery of the intervention. Demonstrating changes to road safety infrastructure in our trial would have required repeated local politician activity over a long period of time, the commitment of finances and the planning and provision of infrastructure changes, which is likely to be much more difficult to achieve. We believe our study is unique in randomly allocating elected local politicians to intervention and control groups and attempting to influence non legislative activities to improve public health through the implementation of effective interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Meaning of the Study: Possible Explanations and Implications for Clinicians and Policy Makers</title><p>Skills in political advocacy are needed by clinicians and policy makers in implementing evidence based practice, particularly in resource constrained times. That the public health function in England is moving from the NHS to local authorities further emphasizes the importance of political advocacy skills for public health practitioners. <xref rid="pone.0060158-Department2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> These groups can learn much from the Advocacy for Pedestrian Safety Study which successfully engaged with local politicians and resulted in increased support for improving safety. However, as it did not change road safety measures within the trial time frame, the reasons behind this limited effectiveness need to be understood to inform the development of further approaches promoting advocacy or to consider other approaches to improve pedestrian safety in high risk deprived communities.</p><p>The advocacy package proved to be acceptable and interesting to local politicians. Most were surprised by the high casualty rates in their wards, suggesting a lack of awareness of the magnitude of road traffic risks in their localities. This is not surprising as such maps and analyses have not been previously shown to politicians, and is consistent with our findings that road traffic injuries were reported as a problem in their ward by only 33% of local politicians. Interestingly, speeding motorists were reported as a problem by 78% of local politicians, suggesting some degree of disconnect between their understandings of the two issues. The majority of politicians thought the advocacy pack was effective in presenting road safety information, but many also requested more detailed information. The pack also appeared to stimulate identification of interventions that would be suitable for their wards and subsequent action, with 63% reporting lobbying or supporting pedestrian safety schemes. Whilst these results are encouraging they are from unverified self reports and could be susceptible to reporting bias.</p><p>There are of course many barriers to the introduction of pedestrian safety schemes, many of which were recognised by local politicians. These include lack of available finance, competing priorities, long delays in planning or implementing schemes through complex council structures, diffuse representative structures, and sometimes lack of supportive attitudes from officials who are often under pressure from inadequate resources and competing demands. Within councils, many people are involved in decision making. Responsibility of road safety might sometimes be perceived to be the domain of largely unelected safety partnerships external to representative structures. Power to influence change may be located within different individuals or departments, and not necessarily in departments dealing with road safety. Previous research showed that influence is unequally distributed between local politicians, with more traffic calming than expected in areas represented by politicians occupying key decision making posts. <xref rid="pone.0060158-Lyons1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> Multi-level local government structures are a further complication in some areas. Responsibility for road safety may be held at different tiers of local government, limiting the potential for politicians representing one tier to influence the actions of other tiers.</p><p>The UK Audit Commission&#x02019;s &#x02018;Changing Lanes&#x02019; report suggests that there is a prevalent view in road safety departments that returns from road safety engineering are diminishing because the main black spots and dangerous stretches of road have already been treated by traffic calming. <xref rid="pone.0060158-Audit2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> Recent research however found only 3.7% of road surface is traffic calmed suggesting considerable potential for further engineering approaches to speed reduction. <xref rid="pone.0060158-Rodgers1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> Despite this, it is possible that perceptions about diminishing returns from road safety engineering may have influenced road safety and engineering departments limiting local politicians&#x02019; ability to affect road safety interventions in their wards. Due to relatively long planning cycles it is also likely that the implementation of previously planned interventions in intervention and control wards will have limited the ability of this study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the advocacy approach. Despite strenuous efforts, we found it impossible to find detailed information on what interventions were planned; variability in council structures, responsibilities and lack of standardised record keeping contributed to this situation.</p><p>Our study demonstrates that road safety provision changed considerably in deprived wards in England and Wales between 2005 and 2008, starting from a very low base. A 50% increase in the median proportion of road length traffic calmed took place; the provision of 20 mph zones around schools also increased by 50% and the numbers of Safe Routes to Schools tripled. However, despite these increases, by the end of the study less than 5% of all roads in wards with high pedestrian casualty rates were traffic calmed, more than three quarters of local authorities still had no provision for 20 mph zones around schools and only 17% of schools had Safe Routes to School. This clearly demonstrates that the provision of effective road safety interventions is still inadequate, even in those areas of greatest need.</p><p>It is difficult to know whether local politicians circulated the information and advocacy packs widely within council planning structures or elsewhere. Certainly, in a number of locations the information found its way to the local media which helped to highlight the issues. A sizeable minority of local politicians requested more detailed and up to date information and maps and some (12%) called for the publication of national league tables. Placing such information in the public domain would also allow other groups to advocate for action and could be particularly helpful when the discrepancy between injury risk and safety investment is large.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Generalisability</title><p>The overall design and methodology used in this study should be of interest to clinicians, policy makers and public health advocates in many settings. We have demonstrated that it is possible to design and implement a cluster randomised trial of political advocacy. The factors influencing local politicians&#x02019; interest in, and behaviour towards, road safety and the barriers which they face in effectively advocating for safety interventions will be relevant in many jurisdictions across the world. Inequality in road traffic injury is a global issue. <xref rid="pone.0060158-Peden1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> The specific findings of this study should also be generalisable to other areas of the UK and to countries with similar political structures and resources. The study sites were chosen to be within 50Km of several research centres and covered a wide area; the patterns of road collisions and safety interventions are likely to be similar across the UK.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Unanswered Questions and Future Research</title><p>There are many barriers to implementing pedestrian safety measures, including a dearth of effective local advocacy groups, perhaps due to the absence of publically available information on the scale of injuries and preventive interventions at local levels. Were such information to be made available it is likely that communities at high risk of injury but with few or no protective interventions would be much more effective in lobbying for change. Building on this study&#x02019;s findings, the Injury Observatory for Britain and Ireland has proposed that such information should be routinely available to the general public through the development of a &#x02018;SafeArea&#x02019; website. <xref rid="pone.0060158-SafeArea1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> This initiative which is being developed in a pilot site may provide the basis for the development and evaluation of modified approaches to public health advocacy.</p><p>This study has shown that the design and implementation of an advocacy package on road safety is feasible within the context of the UK. Further research needs to focus on how advocacy packages can be adapted to generate more action from local politicians; for example, how local media and local community advocates could be involved and whether greater reinforcement of the messages of the package is needed. Case studies using qualitative methodologies documenting the process by which successful implementation of safety measures are carried out would be helpful in informing the design of further intervention trials. Future studies should be carried out over much longer follow-up periods to allow for inevitable delays inherent in planning and delivering safety interventions, particularly those requiring engineering work. Longer-term studies would also facilitate the use of qualitative methodologies at an intermediate stage which could be used to decide whether there was a need to refine intervention strategies mid trial.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0060158.s001"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>An example of an intervention package.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0060158.s001.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0060158.s002"><label>Appendix S2</label><caption><p>Control group information package.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0060158.s002.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0060158.s003"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Published study protocol.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0060158.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0060158.s004"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>Supporting CONSORT checklist.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0060158.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge the help of all the local politicians, road safety officers and teachers who contributed to this study, and to Jo Sibert, emeritus Professor of Child Health at Cardiff University and retired elected local politicians, head teachers, and road safety officers who helped with the design and pilot testing of the advocacy information packs and data collection instruments.</p><p>Ethics: As this study did not include patients or staff of the NHS, the local research ethics committee decided that it did not come under their remit and declined to offer an ethical opinion.
