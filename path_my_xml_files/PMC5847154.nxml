</p></sec><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease with a complex genetic background. Psoriasis is characterized by erythematous scaly plaques, and has a broad clinical spectrum, with a massive impact on quality of life. About 2&#x02013;3% of the population in industrialized countries is affected by psoriasis, which can present as the mild form, affecting only elbows and knees, or as moderate to severe disease, involving large areas of the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Psoriasis is established as a systemic inflammatory disease with an increased risk of various comorbidities. Associated comorbidities include cardiovascular diseases (CVD), obesity, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, depression or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Due to the chronic nature of psoriasis and to the ageing of the general population, elderly patients are a patient group of emerging clinical relevance. Many elderly subjects with psoriasis are inadequately treated and experience adverse consequences, both physically and psychologically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Elderly individuals with psoriasis are often excluded from clinical trials and studies, leading to limited availability of data about the clinical features and toxicities in this group.</p><p id="Par9">Elderly subjects also show several characteristics that distinguish them in terms of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Elderly subjects exhibit altered distribution volumes (e.g., decreased muscle and increased fat content of the body), reduced liver metabolism and reduced renal function. Furthermore, the immune system shows age-dependent changes, the so-called immunosenescence. Due to their increased number of comorbidities, elderly subjects often receive several medications for various indications at the same time (polymedication), which makes them vulnerable to adverse drug interactions and can potentially produce a higher rate of adverse events. It is therefore important that treatments are chosen and monitored carefully in this at-risk population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively neutralizes IL-17A, has significant efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis and PsA, demonstrating a rapid onset of action and sustained responses with a favourable safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In Europe, secukinumab was the first biologic treatment to be approved for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy, without the precondition of failure to respond, contraindication, or intolerance to other systemic therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There are limited data available on the efficacy and safety of biologic treatments in elderly subjects with psoriasis. To evaluate general differences in baseline characteristics between elderly and younger patients as well as the safety and efficacy of secukinumab in elderly subjects, we performed a post-hoc analysis of three phase III trials. A total of 67 elderly subjects (&#x02265;&#x000a0;65&#x000a0;years) affected by chronic plaque psoriasis who were treated with secukinumab 300&#x000a0;mg were identified and compared with 841 younger subjects (18&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years) treated with secukinumab 300&#x000a0;mg.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design and Subjects</title><p id="Par11">The following three studies were included into this pooled post-hoc analysis: ERASURE (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01365455), FIXTURE (NCT01358578) and CLEAR (NCT02074982). Throughout the analysis, subjects were grouped by their age at the time of randomization: elderly subjects (65&#x000a0;years of age or older) and younger subjects (18&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years of age). The cut-off was chosen as a standard used in the literature and mean age at baseline of the two groups was evaluated and compared for validation.</p><p id="Par12">All three studies were multicentre, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, 52-week phase III trials assessing the efficacy and safety of secukinumab in different dosing and treatment regimens for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The ERASURE study compared efficacy and safety of secukinumab at doses of 150 and 300&#x000a0;mg, including a placebo arm, and enrolled 738 subjects. The FIXTURE study compared the efficacy and safety of secukinumab 150, 300&#x000a0;mg and etanercept 50&#x000a0;mg, including a placebo arm, and enrolled 1306 subjects. The CLEAR study compared secukinumab 300&#x000a0;mg with ustekinumab 45/90&#x000a0;mg (per label) and enrolled 676 subjects. Eligibility criteria were similar throughout all three studies. Briefly, subjects were 18&#x000a0;years of age or older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis that had been diagnosed at least 6&#x000a0;months before randomization and was poorly controlled with topical treatments, phototherapy, previous systemic therapy, or any combination of these. In addition, subjects had a score of 12 or higher on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI; a composite evaluation instrument for psoriasis severity, on a scale of 0&#x02013;72, with higher scores indicating more severe disease), a score of 3 or 4 on the modified Investigator&#x02019;s Global Assessment (IGA mod 2011 0/1 or IGA; a static, 5-point instrument for rating the clinician&#x02019;s impression of the overall severity of psoriasis, on a scale from 0 [clear skin] to 4 [severe disease]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and involvement of 10% or more of the body surface area (BSA). Subjects with other forms of plaque psoriasis or drug-induced psoriasis were excluded. In the current analysis population of all three trials, secukinumab 300&#x000a0;mg was applied subcutaneously once weekly at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 followed by injections every 4&#x000a0;weeks until week 48. The study design, methods, and results of all three studies were previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The studies received ethical approval from the appropriate institutional review boards and were conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p id="Par13">Data from two further phase III trials (SCULPTURE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and STATURE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]) were not included in the analysis, as these studies did not include non-secukinumab comparator groups and differed considerably in design, and hence did not lend themselves for pooling with the studies included in this analysis.</p><p id="Par14">For the comparison of efficacy and safety, only patients having received secukinumab 300&#x000a0;mg were included in the analysis. For the comparison of baseline characteristics, two analyses were performed. The first analysis included only patients who have received secukinumab 300&#x000a0;mg (analysis set). In addition, a second analysis was performed that included all patients from the three pooled studies, irrespective of their treatment arm (secukinumab 300&#x000a0;mg, secukinumab 150&#x000a0;mg, etanercept, ustekinumab, placebo). This full baseline analysis allowed a maximum possible sample size, making statements about differences between elderly and younger psoriasis subjects more generalizable.</p><p id="Par15">Subjects&#x02019; medical history of cardiometabolic comorbidities (only available for ERASURE and FIXTURE, not for CLEAR, which is the reason for the lower number of analysed patients [<italic>N</italic>] for this parameter), smoking history and psoriasis history were assessed at screening visit in a separate electronic case report form (eCRF) page. All laboratory tests were assessed from blood samples drawn at baseline. The presence of metabolic syndrome was defined as fulfilment of the 2009 consensus definition criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Efficacy and Safety Analyses</title><p id="Par16">For the analysis of efficacy and safety parameters, the following groups of subjects were included into the analysis: ERASURE study: secukinumab 300-mg treatment arm; FIXTURE study: secukinumab 300-mg treatment arm; CLEAR study: secukinumab 300-mg treatment arm. The 150-mg arms from ERASURE and FIXTURE were not included in the analysis, as 300&#x000a0;mg is the recommended dose per worldwide labels. There are no efficacy or safety data shown for etanercept or ustekinumab, as the group sizes would be too small for a meaningful comparison between age groups.</p><p id="Par17">Disease activity was assessed by the use of PASI and IGA mod 2011. Efficacy data are presented as percentage of subjects with a score of 0 or 1 on IGA mod 2011 (including a reduction from baseline of &#x02265;&#x000a0;2) and as percentage of subjects achieving PASI 75, 90 or 100 response. PASI 75, 90 or 100 response means a 75% or more, 90% or more, or 100% improvement from baseline PASI. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed by the use of the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), a validated instrument for dermatologic conditions (scores range from 0&#x02013;30 points, with higher scores indicating a greater effect of the disease on patient&#x02019;s QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. HRQoL data are shown per time point as mean DLQI and the percentage of subjects achieving a DLQI score of 0/1 (corresponding to minimal to no impact of disease on QoL).</p><p id="Par18">Safety was evaluated by monitoring adverse events, including the severity of the event and the relationship of the event to the study drug, and by obtaining clinical laboratory measurements, assessing vital signs, and performing physical examinations at each study visit. There are no safety data shown for etanercept or ustekinumab, as the group sizes would be too small for a meaningful comparison between age groups.</p><p id="Par19">For the entire study period, common adverse events were defined as adverse events that occurred in &#x02265;&#x000a0;5.0% of either elderly or younger subjects; for the initial 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment the cut-off was &#x02265;&#x000a0;2%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="Par20">Statistical analyses were all conducted post hoc. The full analysis set for subjects treated with secukinumab 300&#x000a0;mg (label dose) was used for efficacy parameter analyses (PASI, IGA, DLQI), the safety set was used for the safety analysis. Non-responder imputation was applied for PASI response, percentage of patients with PASI&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;1, 2, 3, 5 and percentage of patients with a score of 0 or 1 on IGA. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation was applied for DLQI data. For the comparison of baseline characteristics, a&#x000a0;2 sample <italic>t</italic> test was used for continuous variables (e.g. age, weight) and a&#x000a0; Chi square test for categorical variables (e.g. percentage of smokers). No correction for multiple testing was applied. Because of the post-hoc nature of the analysis and the high imbalance in patient numbers between the two groups, no statistical testing was performed for efficacy data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Baseline Characteristics of Elderly Psoriasis Subjects in Comparison to Younger Psoriasis Subjects</title><p id="Par21">A broad range of patient characteristics at baseline were analysed in order to differentiate the clinical characteristics of elderly and younger psoriasis subjects.

Secukinumab showed equivalent efficacy in older subjects, with a safety profile similar to that observed in previous studies, in line with biologic treatments for psoriasis generally, and consistent with an elderly population.</p><p id="Par31">Elderly subjects with psoriasis require distinct treatment considerations in routine clinical practice. Both drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may be altered in the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Elderly subjects are more likely to have had longer disease duration than younger subjects. Due to an increased likelihood of comorbid health conditions, elderly subjects may be prescribed concomitant medications that must be considered when selecting psoriasis therapies to avoid adverse events associated with polypharmacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">Other biologic agents have been assessed in elderly subjects with psoriasis, although data remain limited. An observational study of etanercept and adalimumab monotherapy in 89 elderly subjects with plaque-type psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis showed consistent and stable efficacy over 156&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Ustekinumab treatment was also evaluated in 24 elderly subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">The elderly and younger subjects included in the current analysis showed several distinct differences at baseline. The mean age of both patient groups differed significantly (69.9&#x000a0;years vs 42.8&#x000a0;years, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001), which supports the validity of the analysis. Elderly subjects had a significantly higher frequency of cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities including diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypertension and coronary artery disease. As may be expected, elderly subjects had significantly longer disease duration than younger subjects. Younger subjects appeared to show greater disease severity at baseline, with higher PASI and DLQI scores recorded, and were more likely to smoke.</p><p id="Par34">Here, we show that secukinumab 300&#x000a0;mg gave rapid and sustained PASI 75, 90 and 100, and IGA responses in all subjects regardless of age. There were no differences in the speed of onset or duration of response between elderly and younger subjects treated with secukinumab.</p><p id="Par35">The elderly subjects had a slightly lower baseline DLQI score than the younger group, but DLQI in both groups decreased considerably over the 52&#x000a0;weeks of secukinumab treatment. The proportion of subjects achieving a DLQI response of 0 or 1, indicating minimal impact of psoriasis on QoL, was similar in both elderly and younger subjects over 52&#x000a0;weeks. These data indicate that in addition to the clinical efficacy shown by the decrease in PASI score, secukinumab improves HRQoL in elderly subjects.</p><p id="Par36">Overall, the tolerability of secukinumab was comparable between elderly and younger subjects. There was no indication of an increased risk of infections in elderly subjects; the overall infection rate was lower among elderly than younger subjects, although this was not a significant difference. Similar rates of different types of infections were observed between the two groups. There was a higher frequency of cardiovascular adverse events in the elderly population. At the same time, the elderly population had a significantly higher baseline rate of several cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities, which should be considered in this context. There was a greater frequency of treatment discontinuation among elderly subjects. The natural age association with the incidence and prevalence of several comorbid diseases should be taken into consideration when interpreting the safety data of this analysis.</p><p id="Par37">Despite a careful study design, there are a number of limitations to the current analysis, most notably the retrospective, post-hoc nature of the pooled study. The method of imputation was chosen as the most appropriate approach for the analysis of the data, but all imputation methods carry an inherent risk of bias. Furthermore, the number of patients was highly imbalanced between elderly and younger patients, limiting the comparability of the two groups. The number of elderly patients was low, meaning that numerical differences observed could be assigned clinical significance only with caution. Concerning safety data, the relatively small number of elderly patients limits the detection of rare adverse events. Despite these limitations, the data show that the efficacy and tolerability of secukinumab are similar in both elderly and younger populations.</p><p id="Par38">In conclusion, secukinumab at the label dose of 300&#x000a0;mg is effective in elderly and younger populations. Pronounced benefits in HRQoL were also observed in both populations. Upcoming real-world evidence from ongoing non-interventional studies and registries such as PROSPECT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], SERENA or PsoBest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] will be of interest to better characterize efficacy and safety of biologic treatments in elderly psoriasis patients. Further prospective studies are required to confirm the findings from this pooled analysis, which supports secukinumab as a treatment option for elderly subjects with psoriasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec11"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
