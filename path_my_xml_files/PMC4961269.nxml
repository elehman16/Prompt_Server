This variation is thought to be multifactorial involving gene-environment interactions, with the heritability estimates of age at menopause ranging from 31% to 78%.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Although menopause is an important health issue that will ultimately affect all women, the influence of genetic variation on menopausal physiology is currently not well understood.</p><p>As estrogen production by the ovaries decreases, circulating estrogen levels drop by approximately 90% and the conversion of androgens to estrogens by aromatase in the adipose tissue and skin becomes the predominant source of endogenous estrogens. Estrone (E<sub>1</sub>) and 17&#x003b2;-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) are both ligands for estrogen receptors (ERs), but ERs have higher affinity for E<sub>2</sub>, which is considered the main ligand for ER-mediated processes.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Although estrogen conjugation is an important step in inactivation, conjugated estrogens may also have biologic activity and be important in delivery of estrogens to target tissues, where the sulfate moiety can be removed by sulfatase.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Different formulations, doses, and routes of administration of HT may impact efficacy, with oral products being subjected to first-pass enterohepatic metabolism, which includes sulfation among other conjugation reactions.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> For optimal HT efficacy in symptom reduction and cardioprotection, as well as for avoidance of risks including cancers and thrombosis, maintaining the proper balance between estrogens and their conjugated forms may be important. It is unclear how genetic variation may affect serum concentrations of estrogens, symptom relief, or side effects in the setting of administration of these exogenous hormone products, which result in estrogen levels above physiologic menopausal levels.</p><p>At physiologic concentrations, E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>2</sub> are substrates for SULT1A1, SULT1E1, and SULT2A1.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Through the activity of these enzymes, estrone sulfate (E<sub>1</sub>S) is the form of endogenous estrogen circulating at the highest concentration.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Although SULT1E1 has the highest affinity for estrogen substrates, the expression of SULT1A1 is ubiquitous, and it is the predominant sulfotransferase present in the liver, making it an important contributor to estrogen sulfation.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> At concentrations above physiologic concentrations, such as those seen in HT, the relative contributions of these enzymes to estrogen conjugation may differ. <italic>SULT1A1</italic> is highly polymorphic, with both a common copy number variation (CNV) and multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). SNPs and number of gene copies have both previously been shown to be associated with enzyme activity.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Because SULT1A1 can metabolize estrogens, is highly expressed, and is genetically polymorphic, it is an ideal candidate gene for further study as a potential contributor to variability in menopausal physiology, as well as to the variability in response and side effects that result from HT.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIG. 1</label><caption><p><italic>SULT1A1</italic> locus. <italic>SULT1A1</italic> is highly polymorphic with both a copy number variation and multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms.

The quantity of each fragment, represented by peak height, was measured using GeneMarker, version 1.51 (SoftGenetics, State College, PA), and the ratio between the peak heights was used to determine copy number.</p><p>The promoter SNPs, &#x02212;624 (rs3760091) and &#x02212;396 (rs750155), and <sup>&#x02217;</sup>2 (Arg213His, rs9282861) were genotyped by pyrosequencing. The number of alleles with wild type (WT) and the variant nucleotide at each of the three loci was determined by combining copy number with the pyrosequencing peak height data. The allele ratio obtained from pyrosequencing was then plotted as &#x0201c;% signal&#x0201d; by copy number group to determine the quantity of each allele present.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>Previous reports of minor allele frequency (MAF) for each of the three SNPs studied did not take into account the gene copy number. Therefore, if the duplicated or deleted alleles were either WT or variant more frequently than identified in the samples with two gene copies, the reported MAF may be skewed from its true value. Therefore, MAF was calculated both with and without consideration of gene copy number in these samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of serum steroids</title><p>All samples were collected from venous blood obtained in the morning after an overnight fast.

The LC-MS/MS method was utilized because it uses an organic extraction to remove water-soluble conjugates, allows for concentration of the specimen, is free from interference, and represents a reference methodology.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>E<sub>2</sub> and E<sub>1</sub> were extracted from 0.5&#x0200a;mL of serum with the organic solvent methylene chloride.

After derivatization with dansyl chloride, high-pressure liquid chromatography was used before introduction of the derivatized sample extract into the tandem mass spectrometer.</p><p>E<sub>1</sub>S and E<sub>2</sub>S were extracted from serum via protein precipitation with acetonitrile. Deuterated E<sub>1</sub>S, d4-E<sub>1</sub>S, and E<sub>2</sub>S, d4-E<sub>2</sub>S, were added and used as internal standards. Positive pressure was used to push the sample into a 96 well collection plate, where water was added to each well. Analytes and internal standards were monitored on electrospray ionization mode and detected in multiplereaction monitoring mode. Intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were determined for dose ranges of 0.30 to 389&#x0200a;pg/mL for E<sub>1</sub>, 0.23 to 405&#x0200a;pg/mL for E<sub>2</sub>, 110 to 8,306&#x0200a;pg/mL for E<sub>1</sub>S, and 107 to 8,083&#x0200a;pg/mL for E<sub>2</sub>S. These coefficients of variation ranged from 9.9% (average across assays) at low concentrations to 2.9% (average across assays) at high concentrations. The limits of detection (in pg/mL) were 0.27 for E<sub>1</sub>, 0.04 for E<sub>2</sub>, 4.35 for E<sub>1</sub>S, and 4.31 for E<sub>2</sub>S.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A multistep approach was taken to the analysis of this single candidate gene study. At baseline and after treatment, each symptom was reported on a scale of 0 to 5, with 5 being the most severe, but for our analyses, each symptom was analyzed as mild, defined as 0 to 2, or severe, defined as 3 to 5. Symptoms were dichotomized into mild or severe based on the impact to participants, with severe symptoms considered intolerable by most women. <italic>SULT1A1</italic> is polymorphic with both CNV and SNPs, which were combined for analysis. Because women had one to four copies of <italic>SULT1A1</italic>, the number of each nucleotide at each locus could range from 0 to 4. The nucleotide at each position previously reported to have higher activity in white individuals was selected (C at rs3760091, A at rs750155, and G at rs9282861), and the number of this nucleotide was used in our analyses.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The estrogen levels and ratios of sulfate-conjugated to nonsulfated estrogens were log-transformed before analysis if they did not follow a normal distribution.

None of the women had deletion of both copies of <italic>SULT1A1</italic>. The copy number frequencies in this population of white postmenopausal women are similar to previous reports of copy number frequency in white populations.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>The MAF for rs3760091, accounting for copy number, was 0.538, whereas it was 0.492 not accounting for copy number.

For <sup>&#x02217;</sup>2 (rs9282861), the MAF was 0.286 and 0.243, accounting for copy number or not, respectively. The higher MAF for each variant when accounting for copy number suggests that many of the duplicated alleles contain variant nucleotides.</p></sec><sec><title>Influence of <italic>SULT1A1</italic> on onset of menopause and symptoms</title><p>Data were available for age at menopause in 102 women and symptoms in 100 women before randomization to treatment (baseline).

In addition to sulfation increasing the water solubility of estrogens for excretion,<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> sulfated estrogens have a longer half-life than the unconjugated form and are considered to be an inactive &#x0201c;storage pool&#x0201d; in equilibrium with nonsulfated estrogens.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Although in isolation, increased SULT1A1 activity would be expected to result in decreased bioavailability of estrogens, biological systems and estrogen pathways are complex with many additional variables contributing to variation in estrogen levels. In addition, it is unknown at this time how genetic variations in pathways regulating estrogen metabolism modulate and interact with genetic variations of other pathways that are involved in the phenotypic expressions of symptoms, including those involved with production and degradation of neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and serotonin, and their respective receptors.</p><p>In addition to CNVs, <italic>SULT1A1</italic> contains three SNPs that are commonly studied and may affect hormonal efficacy. Two SNPs, rs3760091 (&#x02212;624) and rs750155 (&#x02212;396), are located in the promoter region and are in linkage disequilibrium with the <italic>SULT1A1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02217;</italic></sup><italic>2</italic> (Arg213His, rs9282861) polymorphism.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The C nucleotide at rs3760091 creates a putative Sp1 binding site and is found in haplotypes that are associated with increased SULT1A1 activity in platelets.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The rs750155 promoter SNP shows ethnic variation in its association with biologic effect&#x02014;the A nucleotide is associated with decreased platelet SULT1A1 activity in African-Americans and with increased platelet SULT1A1 activity in white populations of European ancestry.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The <italic>SULT1A1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02217;</italic></sup><italic>2</italic> polymorphism (G&#x0200a;&#x0003e;&#x0200a;A single nucleotide change) is associated with decreased enzyme activity and decreased thermal stability of the enzyme.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In an individual, gene CNV and SNPs occur together and cannot be separated, so analyzing the effect of allele &#x0201c;dosage&#x0201d; may be more biologically relevant than separately analyzing CNV and SNPs. Here, we found a different MAF for each of the three SNPs studied when the copy number was taken into account compared with only analyzing each locus as homozygous WT, heterozygous, or homozygous variant. These results highlight the importance of investigating both types of variation.</p><p>In this study, increasing number of G alleles at rs9282861 was associated with earlier age at menopause, as well as less severe insomnia and decreased frequency of night sweats before initiation of HT. Although we hypothesize that these findings are related to changes in estrogen levels as a result of this genotype, we were unable to test this hypothesis because at baseline only E<sub>2</sub> was measured, and women were menopausal for at least 6 months before enrollment in this study. SULT1A1 has many substrates in addition to estrogens, so it is also possible that the observed relationships are due to the impact of SULT1A1 variation on other substrates. For example, a recent study demonstrated that SULT1A1 sulfates melatonin, which could impact postmenopausal insomnia in addition to estrogen.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Further study of these associations may clarify the underlying mechanisms responsible. There was approximately a 5-year difference in mean age at menopause among women with 0 G alleles compared with women with 4 G alleles at rs9282861. The impact of age at menopause on risk for a variety of disorders, including breast cancer and depression, has been widely studied. In addition, younger age at menopause is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Therefore, our finding of an association between <italic>SULT1A1</italic> genotype and age at menopause warrants further study in other cohorts and especially with regard to other processes associated with aging.</p><p>Although we hypothesized that <italic>SULT1A1</italic> genetic variation would be associated with hormone levels after HT, and thus with clinical outcomes, and we did identify several associations between genotype and hormone level and between genotype and clinical symptoms, we did not observe a clear relationship linking all three together in the presence of HT. This may be due to our small sample size, small or no effects of this gene, and/or the multifactorial nature of these phenotypes. In addition to estrogen metabolism that we have studied, prior studies have investigated the impact of genetic variation in ERs,<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and a recent genome-wide association study identified SNPs in a transporter to be highly correlated with both the level of conjugated estrogens and the ratio of conjugated to unconjugated estrogens.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>Although several relationships between <italic>SULT1A1</italic> genotype and menopausal timing and symptoms were identified, our study had several limitations. First, our sample size was small and women were randomized to one of three treatments further decreasing the power to detect genotypic effects on the phenotypes of interest. Second, although the collection of samples for hormone measurement was standardized, the timing with which women took pills or applied a patch was not controlled and could contribute to variability in estrogen levels. Finally, in our study, the participants were a relatively homogenous population of healthy white women of European ancestry. The impact of <italic>SULT1A1</italic> genetic variation on hormone levels and menopausal symptoms may vary by ethnic background, limiting the generalizability of our findings to non-white populations, and requires further study in other populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying variation in menopausal timing and symptoms is crucial to improving many aspects of women's health, including risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease. With recent advances in understanding the human genome, it is now possible to begin to understand the impact of genetic variation on menopause, which may translate into models to predict which women may gain the most benefit from HT and to optimize the dose and formulation, as well as to predict which women may experience harmful side effects. Although there is a vast chasm between current knowledge and the goal of optimizing HT to improve women's health, this study represents an initial step toward the understanding of the impact of genetic variation on estrogen metabolism and the individualization of HT.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the dedicated volunteers participating in this study and coworkers in the Women's Health Clinic.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Funding/support: This work was supported by grants from the Aurora Foundation to the Kronos Longevity Research Institute, U19 GM61388 (The Pharmacogenomics Research Network), NIH HL90639, RO1 GM28157, UL1TR00013 (from the National Center for Research Resources [NCRR], a component of the National Institutes of Health [NIH], and the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research.
