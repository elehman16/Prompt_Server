For this, full term pregnant women from low income urban community were enrolled and were followed-up for 24 months postpartum. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from maternal weight and height that were collected one month after delivery. Infants' weight, and length, head, chest and mid upper arm circumferences and skin fold thicknesses at triceps, biceps and subscapular area were collected at baseline (before randomization) and once in three months up till 24 months. Three hundred and twenty four infants were randomized and allocated to zinc (163) or placebo (161) groups respectively. Supplementation of zinc was initiated from 4 months of age and continued till children attained 18 months. The control (placebo) group of children received riboflavin 0.5 mg/day, whereas the intervention (zinc) group received 5 mg zinc plus riboflavin 0.5 mg/day. When infants were 18 months old, dietary intakes (in 78 children) were calculated by 24 hour diet recall method and hemoglobin, zinc, copper and vitamin A were quantified in blood samples collected from 70 children. The results showed prevalence of undernutrition (body mass index &#x0003c;18.5) in 37% of the mothers. Mean&#x000b1;SD calorie consumption and zinc intakes from diets in infants were 590&#x000b1;282.8 Kcal/day and 0.97&#x000b1;0.608 mg/day respectively. Multiple linear regression models demonstrated maternal weight as a strong predictor of infants' weight and length at 18 months of age. As expected, diarrhea duration impacted infants' linear growth and weight gain adversely. Zinc supplementation for a mean period of 190 days, starting from 4 months up to 18 months of age, in full term normal infants, consuming an average energy of 590 Kcal/day, had significant effect on the skin fold thicknesses, but not on their linear growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Clinical Trail Registration India (CTRI) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tinyurl.com/k3s8xu7">CTRI/2012/08/002884</ext-link>

The effect of zinc in younger infants is more important to document, since, linear growth restriction begins as early as 3&#x02013;6 months of intrauterine life, continues through postnatal life and becomes irreversible by the age of 2 years <xref rid="pone.0061486-Rehman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-Butte1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-Mamidi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Given that mild zinc deficiency is almost universal and considering the relatively higher requirement of zinc in early infancy and childhood, zinc should be considered as an important limiting factor to growth in children <xref rid="pone.0061486-Sandstead1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-Waterlow1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-Bhaskaram1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

Selection criteria included term healthy infants who would stay in the study area till the child attains 2 years of age. Preterm deliveries (gestational age &#x0003c;37 weeks), low birth weight (&#x0003c;2500 g) and infants with congenital abnormalities (neural tube defects, congenital heart disease, cleft palate and cleft lip) or birth asphyxia were excluded from the study. All the study children including other children from the community had access to a local medical center run by National Institute of Nutrition. However, conscious efforts were made not to interfere with the routine medical care provided either by the local health authorities through urban health centre or private medical practitioners. A clinic was conducted at the community center to assess study children and to treat any inter-current illnesses such as respiratory tract infections or dysentery; however, a few children who developed pneumonia were referred to tertiary care hospital.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Assuming that the children in the experimental group would achieve better linear growth and that there would be &#x02265;50% reduction in severe stunting compared to the placebo group, a sample size of 135 in each group was calculated taking the prevalence of severe stunting as 29.8 % in the age group of 1 to 2 years; with 80% power at 0.05 significance level with a corrected chi-squared test <xref rid="pone.0061486-National1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

After delivery, new born babies were assessed for confirmation of eligibility and to identify potential noncompliant individuals who were not willing to participate. Of the 475 full term infants available, 24 did not have proper birth weight records and 79 were low birth weight babies and hence were excluded from the study. 48 infants were not available at the time of randomization as they moved out of the study area or refused to participate. Thus a total of 324 infants (163 and 161 for zinc and placebo groups respectively) were randomized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061486-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Supplementation was given after randomization to all children from four months of age till completion of 18 months. Mothers were counseled on strategies to overcome problems with supplement adherence. Eight and 14 children in zinc and placebo respectively, discontinued by 18 months, therefore in the final analysis only 302 were included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061486-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0061486-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0061486.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Flow diagram of the progress through the phases of the trial.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0061486.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Randomization</title><p>The study was a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial, for which, a computer generated simple randomization was used to allocate the study children to either control or intervention group. The zinc and placebo were prepared and supplied by Biological Evans limited, in a syrup base, which were of similar colour, consistency and flavor; in two sets of identical looking bottles, labeled 1 and 2. Riboflavin (1 mg/ml) was common in both sets of bottles, but one set contained zinc as zinc sulfate (10 mg of elemental zinc per ml), in addition to riboflavin. The randomization list and the supplements were given to a senior scientist at the institute who had no knowledge of the codes. After recruitment, the study children were given an identification number and were assigned treatment code by the senior scientist supervising the randomization. All the investigators, including the medical doctor collecting clinical data and those collecting anthropometric measurement, as well as the statistician, were blind to the treatment. After completion of the study analysis, the groups were decoded. Thus, all the investigators involved in data collection, analysis and interpretation were blind to allocation. The parents were also blind to the treatment given to their child.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Supplementation</title><p>Supplementation of zinc was initiated after the age of 4 months and was continued till the child attained 18 months age. The mothers were instructed to give 0.5 ml of the preparation to children every morning after the initial feed. The control groups of children received only riboflavin (0.5 mg/day), whereas the intervention group received 5 mg of zinc plus riboflavin (0.5 mg/day). Every month, the project staff, responsible for distributing the supplements in the field, collected empty bottles and provided fresh supplements as per subject identification number and codes.</p><p>The total duration of supplementation was for 14 months, however, supplements were not available for 2 months in between and none of the children received supplements during this period. Therefore the effective supplementation period was for 12 months (360 days) for each child.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Data Collection</title><p>Data on nutritional status and morbidity of the children were collected by trained field investigators. Quality control testing for interrator reliability and reproducibility were done every three months. Data regarding feeding practices and any other supplementation were recorded for all the children. Immunization status of all children was recorded at monthly visits. Diarrheal and respiratory morbidity was collected by 15 day recall. Diarrheal episodes separated by 3 symptom free days were considered as separate episodes. Diarrhea was defined as passing of more than 3 stools in 24 hours or stools with altered consistency, with or without mucus or blood or loose watery stools. Respiratory tract infections were defined as cough or cold with fever and recurrence after 3 symptom free days was considered as a separate episode. Lower respiratory tract infections were confirmed by clinical examination and radiology.</p><p>Maternal weight and height were recorded 1 month after delivery, as most of the pregnancy weight gain is lost by one month postpartum. Birth weights were recorded from the delivery records. Anthropometric data collection like weight, length, head circumference, chest circumference and mid upper arm circumference and skin fold thicknesses at triceps, biceps, subscapular area were collected once in three months. Mothers were instructed to bring their children once in three months to the community center, which served as a central facility for anthropometric data collection. Whenever the children were not brought to the center, home visits were made and data recordings were done. In case the house was locked at the time of the visit, additional visits were made to record anthropometry measurement within the following two weeks. If they were not traceable within 2 weeks that particular recording was not done. Weight was recorded using a portable Seca digital weighing machine with a sensitivity of 50 grams and length was recorded using infanto-meter to the nearest of 1 mm. Skin fold thicknesses at biceps, triceps and subscapular were measured using Harpenden calipers. The children were categorized into different nutritional grades based on the WHO growth standard, 2006. Study children were defined as stunted, wasted or underweight if his or her &#x02018;z&#x02019;-score of weight-for-age (WAZ), length-for-age (HAZ) and weight-for-length (WHZ) respectively were &#x0003c;&#x02013;2 SD. Children with &#x02018;z&#x02019;-score &#x0003c;&#x02013;3 SD WAZ, HAZ or WHZ were classified as severely underweight, stunted or wasted respectively.</p><p>After completion of supplementation, when children were 18 months old, blood samples (3 ml) were collected from cubital vein in a sub sample of 70 children for estimation of Hemoglobin, Zinc, Copper and Vitamin A. Dietary intakes were also calculated by 24 hours recall method for 78 children (18 months old).</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical software SPSS 19.0 was used for analysis. ANOVA and Mann-Whitney tests were done to test the differences between the groups. Other measures employed were repeated measures (time series) and Chi square to determine distribution of prevalence of undernutrition or stunting among zinc supplemented and control children at 18, 21 and 24 months of age. Regression analysis was done for determinants of infants' weight and length at 18, 21 and 24 months of age. The variables tested in regression analysis were gestational age, maternal weight, height, education and occupation; father's education and occupation and number of family members, for zinc and placebo groups separately as well as combined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Maternal age, gestational age, birth weight, and other demographic variables at baseline were similar in both the zinc and the placebo groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0061486-t001">Table 1</xref>).

The variables tested were group, gestational age, maternal weight, height, education and occupation; father's education and occupation and number of family members. Maternal weight (&#x003b2;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.031; CI: 0.015, 0.047; p&#x0003c;0.001) and gestational age (&#x003b2;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.203; CI: 0.023, 0.383; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.025) were contributing positively, while diarrheal duration (&#x003b2;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.027; CI: &#x02212;0.046, &#x02212;0.007; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.006) was contributing negatively to infant's weight at 18 months of age. At 21 and 24 months of age, maternal weight (p&#x0003c;0.001) and gestational age (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.005) emerged as strong predictors of infants' weight gain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0061486-t007">Table 7</xref>). When regression analysis was applied at 18 months of age for determinants of length; maternal weight (&#x003b2;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.075; CI: 0.023, 0.126; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.005) and father's education (&#x003b2;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.573; CI: 0.166, 0.979; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.006) were contributing positively, while diarrheal duration was observed to influence negatively (&#x003b2;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.064; CI: &#x02212;0.129, 0.001; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05). At 21 and 24 months of age, only maternal height (p&#x0003c;0.001) and fathers education (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01) emerged as strong predictors of infants' linear growth (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0061486-t007">Table 7</xref>). Even after adjusting the other variables zinc had no effect on linear growth, though, it contributed significantly for weight gain at 21 months of age (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0061486-t007">Table 7</xref>). Similarly, multivariate logistic regression model for stunting as dependent variable, at 18 months of age, revealed only a trend with maternal height (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.287; CI: 0.922, 7.532; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.070), but at 21 months maternal weight was significantly associated with stunting (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2.114; CI: 1.202, 3.718; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.009). At 24 months of age, maternal height and illiteracy of father were significantly associated with stunting.

Multiple linear regression models demonstrated maternal weight as a strong predictor of infant's weight and length at 18 months of age; and as expected, diarrhea duration had an adverse impact on infant's linear growth and weight gain.</p><p>Earlier, some studies have shown an increment in linear growth in stunted children or in children with low serum zinc at baseline, while some other studies on healthy term infants failed to show any beneficial effect of zinc on linear growth except for some effect on weight gain and cognitive function <xref rid="pone.0061486-Umeta1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-Rivera1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-Osendarp1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-CastilloDuran1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In our study, blood collection was not done at the baseline and therefore interpretation of data with reference to baseline zinc status was not feasible. Our study population was very unique and that way may not be comparable to the above mentioned studies. For instance, all the children in our study were receiving cereal based complementary food that was inadequate in calories and micronutrients; and moreover, faltering in length appeared from 3 months of age onwards. Though most studies attributed the beneficial effect of zinc on linear growth to reduction in infections, improvement in appetite or replenishment of zinc status, information was lacking on whether the complementary foods given were adequate in zinc or whether they contained high phytate or not <xref rid="pone.0061486-Umeta1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-Rivera1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-Osendarp1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-CastilloDuran1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. It may be assumed that the infants in these studies received an adequate amount of complementary food with inadequate zinc and therefore supplementation of zinc must have contributed to full expression of growth potential <xref rid="pone.0061486-Umeta1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-Rivera1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-Osendarp1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-CastilloDuran1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. A possibility of bias also cannot be ruled out in one study, which registered high attrition in the zinc supplemented group <xref rid="pone.0061486-Walravens1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In our study zinc supplementation increased fat fold (skin fold) thickness, though increment in linear growth was not observed. Dietary recall showed that the intakes were qualitatively and quantitatively insufficient in terms of energy and protein. Primarily, the diet was cereal based refined carbohydrates, which was low in protein as well as in micronutrients. Clearly, the huge calorie gap and low protein intake would have contributed to the lack of effect of zinc on linear growth of the children in our study.</p><p>Heinig et al could not demonstrate any effect of zinc on linear growth in infants receiving adequate energy with appropriate zinc, suggesting that additional zinc would not have effect on growth if adequate intake of balanced diet is ensured <xref rid="pone.0061486-Heinig1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Lack of effect of zinc on linear growth in our study is in contrast with generally observed positive effect of zinc supplementation on breast fed infants in developing countries, suggesting that single nutrient supplementation, on a background of low calorie diet will not be adequate to meet the requirement for linear growth <xref rid="pone.0061486-Heinig1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Furthermore, zinc is known to stimulate the synthesis of IGF-1 which may lead to pre-adipocyte differentiation <xref rid="pone.0061486-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In the present study, the significant increase in the TSF and SSF thickness from 18 to 24 months perhaps could be attributed to such an effect. Similar findings were observed in a study from Africa, which showed an increase in skin fold thickness after zinc supplementation in pre-adolescent children <xref rid="pone.0061486-Cavan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>During 6 to 24 months of age, a child normally doubles in weight, and by 24 months almost attains half of that of adult height. But in contrast, the infants in the current study gained significantly lesser height and weight compared to the standard <xref rid="pone.0061486-World1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The onset of growth faltering was evident, from 3 months onwards, on par with the global data <xref rid="pone.0061486-Shrimpton1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, children in the current study continued to gain lesser weight for age and weight for length for a much longer period in contrast to the global data <xref rid="pone.0061486-Shrimpton1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. For instance, mean weight for age &#x02018;z&#x02019; scores at 3 months was 0.95, which decreased progressively to &#x02013;1.64 by 18 months and continued to decease to &#x02212;1.69 by 24 months. &#x02018;z&#x02019; scores for length (HAZ) over a period of 3 to 24 months also showed a similar trend. Moreover, unlike the global data and much like the data from other parts of India, the current study demonstrated faltering in length as well from 3 months of age <xref rid="pone.0061486-Shrimpton1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-Rehman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-Mamidi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-National2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Growth faltering has multi-factorial etiology including poor nutrition and illness, in addition to other factors such as maternal weight and pregnancy weight gain. In the current study, multiple factors such as poor nutritional status of mothers, inadequate complementary food and diarrheal infections contributed significantly to poor growth in children. Maternal weight emerged as a predictor of gain in weight and length in infants at 18 months of age. At 21 and 24 months of age, while maternal weight predicted weight gain, maternal height predicted infant's length. Moreover, maternal weight and height had a protective effect on stunting at 21 months and 24 months of age respectively. Accordingly, it is credible to believe that early onset of stunting may have its antecedents in preconception and pregnancy <xref rid="pone.0061486-Neumann1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Mother's weight at conception and subsequent gain during pregnancy are powerful determinants of an infant's size at birth and during the first six months of its life. The findings in the current study highlight the need for interventions in pre-conception, prenatal and early life to prevent growth failure in children in India.</p><p>While the RDA recommendation for 1&#x02013;3 year old children is 1200 Kcal, the children in the current study were consuming only half that amount, similar to the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) data for 1&#x02013;3 year old children with rural background, indicating a huge gap in energy intake <xref rid="pone.0061486-National3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-Bhandari1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Several studies have earlier recognized safe and adequate complementary feeding of breast fed infants as a critical factor in preventing growth failure <xref rid="pone.0061486-Bhandari1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-Mora1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. An intervention study conducted by Bhandari et al that evaluated the effect of micronutrient fortified complementary feed and nutrition counseling on growth and morbidity failed to show any effect on linear growth except for a modest effect on weight gain <xref rid="pone.0061486-Bhandari1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The authors speculated lack of effect due to increased inter-current infections in the micronutrient fortified complementary feed group <xref rid="pone.0061486-Bhandari1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Similarly, in our study also diarrhea duration appeared to be playing a significant role in limiting the growth of the children, thus emphasizing the need to provide adequate complementary feeding under hygienic condition.</p><p>The current study was not powered to detect effect of zinc on diarrhea or respiratory morbidities and hence, we could not interpret on the effect of zinc on episodes of infections.</p><p>The compliance to supplementation in our study was similar to the Pemba study <xref rid="pone.0061486-Sazawal1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, where the duration of effective supplementation was 484.7 days (SD 306.6) out of the total supplementation duration of around 1000 days.</p><p>Optimal energy is essential for full growth potential. As stated earlier, the NNMB data for rural Indian children of 1&#x02013;3 years of age shows 719 cal/day against the RDA of around 1200 calories for 1&#x02013;3 year old children <xref rid="pone.0061486-National3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Inadequate calorie intake in the present study must have marred any primary growth promoting effect of zinc in the children. In addition, riboflavin, which was used as a placebo, is known to facilitate the absorption of minerals through cellular transport in gastrointestinal tract resulting in increased absorption of zinc and iron <xref rid="pone.0061486-Agte1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-Sandstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Any enhanced fractional absorption of zinc in control children by riboflavin in the present study might have nullified the effect of zinc in the intervention group <xref rid="pone.0061486-Agte1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-Sandstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061486-Powers1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Yet another reason for lack of growth promoting effect of zinc could have been due to prompt treatment of infections. Children in the current study were regularly monitored and all the inter-current infections were promptly treated. As one of the effects of zinc on growth is through prevention/reduction of morbidity, prompt treatment of inter-current infections in both the groups might have masked any effect of zinc on growth <xref rid="pone.0061486-Bhandari1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Nevertheless, we believe that the strengths of this study lie in the setting and design. The study was a large double blind, population-based prospective study with an age and sex-matched control group. Moreover, the population studied is representative of majority of children in India, thus making the results generalizable.</p><p>In a nutshell, it can be safely concluded that most breast fed infants in relatively poor communities are inadequately fed and in such a scenario, a single micronutrient supplementation, such as zinc, without sufficient calories will not have any impact on the growth potential of the children. It is sad to note that a majority of urban dwelling children have poor growth spurt throughout the first 2 years of life. In such a situation, intervention through food supplementation is the need of the hour for women in the low socioeconomic urban community. This should begin from pre-conception and must be continued throughout pregnancy to postnatal periods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0061486.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
