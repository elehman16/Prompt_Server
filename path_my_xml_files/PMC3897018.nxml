The SA group received 3 cc of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine (15 mg), at L3&#x02013;L4 interspace intrathecally and also 2 mic/kg fentanyl and 0.15 mg/kg morphine intravenously for intraoperative analgesia.

The purpose of this study was to answer a simple question frequency asked by patients and also by some health provider: Which anesthesia (spinal or general) is the best for the surgery?</p><p>And which one has the less postoperative pain scores?</p><p>This study showed that SA with hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% is only superior to the GA for reducing pain intensity and analgesia requirement and number of demands of supplemental morphine in the first 4-6 postoperative hour after lower elective abdominal surgery. Mean changes of HR and blood pressure were statistically lower during the operation period and also during the first 6 postoperative hours after that which may revealed to lower pain during that period.</p><p>But after that period until 24 h there were not statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding postoperative pain scores and also postoperative morphine consumption.</p><p>Previous studies were not in accordance with the results of this study. Massicotte and coworker compared SA with GA on morphine requirement and postoperative pain score after abdominal hysterectomy. They concluded that postoperative pain at rest was lower in SA group until the 18<sup>th</sup> h and under stress until 48<sup>th</sup> h. They consumed at least two times less morphine at each time interval than the GA group. But Massicotte and his coworker used intrathecal morphine and fentanyl with local anesthetic which can cause different result on postoperative pain than our study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>In a recent study Kessous <italic>et al</italic>. in a case-controlled study in 153 patients under either SA or GA for cesarean section showed that postoperative meperidine requirements in the first 24 h were significantly higher in the GA than SA and pain scores were graded after 8 h in the GA versus the SA and this reversed at 48 h.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>Eduardo Imelloni and coworker reported the importance of postoperative pain relief in laparoscopic cholecystectomy and concluded that SA was associated with an extremely low level of postoperative pain and better recovery than GA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>In another study, Ganano and coworker concluded that patients in the GA group were admitted to the postanesthesia care unit with a higher pain score and needed more analgesic than patients in the SA group (both <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Wang and coworker in a randomized clinical trial in 60 women scheduled for lower abdominal surgery under GA or SA concluded that postoperative pain after lower abdominal surgery can be significantly decreased if the surgery is performed under SA with 3 ml of hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Their results showed that pain score at rest was significantly lower in the SA group than the GA group 6-24 h after surgery, but our results showed that patients in the SA group had significantly lower scores only at the first 6 h postoperatively and there were no significant differences on postoperative pain scores after 6 h in the two groups and so it is an important finding that needs more researches in this field.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In this study, we assessed the postoperative pain in lower abdominal surgeries in two groups with GA and SA.</p><p>In conclusion, our data suggest that there is no significant difference between the postoperative pain in GA and SA in these patients, and SA with 3 cc hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% do not provide enough pain relief after lower abdominal surgery and supplemental opioids should therefore be given to achieve effective analgesia in the postoperative period.</p><p>The amount of received analgesic had a declining trend in both groups postoperatively. However, 6 h after the surgery in GA group, there was a peak of analgesic requirement. Even this dose is more than the first dose after discharging from post operative care unit. The reason is not properly clear, but it seems that the inflammatory reactions due to anesthetic's medicines and surgery are responsible.</p><p>Finally, we suggest similar studies to compare the type of anesthesia in other type of surgeries, and on the other hand as acute pain management in patients with preoperative narcotic dependency or acute opioid tolerance is challenging so their postoperative pain require further studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We would like to express our gratitude to all those who gave us the possibility to complete this
