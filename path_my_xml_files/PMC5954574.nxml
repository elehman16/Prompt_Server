often categorized as mild. Clinicians usually treat these infections with
antimicrobial therapy, often applied topically. Some experts, however,
believe that mild diabetic foot ulcer infections will usually heal with
local wound care alone, without antimicrobial therapy or dressings.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2050312118773950"><title>Methods:</title><p>To evaluate the potential benefit of treatment with a topical antibiotic, we
performed a single-center, investigator-blinded pilot study, randomizing
(1:1) adult patients with a mild diabetic foot ulcer infection to treatment
with a gentamicin&#x02013;collagen sponge with local care versus local care alone.
Systemic antibiotic agents were prohibited.</p></sec><sec id="section3-2050312118773950"><title>Results:</title><p>We enrolled a total of 22 patients, 11 in the gentamicin&#x02013;collagen sponge arm
and 11 in the control arm. Overall, at end of therapy, 20 (91%) patients
were categorized as achieving clinical cure of infection, and 2 (9%) as
significant improvement. At the final study visit, only 12 (56%) of all
patients achieved microbiological eradication of all pathogens. There was no
difference in either clinical or microbiological outcomes in those who did
or did not receive the gentamicin&#x02013;collagen sponge, which was very well
tolerated.</p></sec><sec id="section4-2050312118773950"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The results of this pilot trial suggest that topical antibiotic therapy with

While all DFUIs require local wound care, many clinicians also prescribe
antimicrobial therapy. Some experts, however, believe that mild wound infections
usually resolve with local care alone.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2050312118773950" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-2050312118773950" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr5-2050312118773950" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> This may have several benefits,

examine the potential benefits of treatment of mild DFUI without systemic antibiotic
therapy, using only the gentamicin&#x02013;collagen sponge (and local care) versus local
care alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section6-2050312118773950"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section7-2050312118773950"><title>Objectives and sample size considerations</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded, pilot
single-center study. This pilot study was a side study of a larger similar
randomized trial for moderate and severe DFUI involving systemic antibiotics
(ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01951768). As we did a pilot and a side study, we decided
not to register separately. In this preliminary pilot study, we intended to test
(a) whether mild DFUIs can be cured by local professional care alone and (b)
whether a topical antibiotic (gentamicin) would enhance wound healing. If there
would be a clear difference in favor of gentamicin, a much larger randomized
trial would follow as we conduct it for moderate and severe DFUIs.</p><p>Because of the pilot nature in a mostly unpublished area of research, the
inferior margins were set very largely. Moreover, according to our clinical
experience, most patients with moderate DFUI would be hospitalized, whereas many
patients with mild DFUIs would be treated in the office of the General
Practitioner or at home. Therefore, we expected a smaller recruitment potential
for mild DFUIs. We finally estimated, based on clinical experience, that the
expected cure rate would be 30% on the placebo arm and 75% in the treatment arm.
The necessary sample size for a superiority trial in favor of the treatment arm
in 1:1 randomization is 23 patients in each arm (power 80%, alpha 0.05). Using a
blinded allocation scheme with unmarked envelopes, we randomized patients 1:1 to
either: (a) daily topical application on the wound of a gentamicin sponge
(Innocoll Pharmaceuticals Ltd) or (b) covering of the wound with a plain gauze
sponge without gentamicin.</p></sec><sec id="section8-2050312118773950"><title>Definitions and study criteria</title><p>We enrolled patients based on the criteria of the Infectious Diseases Society of
America (IDSA) foot infection guidelines.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2050312118773950" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Briefly, a mild DFUI was defined as follows: having &#x02265;2 manifestations of
inflammation (erythema, pain, tenderness, warmth, or induration) or purulence;
any erythema present extended &#x0003c;2&#x02009;cm around the ulcer; the local infection was
limited to skin or superficial subcutaneous tissues; and, there are no signs or
symptoms of systemic infection. A patient was eligible for study participation
if he or she met the following criteria: aged &#x02265;18&#x02009;years; has a diagnosis of
diabetes mellitus; has an open wound of &#x02265;1&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup> located below the
malleolus that has findings of infection (defined above); has undergone (or soon
will be) any appropriate surgical intervention needed to remove necrotic and
infected tissue; and, if female, is non-pregnant and non-lactating. The
exclusion criteria were the presence of a DFUI associated with any type of
implant or foreign material; peripheral arterial insufficiency requiring
revascularization after enrollment; a moderate or severe DFUI<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2050312118773950" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>; severe immune-suppression; extensive necrosis requiring amputation;
residual osteomyelitis (after any resection); a requirement for any systemic
antibiotic therapy; a history of myasthenia gravis or epilepsy, precluding
gentamicin use; or recent alcohol or substance abuse.</p></sec><sec id="section9-2050312118773950"><title>Study conduct</title><p>Innocoll Ltd provided the gentamicin&#x02013;collagen sponges, which are commercially
available in Switzerland under the trade name GARAMYCIN<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Sponge.
Standard wound care for patients in both study arms included the following:
sharp debridement (at presentation, during hospitalization, or at clinic
visits); daily dressing changes (0.9% saline for those not treated with the
gentamicin&#x02013;collagen sponge); optimization of glycemic control. If the wound was
visually dirty or contaminated by debris, specialized wound nurses cleansed the
wound with water before debridement and microbiological tissue sampling. Our
podiatry specialist (C.P.) supervised the pressure offloading and professional
wound care for all enrolled patients. He chose the offloading device according
to his experience and the scheduled compliance and co-morbidities of the
patients, before randomization to the study. These various offloading devices
were mostly offloading boots and casts, with or without individual adaptation.
Enrolled patients could not be treated with any systemic antibiotic agent for
any reason; other antiseptics or topical antibiotics (other than the gentamicin
sponge) for their DFUI; hyperbaric oxygen therapy; or vacuum-assisted
negative-pressure devices. The patients could undergo any needed limb
revascularization and partial amputation before they started in the study.</p><p>We treated the study patients for 14&#x02009;days (unless the ulcer completely closed
before day 14). Overall, the patients had seven study visits (days 1, 2, 5, 9,
14, 20, 24 (+/&#x02212; 2&#x02009;days)) over approximately 24&#x02009;days, during which they underwent
standardized safety and efficacy assessments. The test-of-cure visit was planned
to be approximately 10&#x02009;days after treatment was discontinued. We defined &#x0201c;cure&#x0201d;
as the absence of any clinical, laboratory, or imaging evidence of the original
infection. We defined &#x0201c;improved&#x0201d; as resolution of most, but not all, of the
original findings of infection, but no need for further therapy. We collected
soft tissue specimens for cultures from the target DFUI (by curettage or biopsy,
but not swab) at baseline and at the final visit (if there was still an open
ulcer) and noted whether or not the baseline pathogens were eradicated. We used
a custom-made tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/2050312118773950">Appendix 1</ext-link>) to describe the wound&#x02019;s evolution during treatment,
which summed up the various elements in a single score. This score (taking into
account inflammatory parameters such as induration, pus, and pain) is more
suitable to describe the evolution of a wound infection than the mere wound
size. At each study visit, the investigators inquired about any adverse events,
especially local wound irritation and ototoxicity. The local Ethics Committee
approved this study (CER 13-178) and all patients provided informed consent. We
also used a custom made scoring system (Consort checklist) available on the
Journal&#x02019;s website. All data are collected in our center.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section10-2050312118773950"><title>Results</title><sec id="section11-2050312118773950"><title>Patients</title><p>Between August 2014 and June 2015, we screened patients with 375 DFUI episodes.

The published literature on the use of topical antimicrobial agents for infected
ulcers is limited, and of generally low quality.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2050312118773950" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="bibr8-2050312118773950" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr9-2050312118773950" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The lack of a strong evidence
base for treatment decisions is supported by the results of a recent Cochrane
systematic review and meta-analysis that concluded that evaluations of topical
antimicrobials for diabetic foot ulcers were limited to a few poorly designed trials.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2050312118773950" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Landsman et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2050312118773950" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> conducted a three-arm randomized trial of the efficacy of topical Microcyn
Rx<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> irrigation (Oculus Innovative Sciences, Inc, a superoxidized
solution) versus oral levofloxacin versus levofloxacin plus Microcyn Rx in mild
DFUIs. The clinical success was higher in the Microcyn Rx alone group (75%) than in
the levofloxacin (57%) or in the combined (64%) groups, suggesting that treatment
with a topical agent might be similar (or even superior) to a systemic antibiotic.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2050312118773950" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In a prospective trial, Chu et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2050312118773950" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> randomized patients with a diabetic foot infection whose signs and symptoms
had resolved into one of two groups&#x02013;either continuing with or discontinuing systemic
antibiotic treatment. For mild infections, they found that the outcome was similar,
suggesting a less than expected efficacy of systemic antibiotics. Of note, in these
studies neither treatment with a systemic antibiotic nor a topical antimicrobial
agent compared to local wound care alone, or a placebo.</p><p>Our study has two important limitations. First, the sample size is small. We planned
to enroll more patients, but terminated this pilot study early (after enrolling a
total of 24 episodes instead of the planned 46) because it was more difficult than
we expected to find eligible cases that met our enrollment criteria. We performed an
interim analysis, which suggested the two treatments were equivalent; thus,
continuation of the study with further enrollment was unlikely to demonstrate a
significant difference between the study groups. We found, as have others,<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2050312118773950" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> that catching patients with a mild DFUI is difficult, as this represents a
relatively brief moment in time in the transition from clinically uninfected to
moderate or severe infection. Second, we specifically wished to enroll only patients
with a mild DFUI, as this is the group that might be treated with topical
antimicrobial therapy alone, without the need for systemic antibiotics. This
contrasts with our previous study, in which we enrolled patients with moderate DFUI,
where the gentamicin sponge combined with systemic antibiotic therapy revealed a
higher proportion of cure and pathogen eradication.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2050312118773950" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> To further assess our findings, we are currently performing a second study in
which we are combining a gentamicin-collagen sponge with systemic antibiotic therapy
for moderate to severely infected diabetic foot ulcers.</p><p>In conclusion, our small, but randomized prospective pilot trial appears to reveal
two important messages that are new in the literature. First, mildly infected
diabetic foot ulcers may be successfully treated by local care alone. Secondly,
adding topical treatment with gentamicin, an antibiotic with a large spectrum
activity against many pathogens, may not improve the healing of mildly infected
diabetic foot ulcers. We believe, however, that a larger trial would be useful and
feasible. If the results of the current trial are similar to those in other trials,
these data might lead to withholding topical gentamicin; this could help avoid
ineffective use of an antibiotic for a ubiquitous and burdensome health problem.
Based on our results, we decided to stop the use of topical antibiotics for all
types of infected wounds for patients treated in our service.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="section14-2050312118773950" specific-use="figshare"><title>Supplemental Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="suppl1-2050312118773950"><caption><title>Appendix_1 &#x02013; Supplemental material for A randomized controlled trial of
