However, conducting these trials can be challenging due to many methodological barriers, including the difficulties associated with patient ascertainment.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Clinical trials have shown that the early initiation of treatment with interferon beta-1b (IFNB1b; Betaferon/Betaseron; Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals) can improve outcomes for patients with MS. The BENEFIT (BEtaferon/BEtaseron in Newly Emerging MS For Initial Treatment) study examined the impact of IFNB1b in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). In this trial, early IFNB1b treatment reduced the number of patients progressing to clinically definite MS (CDMS) compared with placebo after 3&#x02005;years (37% vs 51%, hazard ratios (HR) 0.59) and 5&#x02005;years (46% vs 57%, HR 0.63).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

Patients completed the placebo-controlled phase when CDMS was diagnosed using Poser criteria<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> or after 2&#x02005;years in the study (whichever came first) and were then eligible to enter the open-label, single-arm, follow-up study for up to 5&#x02005;years during which all patients were offered IFNB1b, but could also opt to take other or no medication. Blinding of the initial randomisation was maintained throughout the 5-year period.

Physicians recorded any medications for MS that were administered. Prior to the end of the BENEFIT Extension study, the steering committee identified a list of therapies that were defined as DMTs. Of this list, a subset was considered as escalation therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JNNP2013306222F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="JNNP2013306222F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Proportion of patients requiring escalation therapy pooled across total population.

All variables were analysed by descriptive statistical methods. Efficacy was analysed in three domains: relapse-based, disability-based and patient-reported outcome-based variables (see online supplemental appendix 2). Most variables in the first domain were time-to-event variables described by Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimates, and treatment groups were compared by a log-rank test and proportional hazards regression (covariates: randomised treatment, steroid use during the first clinical event, type of disease onset and categorised number of T2 lesions on BENEFIT screening MRI). The variables in the last two domains were mainly analysed using non-parametric and/or parametric longitudinal modelling. Predefined statistical modelling procedures were used to estimate treatment effects and explore the relationship of target variables to treatment and prognostic covariates. Use of DMTs was analysed by descriptive statistical methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Role of the funding source</title><p>The study was designed by members of the steering committee and the study sponsor.

For 363 patients (77.6%), IFNB1b was the only DMT recorded at any time. More than half the patients (55.6%) in the overall study population were still on IFNB1b within the 90-day period before their last study day. Other DMTs administered at some point over the 8-year observation period included interferon beta-1a (Avonex, Biogen Idec; 28 patients (6.0%), MRT 19.0%) and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone, Teva Neuroscience; 27 patients (5.8%), MRT 23.8%). In the delayed treatment arm, the length of placebo exposure was a minimum of 1&#x02005;month and a median of 23.0&#x02005;months (mean 17.5&#x02005;months). Only 24 patients (5.1%) received no DMT.

Almost all SAEs were reported to be unrelated to IFNB1b, as assessed by the investigators.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this observational extension of the BENEFIT trial, patient ascertainment remained modestly high after 8&#x02005;years with little difference in baseline characteristics when participating patients were compared with those not entering the extension. Overall, patients in both the early and the delayed treatment groups who entered the BENEFIT Extension tended to have had more active disease during the double-blind study, as depicted by higher rates of CDMS and McDonald MS. This would be expected to reduce the differences between treatment groups. However, significant differences between early and delayed treatment were still observed.</p><p>Patients who received early treatment had a lower risk of conversion to CDMS, lower ARR and longer time to recurrent relapses than those who received delayed treatment, differences that persisted throughout the study. After 8&#x02005;years, 51.9% (45.5% by Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimates) of the patients who received early treatment in BENEFIT had not converted to CDMS, which contrasts with the subgroup of the CIS cohort reported by Fisniku <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> with &#x02265;1 clinically silent MRI lesion at screening in which only 17% had not converted to CDMS after 9.7&#x02005;years. Although the differences in outcomes appear to be mainly driven by treatment effects that emerged in the first year of the BENEFIT study and would be expected to dissipate as patients in the delayed treatment arm accumulated more time on IFNB1b, earlier treatment seemed to have continued benefits over the long term. For example, although differences in ARR across treatment groups were mainly driven by treatment effects in the first year of the study, a significant difference between treatment arms was still found across years 3&#x02013;8, which might indicate a prolonged benefit due to an immunomodulatory shift that cannot be recovered in the delayed treatment group.</p><p>Early treatment also appeared to provide some cognitive benefits although some longitudinal variation in PASAT scores was observed, potentially due to practice effects and changes in the study population over time. The improved cognitive performance in patients who underwent early treatment was consistent with earlier analyses from BENEFIT.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> PASAT results suggest that minimising inflammation through treatment with IFNB1b in the early stages of the disease may preserve cognitive capacity of patients with MS.</p><p>By contrast with these endpoints where the treatment arms displayed differences, EDSS, MSFC total z-score, time to first escalation therapy, FAMS-TOI and EQ-5D scores did not differ between the groups, but generally showed little change over the course of the study. In general, disease activity remained low for most patients over the 8-year period of the study in both groups. Median EDSS scores at year 8 were 1.5 and only 13.7% of patients participating in the Extension study reached sustained EDSS 3 at any time during the 8-year period. For comparison, in a natural history cohort of patients with relapsing-remitting MS published by Scalfari <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, and in a more contemporary partially treated cohort reported by Leray <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> (with a mean time between clinical onset and treatment start of 7.4&#x02005;years), the median time to sustained EDSS 3 was 10&#x02005;years from disease onset.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The number of patients in BENEFIT reaching EDSS 3 thus seems smaller than could be expected, suggesting an impact of early treatment on disability progression. The observed long-term disease stability was also reflected in the low number of patients requiring escalation therapy in both arms. NAb status measured at the last visit of the interventional trial period did not result in any discernible differences in clinical outcomes. Patients who were NAb&#x02212; at that time would be unlikely to have converted to NAb+ in the extension study.</p><p>Although the terms <italic>early</italic> and <italic>delayed</italic> treatment have been applied to the different treatment groups in this analysis of the BENEFIT study, it should be noted that both groups of patients started treatment within the first 2&#x02005;years from CIS (eg, relatively early in the course of their disease). Consequently, there were only minor differences in treatment exposure between these groups. Despite the relatively small difference in time on treatment, benefits of early treatment on ARR and disease conversion were observed with up to 8.7&#x02005;years of follow-up.</p><p>Long-term retention in BENEFIT was relatively high, supporting the generally favourable tolerability of treatment with IFNB1b. No new safety signals were detected. FAMS-TOI and EQ-5D scores were relatively high and stable during the 8&#x02005;years of follow-up, suggesting that medication allowed the majority of patients to maintain QoL.</p><p>The findings from this study are largely in agreement with those of the Controlled High Risk Avonex MS Prevention Study in Ongoing Neurological Surveillance (CHAMPIONS) study of the efficacy of intramuscular interferon beta-1a for patients with a CIS.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> With long-term follow-up (8&#x02005;years in BENEFIT, 10&#x02005;years in CHAMPIONS) both trials reported comparable effects of early treatment on rates of CDMS progression and ARR, with most patients also showing little or no EDSS progression. However, there were some methodological differences between CHAMPIONS and BENEFIT, including differences in the length of blinding and preplanned follow-up (3 vs 5&#x02005;years in both cases).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Additionally, the BENEFIT population was slightly different from the CHAMPIONS population, all of whom were treated with corticosteroids at CIS (vs 70.9% in BENEFIT), and who tended to be older (median of 34 vs 30&#x02005;years at baseline in BENEFIT).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>

Compared with other studies of CIS,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> ascertainment in the BENEFIT Extension study was relatively high. Additionally, differences in baseline characteristics were minimal, suggesting limited selection bias. By contrast, on-study outcomes after 5&#x02005;years showed that patients with more active disease entered the extension, which may have led to an overestimation of disease progression in the delayed treatment and early treatment groups. Finally, varying treatments, drug holidays and lack of adherence during the observational phase should have lessened any treatment effects and biased the results toward the null hypothesis of no difference between treatment groups. Despite this possibility, a consistent benefit of early treatment was identified.</p><p>This extension study showed a low overall disease activity and progression rate in patients with CIS. Regarding conversion to CDMS and relapse frequency, early treatment retained significant benefits as compared with delayed treatment. These findings and the benign long-term safety profile of IFNB1b, support the early initiation of such treatment in patients with CIS. The observed low EDSS progression and relapse rates in BENEFIT&#x02014;both regarded as positive long-term predictors<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02014;give hope that early treatment might have a positive influence on long-term outcomes beyond the first 8&#x02005;years of treatment. In order to better understand the chronic course of this disease, we remain committed to continued follow-up of this patient cohort, including further assessment of imaging outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jnnp-2013-306222-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1132" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the patients and the BENEFIT investigators for their continuing contributions to the study.
