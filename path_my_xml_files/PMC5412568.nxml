The mechanism involves trans-dimerization between GTPase heads and a favorable crossover conformational shift, catalyzed by GTP hydrolysis, that converts the dimer from a &#x0201c;prefusion&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;postfusion&#x0201d; state. However, whether crossover formation actually energizes fusion remains unclear, as do the sequence of events surrounding it. Here, we made mutations in atlastin to selectively destabilize the crossover conformation and used fluorescence-based kinetic assays to analyze the variants. All variants underwent dimerization and crossover concurrently, and at wild-type rates. However, certain variants were unstable once in the crossover dimer conformation, and crossover dimer stability closely paralleled lipid-mixing activity. Tethering, however, appeared to be unimpaired in all mutant variants. The results suggest that tethering and lipid mixing are catalyzed concurrently by GTP hydrolysis but that the energy requirement for lipid mixing exceeds that for tethering, and the full energy released through crossover formation is necessary for fusion.</p></abstract><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="sp1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">R01GM107285</award-id><award-id rid="sp1">R01GM107285-02S1</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s01"><title>Introduction</title><p>The substantial energy barriers that prevent spontaneous lipid bilayer fusion allow for the formation and maintenance of distinct subcellular compartments in eukaryotic cells. However, controlled fusion of these compartments must also regularly occur and so cells maintain several fusion catalysts that overcome these barriers. Fusion catalysts are typically integral membrane proteins that induce fusion by promoting the close apposition of opposing membrane bilayers and destabilizing the bilayers sufficiently to favor formation of the nonbilayer intermediates necessary for lipid mixing and membrane merger (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Tamm et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cohen and Melikyan, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Frolov and Zimmerberg, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kozlov et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Currently, the two best-understood types of fusion catalysts are the viral fusion proteins, which mediate fusion between viral and host cell membranes during viral entry (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Skehel and Wiley, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Eckert and Kim, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Weissenhorn et al., 2007</xref>), and the SNARE (soluble <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-maleimide&#x02013;sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor) proteins, which mediate vesicle trafficking within the secretory and endocytic pathways (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Scheller, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000fc;dhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>). Initially, viral fusion proteins reside solely in the viral membrane but then undergo a conformational rearrangement to insert into the host membrane, thus spanning the two membranes. In contrast, SNARE fusion begins with two separate entities each stably bound to the vesicle and target, with initial trans contacts forming a complex that spans both membranes. At first glance, these two evolutionarily unrelated types of fusion catalysts appear to use differing strategies. However, after initial contact, close mechanistic parallels can be drawn (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000f6;llner, 2004</xref>). Both undergo a series of highly favorable conformational rearrangements (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Skehel and Wiley, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Scheller, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Eckert and Kim, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Weissenhorn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000fc;dhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>), whose energy is estimated sufficient to overcome the 40&#x02013;50 k<sub>B</sub>T energy barriers that hinder spontaneous membrane fusion (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Carr et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kuzmin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Fasshauer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Markin and Albanesi, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Yersin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cohen and Melikyan, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). By the end, each reaches a final stable conformation that can only exist in postfusion membranes (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Weissenhorn et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Stein et al., 2009</xref>). In both of these cases, the driving force for membrane fusion comes from the highly favorable protein&#x02013;protein interactions that convert the catalyst from a &#x0201c;prefusion&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;postfusion&#x0201d; state.</p><p>In the past several years, a new type of fusion protein has come under increasing study: the dynamin-related integral membrane protein atlastin responsible for the homotypic fusion of ER membranes (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Park and Blackstone, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">McNew et al., 2013</xref>). Structurally, atlastin is distinct from either of the previously studied fusion proteins. At the N terminus, it contains a globular GTPase head domain that directly couples GTP hydrolysis to fusion activity (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Orso et al., 2009</xref>). The GTPase head, also likely the site of initial trans contacts between atlastin dimers on opposing ER membranes, is connected via a short linker to a fully folded three-helix bundle (3HB; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes and Sondermann, 2011</xref>), which is in turn anchored to the ER membrane by two closely spaced trans-membrane (TM) helices. Emerging from the membrane is a C-terminal tail containing an amphipathic helix with a propensity to insert into the lipid bilayer (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Faust et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Atlastin also appears to undergo highly favorable structural rearrangements between what have been termed pre- and postfusion conformations by analogy to previously studied fusion catalysts. In the so-called prefusion state, observed in the form 2 crystal structure of human atlastin1 (hATL1), two atlastin monomers interact in a head-to-head fashion with the 3HBs packed against their respective heads and pointed away from the dimer interface (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes and Sondermann, 2011</xref>). With an interfacial binding area of only 756 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, this extended dimer conformation could represent an initial encounter complex between atlastins in opposing membranes. A similar head-to-head configuration is present in the so-called postfusion state observed in the form 3 hATL1 crystal structure, though the interfacial area between heads (1,886 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>) is more than twice that in the form 2 prefusion dimer (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes et al., 2013</xref>). A more dramatic difference in the postfusion state is that the 3HBs have been dislodged from their respective heads and are crossed over one another and with respect to the heads, having undergone a rigid body rotation about a central conserved proline residue in the linker. In the postfusion state, the close parallel alignment between 3HBs and the additional new contacts formed between the 3HBs and opposing heads creates a highly stable crossover dimer configuration with a substantial total interfacial binding area of 3,852 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes and Sondermann, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes et al., 2013</xref>). Though the TM domains are not present in the structures, it is hard to envision how the two molecules could adopt the postfusion conformation while remaining in separate membranes (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes and Sondermann, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>With their focus on the similarities with other fusion proteins, initial models for atlastin-catalyzed fusion had formation of the crossover conformer as the most likely source of energy for overcoming the barriers to fusion (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Daumke and Praefcke, 2011</xref>). In those models, atlastin monomers were typically depicted to encounter one another in trans in the GTP-bound state. Thereafter, hydrolysis of the GTP would induce a series of conformational changes that would not only tighten the head-to-head binding interface but also cause expulsion of the 3HBs from their respective heads. The 3HBs, now unconstrained, would be free to undergo a rigid body rotation culminating in formation of the crossover state (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes et al., 2013</xref>), which would drive lipid mixing and fusion.</p><p>Additional studies, however, reveal further complexity to the fusion mechanism. A peptide that corresponds to the atlastin tail amphipathic helix inserts into membranes and destabilizes the bilayer, whereas mutations in atlastin that inhibit this insertion block lipid mixing, showing that the tail is critically involved in the fusion process (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Moss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Faust et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, even conservative amino acid substitutions in the TM domain block lipid mixing, though the underlying cause is not known (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, kinetic analysis of GTP-catalyzed conformational changes within the soluble domain of hATL1 has suggested head-to-head dimerization and crossover to be catalyzed concurrently by GTP hydrolysis (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes et al., 2013</xref>). Collectively, these observations have been interpreted through a different type of model in which atlastins on opposing membranes come together essentially already in a crossover-like state, with the crossover conformation serving as an initial tethering unit holding opposing membranes closely together, whereas subsequent membrane insertion of the tail amphipathic helix in conjunction with the TM domains carry out the work of membrane fusion (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes et al., 2013</xref>). In this alternate model, the energy released on crossover formation might play a less critical role in fusion catalysis.</p><p>Here, we set out to test the importance of atlastin&#x02019;s crossover conformation for membrane fusion. We reasoned that if the binding energy of the crossover conformation plays a critical role in fusion catalysis, then atlastin&#x02019;s fusion capacity should be exquisitely sensitive to progressive reductions in that binding energy. As a test, we generated a panel of localized point mutations within atlastin that might variably reduce, but not abolish, the stability of the crossover conformation. The effects of these mutations on crossover were assessed kinetically and their effects on atlastin&#x02019;s tethering and fusion activity determined. All mutant variants underwent crossover at rates indistinguishable from the wild type. On the other hand, crossover dimer stability differed widely among mutant variants, with the reduction in dimer stability closely paralleling the reduction in fusion activity, demonstrating for the first time the close coupling between the binding energy of the crossover conformation and fusion. Additionally, we observed concurrent head-to-head dimerization and crossover, confirming that tethering and fusion are triggered simultaneously by GTP hydrolysis (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes et al., 2013</xref>). However, tethering was not noticeably impaired by destabilization of the crossover dimer, indicating a lower energy barrier for tethering than for fusion. Finally, the GTPase reaction rate was sensitive to the concentration of atlastin, consistent with the hydrolysis cycle depending, in some way, on dimerization. Together, the results are consistent with a model of the atlastin fusion mechanism in which GTP hydrolysis within the trans dimer triggers the concerted formation of a tightly bound crossover dimer state. If the energy released through formation of this postfusion state is sufficient to mix the lipid bilayers, then fusion ensues; otherwise, the reaction does not progress beyond tethering.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s02"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>Validation of a PIFE assay for crossover</title><p>Assays for atlastin crossover have largely been based on the close proximity and parallel alignment of the 3HBs occurring exclusively in the crossover conformation (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Morin-Leisk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Saini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). We previously engineered a cysteine residue (G343C) in the 3HB of the soluble domain (aa 1&#x02013;415) of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> atlastin cytoplasmic domain (cytoDATL), and as anticipated based on the proximity of the 3HBs in the form3 hATL1 postfusion crystal structure (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes et al., 2013</xref>), a homobifunctional cross-linker with a short 8 &#x000c5; spacer arm conjugated two 3HBs only under conditions of crossover (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Morin-Leisk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Saini et al., 2014</xref>). More recently, F&#x000f6;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fused C-terminally to the 3HB of the hATL1 soluble domain (cyto-hATL1 CFP/YFP) has been used to establish the kinetics of crossover under stopped flow conditions (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes et al., 2013</xref>). Here, as an alternate to the CFP/YFP sensors, we adapted a method termed protein-induced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE). PIFE, used previously to monitor DNA&#x02013;protein interactions, takes advantage of the environmental sensitivity of the Cy3 fluorophore (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mujumdar et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Gruber et al., 2000</xref>). When DNA within 0&#x02013;4 nm of a protein-binding site is conjugated with Cy3, nearby protein binding reduces the torsional mobility of the Cy3, resulting in distance-dependent fluorescence enhancement (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hwang et al., 2011</xref>). When conjugated to G343C of cytoDATL, Cy3 underwent an &#x0223c;20% fluorescence enhancement under conditions leading to crossover, as schematized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>PIFE assay for crossover.</bold> (A) A schematic of Cy3 fluorescence enhancement as a cytoDATL monomer labeled with Cy3 on an engineered G343C residue in the 3HB (i) undergoes dimerization and crossover (ii).

WT, wild type.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_201609071_Fig1"/></fig><p>As PIFE had not been used previously to monitor crossover, it was important to validate that it works as expected based on previous data. A robust fluorescence enhancement was seen after mixing Cy3-cytoDATL with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue GMPPNP, but not GDP or buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The time to maximal enhancement (t<sub>1/2</sub> &#x0223c;50 s) was nearly identical to that previously observed for cyto-hATL1-CFP/YFP by FRET (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes et al., 2013</xref>). When R48E, a mutation that abrogates nucleotide binding (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes and Sondermann, 2011</xref>), was tested under the same conditions, no enhanced signal was observed with any nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>), indicating that crossover, as reflected in the PIFE signal, was induced specifically by GMPPNP binding. Furthermore, as observed previously for cyto-hATL1 CFP/YFP (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes et al., 2013</xref>), GTP gave a profound 100-fold acceleration of crossover over that seen with GMPPNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Thus, PIFE recapitulated key aspects of atlastin crossover and corroborated an earlier study that GTP binding, and hydrolysis in particular, catalyzes atlastin crossover (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Previous work in our laboratory identified two charged residues important for crossover: K320 and E328 (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Morin-Leisk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Saini et al., 2014</xref>). These residues, conserved between DATL and human atlastins, are at the heart of the crossover dimer and participate in an intramolecular salt bridge in the postfusion conformation. We previously showed that the reversal of charge at either residue in cytoDATL (K320E or E328R) disrupts both crossover and fusion without diminishing steady-state GTPase activity (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Morin-Leisk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Saini et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the compensatory double-charge reversal mutation (K320E, E328R), predicted to restore charge attraction, appeared to fully restore crossover according to cross-linking assays (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Morin-Leisk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Saini et al., 2014</xref>), yet it only partially restored fusion activity (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Saini et al., 2014</xref>). To test if PIFE might offer a more sensitive test for crossover and reveal a mild defect still present in the double-mutant variant, we compared GMPPNP-induced PIFE in wild-type, single-mutant (K320E), and double-mutant (K320E, E328R) variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). As anticipated, the single-mutant variant was strongly impaired, whereas crossover was largely restored in the double-mutant variant. However, a modest defect in crossover, not previously seen with cross-linking, was still observed in the double-mutant variant, with the PIFE signal not yet reaching its maximal value well after the wild-type signal had plateaued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that PIFE could be a powerful tool for detecting subtle defects in atlastin crossover.</p></sec><sec id="s04"><title>Variable disruption of crossover</title><p>We next set out to create a panel of atlastin mutant variants with variable disruptions to the crossover state. In addition to being part of a salt bridge, K320 in the crossover dimer is at the heart of a highly spatially restricted bend in the linker between the GTPase head and the 3HB (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes et al., 2013</xref>), making it an ideal focal point for additional mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Further, K320E shows no loss of steady-state GTPase activity despite being defective in both crossover and fusion (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Saini et al., 2014</xref>), making it an ideal residue to target the crossover conformation specifically. Finally, though we had shown that the creation of charge repulsion with the nearby E328 rendered the charge reversal of this residue (K320E) incapacitating for fusion (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Saini et al., 2014</xref>), we found, surprisingly, that the salt bridge, by itself, was nonessential for fusion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Reasoning that a variety of uncharged amino acid substitutions of this residue may provide a range of defects possibly milder than K320E, K320 was replaced with T, M, G, or N. We also included the previously partially characterized P317G variant (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Saini et al., 2014</xref>) because of both the proximity of the conserved P317 residue to K320 and its unique position as the pivot point of 3HB rotation during crossover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). As anticipated based on previous GTPase assays of K320E and P317G (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Saini et al., 2014</xref>), all variants had steady-state GTPase activity similar to the wild type (Fig. S1).</p><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Mutant variants show no defects in GTP-catalyzed crossover formation.</bold> (A and B, left) The positions of K320 and P317 mutations made to target DATL crossover superimposed onto PyMOL renderings of (A) the hATL1 form2 extended dimer PDB <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="3QOF">3QOF</ext-link> and (B) the hATL1 form3 crossover dimer PDB <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="4IDP">4IDP</ext-link>.

To emphasize the relative rates of crossover across different mutant variants, the data were normalized to a value of 1 for maximum fluorescence and a value of 0 for minimum fluorescence. The kinetics of crossover was unaffected by normalization (see Fig. S2, A for kinetics before normalization and B for kinetics after normalization). To our surprise, when GTP was added to initiate crossover, no significant difference in crossover rate was observed between the wild-type and any mutant variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, left). The main difference between variants was the magnitude of an early downward deflection that preceded the fluorescence enhancement because of crossover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, right). For any given mutant variant, the slope of the downward deflection depended strongly on nucleotide concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>), indicating nucleotide binding as its cause. Based on the proximity of the Cy3-labeled 3HB residue to the GTPase head in the form 2 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>), we suspected that this downward deflection could be caused by a starting Cy3 fluorescence enhancement arising from packing interactions between the 3HB and head (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes et al., 2013</xref>), which is subsequently lost as the position of the 3HB is altered upon nucleotide binding. Based on this reasoning, the differences in the magnitude of downward deflection across mutant variants could be attributed to slight differences in the extent to which the 3HB is initially packed against the head before nucleotide loading.</p><p>The lack of any differences in crossover rates for any of the variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>) implied that none were defective in crossover formation. This was surprising, and we wondered whether defects might be better revealed with GMPPNP, which induces crossover 100-fold more slowly than GTP and showed clear differences between various salt bridge mutant variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). When GMPPNP was used to initiate the reaction, crossover defects were readily apparent for K320N, K320G, and P317G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). In contrast, K320M and K320T showed only a slight or modest defect, respectively. We concluded that some, but not all, of the targeted mutant variants had a defect in either forming or maintaining the crossover state. Given that the defect was evident only during the apparent slow approach to equilibrium induced by GMPPNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>), we suspected that the main defect in these variants might lie less in the formation and more in the maintenance of the crossover conformation.</p><fig id="fig3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Mutant variants show defects in GMPPNP-induced crossover.</bold> (A) Normalized PIFE (<italic>n</italic> = 3 replicates, &#x000b1;SEM) over time when each of the indicated Cy3-cytoDATL variants is mixed with GMPPNP.

To increase the time resolution of the assay, the time of incubation with cross-linker was drastically shortened, from 30 min to 20 s. Additionally, we took advantage of the availability of cysteine reactive cross-linkers of longer lengths to probe for the possibility of more loosely crossed-over conformations, if present. After incubating each variant for either 60 s or 60 min in the presence of GMPPNP, either BMOE, with an 8 &#x000c5; spacer arm, or methanethiosulfonate (MTS17), with a 24 &#x000c5; spacer arm (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Loo and Clarke, 2001</xref>), was used to capture dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>).

Similar results were obtained with both short (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>) and long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>) cross-linkers, indicating the absence of another discrete, loosely crossed over intermediate en route to full crossover.

To assess crossover dimer stability, we used FRET to monitor dimer dissociation rates. FRET between Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 647 on an engineered cysteine on the head of each monomer has been used previously to report on cyto-hATL1 head-to-head dimerization kinetics (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes et al., 2013</xref>), and we adapted the assay here by targeting the equivalent cysteine residue (S270C) in cytoDATL. Alexa Fluor 488&#x02013; and Alexa Fluor 647&#x02013;labeled cytoDATL crossover dimers were first preformed with GMPPNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). The use of the nonhydrolyzable analogue here was necessary to prevent rapid dimer disassembly, which is likely coupled to product release after GTP hydrolysis (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes and Sondermann, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Morin-Leisk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Moss et al., 2011</xref>). A 60-min initial incubation period with GMPPNP was of sufficient length to ensure that all variants, even those slow to reach equilibrium, had attained their maximal extent of crossover as indicated by a plateau in both FRET and PIFE signals (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>, respectively). This was followed by addition of excess unlabeled cytoDATL, which should produce a loss of FRET over time as labeled subunits that dissociate will reform new dimers primarily with unlabeled subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). There was little or no loss of acceptor fluorescence when wild-type crossover dimers were spiked with excess unlabeled wild-type cytoDATL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>) over that seen when spiked with buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>), indicating that wild-type crossover dimers formed with GMPPNP are stable over the course of 2 h. This essential irreversibility contrasted with the relatively rapid turnover seen previously using the alternate nonhydrolyzable analogue GTP&#x003b3;S (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2015</xref>), which may possibly be explained by some hydrolysis of the GTP&#x003b3;S. In contrast to the wild type, K320N, K320G, and P317G, the same variants slow to accumulate in the crossover state with GMPPNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), showed accelerated disassembly over the course of 2 h, indicating a loss of crossover dimer stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>).

The meaning of the differences in amplitude observed with different mutant variants was unclear, as the differences did not correlate with any other parameter; tethering activity and crossover dimer stability appeared to be inversely correlated for certain mutant variant pairs but not for others. Although these data did not rule out a contribution of the crossover binding energy toward tethering, they favored a model in which the energy required for fusion far exceeds that required for tethering, and crossover contributes a more important driving force for fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s09"><title>Hydrolysis catalyzes simultaneous dimerization and crossover</title><p>Having established a major role for the crossover dimer conformation for fusion catalysis, we next set out to unravel the sequence of events surrounding crossover formation.

However, an alternative interpretation was that atlastins first encounter one another in the GTP-bound state, whereupon hydrolysis is rapidly triggered to catalyze crossover dimer formation. If the initial interaction between GTP-bound heads were the rate-limiting step in the reaction cycle and subsequent steps ensue rapidly, then head-to-head dimerization and crossover formation would appear synchronous as observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, A and B</xref>). Dimerization-dependent hydrolysis of GTP has not been previously reported for atlastins. However, it has been established for human guanylate-binding protein 1 (hGBP1), whose GTPase domain is more similar to atlastin than to any other dynamin-related protein (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2001</xref>). Upon dimerization, the R48 residue in the P-loop of hGBP1, initially facing the dimer interface, swings into the nucleotide-binding pocket to stabilize the transition state (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh et al., 2006</xref>).

Therefore it was tempting to speculate that dimerization dependent hydrolysis would have been conserved between these two closely related GTPases. To test for this possibility, we monitored the release of GDP at steady state as a measure of the GTPase activity of atlastin in a continuous coupled assay under saturating GTP concentrations but varying atlastin protein concentrations. Notably, as the concentration of cytoDATL fell below those typically used in GTPase assays of atlastin, the observed rate of product release fell accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 E</xref>), with a fit of the rates to a simple dimerization equation yielding an estimated dissociation constant of &#x0223c;0.45 &#x000b5;M. Although additional assays would be required to demonstrate the existence of a GTP-bound trans-dimer, the apparent dependence of the hydrolysis cycle on dimerization was consistent with the possibility.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s11"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results are summarized in a working model, essentially a hybrid of earlier models. The model starts with atlastins on opposing membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 A</xref>) encountering one another in a GTP-bound prefusion conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 B</xref>), whereupon yet-to-be verified trans interactions between GTP-bound heads induce the rapid reorientation of catalytic residues necessary for GTP hydrolysis, which in turn triggers, in one step, the release of the 3HBs from the heads, strengthening of the head-to-head binding interface and 3HB crossover, to form the postfusion conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 C</xref>). In the case of wild-type or K320M atlastin, the free energy released through crossover formation, together with the membrane-destabilizing effects of the TM domains and tail, is sufficient to simultaneously draw the membranes into close apposition and to initiate bilayer mixing for fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 C</xref>). In contrast, in the case of K320N, K320G, or P317G, the binding energy of the crossover conformation is either largely insufficient, or insufficient altogether, to initiate bilayer mixing, leading to a state in which fusion has failed but the membranes remain tethered to one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 C</xref>&#x02032;). The first step of the model is largely based on the dimerization dependent hydrolysis of GTP observed for hGBP1 (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh et al., 2006</xref>), and though consistent with our observations, further experimentation is required to confirm this. Other aspects of the model are supported by the following observations: (a) head-to-head dimerization and crossover formation occur concurrently, (b) mutant variants with a destabilized crossover conformation can generate a tethered state but are incapable of progressing to fusion, and (c) the binding energy of the crossover conformation closely parallels fusion capacity.</p><fig id="fig10" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>Working model for atlastin-catalyzed membrane fusion.</bold> GTP-bound atlastins on opposing membranes (A) encounter one another (B). This induces GTP hydrolysis, which triggers simultaneous tightening of the head-to-head interface and formation of the crossover dimer to initiate membrane fusion (C). When the crossover conformation is destabilized by the indicated mutations, fusion fails, resulting in a tethered state (C&#x02032;).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_201609071_Fig10"/></fig><p>Even with its distinct architecture and enzymatic properties, a strong analogy can be drawn between atlastin and previously studied fusion protein catalysts, where a major driving force for membrane fusion comes from a set of highly favorable protein&#x02013;protein interactions that convert the catalyst from a prefusion to postfusion state. The amount of energy released per atlastin crossover dimer, and how it compares to that of viral fusion protein and SNARE postfusion complexes, remains to be determined. For the SNAREs, the binding energy of the postfusion complex has been measured to be 30&#x02013;40 k<sub>B</sub>T (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Yersin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2012</xref>), remarkably similar to the theoretical 40&#x02013;50 k<sub>B</sub>T estimated energy barriers for fusion (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cohen and Melikyan, 2004</xref>); however, because of the quasi-irreversibility of the postfusion states of both SNAREs and viral fusion proteins (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Carr et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Fasshauer et al., 2002</xref>), unconventional approaches have been required. The atlastin crossover dimer seems at least qualitatively similar, with no apparent dissociation over the course of 2 h. It will be of interest in future studies to apply to atlastin the kinds of approaches used for the other fusion proteins.</p><p>It should be noted that our working model stems from the results of assays both in the soluble phase and those in the context of membranes. Tethering and fusion reactions are performed, by definition, using the full-length protein anchored in vesicle membranes. However, preparing the full-length protein in vesicles appropriately labeled for the same kinds of assays that have been performed in the soluble phase remains a challenge. Therefore, the kinetic behavior of atlastin in the context of membranes is extrapolated from that in the soluble phase, and the full effects of the added load of the lipid bilayer will need to be assessed in future work. For instance, the extent to which membrane-anchored atlastin achieves the tight crossover conformation seen in the form 3 crystal structure as it undergoes fusion catalysis remains to be seen. Moreover, crossover formation in the soluble phase remained favorable even in the face of mutations that were destabilizing to the crossover state; however, the effects of membrane load on the favorability of crossover formation remain unknown. Presumably, crossover formation will be much less favored when coupled to the work of membrane fusion catalysis.</p><p>Finally, although this study has focused on the role of crossover in fusion, it cannot be overstated that fusion catalysis requires more. As noted, membrane insertion of an amphipathic helix in the C-terminal tail of atlastin is also required (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Faust et al., 2015</xref>), as are specific residues in the TM domain. As crossover formation, the tail, or the precise sequence of the TM domain is not required to reach the tethered state (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Saini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2015</xref>) but all are required for fusion (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Saini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Faust et al., 2015</xref>), it may be that all of these mechanisms work in close conjunction and collectively to reduce the energy barrier to lipid mixing. In the absence of any one of these energetic contributions, the activation energy for fusion may be too high, thereby preventing fusion catalysis. Indeed, crossover dimer formation, likely closely coupled to the initiation of bilayer mixing, may fail to occur altogether in the absence of the energetic contributions of either the tail or TM domain. Trans interactions between opposing membrane-spanning domains could provide an additional driving force, though it is currently not known whether the trans interactions of the atlastin crossover dimer extend into the TM region as proposed for previously studied postfusion complexes (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Tamm, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Stein et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, as the atlastin fusion mechanism is ultimately driven by GTP hydrolysis, the maximum free energy liberated by a single atlastin dimer during crossover is unlikely to exceed the total energy of hydrolysis of two molecules of GTP and is thus unlikely sufficient on its own to offset the estimated activation energy (40&#x02013;50 k<sub>B</sub>T) for fusion. cis interactions between the membrane spanning domains, previously reported to occur independently of GTP (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), may help coordinate the activity of multiple atlastin dimers. A full understanding of the atlastin fusion mechanism will require the identification of all these additional binding interactions and their relative energetic contributions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s12"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s13"><title>Cells, constructs, and reagents</title><p>Cell expression studies were in COS-7 cells maintained at 37&#x000b0;C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
