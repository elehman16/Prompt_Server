The mean red cell volume donated by patients who received erythropoietin was 32% greater than that donated by patients receiving placebo. Similar findings were recorded by Christophe Bouy <italic>et al</italic> 2006[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] and Goodnough, <italic>et al</italic> 2007.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] In the current study in which patients were enrolled in an autologous donation program designed to store up to 5 units of blood in three to four weeks, 68% patients who received placebo and 9% treated with erythropoietin were unable to donate &#x02265; 4 units [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Subsequently, the erythropoietin group underwent transfusion of 48% of autologous units and the placebo group 75% of autologous units [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. No patient in the erythropoietin group and 5.7% patients in the placebo group received two homologous units; each of these patients had donated 2 autologous units before the operation. In a previous retrospective study designed to store autologous units, 29% in placebo group and 4% in the erythropoietin treated group were unable to donate &#x02265;4 units. And further in the same study, placebo group in subsequent perioperative period underwent transfusion of 83% of autologous units collected and the erythropoitein group received 70% autologous blood donations,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] where as study conducted by Cristophe Bouy <italic>et al</italic> 5% of patients treated with erythropoietin and 40% of the placebo group received allogenic transfusion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] The overall wastage of autologous units in the present study was 52% in the erythropoietin group and 25% in the placebo group. The discard rate of autologous units in elective orthopedic surgeries shows a wide variation from 6.9% to 56%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] Although the small number of patients in our study precluded a demonstration that the frequency of exposure to homologous blood in the two groups was significantly different, previous studies have indicated that patients scheduled for elective orthopaedic surgery who are able to donate the amount of blood requested have a 13% probability of subsequently receiving homologous blood, as compared with a 43% probability among patients unable to store the requested amount of blood because of Hct limitations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] Studies of more patients are needed to confirm that increased procurement of autologous blood results in reduced need for homologous transfusion. For example, patients who are scheduled for surgical procedures requiring &#x02265;4 units of blood may be one group that will particularly benefit from erythropoietin therapy. In addition, our analysis of the relation between mobilizable iron levels and the number of units donated indicates that the amount of iron stored is a less important determinant than the initial levels of mobilizable circulating iron [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. The initial level of circulating hemoglobin iron is calculated on the basis of body size (i.e. blood volume) and hematocrit; thus these two values most closely predict the success of donation in autologous blood donors and explain why women are most often excluded from donation. The efficacy of erythropoietin in the autologous donation programme is due to increased red cell production [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>] through accelerated conversion of stored iron into circulating iron. This analysis suggests that the patients who would most benefit from the ability of erythropoietin to enhance red cell production are those with smaller blood volumes (e.g. women and children) and those who are anemic. The frequency of adverse effects was comparable in the erythropoietin and placebo groups. Two patients were removed from this study because of major cardiovascular events although neither event was attributable directly to the treatment or to the autologous blood donation protocol.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Relation between initial levels of stored iron, mobilizable circulating iron and total mobilizable iron; and total units of blood donated in the group as a whole The number of patients in each group is shown in parentheses</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AJTS-7-42-g007"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study in addition to confirming the success rate of autologous donations with rHuEPO has shown that the erythropoietin group has greater number of autologous blood unit collection, higher mean red cell volume per donor unit, more stable red cell volume collection throughout successive autologous phlebotomies as compared to placebo group. Further, on basis of current study the MSBOS (Maximum Surgical Blood Ordering Schedule) of our tertiary care hospitals are being reviewed to minimize discard rate of Autologous units collected. Thus the present study suggests that a comprehensive program of pre-deposit autologous blood for transfusion is an effective method for reducing the need for allogeneic transfusion..</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Guerra</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Cuckler</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cost effectiveness of intraoperative auto transfusion in total hip arthroplasty surgery</article-title><source>Clin Orthop</source><year>1995</year><volume>315</volume><fpage>212</fpage><lpage>22</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7634670</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Woolson</surname><given-names>ST</given-names></name><name><surname>Watt</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Use of autologous blood in total hip replacement.
