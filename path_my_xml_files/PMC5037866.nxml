These symptoms affect young people in multiple life domains and are possible precursors of long-term psychological distress. Despite relatively high prevalence, few children with emotional problems are referred for clinical treatment, indicating the need for systematic prevention. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate an indicated preventive intervention, EMOTION Coping Kids Managing Anxiety and Depression (EMOTION), to reduce high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a clustered randomized controlled trial involving 36 schools, which are assigned to one of two conditions: (a) group cognitive behavioral intervention EMOTION or (b) treatment as usual (TAU). Assessments will be undertaken at pre-, mid - intervention, post-, and one year after intervention. The children (8&#x02013;11&#x000a0;years old) complete self-report questionnaires. Parents and teachers report on children. The primary outcome will be changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms as measured by the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) and Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) respectively. Secondary outcomes will be changes in self-esteem, quality of life, and school and daily functioning. Observers will assess implementation quality with ratings of fidelity based on video recordings of group leaders leading the EMOTION group sessions.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study is an important contribution to the field regarding working with children with symptoms of anxiety and depression. The results of this study will provide an indication whether or not the EMOTION program is an effective intervention for the prevention of later depression and/or anxiety in children. The study will also provide information about the EMOTION program&#x02019;s effect on quality of life, self-esteem, and school functioning of the children participating in the study. Finally, the project will provide insight into implementation of an indicated intervention for school-aged children within Norwegian health, education, and mental health services.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinical Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02340637">NCT02340637</ext-link>, Registered on June 12, 2014, last updated on January 15, 2015.

Anxiety and depression, however, may share a common predisposition that, in the presence of stress, lead to the expression of anxiety, depression, or both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Developing integrated programs that target multiple but related problems, a transdiagnostic approach, has great appeal and will make evidence based interventions more available to children in need. While comparable interventions have been developed in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], there is to our knowledge no such intervention available for this age group in Norway today. Following international guidelines for the initial management of depression in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and in close collaboration with the program developers, the essential core elements of the Coping Cat program and Taking ACTION program have been combined. The resulting program, EMOTION Coping Kids Managing Anxiety and Depression (EMOTION) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], is an intensive course of 20 sessions that run twice per week for 10&#x000a0;weeks; this is explained in detail in the Intervention section of this manuscript. In addition to the 20 sessions for the children, the parents participate in seven meetings to learn strategies to support their children; the children also attend four of the parent&#x02019;s meetings.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Indicative intervention in a school setting</title><p>The EMOTION program is an indicated intervention. One challenge for indicated interventions is the need for a screening procedure to recruit youth to the intervention. Stigma associated with being selected due to indication is a potential problem, but in a pilot study of the EMOTION program described below [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the children reported low experience of stigma and high user satisfaction; this result is similar to a systematic study of stigma for adolescents with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Delivering interventions in schools will provide better access to children who might not otherwise receive services, as well as allowing for better collaboration between clinicians and school personnel, thus creating better continuity of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Good attendance is another advantage of delivering the program in school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and the EMOTION pilot study reflected this with very low attrition rates. Delivering interventions in schools has advantages across a range of emotional and behavioral problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The pilot study of EMOTION Coping Kids</title><p>The EMOTION pilot study took place in one elementary school in rural Norway. The pilot study investigated recruitment strategies, appropriate screening instruments, attendance rates, social stigma, and user satisfaction with the EMOTION program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Twenty-two children nominated themselves to join the intervention and eleven of them who had elevated symptoms of anxiety, depression, or both (&#x02265;0.50&#x02013;2.00 <italic>SD</italic>) joined the EMOTION groups. There were no dropouts from the EMOTION groups and overall participation was 98&#x000a0;% for the children and 75&#x000a0;% for the parents. User satisfaction was high and stigma was low. Feedback from the children, parents, and group-leaders was used to revise the content of the intervention.</p><p>Based on the pilot study, the EMOTION intervention has the potential to be an effective and practical transdiagnostic indicative intervention. Results will depend on delivering the intervention with high fidelity in a school setting. Such an intervention will be innovative and valuable from a public health perspective as it may prevent the development of very common and disabling mental health problems for a large number of youth in need.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Method/Design</title><p>The present study is a clustered, two-armed RCT delivered in schools from three regions in Norway: southern, central, and northern.

School eligibility is determined by region of the country and municipality. The primary study sites are in the northern, central, and southeastern regions of Norway. In northern Norway, where the population is less dense, two municipalities (i.e., Bod&#x000f8; and Troms&#x000f8;) are locations for school recruitment. In the central and southeastern sites respectively, municipalities in closer proximity to one another are large enough to provide enough participating schools.</p><p>The recruitment period is lasting for two years, starting in spring 2014 and is going until summer 2016. School-size is a recruitment criterion. The participating schools need to have at least one full class in each grade to increase the probability of recruiting enough children to run an EMOTION group. The intervention is offered once in the autumn and once in the spring term of each school year. The plan is to include an average of six children from each grade in each school every semester; a minimum of three children and a maximum of seven children per group will be allowed. The children are screened before, during, and after the intervention. In addition, participating children are measured one year after intervention to identify possible long-term effects. When the study is finished, the communities are free to implement EMOTION at the control schools. Children at the participating schools are recruited via an open invitation letter that is sent home to the parents; children are invited to participate if they and/or their parents consider themselves to have more sad or anxious feelings than their peers.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>The children who agree to take part in the study fill out the Short Mood and Feeling Questionnaire for depression (SMFQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. All of the children who fill out the screening questionnaires who score at least one standard deviation above the expected mean score for either depression (SMFQ; <italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.8, <italic>SD</italic> 3.6), anxiety (MASC; girls <italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;46, <italic>SD</italic> 15; boys <italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;39, <italic>SD</italic> 15), or both, are then invited to join the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Children who may not benefit from a group-process intervention (e.g. severe cognitive or developmental challenges) are considered individually and the reasons for exclusion are documented according to Consort guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention care and comparison</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention</title><p>EMOTION is a group-based intervention to reduce the symptoms of anxiety and depression in school-aged children. Professionals who work in community health, special educational service, mental health care, or the schools deliver the intervention to children in 20 group sessions over 10&#x000a0;weeks. The professionals are given a three-day training in EMOTION and are referred to collectively as group leaders. The EMOTION intervention focuses on building skills and on anxiety or depression-related activities for the first 10 sessions. For depression, the first 10 sessions focus on psychoeducation, emotion regulation, and behavioral activation; a strategy to encourage behaviors that lead to fun and positive experiences. The latter 10 sessions focus on maintaining activation and cognitive restructuring. The anxiety-related activities for the first 10 sessions focus on building a fear hierarchy, while graduated exposure to fear-inducing situations are introduced in the latter 10 sessions. In order to support the children, parents are asked to attend seven parenting sessions. The children also attend half of the parenting sessions. The parenting sessions focus on creating a supportive home environment for the children as well as practicing new skills together with their children in the joint group meetings. A complete overview of the EMOTION program and its contents can be found in the published results from the pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In addition, the teachers and school-nurses in the schools are offered a half-day psycho-educative training aimed at providing a better understanding of children with anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as recommendations in how to support these children. In order to support the group leaders in the their delivery of the intervention they will receive regular supervision from a trained cognitive behavioral therapist. The supervisors will in-turn receive support from the study coordinating office (RBUP East and South). Group leaders are also asked to deliver video recordings of 20&#x000a0;% of their sessions to be scored for quality assurance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Control</title><p>The teachers and school-nurses in the control schools are offered a half-day psycho-educative training that is equivalent to the training received by teachers and nurses in the intervention schools. Parents of children who score positive to a suicide screening question, are contacted by the research group. If the parents are worried about their child, they are encouraged to seek help from their regular GP or the school health nurse.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Procedure</title><p>The study is registered at clinical trials (NCT02340637) and is funded by a competing grant from the Norwegian Research Council (NFR 228846/CR). Additional funding for the project is provided by The Center for Child and Adolescent Mental Health &#x02013; Eastern and Southern Norway (RBUP East and South) and The Regional Centres for Child and Youth Mental Health and Child Welfare &#x02013; Northern Norway and Central Norway (RKBU North and RKBU Central, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Randomization</title><p>Participants are randomized at the school-level. Because schools are randomized only once when they join the study, study participants may know prior to offering their consent for participation whether they would receive EMOTION or be in a control school being offered treatment as usual (TAU). The schools will be matched prior to randomization based on geographic location (municipality) and school size. Randomization is to be conducted by coin flip and the results corroborated by an external expert cooperating with a member of the research support team at RBUP. Thirty-six schools are included to have a balanced design with an equal number of schools in each design arm and to ensure that the sample of students in the experimental condition is large enough to detect the expected effect size for the main outcome. Group sizes were limited to maximum seven students per group so that group leaders had a reasonable group size to manage. When the number of students who meet inclusion criteria exceeds the group maximum size, a group of seven students is randomly selected to fill the group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Blinding</title><p>Because of the nature of the current interventions, it is not possible for the participants to be unaware of the intervention condition they are assigned to after baseline. Furthermore, schools are randomized to either EMOTION or TAU prior to participation (see Randomization), so most participants are aware of the treatment condition prior to the baseline assessment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Data are collected at four time points: T1 (pre intervention), T2 (mid intervention), T3 (post intervention) and T4 (1-year post intervention follow-up). Participants from the intervention schools (children, parents, teachers, and group leaders) are sent links to the questionnaire via SMS, email, or in the case of the children, are given unique, confidential identifiers that they use to log in using school computer labs. Because of the children&#x02019;s ages, an adult is present while they fill out the questionnaire in order to clarify potentially confusing questions. At least one parent of each participating child is asked to fill out the parent questionnaires, although both parents are encouraged to participate. Teachers also fill out a questionnaire about participating children in their classroom.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Primary outcomes</title><p>The primary outcomes of interest for this study are the changes in depression and anxiety from pre- to post-intervention and from pre-intervention to follow-up. The null hypotheses for the primary outcomes of this study is that there will be no significant differences in changes of depression or anxiety scores between the intervention and the control groups. Depression is assessed using the SMFQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], a 13-item measure assessing cognitive, affective, and behavioral-related symptoms of depression in children 8 to 18&#x000a0;years.

We anticipate a relatively low risk of harm for participating, as EMOTION based largely on known effective methods for treating anxiety and depressive symptoms (i.e., cognitive behavioral therapy) and children in the TAU condition are not prevented from receiving treatment for their symptoms. Children are invited to participate in the study at their schools and an information letter is sent home to their parents that describes the study. If the children volunteer, their parents are required to provide written informed consent for their children to participate in the study.</p></sec></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kendall</surname><given-names>PC</given-names></name><name><surname>Martinsen</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Neumer</surname><given-names>S-P</given-names></name></person-group><source>Mestringskatten (Coping cat): terapeutmanual: kognitiv adferdsterapi for barn med angst</source><year>2006</year><publisher-loc>Oslo</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Universitetsforl</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Stark</surname><given-names>KD</given-names></name><name><surname>Simpson</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Schoebelen</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><source>Treating depressed youth; therapist manual for ACTION</source><year>2007</year><publisher-loc>Ardmore</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Workbook Publishing</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Axelson</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><name><surname>Birmaher</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Relation between anxiety and depressive disorders in childhood and adolescence</article-title><source>Depress Anxiety</source><year>2001</year><volume>14</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>67</fpage><lpage>78</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1002/da.1048</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11668659</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>BC</given-names></name><name><surname>Colognori</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Weissman</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>An initial description and pilot of group behavioral activation therapy for anxious and depressed youth</article-title><source>Cogn Behav Pract</source><year>2009</year><volume>16</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>408</fpage><lpage>19</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.cbpra.2009.04.003</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><label>5.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Weersing</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Gonzalez</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Campo</surname><given-names>JV</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Brief behavioral therapy for pediatric anxiety and depression: piloting an integrated treatment approach</article-title><source>Cogn Behav Pract</source><year>2008</year><volume>15</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>126</fpage><lpage>39</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.cbpra.2007.10.001</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR6"><label>6.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cheung</surname><given-names>AH</given-names></name><name><surname>Zuckerbrot</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>PS</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Guidelines for Adolescent Depression in Primary Care (GLAD-PC): II.
