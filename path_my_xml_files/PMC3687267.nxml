About 30% of those patients are treated with insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In the preanalog-insulin era, patients with diabetes were usually instructed to use an interval of 20&#x02013;60 min between the injection and meal consumption to compensate for the process of absorbing regular insulin preparations. This recommendation has been supported by pharmacodynamic studies measuring the rate of appearance of insulin in the serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). However, half of the patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and T2DM do not use any injection-to-meal interval (IMI). The other half is using a fixed or flexible IMI. In contrast to the many recommendations to apply an optimal IMI of 20&#x02013;30 min, most patients use a shorter IMI of 17&#x02013;18 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>There are some studies with considerable limitations on the IMI in patients with T1DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). However, almost no information is available for patients with T2DM, although they represent the largest group of insulin-treated patients. The few small, short studies on T1DM were published between 1980 and 1995, a time in which animal insulins were predominantly used. It is known that animal insulins induce anti-insulin autoantibodies more frequently than human insulin. This is evident particularly for bovine insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). At that time, the therapy strategy was conventional insulin therapy, with one or two injections of a mix of short- and intermediate-acting insulin per day, and patients did not regularly self-monitor their blood glucose. If reported, patients usually had insufficient metabolic control, indicated by HbA<sub>1c</sub> values between 9 and 11%. None of the studies dealing with the IMI were long enough to show any differences in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>In 1996, the first short-acting insulin analog was introduced to diabetes therapy. The fact that short-acting analogs do not need an IMI at all was claimed to be a great advantage, although it is questionable, according to current data, if the IMI is really necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In Germany, the most commonly used diabetes teaching and treatment programs do not necessarily recommend an IMI, with either regular human insulin or short-acting analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). This randomized, two-phase crossover study examines the necessity of an IMI in patients with T2DM and flexible insulin therapy with human regular insulin for metabolic control and its impact on treatment satisfaction and quality of life.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This trial was designed as a clinical, prospective, randomized, open-label, single-center crossover study. The trial was carried out in a general practice. We considered patients to be eligible if they met the following criteria: age between 40 and 80 years, have T2DM, and use insulin therapy with regular human insulin. The exclusion criteria included pregnancy or planned pregnancy in the next year, eating disorders, BMI &#x0003c;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, severe and enduring mental health problems, cancer, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;9%.</p><p>The trial was approved by the local ethics committee and was performed according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The trial was registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT00529165).</p><sec id="s2"><title>Intervention</title><p>After obtaining written informed consent, the individual insulin dosage, carbohydrate intake, and four-point blood glucose profile (before meal and bedtime) were determined in a 4-week run-in period. One day per week, blood glucose self-monitoring was also performed 1 h after the main meals. During the run-in period, all patients kept their IMI the same as before the study recruitment.</p><p>After the run-in period, we randomized volunteers into two groups: group A (IMI first, with phase 1 IMI 20 min and phase 2 no IMI) and group B (IMI last, with phase 1 no IMI and phase 2 IMI 20 min).</p><p>We randomized participants by using a computer-generated random list. Randomization was undertaken independently at the Institute of Medical Statistics, Computer Sciences, and Documentation, Jena University Hospital. Group IMI first started with an IMI of 20 min and group IMI last without an IMI. All eight visits every 4 weeks were the same in both groups and were held in the general practice. Participants completed a 12-week study sequence until crossover at visit four. After visit four, they completed the second 12-week study sequence. At the end of the trial, the IMI preference was investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design.

Samples were drawn from a venous sample and assayed in the laboratory of the local hospital. HbA<sub>1c</sub> was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (normal range, 4.3&#x02013;6.1%) (Variant II Hemoglobin Testing System; Bio-Rad, M&#x000fc;nchen, Germany). Blood pressure and body weight were measured at baseline and each visit.</p><p>Patients recorded in their diaries the insulin dosage, hypoglycemic episodes, and four-point blood glucose profiles (before the main meal and bedtime). One day per week, blood glucose control was also performed 1 h after the main meals. Mild hypoglycemia was defined as symptomatic neuroglycopenia or blood glucose readings &#x0003c;3.5 mmol/L, and severe hypoglycemia as a condition that requires intravenous glucose injection.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Psychosocial data</title><p>We used the audit of diabetes-dependent quality of life (ADDQoL) questionnaire from C. Bradley (Health Psychology Research Unit, Royal Holloway, University of London, London, U.K.) to measure the impact of diabetes on the quality of life. This questionnaire included 19 potentially applicable domains of life. The weighted impact score is a composition of all of these 19 domains. The score can range from &#x02212;9 (maximum negative impact of diabetes) to +3 (maximum positive impact of diabetes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The ADDQoL was measured at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks after baseline.</p><p>The treatment satisfaction was measured with the diabetes treatment satisfaction questionnaire (DTSQ) by C. Bradley. There are two versions of the DTSQ: standard and change. The standard questionnaire includes eight items, six of which measure treatment satisfaction with a scale (scored 0&#x02013;36), a higher score indicating a greater treatment satisfaction. The other two items (scored 0&#x02013;6) measure perceived hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Higher scores indicate greater perceived frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The DTSQ change version includes the same eight items but inquires in six items if the treatment satisfaction is better or worse than before (score &#x02212;18 to +18). A higher score indicates a greater improvement of treatment satisfaction. The other two items measure the change of problems with high or low blood glucose (score &#x02212;3 to +3). A higher score indicates a greater frequency. The DTSQ standard was measured at baseline, and DTSQ change was measured at 12 and 24 weeks after baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data of a pilot study were used to calculate the sample size of the noninferiority trial. Based on the preliminary data, the expected HbA<sub>1c</sub> difference of no IMI and IMI was 0.15%, and the expected SD of intraindividual HbA<sub>1c</sub> differences was 0.51%. The HbA<sub>1c</sub> difference of no IMI and IMI should not exceed 0.30% (noninferiority margin). To show noninferiority of no IMI compared with IMI with 80% power at the 5% significance level, we calculated 37 patients per study arm. Assuming a dropout rate of 25%, 100 patients (50 in each arm) needed to be referred.</p><p>Means and SDs were calculated to describe the baseline characteristics and outcomes after 12 and 24 weeks. The Student <italic>t</italic> test for paired samples was used to test for carryover, period, and treatment effects. The average intraindividual differences between both phases (no IMI/IMI) with the corresponding 95% CIs were determined to assess the effect of IMI. To compare the blood glucose profiles of both therapies, repeated-measures ANOVA was applied. A binomial test was used to test the patient preference for the IMI. A <italic>P</italic> value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p><p>All data analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle using IBM SPSS Statistics 19 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s7"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In total, 600 patients were screened and 100 patients were randomized.

Also, the blood glucose profiles, particularly with regard to the postprandial blood glucose measurements, and the incidence of hypoglycemia showed no significant or clinically relevant differences between an insulin therapy with and without the use of an IMI.</p><p>Insulin therapy without the necessity to use an IMI can improve treatment satisfaction in a clinically relevant setting. We found a significant increase in diabetes treatment satisfaction if patients stopped using an IMI and a significant decrease in treatment satisfaction if patients are obliged to restart using one. However, we did not find an influence of the IMI on quality of life. We interpret this finding as patients estimating their quality of life generally as good and their opinion that their diabetes-dependent quality of life would improve marginally without diabetes.</p><p>Insulin therapy without the IMI was preferred in 86.5% of patients, and the results of this study yield no arguments against it.</p><sec id="s12"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p>One limitation of this study is that we only looked at a 20-min IMI. The efficacy of a longer interval of 30, 45, or 60 min remains unclear.</p><p>Another limitation of this study is that the intervention could not be blinded. On the basis of the patient consent form, patients knew the rationale for the study at the time of recruitment. This may have influenced the assessment of patient treatment satisfaction. It was impossible to control the patients about the real use of the IMI of 20 min. Because all patients used an IMI before the start of the study, keeping an IMI is not an unusual intervention. We scored the bias low. The study participants were well controlled, with a mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 7% at baseline and a low dose of regular insulin. Whether patients with worse metabolic control or a high dose of regular insulin could have an advantage by using an IMI cannot be answered by this study.</p><p>This study has several strengths. The design of the study is a randomized, controlled crossover study. All visits were held in the general practice where the patients were treated before the start of the study; therefore, the patients trusted their doctor, and this reflects in the low dropout rate of 4%.</p></sec><sec id="s13"><title>Other research</title><p>The first study on this topic with a sufficient duration to show differences in HbA<sub>1c</sub> was conducted in Belgium but with patients with T1DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Two groups of 15 patients with T1DM received insulin injections either 5 or 30 min before their three main meals in combination with bedtime NPH insulin. Similar to our results, no differences between groups were reported in relation to changes in either plasma glucose excursions or HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Correspondingly, no significant difference of HbA<sub>1c</sub> was reported in patients with T1DM, with or without the IMI. In a preceding survey in our center, predominately older patients with T1DM and long diabetes duration practiced IMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). A possible explanation could be that these patients started insulin at a time when the IMI were generally recommended by health professionals, and they did not change their habits even after the introduction of modern treatments and teaching programs after 1990, when this recommendation was abolished.</p><p>Keeping an IMI can cause hypoglycemia, especially in patients with good preprandial blood glucose values. Forgetting insulin injections could be another disadvantage in older patients who keep an IMI. Therefore, besides postprandial glucose excursions and HbA<sub>1c</sub>, hypoglycemic events, quality of life, and treatment satisfaction are important to consider. No difference in the incidence of hypoglycemia in patients with or without IMIs was found. This is partially due to the lower incidence of hypoglycemia in T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Quality of life and treatment satisfaction with short-acting analogs were shown to be better than with regular human insulin if analogs are applied immediately (and regular human insulin 30 min) before a meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). If both types of insulin are applied immediately before meals, in a blinded manner, no differences in treatment satisfaction, well-being, or HbA<sub>1c</sub> were found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). These results are supported by the recently published Cochrane Review, which also did not show any clinical benefit of short-acting insulin analogs in comparison with regular insulin in type 2 diabetes subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). This proves that in patients with T1DM, the deterioration in the quality of life and treatment satisfaction is due to an IMI but has nothing to do with the type of insulin used. Our study results support these findings in patients with T2DM because we could clearly demonstrate the impact of the IMI on treatment satisfaction. Furthermore, an IMI with its theoretical advantage of optimum overlapping insulin absorption and carbohydrate ingestion is of seemingly no importance in patients with T2DM in a real-life setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this randomized, controlled crossover study, we found no difference in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, blood glucose profile, incidence of hypoglycemia, and quality of life in patients with T2DM and insulin therapy with or without the IMI. The treatment satisfaction increased significantly and in a clinically relevant extent if patients used no IMI. Most patients preferred insulin therapy without an IMI. Insulin therapy without an IMI is not inferior to treatment with an IMI of 20 min in patients with T2DM.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
