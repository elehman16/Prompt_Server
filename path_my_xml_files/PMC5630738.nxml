Intracellular tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP) levels at weeks 12 and 48 were used as a continuous measure of adherence. At study visits, participants were asked to describe how they perceived others&#x02019; reactions to them being on PrEP. These perceptions were categorized a priori as either &#x0201c;positively framed,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;negatively framed,&#x0201d; or both. We used Wilcoxon rank-sum to determine the association between positive and negative framing and TFV-DP levels at weeks 12 and 48.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>By week 4, 29% of participants reported perceiving positive reactions from members of their social groups, 5% negative, and 6% both. Reporting decreased over 48 weeks, but positive reactions were consistently reported more than negative. At week 12, no differences in mean TFV-DP levels were observed in participants with positively-framed reactions compared with those reporting no outcome or only negatively-framed (1338 [IQR, 1036-1609] vs. 1281 [946-1489] fmol/punch, <italic>P =</italic> 0.17). Additionally, no differences were observed in those with negative reactions vs. those without (1209 [977&#x02013;1427] vs. 1303 [964&#x02013;1545], <italic>P =</italic> 0.58). At week 48, mean TFV-DP levels trended toward being higher among those that report any reaction, regardless if positive (1335 [909&#x02013;1665] vs. 1179 [841&#x02013;1455], <italic>P =</italic> 0.09) or negative (1377 [1054&#x02013;1603] vs. 1192 [838&#x02013;1486], <italic>P =</italic> 0.10) than those reporting no reaction. At week 48, 46% of participants reported experiencing some form of PrEP-directed judgment, 23% reported being called &#x0201c;PrEP whore,&#x0201d; and 21% avoiding disclosing PrEP use.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Over 48 weeks, nearly half of participants reported some form of judgment or stigmatization as a consequence of PrEP use. However, individuals more frequently perceived positively framed reactions to being on PrEP than negative. Importantly, long-term PrEP adherence does not appear to suffer as a result of negative PrEP framing.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Disclosures</title><p>
