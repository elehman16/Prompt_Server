Participants had the option to continue self-treatment using the ginger patch for a further 24 weeks. A brief arthritis health questionnaire was completed weekly for 3 weeks and 4 weekly for 24 weeks. <bold>Results:</bold> The mean scores for Group 1 and Group 2 show a notable decline following 1-week topical ginger treatment; scores in pain, fatigue, global effect, and functional status reduced by 48%, 49%, 40%, and 31%, respectively, whereas health satisfaction improved from 80% dissatisfied to 70% satisfied. Scores for all participants in all five domains progressively reduced over the following 24 weeks of self-treatment. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Topical ginger treatment has the potential to relieve symptoms, improve the overall health, and increase independence of people with chronic osteoarthritis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>older adults</kwd><kwd>alternative therapies</kwd><kwd>chronic pain</kwd><kwd>herbal remedies</kwd><kwd>chronic conditions</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disease of the articular cartilage primarily affecting the hips, knees, and hands that subsequently accounts for the majority of joint replacements and musculoskeletal pain and disability in Western society (<xref rid="bibr42-0898010113512182" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, Moskowitz, et al., 2008</xref>).

Topical ginger avoids these potential negative effects, and when applied over the mid-lumbar region, qualitative studies suggest a positive effect on mobility, mood, energy levels, and overall sense of well-being (<xref rid="bibr32-0898010113512182" ref-type="bibr">Therkleson, 2010b</xref>; <xref rid="bibr33-0898010113512182" ref-type="bibr">Therkleson &#x00026; Sherwood, 2004</xref>). Topical ginger applied as ginger compresses to the kidney region is part of the practice of anthroposophic nursing for patients with chronic inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. In 1923, anthroposophic nursing was founded in the Ita Wegman Clinic in Arlesheim, Switzerland, and today there are more than 25 specialist hospitals and clinics throughout Europe, with nursing practice summarized in <xref rid="bibr12-0898010113512182" ref-type="bibr">Fingado (2011</xref>, <xref rid="bibr13-0898010113512182" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).

Throughout the 3 weeks, participants maintained their normal established OA management procedures. Routine analgesic medication was noted in a daily diary alongside a daily pain questionnaire.</p><p>Twenty volunteer adults with OA were randomly assigned to either Group 1 (compress) or Group 2 (patch). Randomization was sequential in time as participants were recruited at the first interview. This is a two-group design with a 1:1 allocation to each of the two interventions; Group 1 had 10 receiving a manually prepared ginger compress, and Group 2 had 10 receiving the standardized ginger patch. To ensure equal numbers in each group, a restricted randomized scheme was used, with a block size of 4 (<xref rid="bibr20-0898010113512182" ref-type="bibr">Machin &#x00026; Fayers, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The intervention was 7 consecutive days of topical ginger treatments, given at four medical clinics by anthroposophic nurses. Topical ginger treatment was the same for all participants and involved lying on the back in a quiet, warm space, with a prewarmed ginger patch/compress applied to the mid-lumbar region for 30 minutes, followed by a rest of 20 minutes. The compress and standardized patch each had the equivalent of 1 g dry ground organic <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> rhizome (ginger) from the same certified batch. The compress was prepared prior to use by dissolving 10 g of ground ginger in 100 mL hot water, soaking a cloth in the mixture and squeezing firmly. The patches were prepared exclusively for the study: each comprising a piece of crepe paper and extract with 1 g ginger and purified water. The same procedure and protocol for topical ginger compress treatments used in a previous qualitative study for 10 people with OA was followed (<xref rid="bibr32-0898010113512182" ref-type="bibr">Therkleson, 2010b</xref>). Before and after each treatment, nurses monitored participants&#x02019; basic physiological measures of temperature, pulse, respiration, blood pressure, and body weight and the observed and reported effects of the intervention. Although there are no known risks or side effects to ginger therapy, this was an added precaution. The brief Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (MHAQ) was completed weekly for the first 3 weeks: 1 week before treatment, 12 hours after treatment, and 1 week after treatment.</p></sec><sec id="section5-0898010113512182"><title>Part 2</title><p>Following the initial 3 weeks, all participants were offered the option to continue self-treatment at home using the ginger patch only as required for a further 24 weeks. The ginger patch was used by all participants for self-treatments because it is simple to apply, as well as convenient and reliable. The ginger compress is awkward and difficult to prepare in a consistent and reliable manner by patients. Participants were educated in the use of the ginger patch, with adequate supplies of patches available from the clinics. The MHAQ was completed four times a week for 24 weeks either in person or by telephone, depending on participant availability.</p><p>This study has appropriate state ethical approval in New Zealand.

OA was confirmed by Kellgren and Lawrence X-ray Grades 2 and 3; health assessment was based on clinical diagnosis and completion of the short arthritis assessment scale (SAS; <xref rid="bibr38-0898010113512182" ref-type="bibr">Wolfe, Michaud, Kahler, &#x00026; Omar, 2004</xref>). The SAS asks four simple questions relating to pain, functional status, and global effect of OA in the previous week, each on a 10-point Likert-type scale, with 0 for no problem and 10 for very severe problem. No participant was accepted with a pain score less than 5/10 or a total score less than 18/40. The health assessment excluded those with a joint replacement of the affected joint, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, cancer, and other serious health conditions; those who were not naive to the therapy; and those having corticosteroids and/or anticoagulants in the past 12 weeks.

The additional data relating to medication provide increased understanding of the changes in OA status before and after topical ginger therapy.</p><p>Participant total mean scores are given for the three questions on a VAS and the HAQ-II, with proportions for the one categorical variable. MHAQ total scoring was out of 3, with each of the questions on the 10-cm VAS and the 10 questions on the HAQ-II totaling 3. The 21-day pain scale was scored from 0 to 3, with 0 being no problem and 3 being a severe problem. The HAQ-II has 10 items with each scored from 0 to 3: 0 to 1 is mild to moderate disability, 1 to 2 is moderate to severe disability, and 2 to 3 is severe to very severe disability. The total HAQ-II score is divided by 10, resulting in 3 being the highest score possible in functional status.

After 7 days of ginger therapy, 5 of the 14 participants continued their usual medication regime, whereas 9 stopped all forms of analgesia; then 4 weeks later, 11 participants reported requiring no further pain relief as previously required. After 4 weeks, 78% of those previously taking analgesia were no longer requiring this additional support.</p><p>The 20 participants were motivated to be 100% compliant in every aspect of the study, and there were no reported adverse effects from nurses or participants. One participant did not continue self-treatment due to comorbidities that compromised the ability to maintain a balanced perspective, when completing the SRQ.</p><sec id="section9-0898010113512182"><title>Limitations</title><p>Although this study shows a positive response to topical ginger therapy, the small numbers do not allow for clinical significance.

This study showed a significant shift in pain symptoms by using the 10-cm VAS pain scoring daily for 21 days, and the MHAQ 7 days before and 7 days after therapy.

Manually prepared compresses and standardized patches applied for 7 consecutive days decreased symptoms of pain and disability for 20 adults with OA. This positive response continued over the following 24 weeks, with self-treatment. Topical ginger treatments were found to improve the subdimensions of quality of life scores of physical function, pain, and health satisfaction and overall global effect of OA. The noninvasive nature of topical ginger avoids the risks of conventional medication and surgery and has the potential to delay and possibly negate the use of these more invasive treatments. This study advances previous qualitative studies on topical ginger for OA by using brief and simple SRQs. Although a small sample, the positive response warrants further controlled research with a larger and more even cohort.</p><p>The domain of topical ginger is those people with OA for whom existing treatments are unsatisfactory due to personal preference, complex comorbidities, and/or existing medication regimes. The wide range of symptoms, ongoing debilitating effect, and absence of a cure means people with OA are often prepared to consider a range of options, including alternative approaches. Topical ginger treatments are a convenient, simple, and economical option that needs to be considered in the care of the aged with OA.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Author&#x02019;s Note:</bold>Appreciation is extended to the following: Anthroposophic doctors and nurses and participants involved in the study; School of Nursing and Midwifery, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, Western Australia; Godfrey Therkleson, RATO Health Ltd, New Zealand, for statistical support.
