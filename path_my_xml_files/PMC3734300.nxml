Some authors have hypothesized a causal link between the diurnal fluctuations of core temperature and short-term maximal performances <xref rid="pone.0070534-Chtourou1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070534-Souissi5" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070534-Zarrouk1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070534-Zarrouk2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Indeed, the increase in body temperature in the evening hours may increase the conduction velocity of action potentials, and this could result in better motor coordination and so produce higher muscle power output at this time-of-day <xref rid="pone.0070534-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Moreover, by examining the electromyographic (EMG) activities of the lower limbs during the Wingate test, previous study found that the diurnal variations in muscle power and fatigue were likely to be linked to conditions prevailing at the peripheral rather than central level <xref rid="pone.0070534-Chtourou9" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Concerning the effects of static stretching, the present results showed that jumping heights during the SJ and CMJ tests were impaired in the morning and in the evening. Although some previous studies had been unable to show any adverse effect of the static stretching <xref rid="pone.0070534-Samuel1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070534-Behm2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070534-Dalrymple1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, others showed that static stretching may adversely affect short-term maximal performance <xref rid="pone.0070534-Cornwell1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070534-Wallman1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The discrepancies between the results of the present study and those in the literature could be attributed to the age and training status of the subjects, stretch duration, intensity and volume, and to other factors (for further details, see <xref rid="pone.0070534-Behm1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>). Robbins and Scheuermann <xref rid="pone.0070534-Robbins1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> investigated the effects of 3 different volumes of static stretching on vertical jump height and showed that the greatest stretching volume, i.e., 6 sets of 15 seconds, decreased jump performance by an average of 1.9 cm. The exact mechanism for the decline in performance induced by static stretching is not fully understood; however, authors have speculated that a decrease in muscle activation and musculo-tendinous stiffness could be the main causes <xref rid="pone.0070534-Fletcher1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Nelson et al. <xref rid="pone.0070534-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> suggested that increased muscular compliance as a result of stretching might mean that the muscle will go through a greater period of unloaded shortening before taking up sufficient slack to then be able to transfer generated force to the bone. Consequently, cross-bridges may be at a less-than-optimal length much sooner in the movement. Moreover, Hough et al. <xref rid="pone.0070534-Hough1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> suggested that the static stretching may cause some neurological impairment that result in decreased muscle activation. This suggestion is supported by previous research demonstrating reductions in EMG activity of the quadriceps <xref rid="pone.0070534-Marek1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> and triceps surae <xref rid="pone.0070534-Cornwell1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> muscles after static stretching. Decreased muscle activation after static stretching could be explained by a number of factors including the Golgi tendon reflex and the mechanoreceptor (type III afferent) and nociceptor pain feedback (type IV afferent) responses <xref rid="pone.0070534-Fowles1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. As in the present study, the static stretching was assisted; this may activate the Golgi tendon organs that would cause a reciprocal inhibition of the motor neurons of the antagonist muscle, thereby causing autogenic inhibition <xref rid="pone.0070534-Hough1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Although some previous studies reported that dynamic stretching did not improve short-term explosive performance <xref rid="pone.0070534-Jaggers1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070534-Samuel1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070534-Torres1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070534-Bradley1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, others showed facilitation of jump performance <xref rid="pone.0070534-Hough1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070534-Holt1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070534-Pearce1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Behm and Chaouachi <xref rid="pone.0070534-Behm1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> concluded that dynamic stretching routines are a preferred method for improving explosive muscle contractions. In the present study, the improvements in jump height during the SJ and the CMJ were greater in the morning than the evening. However, to the authors&#x02019; knowledge, no previous study has compared the effects of static and dynamic stretching on the diurnal variations of short-term explosive muscle performance. Therefore, it is not possible to compare the present results with those of others. The mechanisms by which dynamic stretching improves muscular performance have been suggested to be elevated muscle and body temperature <xref rid="pone.0070534-Fletcher1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The greater increase in core temperature after dynamic stretching in the morning compared with the evening may induce faster and more forceful muscle contractions in the morning. Indeed, the higher body temperature may enhance metabolic reactions, increase the extensibility of connective tissue, reduce muscle viscosity, and increase the nerve conduction velocity of action potentials <xref rid="pone.0070534-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070534-Chtourou11" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070534-TurkiBelkhiria1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Moreover, Hough et al. <xref rid="pone.0070534-Hough1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> showed that EMG activity during a vertical jump exercise increased after dynamic stretching. This may reflect an increased recruitment of active neurons supplying each motor unit and so facilitate motor unit activation through neuromuscular propagation. Previous studies showed a higher EMG activity during the 30 second Wingate test in the evening compared to the morning <xref rid="pone.0070534-Chtourou9" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070534-Souissi2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Thus, dynamic stretching performed in the morning hours could enhance muscle EMG activity and, therefore, reduce the amplitude of the diurnal variation of short-term maximal performance.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the fact that all participants were male soccer players. Future investigations should focus on determining any modification to diurnal variations of short-term maximal performance in females. Moreover, short-term maximal performance was tested using only the SJ and CMJ. Therefore, acute effects of stretching on the daily fluctuations of upper body performance should also be investigated. Since the 3 CMJ repetitions were performed after the 3 SJs over a time span of only about 3 minutes, the conclusions from the present study are to be interpreted as an effect not only upon single short-term explosive power efforts but also, to some extent, upon powerful and repeated short bursts of exercise. For more accurate data regarding this issue, a similar protocol could be performed using repeated sprint ability (RSA) &#x02013; investigating single power, mean power and fatigue index variables and alterations in these with time-of day and after static and dynamic stretching.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the present study confirm that (i) static stretching is detrimental and (ii) dynamic stretching is beneficial and can overcome decreases in jump height in the morning. Thus, athletes required to compete in the morning hours and to produce powerful efforts may be advised to include dynamic stretching exercises in their pre-competition warm-ups.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Prof. Jim Waterhouse who checked the English of the manuscript.
