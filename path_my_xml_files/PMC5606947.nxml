This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of golimumab as maintenance therapy in the Japanese population. </p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In this phase 3, double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled, parallel group, randomized withdrawal study, 144 Japanese patients with moderately to severely active UC received golimumab doses of 200&#x000a0;mg (at week 0) and 100&#x000a0;mg (at week 2) subcutaneously during the 6-week open-label induction phase. Patients who responded to golimumab induction therapy entered the DB maintenance (M) phase and were randomized (1:1) to receive 100&#x000a0;mg of golimumab subcutaneous injection (SC) or placebo every 4&#x000a0;weeks for 52&#x000a0;weeks. The primary endpoint was clinical response through M-week 54; secondary endpoints included clinical remission and mucosal healing at M-week 30 and 54.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Among induction responders, more patients on golimumab treatment (56.3%) maintained clinical response through M-week 54 versus the placebo group (19.4%). At both M-week 30 and 54, 50% golimumab-treated patients achieved clinical remission versus the placebo group (6.5%) and a higher proportion of patients on golimumab (59.4%) experienced mucosal healing than the placebo group (16.1%). Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 96.9% in the golimumab group and 71% in the placebo group. Overall, the efficacy and safety results in this study were comparable with those observed in global studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Golimumab SC treatment maintained clinical efficacy through week 54 among induction responders, and no new safety signals were observed in the patients with moderate to severely active UC.</p><p id="Par5">Clinical Trial Registration: The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01863771.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00535-017-1326-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Anti-TNF&#x003b1; antibody</kwd><kwd>Golimumab</kwd><kwd>Japanese patients</kwd><kwd>PURSUIT</kwd><kwd>Ulcerative colitis</kwd><kwd>Maintenance therapy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Janssen Pharmaceutical KK (Japan)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Japanese Society of Gastroenterology 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par6">Ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) confined to the colon, is characterized by diarrhea, rectal bleeding, rectal urgency and tenesmus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The prevalence of UC is high in western countries; in USA, the prevalence ranges from 37 to 246 per 100,000 persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In Japan, the age-standardized prevalence of UC in 2005 was 63.6 per 100,000 persons and it is rapidly increasing with time, although at a comparatively lower rate than the western countries. Growing incidence and emergence of UC in formerly low-risk populations like Japan highlight the effects of the environment and the growing western influence on dietary habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition to westernization, familial traits, genetics and smoking habits also contribute to the development and progression of UC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">The conventional therapies used for the management of moderately to severely active UC include 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) compounds, corticosteroids, immunomodulators such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), azathioprine (AZA) and cyclosporine. However, many patients fail to achieve adequate response and tolerate conventional therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, a proinflammatory mediator, plays an integral role in the pathogenesis of UC, treatment with TNF-&#x003b1; antagonist such as infliximab has proven to be effective in moderate to severe UC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Golimumab, a fully human monoclonal anti-TNF&#x003b1; antibody, was approved in the USA and the European Union in 2013 for induction and maintenance treatment of moderately to severely active UC. The approval was based on two phase 3 clinical studies (Program of Ulcerative Colitis Research Studies Utilizing an Investigational Treatment [PURSUIT]-SC, a 6-week induction study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and the PURSUIT-Maintenance [PURSUIT-M], a 54-week maintenance study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]), which evaluated the efficacy and safety of golimumab subcutaneous injection (SC) in moderately to severely active UC patients who were refractory or intolerant to conventional UC therapies. Both the PURSUIT-SC and PURSUIT-M studies also enrolled Japanese patients; however, the small sample size of Japanese patients limits the generalizability of the results in these patients. Hence, the present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of golimumab via SC as maintenance therapy in Japanese patients with moderately to severely active UC and to confirm the similarities of golimumab efficacy and safety between this study and those observed in the PURSUIT-M study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p id="Par9">Japanese patients (both men and women aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years) with moderately to severely active UC, as defined by a Mayo score of 6&#x02013;12 with a local endoscopic subscore &#x02265;2 at baseline of induction phase were eligible if they had an inadequate response to or had failed to tolerate one or more conventional therapies [oral 5-aminosalicylates, oral corticosteroids, azathioprine (AZAs) and/or mercaptopurine] or had demonstrated corticosteroid dependence. All patients in this study were TNF &#x003b1; therapy-na&#x000ef;ve. In addition, eligible patients were to have a stool culture negative for enteric pathogens and patients aged &#x02265;45&#x000a0;years were to have undergone a colonoscopy to assess the presence of adenomatous polyps (within 5&#x000a0;years prior to first administration of study agent) and adenomatous polyps were to be removed prior to the first administration of any study agent. Patients with no history of latent or active tuberculosis (TB) prior to screening were included. In the screening phase, infections were assessed by an investigator. Two months prior to the first administration of golimumab, patients were screened for TB using the interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs): QuantiFERON-TB Gold Testing and T-SPOT.TB test, chest radiographic and lung computed tomography (CT). Patients were also screened for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections using the HBsAg (HBV surface antigen), anti-HBs (HBV surface antibody) and anti-HBc total (HBV core antibody total) assays.</p><p id="Par10">Patients with a history of severe and extensive colitis who required colectomy; or who had colits limited to 20&#x000a0;cm of the colon or rectum, symptomatic colonic or small bowel obstruction, colonic mucosal dysplasia, extensive colonic resection or any other intra-abdominal surgery within a specified interval prior to screening; or patients having presence of fistula or adenomatous colonic polyps (not removed) were not included in this study.</p><p id="Par11">The institutional review board at the study site approved the protocol and the study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, consistent with good clinical practices and applicable regulatory requirements.

The study consisted of a 6-week open-label induction phase (I) and a 54-week double blind (DB)-maintenance phase (M; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1)</xref>. In the open-label induction period (I-week 0 to I-week 6), all patients received 200&#x000a0;mg of golimumab via SC at I-week 0 and 100&#x000a0;mg at I-week 2. At I-week&#x000a0;6 (i.e. M-week 0), patients who achieved clinical response (CR) entered the DB-maintenance phase as the primary population and were randomized (1:1) to receive either 100&#x000a0;mg of golimumab or an equivalent placebo every 4&#x000a0;weeks through M-week 52. Treatment allocation was based on a computer-generated randomization schedule that used permuted block randomization with stratification factors as clinical remission and corticosteroid use at M-week 0 (yes or no). For patients with a confirmed loss of CR, the following dose adjustments were permitted once during the study: patients on placebo received 100&#x000a0;mg of golimumab every 4&#x000a0;weeks and patients on golimumab treatment continued receiving the same dose every 4&#x000a0;weeks.

It was assessed using the Mayo score, a composite endoscopic clinical score calculated as a sum of four subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy findings and physician&#x02019;s global assessment. Mayo overall score values range from 0 to 12 with higher scores indicative of severe disease condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">CR was measured as a decrease in the Mayo score by &#x02265;30% and &#x02265;3 points from I-week 0, along with a fall in the rectal bleeding subscore of &#x02265;1 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. Mayo scores were calculated at I-week 0, M-week 0, M-week 30 and M-week 54. In addition, patients experiencing an increase in disease activity (i.e., clinical flare defined as an increase in the partial Mayo score of at least two points from baseline [M-week 0] with an absolute partial Mayo score &#x02265;4 or an absolute partial Mayo score &#x02265;7) at any time during the study were also assessed for loss of CR using Mayo scores.

Other efficacy endpoints were: proportion of patients who maintained clinical remission at both M-week 30 and M-week 54 among patients induced into clinical remission with SC golimumab; proportion of patients achieving clinical remission and eliminating corticosteroid use at M-week 54 among patients receiving concomitant corticosteroids at M-week 0; change in Mayo scores and partial Mayo scores from baselines (I-week 0 and M-week 0); proportion of patients who reported mucosal healing at various time points and change from baseline in corticosteroid use at M-week 30 and M-week 54. Health-related quality of life was assessed using a patient-reported IBD questionnaire (IBDQ), a 32-item self-reported questionnaire that evaluated bowel symptoms, systemic symptoms, social function and emotional functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Improvements in the IBDQ was assessed in patients who had &#x0003e;20-point improvement in the IBDQ score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] at M-week 0 from I-week 0. The proportion of patients with sustained improvement in their IBDQ score of &#x0003e;20 points at M-week 30 and M-week 54 was also assessed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Immunogenicity and biomarkers</title><p id="Par19">Immunogenicity was measured by antibody detection and characterization from I-week 0 through the follow-up visit at week 68.

No clinically relevant changes from baseline in the hematology parameters and clinical laboratory parameters were observed during the study..</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par45">Subcutaneous injection of golimumab, a fully human anti-TNF&#x003b1; antibody, has demonstrated clinical efficacy in recent double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled global studies by effectively achieving and maintaining CR and remission in patients with moderate to severely active UC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, in these global studies, no definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of golimumab SC as a maintenance therapy in Japanese patients could be drawn due to the limited number of patients from this region. The current study was the first to assess the efficacy and safety of golimumab SC as both induction and maintenance therapy particularly in Japanese patients. In the current study, efficacy and safety of golimumab therapy was assessed in UC patients who were refractory or intolerant to 5-ASAs, corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators. Consistent with the results of the global PURSUIT-M study, CR was achieved with golimumab therapy in 56.3% of induction responders through M-week 54 during the DB-maintenance phase. Furthermore, golimumab treatment showed 36.9% more efficacy compared with the placebo; thus, the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved based on the predetermined criterion for efficacy (CR<sub>100</sub>&#x02013;CR<sub>P</sub> &#x02265;8.5%). The safety results indicated that, consistent with the global studies, golimumab was well-tolerated in this patient population.</p><p id="Par46">At the end of the induction phase, 43.8% of UC patients achieved CR to golimumab. These results are generally consistent with a global induction study wherein a similar proportion of patients (51.0%) achieved CR with golimumab SC 200&#x000a0;mg at the end of a 6-week induction phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The Japanese subpopulation of the PURSUIT-SC study, however, showed a lower CR of 26.1% during the induction phase as compared with the CR observed in the present study (43.8%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. During the DB-maintenance phase, the observation of CR with golimumab 100&#x000a0;mg in 56.3% of patients in the maintenance phase of this study is also comparable with the global golimumab SC maintenance study (49.7%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">Results of secondary endpoints including clinical remission status and mucosal healing at both M-week 30 and M-week 54 further substantiate the efficacy of golimumab therapy in this study. Clinical remission observed during the induction phase was maintained at M-week 30 and M-week 54 in golimumab-treated patients as compared with placebo-treated patients. A decrease in the Mayo score and partial Mayo score obtained at baseline of maintenance phase from I-week 0 were maintained through the end of study. Mucosal healing was achieved by more than 50% patients at M-week 30 and M-week 54 as compared with placebo, further supporting the efficacy of golimumab 100&#x000a0;mg over placebo. Mucosal healing determined by the endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] has emerged as one of the most significant treatment goals in IBD such as UC and Crohn&#x02019;s disease, as it assesses disease activity and helps predict sustained clinical remission. Thus, with similar CR, clinical remission and mucosal healing observed in the present study, the current results of golimumab treatment in the Japanese population are comparable with the overall global population.</p><p id="Par48">Currently, infliximab and adalimumab are approved for the biological therapy of UC in Japan. Golimumab is the latest addition to the anti-TNF class of drugs and offers some advantages over the conventional biological treatments. In addition, golimumab treatment may prove to be beneficial over the other treatments such as adalimumab in terms of a longer dosing schedule (4- vs. 2-week) for maintenance treatment. An important point to consider is the relatively convenient ease of administration of golimumab SC, as compared with other treatments like infliximab, which require intravenous administration in hospital settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">One of the key roles of an ideal UC therapy is to reduce the need for concomitant corticosteroid therapy and lower the consequent side effects. Several agents such as azathioprine and 5&#x02010;ASA have been evaluated for their ability to discontinue steroid therapy and induce steroid-free remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this study, golimumab reduced the mean daily corticosteroid dose at both M-week 30 and M-week 54 from baseline and 55.6% patients on golimumab treatment achieved clinical remission and discontinued corticosteroid use at M-week 54. Patient-related improvements in disease status, quality of life and patient preferences as measured by IBDQ score are gaining impetus and IBDQ score is now being used as a measure of clinical effectiveness in UC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. An increase in the median IBDQ score was noted at the end of the induction phase and was maintained through M-week 54. This tendency is consistent with that observed in the PURSUIT-M study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">Inflammation is indicated as an underlying cause of UC and various treatment regimens have been evaluated for their effects on suppressing these subclinical inflammations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The inflammatory biomarker CRP and stool biomarkers with enhanced specificity for intestinal inflammation such as fecal lactoferrin, and fecal calprotectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] were also assessed to estimate the effects of golimumab in reducing the degree of mucosal inflammation. In the current study, the initial reduction in these biomarker levels was observed at the end of the induction phase and was maintained through M-week 54, suggesting the positive effects of golimumab SC in controlling inflammation associated with UC. The incidence of antibodies to golimumab was low through M-week 54, consistent with that observed in the global study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">No new safety signals were observed with golimumab treatment in this UC patient population from Japan. There were no deaths and no cases of active TB or malignancy reported during this study. The pattern of TEAEs, serious TEAEs, infections and injection site reactions during this study were comparable to the global study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">The findings of this study are limited by the fact that it was not statistically powered to detect a difference between the golimumab and placebo groups for the end point of maintenance of clinical remission. All between-group comparisons were descriptive and no formal statistical tests were applied to detect the differences between the two treatment groups.</p><p id="Par53">To summarize, the encouraging efficacy and safety outcomes of the current study and the two global studies collectively demonstrate the consistent clinical benefit and positive benefit/risk profile of golimumab treatment. Thus, golimumab can be an additional valuable treatment option for moderate to severe UC in patients from Japan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec28"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
