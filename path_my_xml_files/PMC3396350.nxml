This has led to development of drugs for prevention of fragility fractures. Among anti-osteoporosis agents, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates are the most commonly prescribed for prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. This class of drugs includes minodronate (ONO-5920/YM529), which is currently marketed in Japan for treatment of osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Preclinical studies have shown that minodronate is at least 10 times more potent than alendronate in inhibiting bone resorption in vivo and in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] with intermediate mineral-binding affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A double-blind head-to-head trial of minodronate and alendronate in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis showed that treatment with each drug for 12&#x000a0;months increased bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine and the hip in a similar manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A phase III trial conducted to examine the effect of daily oral 1&#x000a0;mg minodronate for 2&#x000a0;years showed a significant reduction of 59% in the risk of vertebral fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Since bisphosphonates are likely to be prescribed for more than 3&#x000a0;years, it is important to determine if the anti-fracture effect is sustained in long-term treatment. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of long-term minodronate treatment in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, based on re-analysis of a phase III 2-year clinical trial with a 1-year extension.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>A 3-year prospective multicenter intervention study, including a 2-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study and a 1-year extension study were performed.

In the 2-year study, subjects who met all the entry criteria were sequentially assigned an allocation number independent of the study site. Subjects were randomized to take 1&#x000a0;mg minodronate (Astellas Pharma, Tokyo, Japan) or placebo once a day and were treated for 24&#x000a0;months. The subjects were instructed to take their tablet on rising and 30&#x000a0;min before breakfast with water. All subjects received daily calcium (600&#x000a0;mg) and vitamin D (200&#x000a0;IU) supplementation once a day after the evening meal.</p><p>The subjects who completed the 2-year study were invited to participate in an additional 1-year extension, in which all subjects were to receive minodronate (1&#x000a0;mg daily). As in the original 2-year study, all subjects also received 600&#x000a0;mg daily of supplemental calcium and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (200&#x000a0;IU). Adherence with the study treatment was assessed using medication diaries and counts of residual drug supplies.</p><p>This study was conducted with protection of patient rights, as outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the appropriate institutional review boards. All subjects gave written informed consent before undergoing any examination or procedure, and all study protocols were conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Assessment of fractures</title><p>Vertebral fractures were determined based on lateral radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar spine, as described in the report of the original 2-year study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Briefly, prevalent fractures were judged to be present based on a ratio of anterior or middle vertebral body height to posterior vertebral body height &#x0003c;0.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Quantitative and semiquantitative techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] were used to identify incident vertebral fractures for the purpose of efficacy determination. Lateral and anterior-posterior radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar spine were taken at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36&#x000a0;months for assessment of incident fractures. An incidence of new vertebral fracture was diagnosed if the anterior, posterior, or middle vertebral height decreased by at least 15% and by 4&#x000a0;mm in a vertebra that was normal at baseline, or semiquantitatively as a progression in grades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The assessment was performed in a blinded fashion.</p><p>All non-vertebral fractures were identified symptomatically as clinical fractures, and only non-traumatic fractures assessed by investigators were recorded. Suspected clinical fractures at six non-vertebral sites (humerus, radius/ulna, clavicle, pelvis, femur, and tibia/fibula) were only listed if confirmed radiographically.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Assessment of bone mineral density</title><p>Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (L2-4) in posteroanterior projections was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36&#x000a0;months. BMD measurements were performed in centers in which DXA for the lumbar region and hip was available. Of the centers involved in the study, 19 were equipped with QDR series machines (Hologic, Waltham, MA, USA), 6 with DPX series (General Electric Company, Fairfield, CT, USA), 2 with XR series (CooperSurgical, Inc., Trumbull, CT, USA), and 1 with a BMD 1X series (Hitachi Medical Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) machine for BMD measurements. A central facility (Department of Nuclear Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama, Japan) performed quality assurance.

Although the extension study did not have a placebo arm, the data showed no indication of any loss of anti-fracture efficacy after 2&#x000a0;years of minodronate treatment. In addition, those patients who had been on calcium and vitamin D supplementation for 2&#x000a0;years and then received treatment with minodronate showed a substantial reduction in the incidence of vertebral fracture after 6&#x000a0;months of minodronate administration. In the patients who received minodronate in the original 2-year study, lumbar BMD changes were consistent and bone turnover markers decreased within the first 6&#x000a0;months and remained constant thereafter over 3&#x000a0;years. Similar positive effects of minodronate on BMD and bone turnover markers occurred when therapy was initiated in the placebo/minodronate group, which is consistent with previous extension studies of bisphosphonates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In the original 2-year study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], a large number of vertebral fractures occurred during the first 6&#x000a0;months in both the minodronate and placebo groups. We speculated that some of these vertebral fractures might actually have occurred before drug administration was started, since the assessment of vertebral fractures at baseline was performed within 2&#x000a0;months of the start of minodronate administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. On the contrary, in the extension study, minodronate treatment reduced the incidence of vertebral fracture to 1.5% in the placebo/minodronate group during the first 6&#x000a0;months, compared to 6.4% during the last 6&#x000a0;months of placebo treatment. This preventive effect might reflect the fundamental potential of minodronate under conditions in which calcium and vitamin D levels are sufficient. In the original 2-year study, when fractures during the first 6&#x000a0;months were eliminated, the risk of vertebral fractures from 6 to 24&#x000a0;months was reduced by 74% in the minodronate group, which is very similar to the reduction observed during the first 6&#x000a0;months in the extension study in the placebo/minodronate group. In previous fracture prevention studies of bisphosphonates and selective estrogen receptor modulators, relative risk reductions for 3&#x000a0;years of 47% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], 41% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] were found with alendronate, risedronate, and raloxifene, respectively. Therefore, the relative risk reduction due to minodronate in the current study is comparable to or greater than those produced by other drugs, although we note that this comparison is not based on a head-to-head trial.</p><p>The changes in lumbar spine BMD and bone turnover markers were consistent with continuing efficacy over 3&#x000a0;years, and over-suppression of bone turnover markers was not observed. These results are reassuring regarding both the long-term efficacy and safety of minodronate treatment. The findings of continuing benefits with long-term minodronate treatment are important, given the chronic nature of osteoporosis. The increase in BMD changes in the current study is similar to those in previous studies with alendronate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and risedronate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which demonstrated sustained increases in BMD for up to 3&#x000a0;years. The increases in lumbar spine BMD were largely due to an increased degree of secondary mineralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It is also possible that part of the increase in lumbar spine BMD was artifactual due to progressive osteoarthritic changes with aging.</p><p>With regard to the safety profile of minodronate, the drug appeared to be well tolerated during this 3-year study. Safety assessment is difficult due to the lack of a placebo arm, but the overall incidence of adverse events in year 3 was similar to that in the first 2&#x000a0;years of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], especially with regard to gastrointestinal adverse events. Osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical subtrochanteric or diaphyseal femoral fracture are major concerns in patients with longer term administration of bisphosphonates. We did not observe these adverse events in either group, but the risks for these events are low in patients receiving bisphosphonates for less than 3&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, observation of patients treated with minodronate for a longer period is needed to clarify the longer term risk of these adverse events.</p><p>The present study has several limitations. The number of patients was relatively small and the extension study did not have a placebo arm. It is also possible that patients who elected to enter the extension study were not representative of the original cohort and may differ from patients who elected not to participate in this part of the study. Therefore, we did not perform a statistical comparison of the two groups or periods in the fracture risk incidence. However, the baseline characteristics of the extension cohort were similar to the original study cohort, which indicates that the results of the study are likely to be reflective of the entire cohort. A strength of the study is that spinal radiographs were obtained for all patients at entry and at the conclusion of the study, which allowed an accurate assessment of the incidence of radiographic vertebral fractures.</p><p>In conclusion, a 1-year extension study in postmenopausal osteoporotic women showed that daily administration of 1&#x000a0;mg oral minodronate is safe and well tolerated, and that the efficacy of this dose in reducing vertebral fracture risk in postmenopausal women over 2&#x000a0;years is sustained with continuing treatment. The study also demonstrated that initiating minodronate therapy after 2&#x000a0;years of calcium and vitamin D treatment had the expected positive effects on fractures, bone turnover markers, and BMD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. H.
