Poor self-control has been found to be related to numerous problems, such as obesity, criminality, risky sexual behavior, drug and alcohol use, as well as other negative outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Conversely, high self-control has been found to be related to better grades, less psychopathology, better relationships, better interpersonal skills, healthier eating habits, better emotional control, as well as other positive outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The strength model of self-control argues that self-control behaves like a muscle in that it becomes weakened from active use and people are less successful at using self-control on subsequent tasks which require its use [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Similarly, repeated use can strengthen self-control, much like exercising a muscle, making it less susceptible to becoming weakened from active use and leading to better subsequent outcomes on tasks which also require self-control. Thus, self-control seems to increase following training. A meta-analysis by Hagger, Wood, Stiff, and Chatzisarantis [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported an overall positive effect of training on improving self-control, though few studies have examined how long effects persist after the end of the training. Hui, Wright, Stewart, Simmons, Eaton, and Nolte [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] documented some persistence of effects, but findings were complicated by the specific domain of the research (dental hygiene). Muraven [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] tracked participants for a month following training, but again, the persistence of effects was domain specific (smoking cessation). Recently, Bertrams and Schmeichel [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] found that training effects were not sustained after the end of training, contradicting the previous findings.</p><p>With the persistence of self-control training (SCT) effects being unclear, the first goal of the current study was to examine the robustness of SCT effects. Such an examination is pertinent because a recent meta&#x02013;analysis by Carter and McCullough [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed that there is a publication bias with regard to research on self-control depletion. This raises potential doubt with regard to other self-control research, especially because informal communications with self-control researchers revealed that unsuccessful and unpublished training studies exist, pointing to a file-drawer problem [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, a meta-analysis using alternative procedures from those by Hagger et al. [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] obtained somewhat smaller effect sizes than reported by these authors [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>A second goal of this study was to examine the role of implicit beliefs in SCT. Research on self-control highlights the importance of implicit beliefs about self-control. Job, Dweck, and Walton [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] found that whether participants&#x02019; believed willpower to be a limited resource or not moderated depletion effects. Participants who did not believe willpower to be limited did not demonstrate reduced self-control after having engaged in a depleting task [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Similarly, it may be possible that implicit beliefs about the trainability of self-control impact whether or not SCT effects manifest following training. Thus, we developed a scale which measures implicit beliefs about the malleability of self-control. We hypothesized that beliefs in the malleability of self-control would be linked with (a) greater compliance with the training instructions, and ultimately (b) greater success of the SCT.</p><p>Participants attended three study sessions, each two weeks apart. In the first session they were randomly assigned to an established SCT condition or a control condition and asked to follow instructions during the period between Session 1 and 2. During this time they also reported their compliance with instructions via a website. Participants did not receive any instructions for the period between Session 2 and 3. At all three sessions participants completed a set of self-report measures and completed the physical self-control task.</p><p>Notably, we used a SCT task and a physical self-control measure which are both well-established in the literature, but which are similar in nature. Our SCT asked participants to increase the use of their non-dominant hand. This procedure has been demonstrated to increase self-control, such that following this procedure participants were better able to resist the temptation to smoke [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], less likely to entertain thoughts about and engage in interpersonal aggression [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and more resistant to self-control depletion [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To assess self-control, our participants were asked to squeeze a handgrip exerciser for as long as they could, with the time serving as a physical measure of self-control. The meta-analysis by Hagger et al. [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] revealed this to be a popular task when assessing self-control strength [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although muscle strength contributes to the time that a participant can hold a handgrip exerciser, previous research has documented that it is best understood as a measure of self-control as participants are required to withstand the discomfort resulting from continuing to hold the device [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Whereas participants in the SCT condition were told to increase the use of their non-dominant hand during the training period, the physical measure was applied to both dominant and non-dominant hands. If participants use their non-dominant hand as part of the training regime, it should not be surprising if this increased use of the non-dominant hand also improves subsequent muscle strength in this particular hand. However, there is no reason to believe that such increased muscle strength in the non-dominant hand would translate to improved performance in the dominant hand <italic>unless</italic> the training also improved self-control. Muraven et al. [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] used participants&#x02019; ability to squeeze a handgrip as a dependent variable in assessing changes in self-control, but did not mention whether participants used their dominant or their non-dominant hand to do so [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Note that Muraven et al.&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] training regime did not involve use of any particular hand; hence, these authors seemed to consider this issue unimportant enough to not even report which hand was used, nor whether participants used the same hand before and after the training. In contrast, the present investigation does make use of a SCT procedure focused on the non-dominant hand, thus making it imperative to differentiate possible effects on muscle-strength improvement from self-control improvements by assessing performance on the handgrip task with each hand in all sessions.</p><p>Additionally, a subset of participants completed a second objective measure of self-control, namely, a Stroop task. This secondary measure was included to confirm potential findings pertaining to the physical measure. The Stroop task, in which participants are shown color words in various font colors and indicate the color of the word while ignoring what the word actually says, has also been used in previous self-control research, and is another popular measure for self-control [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>All participants provided written informed consent at the initial session, prior to engaging in the research activities. The consent forms and procedures were approved by the University of Nevada, Reno Social Behavior and Education IRB (approval number 508754&#x02013;5). Across four different semesters, 147 students (74.8% female; 67.6% White) participated in the study in exchange for course credit and $15 (USD). The study consisted of three lab sessions.</p><p>Assuming the estimate for training effects reported by Hagger et al. [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], <italic>d</italic> = 1.07 (p. 510, averaged corrected standardized difference effect size), and assuming &#x003b1; = .05 and &#x003b2; = .99, the required sample size was 68 to detect an effect of this magnitude. This estimate pertains to the comparison between a training condition and a control condition following the training. Only after the study was completed and the present manuscript submitted for publication did the authors learn about two recent meta-analyses that estimated the effects to be smaller, Hedges&#x02019; <italic>g</italic> = .30 [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and Hedges&#x02019; <italic>g</italic> = .36 [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] (note that Hedges&#x02019; <italic>g</italic> and Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> only differ in that <italic>g</italic> includes a correction factor for sample size).</p><p>One can question whether a simple comparison between a control group and a self-control training group does provide the correct basis for a sample size estimate because we employed a mixed-model design which was predicated on the notion that the control group and the training group would diverge over time. Indeed, ours was a mixed-model design, in which we assigned each participant to an experimental condition (between-groups factor) but assessed each participant in three different sessions (repeated-measures factor) on both their dominant and nondominant hand (repeated-measures factor), for which we expected differential effects over time. Hence, it was important to determine the sensitivity of this design for a Condition x Session x Hand interaction. Assuming &#x003b1; = .05 and &#x003b2; = .80, as well as an average correlation of <italic>r</italic> = .60 between measurements, our planned sample size of 68 was able to detect a Condition x Hand x Session interaction effect with an effect size that corresponded to a Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> of .23&#x02014;arguably a small effect size. Note that, other than the estimates reported by previous authors [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] we do not focus on a simple comparison between a training group and a control group post-training. Rather, our estimate pertains to the differential change that emerges between these two groups over the course of the training.</p><p>The data were collected in two batches. In the first set of data, 108 students participated across three successive semesters. After removal of partial completers and ambidextrous students, the number of usable cases reached 65, thus making it necessary to collect additional data. Because preliminary analyses of the incomplete data set revealed ambiguous results, in the final semester of data collection (resulting in 39 more participants), we added one dependent variable to the very end of the procedure to examine the consistency of potential findings across measures.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Procedure</title><sec id="sec005"><title>Session 1</title><p>At the first session, participants provided written consent, and then completed all of the self-control measures (discussed below). Participants were given the self-report measures first, then the physical measure, and lastly, for the second batch, the Stroop task. Participants were randomly assigned to conditions via a coin toss and received corresponding instructions.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>SCT condition</title><p>Participants in the training condition were instructed to use their non-dominant hand for mundane, daily tasks (e.g., carrying objects, brushing their teeth, stirring beverages) between the hours of 8AM and 6PM. This training program is modeled after the exercises in Gailliot et al. [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] (see Study 2 &#x00026; 4); also [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which was previously demonstrated to bolster self-control.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Control condition</title><p>Participants assigned to the control condition were instructed to keep a journal of the temptations they encountered daily (e.g., not doing homework when they ought to, making poor eating choices, hanging out with friends instead of studying) between the hours of 8AM and 6PM, and to do so whether they resisted the temptation or capitulated. This control condition was modeled after Muraven [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and served the purpose of making self-control behaviors salient, without requiring participants to practice self-control. Notably, keeping a journal has been occasionally used in the context of a self-control manipulation [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, diaries were either used to record participants&#x02019; activities [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], or to record participants&#x02019; food intake [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Even though in Muraven et al. [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] there were no explicit instructions to modify food intake while keeping a food diary, keeping a food journal may lead to a spontaneous modification of behavior, though effects are small [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, the task of recording one&#x02019;s food intake might be reactive and increase the likelihood of people exercising self-control. However, a similar process is much less likely to occur for the recording of daily temptations, which are experienced often as spontaneous and outside of the individual&#x02019;s volition. Consistent with this notion, Hufford et al. [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] found little evidence for problem drinkers tasked with recording their alcohol-related temptations to alter their behavior. Moreover, Muraven [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] demonstrated that the journaling task was no different in its consequences on self-control improvement from an alternative control condition (performing 3&#x02013;5 minutes of simple math problems twice a day).</p><p>Participants in both conditions were told to follow instructions for a period of two weeks ending with Session 2.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Interim between Session 1 and Session 2</title><p>All participants regardless of condition received text messages every three days reminding them to follow condition-specific study instructions.

The mixed model included the Stroop scores and then the adjusted Stroop scores as the dependent variable, Session (1&#x02013;3) and Condition (training vs. control) as factors, and malleability beliefs and compliance as continuous predictors. Gender, week of participation, and depletability beliefs were controlled for (i.e., added as main effects only). No significant effects or interactions emerged with either model, all <italic>p</italic>s &#x0003e; .086. The findings do not support that training with the non-dominant hand leads to improved Stroop task performance. However, this result must be interpreted with caution because only a subgroup of our participants completed the Stroop task. This particular aspect adds to the present study&#x02019;s pattern of non-supportive findings, albeit remains inconclusive, as it is likely underpowered.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec027"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present investigation yielded only null findings. On the one hand, our study provided behavioral evidence that participants in the SCT condition adhered to experimental instructions. This was evident in self-reported compliance, which has been used in previous research [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], as well as the act of reporting their compliance online, i.e., number of compliance checks completed. This finding is surprising in light of much of the published evidence and appears consistent with the criticism leveraged against research on the effects of self-control training, which has been suspected to be compromised [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Similarly, our attempt to examine whether subjective beliefs about the malleability of one&#x02019;s self-control capacity moderate the expected effects ultimately failed. Although our novel scale revealed good psychometric qualities and showed satisfactory convergent and divergent validity, malleability scores did not moderate training effects, as the latter did not materialize.</p><p>A possible criticism of the present study is that the SCT instructions might have drawn attention to the non-dominant hand, thus signaling to participants that experimenters were interested in the non-dominant hand, but not the dominant hand. However, there was no change in the performance of the dominant hand that would support the claim, there were no changes in Stroop performance, nor were there changes in self-reported self-control. Overall, the present research found little evidence that self-control training successfully improved individuals&#x02019; physical measures of self-control or self-reported self-control. Whereas our findings cannot refute that improving self-control is possible, the underlying processes are likely complex and difficult to translate into a simple training procedure.</p><sec id="sec028"><title>Our study in the light of recent developments</title><p>Only after completion of the present research did we became aware of two recent meta-analyses, which were unpublished at the time of submission [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Both analyses reported small but positive effects of training on self-control. Whereas this overlap is unfortunate, the inclusion of our study would have further reduced their already low effect size estimates. Conversely, the fact that we looked toward the large effect size estimate published by Hagger et al. [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] for sample size requirements, yet to detect the type of effects emerging from the recent meta-analyses [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178814.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], a larger sample size would have been required had our observed average correlation between measurements been smaller. We believe that Hagger et al. [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] only synthesized the evidence available to them and cannot be blamed for their inflated estimate (but see [<xref rid="pone.0178814.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]); however, this instance may serve as evidence that publication bias does have real consequences and can mislead members of the scientific community.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0178814.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Muraven</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Baumeister</surname><given-names>RF</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Tice</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name>. <article-title>Longitudinal improvement of self-regulation through practice: building self-control strength through repeated exercise</article-title>. <source>Journal of Social Psychology</source>. <year>1999</year>; <volume>139</volume>: <fpage>446</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>457</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00224549909598404">10.1080/00224549909598404</ext-link></comment>
