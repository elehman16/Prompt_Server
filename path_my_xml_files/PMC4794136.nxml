CCR5-tropic virus is the most prevalent strain during the early stages of infection, whereas CXCR4 predominates during later stages [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. CCR5 antagonists are active against viruses resistant to other drug classes.</p><p>Cenicriviroc (CVC), a novel, oral, once-daily, dual CCR5/C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) antagonist, demonstrated potent antiviral activity and was generally well tolerated in HIV-1-infected, antiretroviral-experienced, CCR5 antagonist-naive study participants [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, dose-dependent increases in the primary ligand of CCR2, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), were observed during CVC treatment [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. CCR2 and MCP-1 play critical roles in coordinating cell migration, including that of classical monocytes, and are intricately linked to processes that are associated with metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, and hepatic fibrogenesis [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As morbidity and mortality in HIV-1-infected individuals are closely linked to HIV-associated chronic immune activation [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], potent CCR2 and CCR5 blockade suggests that CVC could also confer CCR2-mediated anti-inflammatory effects [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This is supported by nonclinical studies showing CVC antifibrotic activity in rodent models of thioacetamide-induced liver fibrosis and diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, CVC is an attractive candidate for treatment of HIV infection, and may have benefit beyond its direct antiviral activity. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety, and anti-inflammatory properties of 100 and 200&#x0200a;mg of CVC with those of efavirenz (EFV) 600&#x0200a;mg, when each was administered in combination with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) in antiretroviral treatment-naive, HIV-1-infected adults with CCR5-tropic virus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained, and the protocol, as well as any amendments, consent documents, and safety reports, were reviewed and study conduct was monitored by an Institutional Review Board at each site. CVC is an investigational drug that has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The phase 2b, 48-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study (652&#x02013;2&#x02013;202, NCT01338883) was conducted at 43 hospitals/institutions in Puerto Rico and the USA between May 2011 and 2013. Study participants were stratified by HIV-1 RNA of at least 100&#x0200a;000 or less than 100&#x0200a;000 copies/ml and randomized 2&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;2&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;1 in accordance with a computer-generated randomization schedule prepared by a nonstudy statistician to receive CVC 100&#x0200a;mg (CVC100), CVC 200&#x0200a;mg (CVC200), or EFV 600&#x0200a;mg (Sustiva; Bristol-Myers Squibb), in a double-blind manner, all given with open-label FTC/TDF (Truvada; Gilead Sciences). The drug kit number was obtained by study staff from an interactive voice response system (PharPoint Research, Inc.). The database was locked until the week 24 primary analysis, when the sponsor was unblinded. Study sites and patients remained blinded until the final week 48 analysis.</p><p>CVC was formulated as 50&#x0200a;mg tablets and each study participant received a total of six tablets daily, including placebos, on a twice-daily schedule: CVC/placebo with breakfast to enhance CVC absorption, EFV/placebo on an empty stomach at bedtime, and FTC/TDF at either time.</p><p>The first 25 randomized study participants (CVC100, eight; CVC200, 10; and EFV, seven) underwent intensive 24-h pharmacokinetic sampling on day 14, and took CVC/placebo after breakfast (approximately 500&#x02013;700&#x0200a;kilocalories, less than 15&#x02013;20&#x0200a;g fat) and EFV/placebo with FTC/TDF on an empty stomach at bedtime. Following confirmation that both CVC doses provided plasma exposure levels within the target range [average plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic>
<sub>avg</sub>) of 55.2&#x02013;646&#x0200a;ng/ml], the remaining study participants were enrolled.</p><p>Treatment was discontinued for confirmed virologic failure/inadequate virologic response (Supplemental Digital Content 1). The original criterion for virologic failure was measurement of HIV-1 RNA more than 50 copies/ml at any time on or after week 24, confirmed within 7&#x02013;14 days. This criterion resulted in premature discontinuation of study participants with transient low-level viremia who spontaneously resuppressed, and who, therefore, did not appear to constitute true treatment failures. Prior to unblinding for the week 24 primary analysis, the protocol was amended to redefine the confirmatory HIV-1 RNA criterion for virologic failure as more than 400 copies/ml within 14 days, instead of more than 50 copies/ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Study participants</title><p>Antiretroviral treatment-naive, HIV-1-infected adults (&#x02265;18 years of age) with CCR5-tropic virus, plasma HIV-1 RNA level of at least 1000 copies/ml, and CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count of at least 200 cells/&#x003bc;l were enrolled. Tropism was determined by phenotype (Enhanced Sensitivity Trofile assay, Monogram Biosciences) and genotype [reflex strategy (triplicate population sequencing) followed by ultradeep sequencing, Quest Diagnostics]; study participants had to be CCR5-tropic by both assays. Exclusion criteria included the presence of primary resistance mutations or phenotypic resistance to TDF, FTC, or EFV and/or mutations associated with multidrug nucleoside/nucleotide resistance; serum alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at least 2.6 times the upper limit of normal (ULN); total bilirubin of at least the ULN; history of HIV-2, hepatitis B and/or C, cirrhosis, or any other known active or chronic liver disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Study objectives</title><p>The primary objectives were to determine the proportion of study participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml at week 24 (virologic success according to the US FDA Snapshot algorithm), and to compare the safety and tolerability of two different doses of CVC with those of EFV. Secondary objectives were to determine the proportion of study participants with HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml and less than 400 copies/ml at week 48, change from baseline in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cell counts at week 48, incidence of treatment-emergent drug resistance and tropism changes in study participants with virologic failure, effects of CVC-mediated CCR2 antagonism as measured by inflammatory and immune activation biomarkers and metabolic parameters, and the dose of CVC associated with optimal plasma safety and virologic response.</p></sec><sec><title>Study assessments</title><p>HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4<sup>+</sup>, and CD8<sup>+</sup> cell counts were measured at every visit [two screening visits; baseline (day 1); weeks 1, 2, 4, and every 4 weeks until week 48]. Viral load was measured by the TaqMan assay (Applied Biosciences, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA). The impact of viral &#x02018;blips&#x02019; was evaluated using a preplanned secondary analysis to determine the proportion of patients who achieved HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies/ml at weeks 24 and 48. Virologic resistance and tropism changes were assessed in study participants meeting criteria for protocol-defined virologic failure (PDVF). Resistance-associated mutations were identified by GenoSure<sup>TM</sup> assay (Monogram Biosciences, South San Francisco, California, USA). Tropism testing was carried out as previously described and phenotypic CVC susceptibility was analyzed by PhenoSense Entry assay (Monogram Biosciences).</p><p>Safety and tolerability were evaluated by serum chemistries, complete blood counts, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, urinalysis, adverse event monitoring from screening until 4 weeks after treatment completion, physical examinations, and ECGs. Severity of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities was assessed using the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Division of AIDS toxicity grading scale. Fasting metabolic studies were performed at baseline and at weeks 4, 12, 24, and 48, including glucose control indicators (glucose and insulin for homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance and hemoglobin A1c) and lipid profiles.</p><p>Inflammatory [high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), IL-6, MCP-1, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and soluble CD14 (sCD14)] and immune activation (CD4/CD38/CD3/human leukocyte antigen-DR and CD8/CD38/CD3/HLA-DR) biomarkers were measured at baseline and at weeks 4 (except for MCP-1 and sCD14), 12, 24, 32 (MCP-1 and sCD14 only), and 48. hs-CRP was measured by immunochemiluminometric assay using a quantitative C-reactive protein kit (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), IL-6 by ELISA using a Quantikine human IL-6 kit (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA), D-dimer by immunoturbidimetric assay using a D-dimer assay (Liatest) kit (Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres, France) and fibrinogen by polymerization function by the Clauss method using the Stago Fibrinogen kit (Diagnostica Stago); these biomarkers were measured by LabCorp Clinical Trials (Cranford, New Jersey, USA). sCD14 and MCP-1 were measured by R&#x00026;D Systems using a solid phase sandwich ELISA with a human sCD14 and human C-C chemokine ligand type 2/MCP-1 Quantikine ELISA kit, respectively (R&#x00026;D systems). Immune activation markers were measured by flow cytometry using cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</p><p>Samples for CVC trough levels were collected predose on day 1 and at weeks 4, 24, and 48, and additional random samples were collected at weeks 2, 8, 12, 16, 20, 32, and 40 in all study participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>A sample size of 60 study participants in each CVC arm and 30 study participants in the EFV arm was proposed to provide a preliminary evaluation of the safety and efficacy of CVC, and to sufficiently detect an 18% difference in the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml at week 24 (primary end point) between groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05; <italic>t</italic>-test for two independent proportions; 80% power; 80% EFV rate) or &#x02212;0.92 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml difference between each CVC group and the corresponding active control group in HIV-1 RNA (SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.4, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05; 80% power; <italic>t</italic>-test with nonparametric adjustment to the normal distribution).

Change from baseline was assessed by treatment arm for CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cell counts, and inflammatory and immune activation biomarkers. Descriptive analyses of viral resistance and tropism changes were summarized by treatment arm in study participants meeting PDVF criteria. Preplanned statistical analyses were conducted to assess treatment differences for: proportion with HIV-1 RNA less than 50 and less than 400 copies/ml, changes from baseline in HIV-1 RNA levels, and in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cell counts; other analyses were conducted posthoc. Unless specified otherwise, all statistical testing was two sided, and used a Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test, controlling for HIV-1 RNA at baseline; statistical significance level was set as <italic>P&#x0200a;</italic>&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.05. An analysis of variance model with treatment as the fixed effect was also used to assess differences in demographics and baseline characteristics among arms. A Breslow&#x02013;Day test was used to assess the homogeneity of virologic response across the baseline HIV-1 RNA stratification variable (HIV-1 RNA &#x02265;100&#x0200a;000 and &#x0003c;100&#x0200a;000 copies/ml). A van Elteren test, controlling for baseline HIV-1 RNA, was used to determine differences in cholesterol levels between arms and for MCP-1 mean changes from baseline. Least squares means were calculated for sCD14 from a linear mixed model including treatment, baseline sCD14 value, baseline HIV-1 RNA, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects. All statistical analyses were conducted with the SAS System, version 9.1.3 or higher (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).</p><p>Noncompartmental CVC pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using descriptive statistics. A population analysis was performed on all samples, using a two-compartment model to predict CVC plasma exposure [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling evaluated the relationship between CVC parameters and virologic outcomes. A Classification and Regression Tree analysis was used to further investigate the association between week 24 CVC minimum plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic>

CVC effects on sCD14 were independent of changes in HIV-1 RNA, in contrast to EFV, where greater viral load decline was associated with smaller changes in sCD14 levels (Supplemental Digital Content 8).

<sub>min</sub> of at least 50&#x0200a;ng/ml; this was confirmed in the trial.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>CVC100 and CVC200 were efficacious and well tolerated in antiretroviral treatment-naive, HIV-1-infected adults with CCR5-tropic virus. At weeks 24 (primary end point) and 48 (secondary end point), virologic success was similar among treatment arms. Overall, virologic failure was 11% in the CVC arms and 7% in the EFV arm. Notably, three CVC-treated study participants were withdrawn because of virologic &#x02018;blips&#x02019; prior to a protocol amendment designed to prevent premature discontinuation for transient low-level viremia.</p><p>Treatment-emergent, NRTI-associated mutations were observed in five CVC-treated study participants with virologic failure and none in the EFV arm; importantly, four of the five mutations emerging at codon 184 occurred in study participants with a suboptimal CVC plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic>
<sub>min</sub> &#x0003c; 47.8&#x0200a;ng/ml). Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated a trend toward improved virologic outcomes with increasing CVC plasma concentrations; study participants with <italic>C</italic>
<sub>min</sub> more than 47.8&#x0200a;ng/ml were more likely to achieve virologic success. A tropism change to R5X4 was observed in one study participant receiving CVC200.</p><p>CVC was better tolerated than EFV, with fewer treatment-related adverse events of at least grade 2 and adverse events leading to discontinuation. Higher rates of adverse events-related discontinuation among EFV recipients led to a greater proportion of study participants with no virologic data at weeks 24 and 48.</p><p>Notable study limitations include a complex dosing regimen and considerable pill burden that may have reduced adherence across all arms and contributed to high rates of missing data, in spite of retention measures. These measures included missed-visit alerts for sites, transportation assistance, and patient-assistance programs to enable access to poststudy HIV regimens following 48-week study completion.</p><p>The complex dosing regimen also made enrollment challenging at a time when once-daily regimens with lower pill burdens were the standard of care. This was further exacerbated by a high screen-failure rate (primarily because of having X4 or dual/mixed-tropic virus, CD4 less than 200 cells/&#x003bc;l, primary resistance to antiretroviral regimens in the study, and HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;1000 copies/ml). As a result, the number of sites was needed to complete study enrollment was very high. To ensure that compliance and quality assurance were maintained between the large number of study sites, standardized audits of data collection and analysis functions were conducted throughout the study period, as well as targeted audits of eight study sites with high enrollment. Underrepresentation of women precluded any sex-specific conclusions. The low rate of virologic success in the EFV arm at week 48 (50% of study participants with HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;50 copies/ml) contrasts sharply with results from other phase 3 studies where EFV-based therapy was used as a comparator (80&#x02013;84% of study participants with HIV-1 RNA levels &#x0003c;50 copies/ml; intention-to-treat, FDA Snapshot Algorithm) [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Of note, a lower than expected rate of virologic response was also reported in two contemporary studies (71% at week 48) [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our results may underestimate EFV efficacy because of the small sample size (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;28), high proportion of week 48 missing data (39%), and potential nonadherence associated with a complex dosing regimen. Discontinuation because of adverse events associated with EFV accounted for a high proportion of missing data (21%).</p><p>Data on virologic response, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, and safety and tolerability support the selection of CVC 200&#x0200a;mg once daily for further clinical evaluation. Phase 3 studies in antiretroviral treatment-naive, HIV-1-infected study participants are planned to evaluate fixed-dose combination of CVC/lamivudine as a novel backbone versus TDF/FTC, coadministered with guideline-recommended third agents.</p><p>Our findings demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in MCP-1, suggesting potent blockade of CCR2. The monocyte activation biomarker sCD14, an independent predictor of mortality in people with HIV [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], decreased and remained below baseline with CVC treatment, but increased with EFV. CVC has demonstrated CCR2-mediated antifibrotic activity in animal models of liver and kidney fibrosis [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; a phase 2b study in non-HIV-infected patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis is fully enrolled (CENTAUR Study 652-2-203; NCT02217475). These intriguing findings support further exploration of the potential anti-inflammatory effects of CVC in HIV infection and other inflammatory syndromes.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Editorial support was provided by Camille Bonomelli of Alpharmaxim Healthcare Communications.
