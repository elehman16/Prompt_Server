<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In May 2012, the World Health Assembly approved the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) to ensure that the full benefits of vaccines are extended to all people.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Interventions to improve vaccination outcomes are commonly categorised either as targeting health services delivery or supply (eg, improving human resources training and supervision, logistics, cold chain maintenance and vaccine storage), or demand for vaccines. Common approaches to increase demand involve offering incentives for vaccination, or knowledge translation and education (KTE), to promote and sustain vaccine uptake.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Mixed strategies combine features of supply and demand approaches.</p><p>Demand-side interventions may be particularly promising as equity-based strategies to reach underserved populations. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis by our group found that demand-side interventions led to substantial gains in child vaccination coverage in diverse developing country settings.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> KTE and incentives strategies were both effective.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>For children &#x0003c;12&#x02005;months of age, India's Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) now provides free vaccination against eight vaccine-preventable diseases: tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles, hepatitis and rotavirus.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Notwithstanding, in 2012, India accounted for the largest share among all countries (30%) of the world's 22.6 million under-vaccinated (defined as failure to receive three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine) children, underscoring the need to strengthen uptake of routine immunisation (RI) in this context.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Only one study has evaluated use of demand-side interventions to strengthen RI in India. Banerjee <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> tested the use of food incentives to promote immunisation uptake in rural Rajasthan, and found an important positive effect.

Villages were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group (CG). A survey to assess knowledge, understanding and practices concerning immunisation, diarrhoea and child health was administered to participants at baseline prior to randomisation, and 4&#x02005;months later at endline.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><sec id="s2b1"><title>Setting and location</title><p>The trial location is rural Hardoi district, UP, India.

In Hardoi district, estimated mortality in children under 5&#x02005;years of age was 89.6 per 1000 (UP 74.9; India 57.3) in 2012,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> coverage of DTP3 (a standard measure of RI system performance used by international agencies such as WHO, UNICEF and GAVI<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref>) was 41.9%<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> (UP 55.9%;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> India 71.5%<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and full immunisation was 49.9% (UP 45.3%; India 61.0%).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Bawan is one of Hardoi's 19 administrative blocks. Bawan was chosen as the pilot study site for reasons related to logistics and feasibility, and because it consistently performs below district averages on development indicators.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Eligibility criteria for clusters</title><p>Villages were eligible for inclusion if they had 2000 to 5000 inhabitants and were located in Bawan Block. Census data showed that 23 of Bawan's 126 villages were candidates for inclusion. We eliminated 1 village with which we had had previous contact. Twelve of the remaining 22 villages were selected to ensure maximum geographical distance between clusters.</p></sec><sec id="s2b3"><title>Eligibility criteria for participants</title><p>All women residing in a selected village, who were mothers of a child 0&#x02013;2&#x02005;years of age, were eligible to participate. We excluded those not able to understand and speak Hindi or Urdu, and those cognitively impaired or who did not intend to reside in the village for the study duration (4&#x02005;months). Eligibility criteria applied only to scientific data collection and inclusion in the main analysis.</p><p>The sampling unit was the household. We selected 36 households containing one or more eligible mothers within each village, using sampling procedures designed to provide near random selection of households spread over the community.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>Interventions employed a variety of individual, small group and community-wide approaches that can eventually be delivered by volunteers. The target populations reside in rural areas with weak health services. Our focus on community-based KTE is grounded in two findings from our 2013 district survey: (1) social factors structuring access, opportunities and empowerment also shape immunisation coverage. (2) Mothers are considered the primary caregivers for their children but are often not empowered to fulfil this role.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Study interventions contribute to learning, empowerment and forging of links across social groups, thereby reinforcing the resilience of individuals and communities, and creating conditions for positive change. Interventions aim to increase the effectiveness of local immunisation services without substantial added public investment, and are designed as a support to local health workers. Interventions took place over 4&#x02005;months and will be standardised in future to facilitate delivery at scale.</p><p>India's Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme offers nationwide nutrition and health promotion. In addition to the regular ICDS services, women residing in intervention group (IG) villages received: (1) six home visits by volunteers (one visit every 3&#x02005;weeks) using &#x02018;engagement packages&#x02019; designed to improve knowledge, awareness and attitudes towards immunisation. Engagement packages consist of visually appealing story cards, discussions, games and activities, delivered one-on-one or in small groups with friends, fathers and other family members. Together, these activities help to cultivate confidence, raise awareness and create a space wherein the mother's capacity to make decisions on immunisation is recognised and supported; (2) three community mobilisation events involving activities, theatre and discussion groups to identify problems related to immunisation in their communities, discuss possible causes and solutions, and give feedback on the project. CG villages received community mobilisation through activities, events and discussion groups to raise awareness on issues related to nutrition, diarrhoea prevention and treatment in their communities, and give feedback on the project. A toll-free number for immunisation enabling anonymous queries and feedback was offered to all residents of IG and CG villages. <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015007972TB1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> summarises study interventions.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2015007972TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Study interventions</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Activity</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention group (IG)&#x02020;</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (CG)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Baseline survey*</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Randomisation*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Home visit 0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rapport formation; information</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rapport formation; information</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Community discussion 1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Project introduction; sharing district report card; skit (vaccination); toll-free number (vaccination)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Project introduction; sharing district report card; skit (ORS); toll-free number (vaccination)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Home visit 1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Story 1 (Key messages)

Specifically, we viewed the study as feasible if (1) 50% of villages approached would agree to participate and accept randomisation; (2) 30 women per village could be recruited in 70% of villages; (3) 50% of women were retained from baseline to endline. Below these thresholds, we judged that the study would not be feasible without major modifications.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>We studied process indicators related to implementation fidelity (ability to delivery interventions as planned) and two indicators of community response ((1) participation in community events; (2) additional participants who joined the endline survey (as a measure of the indirect effect of interventions)). We also studied three proxy indicators of intervention impact on immunisation uptake. We described differences between IG and CG villages for two cluster-level outcomes: (1) use of the toll-free number and (2) monthly immunisation day footfall. (3) We compared performance of individuals belonging to the IG versus CG on the change from baseline to endline survey on key indicators related to information conveyed through the engagement packages and community events. There were no changes to outcomes after the start of the trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sample size</title><p>For a feasibility study, sample size is not established based on power to detect an anticipated intervention impact. We set the number of clusters at 12, as six clusters per study arm is a minimum for cluster comparisons using a t test,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and for logistical and budgetary reasons. To facilitate statistical testing within clusters, we fixed the number of households per village to be 30, but inflated this to 36 to account for potential non-response and missing values. We therefore sought to recruit 432 individual participants allocated equally between intervention and control villages. In all 12 villages, community discussions and the toll-free number were open to the entire community.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Randomisation</title><sec id="s2f1"><title>Sequence generation and allocation concealment</title><p>Villages were assigned either to intervention or CGs using simple randomisation with a 1:1 allocation following a computer-generated randomisation schedule. The random allocation sequence was generated at the CRCHUM by a professional statistician (M-PS) using the R package blockrand<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and kept in a password-protected computer. The statistician was not involved in study implementation. Prior to release of the randomisation code, only the statistician had access to the allocation sequence. The randomisation code was released all at once, and treatment groups assigned only after completion of all recruitment procedures and baseline measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Implementation</title><p>Field team leaders enrolled clusters by contacting village officials in person to explain study aims and activities, and to request consent to participate. Subsequently, in each participating village, field team members directly approached a random sample of households to request their consent to participate in the baseline survey and pilot study. Enrolment occurred prior to randomisation. No advertisements were used for recruitment, and no incentives or rewards were offered for participation. Field team members informed households personally of their study group assignments.</p></sec><sec id="s2f3"><title>Blinding</title><p>Owing to the nature of the interventions, neither participants nor those involved in intervention delivery were blinded to group assignment. Data analysis was not masked. We took two measures to reduce the potential impact of knowledge of group assignment on study outcomes. (1) The study used a control intervention to enhance acceptability of randomisation and to conceal the true study hypothesis. (2) We hired independent surveyors for the endline survey to assess study outcomes. These surveyors were not informed of group assignment. They were told that our goal was to understand how mother's knowledge affects child health. Baseline and endline questionnaires encompassed immunisation, diarrhoea and other aspects of child health.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>We used descriptive statistics (counts, frequencies, proportions) to assess study feasibility and processes. Descriptive statistics were also used to compare the IG and CG on cluster-level outcomes. We compared the IG and CG on individual-level outcomes reflecting change from baseline to endline survey on selected indicators using generalised estimating equations (GEE) regressions adjusted for village-level clustering using an exchangeable correlation structure. Additional analyses considered GEE models adjusted simultaneously for village-level clustering, maternal education and wealth quintile. These analyses included participants with complete data; complementary analyses explored results for participants with incomplete data.</p><p>The study will be prospectively registered in an international trial registry before starting the main trial.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Primary outcomes</title><p>Village recruitment and the baseline survey occurred between 12 January and 3 February 2014. Four villages were replaced prior to randomisation, one due to failure to meet inclusion criteria, and three due to surveyor error during the baseline survey. A surveyor administered components of the baseline survey in the wrong order. Randomisation assignments were released to the core study team on 4 February 2014 and communicated in person to all 12 villages on 7 and 8 February 2014. The intervention began immediately thereafter and ran for 4&#x02005;months as planned. The endline survey was initiated on May 27th and completed by 30 June 2014.</p><p>Feasibility criteria related to recruitment, randomisation and retention were satisfied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015007972F1">figure 1</xref>). All villages contacted (100%, 16/16) agreed to participate and accepted randomisation. Thirty-six women were recruited in 100% (12/12) of villages randomised. No clusters were lost to follow-up. The main analysis included 86% (373/432) of participants, 90% (195/216) from the IG and 82% (178/216) from the CG.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015007972F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of progress of clusters and individuals through the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015007972f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Baseline data</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015007972TB2">Table&#x000a0;2</xref> presents characteristics of the study sample.

(2) Intervention fidelity was excellent. (3) Community participation was high but weaker in the CG. (4) As hypothesised, use of a toll-free number was higher in the IG than in the CG. Notwithstanding, call volumes were low overall. (5) No clear conclusions could be drawn concerning trends in immunisation centre footfall. (6) Multiple analyses revealed a very strong effect of the immunisation intervention on individual participant learning, but results were variable across indicators.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Methodological lessons for the planned main study</title><p>Reflection on pilot findings and experiences suggests several lessons for the future study.
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Study groups were unbalanced on characteristics likely to be related to study participation and child vaccination status, with IG participants systematically disadvantaged as compared to controls. (i) During the pilot, we adopted two strategies to enhance community partnership, and to ensure participation of households and individuals. First, we learned to cultivate support from influential members of the community and to seek their help in motivating others to join the study. Second, we diversified our field teams to include under-represented groups. We view these strategies as essential to successful recruitment, randomisation and retention. (ii) Randomisation failed to achieve balance between study arms due to the small number of clusters involved in this pilot study. The future study should consider design options to improve balance, and to increase study power and precision, such as inclusion of a larger number of clusters, stratification<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and restricted randomisation using balancing criteria.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> (iii) Substantively, pilot results show that the intervention was successful on many measures in a very disadvantaged population.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Although intervention fidelity was excellent, the value of a parallel control intervention was unclear. Through discussion with our study teams, we learned that active presence of field staff in control villages led to opportunities for contamination as villagers requested field team members to share information and advice on child health themes raised by the baseline survey. All content for the main study should likely be delivered through an intervention arm.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The first round of community discussions was delivered as one large gathering per village. In the CG, the first community discussion coincided with local religious festivals in two of the six control villages, while in one control village, people were reluctant to meet together due to caste and class divisions. The second and third community discussions were delivered in rounds of three to six smaller meetings per village, and groups were more homogeneous with respect to age, sex and status. This strategy was more effective.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Use of a toll-free number was lower than anticipated. To our surprise, in endline discussions with the community we learned that the toll-free service was extremely valued. However, active presence of our field teams meant that questions were addressed preferentially to them. Toll-free and KTE intervention components should not be evaluated together.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Administrative data on immunisation were inadequate for scientific use. The Government of India is investing to improve vital statistics using biometric and digital technologies. Until this process reaches maturity, the future main study should consider undertaking a census of participating villages at baseline to determine target population denominators.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Analysis of individual participant survey responses showed a compelling effect for some but not all components of the main vaccine intervention on proxy outcomes. (i) These results provide an evidence base to improve aspects of the main intervention prior to fielding the larger study. Different communication methods were used for the different components. (ii) Results also encouraged us to consider the adequacy of our questionnaires. We used a previously developed survey with only marginal modifications.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Questions were only distantly related to the study interventions to ensure that both study groups had a reasonable chance to reply correctly. Questions related to the immunisation card may have been difficult to interpret. The main end point of the future study will be immunisation status rather than knowledge or health literacy, avoiding some of these difficulties. (iii) The intervention had an indirect effect. In our sample, community participants had higher scores than the mothers who were the target participants, with fathers having the highest scores on average. This likely reflects how gender biases shape ability to learn over the life course in this context. The community sample was not randomly selected.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This pilot study provided rich lessons to inform design of a future trial and to refine interventions.
