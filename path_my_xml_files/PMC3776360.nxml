From an ongoing randomized controlled trial, 30-day text response rates of participants assigned to the intervention (individualized texting for adherence building (iTAB), <italic>n</italic> = 20) were compared to those in the active comparison condition (<italic>n</italic> = 9). Both groups received daily texts assessing methamphetamine use, and the iTAB group additionally received personalized daily ART adherence reminder texts. Response rate for methamphetamine use texts was 72.9% with methamphetamine use endorsed 14.7% of the time. Text-derived methamphetamine use data was correlated with data from a structured substance use interview covering the same time period (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The iTAB group responded to 69.0% of adherence reminder texts; among those responses, 81.8% endorsed taking ART medication. Standardized feedback questionnaire responses indicated little difficulty with the texts, satisfaction with the study, and beliefs that future text-based interventions would be helpful. Moreover, most participants believed the intervention reduced methamphetamine use and improved adherence. Qualitative feedback regarding the intervention was positive. Future studies will refine and improve iTAB for optimal acceptability and efficacy.

Introduction</title><p>Mobile health (mHealth) interventions aiming to enhance health behaviors have recently proliferated [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. mHealth strategies are designed to be integrated into the everyday lives of patients in order to minimize barriers to intervention implementation and facilitate use and generalizability [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Both the mobility and popularity of cell phones make it possible to remotely deliver services to assist people with behavior modification and disease self-management [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], thereby improving health outcomes. Short-message service (SMS; i.e., text messaging), in particular, represents a low-cost route to promoting health behaviors, such as treatment adherence, due to the ubiquitous nature of this technology on mobile devices. Furthermore, SMS technology supports interactivity (e.g., two-way communication) and can be personalized at the individual level [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Thoughtful mHealth interventions grounded in behavior change theory may therefore be particularly advantageous in advancing aspects of health care (e.g., delivery and assessment). Despite relatively few high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) supporting mHealth tools, several interventions to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have yielded positive results [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. ART is currently the standard of care for persons infected with HIV, and effective adherence to ART is the key to deriving therapeutic benefit [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. SMS-based interventions have begun to show efficacy in promoting ART adherence in RCTs but are currently in the early stages of development and refinement [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. mHealth interventions have potential to decrease barriers to traditional ART adherence interventions, particularly in difficult-to-track groups because they ameliorate obstacles such as transportation, insurance, and physical limitations [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Substance users are one such high-risk subgroup of persons living with HIV who have been documented to be especially nonadherent to ART [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Taken together, HIV+ substance users may represent both a critical and feasible target of public health significance for such mHealth adherence interventions.</p><p>In addition to ART adherence, substance use behaviors may also be a potential target for assessment or modification via mHealth interventions. Notably, a recent survey involving patients in substance abuse treatment documented that the vast majority of patients reported having access to mobile phones (91%) and to text messaging (79%) [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Challenges remain in accurately assessing risk of relapse among substance users, and mHealth technologies may be able to assist by obtaining &#x0201c;real time&#x0201d; data, such as self-reported mood and engagement in substance use. This &#x0201c;real time&#x0201d; data could potentially enable earlier relapse intervention and/or keep individuals continuously engaged in treatment. The deployment of mHealth for substance use disorder treatments is a developing area of research, and early work in this field is promising (see [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] for a review). To our knowledge, investigations using mHealth to promote ART adherence have not yet included or targeted persons with active substance use [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The use of mHealth technologies may therefore be efficacious in simultaneously monitoring and assessing medication adherence and substance use among persons with HIV infection and co-occurring substance use problems.</p><p>In the context of HIV infection, methamphetamine use may be a particularly relevant substance of abuse given the high comorbidity rate between these two conditions [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In fact, methamphetamine users are more likely to be HIV infected than opioid users in the western United States [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which is primarily facilitated by the link between methamphetamine use and risky sexual behaviors [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Importantly, recent methamphetamine use is particularly predictive of poor ART adherence (e.g., [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). Given that suboptimal ART adherence can lead to virologic rebound, development of medication-resistant strains of HIV, and more rapid progression to AIDS and death [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], sustained treatment and ART adherence is critical. </p><p>Based on the growing evidence supporting mHealth assessment and intervention, the ubiquity of SMS technology, and the critical need to improve ART adherence among persons with methamphetamine use and HIV infection, the overarching goal of the parent study was to develop and evaluate an SMS intervention to improve ART medication adherence among persons with methamphetamine use and HIV infection. While the RCT of the developed intervention (individualized texting for adherence building (iTAB)) is ongoing, the goals of this present study were to use preliminary data to (1) examine response rates to text messages regarding methamphetamine use and medication adherence, (2) determine whether our assessment of methamphetamine use gathered via SMS is consistent with self-report information of substance use gathered in a clinical interview (i.e., construct validity for methamphetamine use assessment via SMS), and (3) summarize preliminary participant feedback of the ongoing intervention. The rationale for reporting these preliminary data is driven by recent publications suggesting a more rapid approach to publishing behavioral intervention data, especially as it relates to the rapid dissemination of the content of mHealth interventions (e.g., [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). The information presented herein may be informative for the development of other mHealth interventions to improve health outcomes in difficult-to-treat individuals. </p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Method</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Participants</title><p>This report represents results from the first 29 HIV-infected active methamphetamine-dependent individuals (i.e., use within 30 days of baseline) enrolled in an ongoing pilot RCT designed to improve or maintain ART medication adherence. Target enrollment for this ongoing study is 50 individuals in the active condition (iTAB) and 25 individuals in the active comparison condition. The unbalanced design was chosen to maximize the ability to investigate the data from within the iTAB group. Of the 29 individuals presented here, 20 were assigned to the iTAB arm and 9 were assigned to the control arm. As this study was still ongoing, data were not available for all subjects for all outcomes. Analyses of SMS and substance use data included 21 participants (13 iTAB, 8 control); analyses of feedback questionnaires included 26 participants (17 iTAB, 9 control); and analyses of qualitative feedback interviews included 19 participants (12 iTAB, 7 control). The UCSD Human Research Protection Program approved the current study. Participants provided written informed consent to participate.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were the capacity to provide informed consent, age 18 years or older at enrollment, documentation of HIV infection, self-reported methamphetamine use within the last 30 days, DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of methamphetamine abuse or dependence via the Composite International Diagnostic Interview [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and an active prescription for an antiretroviral medication. Participants also had to be willing to respond to text messages and utilize electronic medication tracking devices (i.e., medication event monitoring system as previously described [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]) for the identified antiretroviral medication over the study period. Participants needed to show capability of responding to text messages at baseline by direct observation. Exclusion criteria were minimal in order to enhance generalizability and recruitment feasibility in that many of these individuals had several co-occurring conditions (e.g., psychiatric disorders, hepatitis C virus). Of note, plasma HIV viral load detectability was not an inclusionary criterion for the present study. Given that (1) methamphetamine use is a well-established risk factor for antiretroviral nonadherence, (2) self-reported antiretroviral adherence tends to overestimate actual adherence, (3) viral load detectability is dynamic, and costly to gather at a screening visit, and (4) recruitment of actively using methamphetamine HIV+ persons is difficult, we chose to enroll persons with both detectable and undetectable HIV viral loads.</p><p>Participants received monetary incentives for both the initial ($50) and follow-up assessments ($60). Participants were encouraged to use their own cell phones and were reimbursed for any additional costs incurred by participating in the study over their regular cell phone use. A mobile phone, not a smartphone, with a comprehensive texting plan was loaned to those participants who did not own a cell phone or were unable to receive text messages on their current phone (ten of 29 participants were provided a cell phone for use on the study).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Focus Groups and Intervention Development</title><p>The intervention was developed by means of a user-centered approach. Two focus groups, each with ten persons with methamphetamine abuse or dependence and HIV infection (not enrolled in the current study), were conducted to assess the feasibility of a text message intervention to improve adherence among this population, as well as to aid the development of SMS content for the intervention. In brief, focus group participants were recruited from large ongoing research studies of HIV infection and substance use. The focus groups generated broad barriers and facilitators for adherence and preferences for personalized reminder text messages to promote adherence using an mHealth intervention. Findings from these focus groups are described in a separate manuscript [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. As a result of these focus groups, 40 reminder text messages that fall into eight reminder themes were developed for use in the intervention. We piloted the intervention with five individuals (data not included in the current study) after the initial development and made further minor modifications accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial</title><p>These interim results represent randomized participants with the outcomes of interest (i.e., this was not an intent-to-treat analysis). Both the iTAB (<italic>n</italic> = 20) and control groups (<italic>n</italic> = 9) received the following intervention components. </p><sec id="sec2.3.1"><title>2.3.1. Medication Adherence Education</title><p>The medication adherence education included multiple components of previously successful medication interventions and published barriers to successful medication adherence among substance users [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The adherence education presented the importance of attention to medication maintenance, health benefits of adherence to ART medication, adverse medication and methamphetamine use effects, problems of adherence for methamphetamine users, and practical medication adherence strategies. The medication adherence psychoeducation was delivered via PowerPoint, lasted approximately 30 minutes, and provided time for the participants to ask questions and speak about their own experiences adhering to medications. </p></sec><sec id="sec2.3.2"><title>2.3.2. Creation Process of Personalized Reminder and Reinforcement Text Messages</title><p>During the medication adherence presentation, all participants were informed about the use of reminder strategies (e.g., creating a &#x0201c;note to self&#x0201d; to put in a visible place or writing a reminder on a calendar) to facilitate their antiretroviral adherence. Participants assigned to iTAB then selected, modified, and/or created ten personalized reminder text messages working from a list of 40 predetermined text message reminders. Participants in the control group also selected ten messages from the same list that were printed on one sheet of plain white paper for them to take home and use as they desired. For example, a participant might write the messages on sticky notes around his or her home or set reminders on their own phones as discussed in the psychoeducational portion of the study. The control group did not receive daily ART reminder text messages during the intervention. </p><p>In addition to the personalized reminder text messages, participants in the iTAB group also selected ten reinforcement text messages working from a list of 20 predetermined choices (e.g., &#x0201c;Great job, every dose helps&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Keep up the good work.&#x0201d;). Participants also had the option of writing their own reinforcement text messages and/or modifying the existing messages. The reinforcement text messages were sent to reinforce events where the participant reported taking his or her medication.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3.3"><title>2.3.3. Text Messages to Evaluate Daily Methamphetamine Use</title><p>Both groups received a daily text message asking if they had used methamphetamine in the last 24 hours. To protect the participants from any potential legal or personal ramifications associated with disclosure of methamphetamine use, the word &#x0201c;methamphetamine,&#x0201d; or variants thereof, were not included in the text messages. Instead, as a proxy for a direct question about methamphetamine use, at the baseline visit, participants were instructed to respond to a daily 9&#x02009;a.m. message inquiring: &#x0201c;Have you done anything in the past 24 hours? (Y) yes (N) no.&#x0201d; It was further emphasized that answering either &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; to this question would not impact individuals' participation in the adherence study. </p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. iTAB Specific Intervention Components</title><p>In addition to selecting individualized reminder and reinforcement text messages, participants in the iTAB group provided his/her preferred name and a description of their tracked medication (e.g., &#x0201c;the white pill&#x0201d;) to be used in the messages. Participants were guided to use a description of the medication rather than the name of the medication itself in order to avoid a potentially stigmatizing medication name appearing in the content of the text message. The participant and examiner identified appropriate time(s) for the reminder text message (i.e., once daily or twice daily, depending on the instructions for the ART regimen). An example reminder message might read, &#x0201c;John, it's med time! Pls take ur big blue pill now. Pls reply (A) took (D) didn't (G) snooze.&#x0201d; A reinforcement message might read, &#x0201c;Great job! Ur current adherence: 75%. Adhr when u take ur next dose: 80% (4/5 doses).&#x0201d;</p><p>Additionally, the automated system sent out a &#x0201c;noncompliance&#x0201d; message to the participant after three consecutive days of missed messages, and an alert was sent to the study coordinator. The study coordinator had real-time access to participant response logs to identify problems and contact participants who were having difficulties responding to the system (i.e., two days after &#x0201c;noncompliance&#x0201d; message if still no response).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Intervention Feedback</title><p>At the final visit, participants were given a standardized feedback questionnaire using Likert-type response options. Questions addressed ease of understanding/problems with reminder text messages, overall satisfaction with the study, self-perceived efficacy as it relates to participation in the study, and likelihood of using the system in the future. Questions with response options are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>. To bolster the feedback questionnaire data, participants completed a semistructured feedback interview regarding their involvement in the study. Specifically, participants were asked to describe their experience in participating in the study and to comment on the text messages. </p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>2.6. Other Assessments</title><sec id="sec2.6.1"><title>2.6.1. 30-Day Substance Use Interview</title><p>At followup, subjects were administered a detailed substance use interview, recording both frequency and quantity of methamphetamine use. To allow for direct comparison to text message responses regarding methamphetamine use, only methamphetamine use during the 30-day study period was analyzed. Similarly, only the last 30 days of text message data were considered for subjects whose visit interval covered a period longer than 30 days. </p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.7"><title>2.7. Statistical Analyses</title><p>Comparison of positive versus negative responses to the SMS methamphetamine use messages (i.e., use versus nonuse) was examined using a matchedpairs <italic>t</italic>-test. Additionally, analyses examining associations between SMS methamphetamine use responses and self-reported substance use obtained by the 30-day Substance Use Interview were determined using nonparametric Spearman's rho correlations. The standardized feedback questionnaire data were summarized as response proportions for various Likert-type scales. Pearson chi-squared tests were conducted to compare responses on the standardized feedback questionnaire. Quantitative statistical analyses were performed using JMP 9.0.2 Statistical Software.</p><p>Transcripts of the semistructured feedback interview were analyzed in the following manner. The content of each interview was audio taped and subsequently transcribed by a single study investigator (Shereen Georges). The transcripts were then independently coded, based on emergent themes, by two investigators (Jessica L. Montoya &#x00026; Shereen Georges). Segments of the transcript could be assigned more than one code. Disagreements in description or assignment of codes were resolved by consensus among investigators and led to the refinement of codes. The final coding structure of the transcripts was reviewed to determine the level of agreement in the codes applied. Data analysis was performed using QSR International's NVivo9 qualitative data analysis software.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>3.1. Demographics and Sample Characteristics</title><p>Participants in the present study were, on average, middle-aged non-Caucasian males with approximately one year of college education. In terms of HIV disease, approximately two-thirds had undetectable viral loads. Details of the sample are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. There were no significant differences between the groups for any of the variables shown. Participants were monitored for an average of 29.9 days (range: 29-30).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2. iTAB Condition: ART Reminder Text Messages</title><p>Among persons assigned to the iTAB condition, the overall mean response rate to medication reminder text messages was 69.0%. Participants rarely responded that they did not take ART medications (3.6%). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1(a)</xref> shows the response pattern to the adherence reminder text messages. </p><p>Using a matched pairs analysis among the iTAB group, participants were significantly more likely to respond that they had been adherent than to indicate nonadherence (&#x0201c;took&#x0201d; responses: <italic>M</italic> = 19.08, SD = 9.3 versus &#x0201c;didn't take&#x0201d; responses: <italic>M</italic> = 1.23, SD = 2.1; <italic>t</italic>&#x02009;&#x02009;(df = 12) = &#x02212;6.52, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>Among the received responses to adherence messages, we examined the proportion of responses indicating that the individual took his/her medications (81.8%), did not take his/her medication (5.3%), or sent a snooze response indicating that they would like to receive a reminder in an hour (12.9%). That is, the denominator used in these calculations represents the number of received participant responses of any type (i.e., &#x0201c;took,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;did not,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;snooze&#x0201d;), but does not include instances where the participant failed to respond to the adherence text message.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>3.3. Text Message Assessment of Methamphetamine Use</title><p>The overall mean response rate to the methamphetamine use text messages was 72.9% (<italic>M</italic> = 21.3 responses per participant), while the overall mean nonresponse rate was 27.0% (<italic>M</italic> = 7.9 nonresponses per participant). </p><p>Examining response patterns among participants in both groups, we observed that participants were more likely to indicate that they were not using methamphetamine via the SMS messages than to indicate that they were using methamphetamine (&#x0201c;no&#x0201d;: 18.2 days, 62.2% versus &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d;: 3.1 days, 10.7%; <italic>t</italic> = 10.3&#x02009;&#x02009;(df = 20), <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). An overall pie chart showing response rates for the SMS methamphetamine question, including instances where the participant did not respond, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>.</p><p>Similar to the approach used above for the adherence messages and in order to control for instances where participants failed to respond to SMS message of methamphetamine use, relative values of methamphetamine use and abstinence were calculated by dividing the number of SMS messages indicating use or nonuse by the number of total responses by the participant (versus across the total study period). Using this method, participants indicated adjusted methamphetamine use 14.7% of the time and non-use 85.3% of the time across the study period.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>3.4. Comparison of 30-Day Substance Use Interview and Daily Methamphetamine Text Message Data</title><p>Using data derived from the examiner administered semistructured interview reviewing methamphetamine use over the 30-day study period (and thus directly overlapping with the time period of SMS methamphetamine use reporting), participants reported actively using methamphetamine 27.3% of the time (<italic>M</italic> = 8.2 days).

In terms of feedback on the text messages, participants across both groups reported no difficulties with understanding the text messages (94% iTAB versus 89% control). Additionally, the majority of participants indicated that they experienced no interference with their daily activities by receiving daily text messages (76% iTAB versus 100% control). Similarly, results indicated high overall satisfaction with participation in this study (65% iTAB versus 44% control reported being &#x0201c;extremely satisfied&#x0201d;). In terms of self-perceived efficacy, iTAB participants reported that the daily methamphetamine text message (i.e., &#x0201c;Have you done anything in the past 24 hours?&#x0201d;) may have influenced their use behaviors: 35% reported they used &#x0201c;a lot less,&#x0201d; 35% reported they used &#x0201c;a little less,&#x0201d; and 24% reported using &#x0201c;about the same.&#x0201d; Control participants, on the other hand, reported using methamphetamine &#x0201c;about the same&#x0201d; 44% of the time, while 22% of controls reported using &#x0201c;a lot less&#x0201d; and 33% reported using &#x0201c;a little less.&#x0201d; Responses related to intervention influences on changes in ART medication adherence were as follows: &#x0201c;about the same&#x0201d; (29% iTAB versus 33% control), &#x0201c;a little better&#x0201d; (24% iTAB versus 56% control), and &#x0201c;much better&#x0201d; (35% iTAB versus 0% control). Overall, most participants indicated that they would participate in similar studies in the future (71% iTAB versus 78% control) and that a text messaging intervention could be &#x0201c;very much&#x0201d; helpful to them in the future (59% iTAB versus 44% control).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.6"><title>3.6.

Discussion</title><p>The present study shows preliminary evidence of feasibility and acceptability of an SMS intervention to gather data on methamphetamine use and to provide adherence reminders among persons with HIV infection and recent methamphetamine use. The significant positive correlation between SMS and interview-based methamphetamine use reports provides preliminary support for the construct validity of methamphetamine use assessment via SMS. Participants also responded to the adherence reminder message system approximately two-thirds of the time, reported very few difficulties in understanding the messages, and provided positive feedback regarding the intervention. Thus, an SMS messaging system targeting both substance use evaluation and medication adherence improvement appears feasible to implement in this difficult-to-treat group.</p><p>Accurately capturing details of substance use has traditionally posed a challenging problem for substance use researchers and providers [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. There have been recent advances using portable technology for real-time monitoring of drug cravings and use (e.g., [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]). Our preliminary evidence is consistent with these previous publications. Using calculations from the days when participants responded to SMS messages, individuals reported methamphetamine use on approximately 14.7% of days (as compared to 27.3% using a retrospective interview approach). The slightly lower rate of methamphetamine use as obtained via SMS may be attributed to (1) the potential that, on the days that participants failed to respond, they may have been using methamphetamine, (2) a hesitancy from some individuals to report methamphetamine use via SMS, (3) the difficulty of recalling information over longer periods of time for the interview, which was conducted at the final study visit, (4) the use of a nondirect question about methamphetamine use to secure participant privacy, and/or (5) a combination of these factors. It is important to note that the SMS assessment of methamphetamine use was embedded in a study focused on medication adherence and therefore was not the exclusive focus of the study. Moreover, it is possible that receiving text message inquiries about methamphetamine use during the study may have influenced retrospective self-reporting of substance use behavior at the study follow-up visit.</p><p>On the structured feedback questionnaire, 70% of persons reported that they believed that the daily methamphetamine use text message made them use a little to a lot less methamphetamine. Qualitative feedback gathered from a semistructured interview supported the idea that, in general, participants viewed the methamphetamine text messages favorably because they helped maintain the goal of abstinence. For example, during the interview one participant described how the methamphetamine text message kept abstinence at the forefront of his mind. Thus, self-monitoring methamphetamine use via text messages may be a useful and an easy way for participants to monitor and/or gain insight to the frequency of their methamphetamine use. This may be particularly important for a group of individuals that are known to have attention and memory deficits [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>In acknowledgment of the potential detrimental effects of inquiring about methamphetamine use on a daily basis, we observed one participant who believed that the daily messages regarding methamphetamine use may have served as a trigger for subsequent and continued use. On the standardized feedback questionnaire, this same participant endorsed that the daily methamphetamine use text made him use &#x0201c;a lot more.&#x0201d; Additionally, this participant described feeling resentment regarding the need to take medications as a result of his participation in the study, even though he had been on an ART regimen for the prior two years. Although the majority of participants indicated satisfaction with the various study components, a text message specifically inquiring about substance use may not be appropriate for all current substance users. Further research is needed to determine the individual factors that influence positive and negative experiences of a daily assessment of substance use behaviors.</p><p>Participants enrolled in the iTAB condition demonstrated similar engagement with the adherence text messages as was illustrated with the methamphetamine messages (i.e., iTAB participants responded to 69.0% of the adherence reminder text messages). One interesting response pattern is that participants rarely chose the &#x0201c;didn't [take]&#x0201d; response to the adherence reminder texts. This response pattern may reflect the possibility that the participants were, in fact, largely ART adherent and simply forgot, or did not have time, to respond to the text message promptly. Alternatively, the results may indicate that participants opted not to respond rather than admit nonadherence. Given that there is rich data in why individuals fail to take medications, subsequent interventions and feedback questions should focus on why participants rarely choose the option of reporting missed doses; future studies could then incorporate this information in development of novel approaches to better ascertain those data (e.g., softer language or reinforcers, such as &#x0201c;did not get to it today,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;you'll get it next time!&#x0201d; versus simply &#x0201c;did not take&#x0201d;). The current iTAB system is designed such that a &#x0201c;didn't [take]&#x0201d; response triggers a follow-up text regarding reasons for the missed dose. Participants may have wanted to avoid this additional text. Responses to the feedback questionnaire item, &#x0201c;Receiving text messages interfered with my daily activities,&#x0201d; provides some indication that fewer messages may have been more optimal. Specifically, none of the control participants indicated that the daily messages interfered with daily activities whereas 24% of the iTAB participants endorsed some interference with daily activities. Of note, iTAB participants received more text messages than the control participants thereby adding to the overall burden of participation for iTAB participants and possibly negatively impacting responding rates. In addition, there is some indication in mHealth HIV adherence research suggesting that fewer text messages may be optimal for adherence and participant engagement and satisfaction [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Future research is needed to tackle the trade-off between providing fewer text messages (to improve participant acceptability) and providing a sufficiently intense intervention to be effective (improve adherence). Moreover, the research literature has not yet explored the possibility of allowing participants the ability to control the frequency of messages. Detailed examinations of the content of adherence messages, ranging from simple messages not specifically addressing adherence (e.g., &#x0201c;How are you?&#x0201d;) to more complex messages intended to be motivating and targeted at health promotion (e.g., &#x0201c;People care about you&#x02026;&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Not taking your meds could make you resistant&#x02026;&#x0201d;) are also warranted. Finally, determining whether there are specific HIV-infected subpopulations for which a given type of messaging may or may not work is also worthy of investigation.</p><p>Although there were not significant differences between the iTAB and control groups on the standardized feedback questionnaire, participants generally reported a positive experience. Explicitly, the feedback from participants showed that 94% of iTAB individuals were at least somewhat satisfied with the intervention as compared to 66% of control participants, 35% of individuals in the iTAB group reported that the intervention made their medication adherence &#x0201c;much better&#x0201d; as compared to 0% of individuals in the control group endorsing this response, indicating some specificity of the ART text messages to adherence behaviors. Perhaps more interesting is the fact that 56% of the control group felt that the text messages about methamphetamine use made adherence at least &#x0201c;a little better.&#x0201d; Therefore, participants in the control condition may have generalized their engagement with substance use assessment text messages (i.e., methamphetamine use) to other health behaviors beyond the content of the messages (i.e., adherence). Thus, reminder messages, perhaps regardless of content, in the context of a stated goal to improve medication adherence may be useful. The process of receiving messages on a daily basis may, therefore, instill a sense of health behavior accountability in participants. Additionally, data from the open-ended feedback interview suggests the possibility that participants felt supported by the intervention. This finding is consistent with previous work in which social support has been identified as an important factor for positive adherence outcomes [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Participants also clearly indicated that they would be willing to participate in future studies, with approximately three-quarters of individuals endorsing that they would &#x0201c;very much&#x0201d; like to participate in future studies of this type. Participants additionally indicated that a text messaging intervention such as the study described here would be &#x0201c;very much&#x0201d; helpful (59%) to them in the future. These data suggest that interventions such as the one described here may be scalable and that uptake may be feasible in future studies.</p><p>There are several limitations to the current study that should be mentioned. This was a small sample of convenience taken from an ongoing RCT. As a result, the data are more descriptive than is typically reported, and we do not yet have objective outcome data on whether the intervention changed the target behavior of adherence or non-target behaviors such as substance use. With that said, participants were generally responsive and positive about the intervention. We cannot rule out that any perceived benefits of the study simply represented subject-expectancy effects (e.g., the participant feels compelled to say she or he liked the intervention). An additional limitation of reporting data from an ongoing RCT was that data were not available for all subjects for all outcomes. Recent research advocates the use of imputation-based strategies to handle &#x0201c;nonignorable&#x0201d; missing data [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], which future analyses may employ. As previously noted, a measure of ART adherence was not used as inclusionary/exclusionary criteria. Thus, although the study was designed to improve ART adherence among active methamphetamine users, it is possible that the study features are only capable of maintaining, worsening, or having no effect on adherence for already adherent participants. Finally, we are not able to examine predictors of non-adherence at the present time because outcome data are still pending. Nonetheless, the information provided, specifically as it relates to the feasibility and validity of the SMS methamphetamine use, is novel.</p><p>Future directions for mHealth interventions are numerous. Specifically, future mHealth interventions could target the reduction of substance use behaviors by replicating components of traditional substance use interventions in supportive text messaging. Alternatively, interventions could build on existing social networks by texting a friend or family member when substance use is reported, take advantage of geolocation tools by sending messages about areas that may serve as triggers for substance use, and/or provide resource information such time and location of the next Narcotics Anonymous meeting. There are challenges with the larger implementation of these interventions as well, such as who would fund or support the messaging systems in the clinic setting. For optimal delivery, systems would need to be integrated into existing large-scale electronic health systems.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the results of this preliminary analysis of an ongoing RCT to improve medication adherence and assess methamphetamine use show that SMS messaging is feasible, acceptable, and perceived to be helpful. Importantly, we provide initial support that endorsement of methamphetamine use via text messaging was externally valid in comparison to retrospective reports. Results regarding the ability of the iTAB intervention to lead to tangible changes in adherence behavior are pending the completion of this trial. mHealth interventions offer opportunities for reaching challenging and marginalized populations and may be a useful and low-cost approach to improving the health of people with co-occurring HIV infection and methamphetamine abuse or dependence.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was primarily supported by NIDA Award R34 DA31058 (Moore, PI).
