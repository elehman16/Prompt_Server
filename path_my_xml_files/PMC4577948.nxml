<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, smoking cessation trials which have attempted to target members of socially disadvantaged groups have usually achieved only small sample sizes and low consent rates.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Trials that draw samples from the general population are rarely powered to adequately examine outcomes according to social group.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> As a result, knowledge of effective ways to improve smoking cessation among socially disadvantaged groups is lacking.</p><p>Generally in health and medical research, groups from socioeconomically lower status have been under-represented. A recent comprehensive systematic review of the barriers to participation in medical research for disadvantaged groups were numerous, including difficulties in identifying and sampling&#x000a0;the hidden populations, mistrust of medical research and researcher, cultural or language barriers, low literacy, and low education levels.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>To improve consent rates for trials targeting samples from socially disadvantaged groups, it is important to gain an understanding of the characteristics of individuals who are likely to consent to participate in trials and those who are less able or willing to participate. This information can help inform the development of recruitment strategies for smoking cessation trials.</p><p>Few studies have compared the characteristics of smoking cessation trial participants to non-participants with smokers from socially disadvantaged groups.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In the USA, Warner <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> described the factors associated with eligible consenting smokers recruited from homelessness shelters returning for a randomisation appointment. The authors found that those who returned were older and more likely to have a phone contact than eligible participants who failed to return. This study is limited, however, in that it only compared a small number of factors affecting participation, and no data were available on those smokers who declined participation at the consent stage.</p><p>This paper will describe consent rates for a sample of socially disadvantaged smokers who were approached to participate in an Australian trial&#x02014;Call it Quits (CiQ)&#x02014;to increase cessation among a socially disadvantaged group of smokers.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In order to obtain a large sample of smokers who experience high levels of multiple forms of disadvantage including homelessness, unemployment, mental illness, substance abuse, and Indigenous status, recruitment took place within a non-government social and community service organisation (SCSO). These services provide a range of counselling, material (food and financial), and emergency welfare aid to people in need across Australia. Previous research has shown that smoking prevalence is between 60% and 70% among the adult clients of SCSOs.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> A number of evidence-based strategies were used to increase response rates for the trial,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> including the offer of smoking cessation support at no cost which included an offer of free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), financial reimbursement for time spent completing the trial surveys, the use of simple, low reading age study materials, and use of an engaging and acceptable computerised health survey.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The current study will examine the sociodemographic, smoking, alcohol use and psychosocial characteristics associated with consent to participate in the CiQ trial. Data for this study were collected during a baseline survey which was administered prior to seeking consent for the trial, enabling participant and non-participant characteristics to be compared. This provides new and unique information on the differences between smokers from socially disadvantaged groups who agree or decline consent to participate in a smoking cessation trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>A self-administered cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess eligibility for inclusion in a trial, to collect health-related data, and to collect baseline trial data. The CiQ trial, which has been described in detail elsewhere,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> is a randomised controlled trial of a five-session SCSO case-worker delivered smoking cessation intervention for socially disadvantaged smokers.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Setting and sample</title><p>Study participants were recruited from a large SCSO in regional NSW, Australia. Participants eligible for inclusion in the baseline cross-sectional survey were SCSO clients who were aged 18&#x02005;years and above, sufficiently fluent in English, and well enough on the day of recruitment to give informed consent and complete a survey. SCSO clients who presented as agitated, distressed or under the influence of alcohol or other drugs were ineligible to participate. Individuals from socially disadvantaged groups are expected clients of these services, including those who are Aboriginal Australians, unemployed and living on government welfare, homeless, with a mental illness or drug addiction, and young single parents.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Most SCSO clients report multiple forms of disadvantage.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Procedures</title><p>A two-stage consent process was used where clients were asked to: (1) consent to complete a general health survey, and if they completed the survey and were identified as eligible; (2) were asked to consent to participate in a smoking cessation trial. Initially, all clients who presented for their SCSO appointment were informed by staff that the service was involved in a university health survey. SCSO staff asked eligible clients interested in participating to present to the Research Assistant (RA) who reassessed eligibility, provided the client with a participant information statement and sought written consent to participate in a health survey. Those clients who completed the computer-administered health survey and were identified during the survey as current tobacco smokers, viewed a final survey screen inviting participation in further research where they may receive a service-based smoking cessation programme. The RA provided willing clients with the CiQ trial participant information statement and sought written consent for participation in the trial.</p><p>All participants who completed the health survey received a $20 grocery voucher, regardless of whether or not they enrolled into the CiQ trial. During recruitment, those participants who were eligible for the trial were advised that they would receive a further $50 voucher at each follow-up data collection period (1 and 6&#x02005;months). All study procedures were approved by the University of Newcastle's Human Research Ethics Committee (H-2010-1002).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Survey instrument</title><p>A 62-item computer survey was administered using Digivey survey software.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> To assess eligibility for inclusion in the smoking cessation trial, the following two items were used to determine smoking status: (1) &#x0201c;Do you currently smoke tobacco products?&#x0201d;, with the following response options (A) &#x0201c;Yes, daily&#x0201d; (B)&#x0201d;Yes, at least once a week&#x0201d; (C) &#x0201c;Yes, but less often than once a week&#x0201d; and (D) &#x0201c;No, not at all&#x0201d; and; (2) &#x0201c;Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes or a similar amount of tobacco in your life?&#x0201d; with response options (A) &#x02018;Yes&#x02019; (B) &#x02018;No&#x02019; (C) &#x02018;Not sure&#x02019;.

first study to examine the characteristics that distinguish socially disadvantaged smokers who consent to participate in a smoking cessation trial from those who do not. A large range of personal characteristics were examined and a number of these differentiated the participants in the trial from non-participants. Lower enjoyment of smoking, higher motivation to quit smoking, preference for gradual reduction approach for cessation, and high numbers of family and friends who smoke were associated with consent into a smoking cessation trial for a sample of socially disadvantaged smokers.</p><p>The extent of socioeconomic disadvantage experienced by the sample is worth noting. The sample consisted of adults with high rates of homelessness, anxiety and depression, alcohol abuse, self-identification as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples and low education attainment. The sample displayed exceptionally low income with 84% reporting income well below the Australian single-person &#x02018;poverty line&#x02019; of $500 per week,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and 94% dependent on government benefits as their main source of income. The high consent rate (74%) from those eligible to enter the trial may be due to interest in seeking assistance to quit smoking, that is, the offer, made during recruitment, of free NRT if randomised to the intervention group, as well as financial reimbursements for their time. Notwithstanding the socioeconomic disadvantage of the clients in the sample, these incentives may be particularly attractive to individuals under financial strain.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>It is important to identify those factors which might motivate socially disadvantaged smokers to participate in smoking cessation trials. Some factors associated with intrinsic motivation to quit were found to differentiate participants from non-participants. Enjoyment of smoking was found to be associated with participation whereby those who reported ambivalence or uncertainty regarding their enjoyment of smoking had lower odds of participation relative to those reporting not enjoying smoking. As expected, higher rating of motivation to stop smoking was associated with greater odds of participation in the cessation trial. There is a need to increase interest in participating in smoking cessation research among smokers who may not be motivated to quit smoking.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Use of motivational interviewing techniques during recruitment warrants further consideration. There were also greater odds of participation in the trial for those preferring an approach to quitting that allowed a gradual reduction in smoking, relative to no preference. Reduce to quit approaches have been found to be effective for cessation.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> There may be a need to offer a &#x02018;reduce to quit&#x02019; approach which is likely to attract smokers from socially disadvantaged groups to cessation trials. Having higher numbers of family and friends who smoke was a surprising association with consent to participate. Socially disadvantaged smokers report low social support to quit smoking and being embedded in a social network and context of smoking.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Perhaps for these smokers, the offer of possibly receiving a smoking cessation programme was an opportunity to gain some assistance in their attempts to quit smoking.</p><p>The current results may also aid stop smoking services develop strategies for attracting socially disadvantaged smokers. Some studies have examined the characteristics of smokers attending smoking cessation clinics.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Using largely observational data, these studies have found that the UK-based stop smoking services have been successful at attracting smokers from socioeconomically disadvantaged areas<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and that this has translated into increased abstinence rates for 1&#x02005;year.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Study limitations</title><p>There are a number of study limitations which should be considered. The two-stage recruitment process, while useful in providing depth and breadth of information about trial participants and non-participants, excluded eligible individuals who were not interested or did not consent to the initial health survey. There is low probability of systematic biases during recruitment given that the consent rate in the health survey was high (96%) among those who did approach the RA, and attempts were made to ensure that at this stage no reference to the smoking cessation trial was made by describing the survey as a &#x02018;general health survey&#x02019;, ensuring that smokers were just as likely as non-smokers to participate. However, we do not know how many clients were not referred to the RA and did not approach the RA. Although staff was asked to refer all eligible clients to the RA, there is the possibility that some were missed or that some clients did not approach the RA. A further study limitation is that external factors not explored in this study, such as lack of time, a high crisis situation for visiting the SCSO and low literacy levels, may also contribute to non-participation.</p><p>In conclusion, based on current results, it would appear important that smoking cessation trials that aim to recruit socially disadvantaged smokers incorporate recruitment strategies that provide extrinsic and intrinsic motivational techniques such as financial reimbursements; use of known and acceptable settings, for example, the SCSO services; intervention components, including NRT at no cost; offers of &#x02018;reduce to quit&#x02019; strategies; and motivational interviewing components. Given the increasing urgency for conducting methodologically sound smoking cessation trials for smokers from socially disadvantaged groups, the results of this study are pertinent.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Leah Zoszak, Emma Walter and Gamze Abramov for their assistance in data collection.
