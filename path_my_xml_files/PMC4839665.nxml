Iron deficiency anemia affects approximately one-quarter of the world&#x02019;s population [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Meanwhile, iron overload has also become a prominent public health issue. A national report showed constant high prevalence (&#x0003e;30%) of iron overload (ferritin concentration &#x0003e;200 &#x003bc;g/L) between 1999&#x02013;2002 in U.S. men of 20 years and older [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A survey of the year 2005 in Beijing and Shanghai of China indicated that 10.6% of men (ferritin concentration &#x0003e; 300 &#x003bc;g/L) and 14.7% of women (ferritin &#x0003e; 200 &#x003bc;g/L) exhibited iron overload [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As the body lacks of active iron excretion mechanisms and thus human body iron balance is regulated by absorption [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], high iron intake and /or stores are reportedly associated with increased risks of chronic diseases such as pre-diabetes, chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and colorectal cancer [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to correctly plan the iron intake in diets.</p><p>To help people better plan diets and/or evaluate nutrient status of individuals and groups, dietary reference values [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153885.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and dietary reference intakes (DRIs) [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] have been suggested in Europe, USA, Canada, East Asia countries, and in China. The present DRIs in China [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] were mainly based on a 2000 Chinese Total Diet Study (unpublished data). With the recent progress in the related fundamental studies and update of the data relating to the national dietary status, the values for DRIs need to be accordingly adjusted. Therefore, DRIs should be updated in China to more accurately reflect the requirement of nutrients of Chinese population. For the setting of iron DRI, it is essential to accurately estimate the bioavailability of dietary iron. However, currently there lacks of available data that can be used directly for the setting of Chinese iron DRIs. Dietary iron comprises heme iron (mainly from animal tissues) and non-heme iron (mainly from plant foods). Compared with the heme iron, non-heme iron generally has much lower bioavailability [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], suggesting that the determination of non-heme iron absorption and utilization is key for the setting of iron DRIs.</p><p>The absorption of iron may differ significantly with various diet- and host-related variables, including the chemical forms of the nutrients and means of cooking and processing (diet-related), presence of enhancers and inhibitors of iron absorption (diet-related), life-stage, and nutritional and health status (host-related) [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153885.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It was reported that iron absorption from typical Latin American diets ranged from 7.5% to 13.4% [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and that the overall iron bioavailability from a mixed American or Canadian diet was 18% [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. WHO/FAO proposed iron bioavailability of 15%, 12%, 10%, or 5%, depending on the dietary composition and other factors [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Studies from the United States, Europe and Mexico revealed large variations in mean non-heme iron absorption (0.7&#x02013;22.9%) from whole diets [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], indicating there lacks agreement in relation to non-heme iron absorption both between and within countries. In addition to dietary patterns, there are big genetic differences between the Chinese population and those from other countries. For example, the incidence of the HFE gene mutations contributing to hemochromatosis as a disorder that causes excess high iron absorption [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153885.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] is low in Chinese Han population (major Chinese population) than in white populations [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, it is difficult to directly refer to related iron absorption data from foreign studies. In addition, since the iron absorption depends on iron status, dietary enhancers and inhibitors, etc., extrapolation of the present findings to other countries such as China will require additional high-quality controlled trials [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It was therefore recommended that domestic data should be preferred when setting the iron DRIs in different countries. Moreover, the iron absorption data from single meals is often different from whole diets, which cannot be correctly used to estimate dietary iron absorption. The iron absorption data should be obtained from the whole diets.</p><p>The stable isotope labeling technique is currently the most accurate method for determining dietary mineral absorption and utilization through the oral administration of a single isotope or two isotopes (i.e. one given orally and the other intravenously [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the non-heme iron absorption and biological utilization from typical whole Chinese diets in young Chinese healthy urban men using a double-labeled stable isotope technique, and thus to generate some data base from which bioavailability values could be derived for setting iron DRIs for the Chinese population. In addition, considering China is a large country where the dietary patterns vary among the different parts, this study was also to observe if the non-heme iron absorption and utilization could be affected by the staple food patterns of Southern and Northern China. This study will provide a basis for the setting of Chinese iron DRIs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty-two eligible young Chinese healthy urban men (11 from Southern China and 11 from Northern China) aged 18&#x02013;24 years were randomly recruited between January 2010 and March 2011 from Bethune Military Medical College (Shijiazhuang, Heibei, China). Subjects did not take any vitamins or mineral supplements at least one month before the experiment. Subjects with diseases (such as malabsorption and ulcer) that could affect the iron absorption or with chronic or acute inflammatory diseases, and those regularly taking medication that could affect iron absorption were excluded. In particular, accurate examinations were conducted to exclude subjects with abnormal iron nutrition statuses and potential inflammation.</p><p>Rice and wheat belong to the most consumed cereals in the world, and rice and wheat-prepared buns are also major staple foods in China. On the basis of respecting their conventional dietary inhabits as possible and obtainment of their agreement, 22 eligible subjects were then randomly assigned to rice group (n = 11) and steamed buns group (n = 11), taking rice and steamed buns as the staple food, respectively. The trial was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (No: ChiCTR-TRC-09000580).

Meanwhile, the subjects were further observed the dietary habits and healthy conditions, and were also asked to fulfill some related questionnaires such as previous diseases and family history. On day 0, a baseline venous blood sample was drawn after an overnight fast to determine the serum levels of haemoglobin (Hb) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and other iron status indexes (i.e. unsaturated iron-binding capacity [UIBC], serum iron [SI], soluble transferrin receptor [sTfR], and serum ferritin [SF]). The baseline isotopic composition was also analyzed.

China has the largest (nearly 1.4 billion) population in the world, with the rice and wheat as the staple food in the Southern and Northern China, respectively. To determine the iron DRI value for Chinese population, it is rather important to observe the status of the dietary iron absorption from rice and wheat in Chinese population. With the help of a single-labeled stable isotope technique, Zhou et al. measured dietary iron absorption in 12 young Chinese Tibetan men (18&#x02013;24 years old) and obtained an overall absorption rate of 13.4% [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], but that study just reflected the iron absorption in a very small portion of Chinese population because these subjects lived in the high altitude area and had great differences in diet patterns, iron nutritional status and genetic background from most of the other Chinese populations. Until now no available data can be used directly for the setting of Chinese iron DRIs, calling for the necessity of strictly estimation of the iron absorption from the typical whole Chinese diets in Chinese adult population. In this study, we investigated the non-heme iron absorption and biological utilization from typical whole diets in young Chinese urban men using a double-labeled stable isotope technique. In addition, given great difference in the diet patterns within China, we also observed if the iron absorption and utilization could be affected by the staple patterns of Southern and Northern China.</p><p>In this study, to correctly estimate the dietary iron absorption, typical whole Chinese diets instead of single meals were served for the subjects. It is very important to first formulate a representative experimental diet, which can collate data on inhibitors and enhancers of iron absorption in the diets. We designed typical whole Chinese diets on the basis of the results of the latest Chinese National Nutrition Survey [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and cluster analysis. The total energy and percentages of protein, carbohydrate, and fat consumed by the subjects were all in accordance with the recommended dietary intakes for the Chinese population [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The molar ratio of phytic acid to iron can be used to estimate the negative effect of phytic acid on iron absorption [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153885.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and the ratio should be &#x0003c; 6:1 in composite meals with certain vegetables that contain ascorbic acid and animal meat as enhancers of iron absorption [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In our study, the molar ration of phytic acid to iron was 0.48:1, indicating that phytic acid does not influence the iron absorption from the whole diets in this study. In addition, iron status affects iron bioavailability, which needs to be assessed in combination, and inflammatory markers should be also measured simultaneously [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We thus strictly screened the subjects&#x02019; iron nutritional statuses in the current study. During the baseline screening of the subjects, we used the traditional criteria of Hb &#x0003c; 130 g/L and SF &#x0003c; 30 &#x003bc;g/L to rule out iron deficiency anemia. We also analyzed sTfR to exclude early iron deficiency (&#x0003e;4.4 mg/L) [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition, the impact of inflammation (defined as CRP &#x0003e; 5 mg/L) on relevant indicators was excluded. These results indicated that these subjects were healthy with good iron nutritional statuses.</p><p>Additional factors affecting the results of similar studies include the experimental isotope dose and administration method. In the present study, similar dose of <sup>57</sup>FeSO<sub>4</sub> was mixed with staple rice and steamed buns and ingested in 3 meals per day over 2 days in accordance with the energy distribution ratio. This strategy enabled the measurement of the representative dietary iron absorption under normal dietary conditions. We administered a mean oral <sup>57</sup>Fe dose of 3.25 mg/d, which accounted for approximately 25% of the average daily dietary iron intake (12.8 mg). When coupled with the intravenous <sup>58</sup>Fe dose of 2.4 mg/d, the total amount of labeled isotopic iron accounted for 44% ([3.25+2.4] mg/12.8 mg x 100%) of the total dietary iron intake. Stable isotope iron supplementation is reported to reach 30&#x02013;60% of total dietary iron intake; at this level isotopes involved in will not interfere with the normal iron metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. On the other hand, according to the fortification levels in China (14~26 mg iron/ kg rice or flour) [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], all the subjects in this study consumed average 450 g rice or flour, so the daily total labeled iron (3.25 mg <sup>57</sup>Fe + 2.4 mg <sup>58</sup>Fe = 5.65 mg Fe) in this study was less than the iron fortification level (6.3&#x02013;11.7 mg [14&#x02013;26 mg iron/ kg rice or flour x 0.45 kg]) in China, which would not influence the normal iron metabolism. In addition, we did not instruct the subjects to initially consume a low-iron diet and we distributed the stable isotope doses in food served at 6 meals over 2 days. This strategy is closer to actual dietary situations, thus avoiding overestimation of biological utilization. Collectively, this study was strictly designed.</p><p>The present result showed that the average iron intake in the basic staple diet was 12.8 mg, which is concordant with that reported by the 2000 Chinese Total Diet Study (national average iron intake among adult men: 13.03 mg, range 9.28&#x02013;23.76 mg) (unpublished data). This value reflects the iron intake in the actual diet consumed by the Chinese population, and it is consistent with data from some countries with similar dietary habits to China (e.g. mean daily intake of 12.7&#x02013;15.0 mg iron for Japanese men [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] but unsurprisingly inconsistent with other countries with different dietary habits (e.g. mean daily total dietary iron intake of 13.5 mg for British men) [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. We designed two sub-groups with steamed buns or rice their staple food respectively according to the different dietary habits of Northern and Southern China. The iron intake of the steamed buns group was significantly higher than that of the rice group, which might be because the steam buns group subjects consumed more iron-rich animal tissues (including stir-fried chicken breast, braised beef and stir-fried squid). However, since the isotopic <sup>57</sup>Fe labels in the meals were similar among all these subjects, the final <sup>57</sup>Fe absorption from the whole diet did not show significant difference between these two sub-groups.</p><p>In this study, in addition to the staple food, some non-staple foods were similarly provided for the subjects. However, probably due to the difference of the subjects&#x02019; dietary habits, the non-staple foods were not similarly taken by the subjects. Some kinds of foods relatively rich in ascorbic acid were taken less by rice group subjects than by streamed buns group subjects. As a result, the intake levels of ascorbic acid were significantly lower in the rice group than in the steamed buns group. Although ascorbic acid is an enhancer of iron absorption, generally, there is no significant difference in the non-heme iron absorption and utilization between the two groups, implying that difference of the levels of single enhancer or inhibitor might not be able to substantially influence the non-heme iron absorption and utilization.</p><p>Iron absorption represents the percentage of the absorbed iron (from the dietary iron) that enters the gastrointestinal mucosa cells through gastrointestinal tract, which is calculated as the incorporation of oral <sup>57</sup>Fe into erythrocytes. It was reported that the mean non-heme iron absorption from whole diets in other countries (such as USA, Europe, and Mexico) greatly varied from 0.7 to 22.9% [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The present study demonstrated that the mean dietary non-heme iron absorption in young Chinese men with typical whole diets was 11&#x000b1;7%. Kalasuramath et al. showed 8.3% of the mean iron absorption from rice and 11.2% from wheat-based meals in healthy young Indian women with iron deficiency [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Moretti et al. reported the mean iron absorption was 11.6% from rice meals fortified with ferrous sulfate in young women and 3.2% from wheat-based meal [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Our study showed the dietary non-heme iron absorption in rice group was higher than in wheat-based streamed bund group (13&#x000b1;7% versus 8&#x000b1;4%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.061), which is consistent with Moretti et al.&#x02019; study [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] while is interestingly different from Kalasuramath et al.&#x02019;s study [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Iron utilization shows the ratio of the iron that is utilized by body to synthesize the iron&#x02013;containing biomolecules (mainly hemoglobin) among the absorbed iron from dietary iron during a period. It is usually expressed as the incorporation ratio of the absorbed iron into erythrocytes or hemoglobin of the subjects, which is calculated as the incorporation of iv <sup>58</sup>Fe into erythrocytes in this study. In this study, the overall infused iron utilization rate at 14 days after intake was 85&#x000b1;8%, which is similar to the results of foreign studies (80&#x02013;93%) [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153885.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We administered two different stable isotope tracers orally and intravenously to directly measure the incorporation of the infused iron into erythrocytes, which helped distinguish dietary iron absorbed by the intestinal tract and utilized systemically [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In contrast, single-labeled isotope method cannot directly obtain this data [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Thus, the results will be beneficial to clarify dietary iron absorption and utilization in the human body.</p><p>Our results demonstrated that iron store (SF level) was negatively correlated with iron absorption, which is consistent with Dainty et al.&#x02019;s result [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153885.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The iron bioavailability factor for DRIs thus needs to be practically relevant and for a well-defined iron status. There lacks agreement with regard to the iron status on which the estimation of iron absorption values should be based. However, it is commonly considered that the iron absorption would be attained from subjects who have low iron stores but are not anemic [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Under this condition, iron absorption can be maximally up-regulated without any impairment of normal physiological processes. It was suggested that the absorption efficiency should be based on subjects with the SF concentration of 15 &#x003bc;g/L [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This will lead to a higher bioavailability and lower dietary iron intake recommendation, but still ensure that subjects with low iron stores will absorb enough iron to meet their demands. Yet whether this SF level is sufficient to meet the needs of individuals with adequate iron stores is unclear [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Researchers from different countries have proposed specific SF cut-offs for domestic populations for the diagnosis of iron deficiency, on which should be based to estimate the iron absorption efficiency. For example, Nelson et al. [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and Sharma et al. [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] supposed a cut-off level of 30 &#x003bc;g/L for SF. A meta-analysis revealed that the determination of iron deficiency using a cut-off level of 25 or 30 &#x003bc;g/L achieved the greatest accuracy and overall effectiveness [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In the present study, the non-heme absorption and utilization in young Chinese adult urban men were estimated on the condition that SF level was measured as 63.8&#x000b1;25.6 &#x003bc;g/L using the detection Kit with the reference range of 30&#x02013;400 &#x003bc;g/L for adult men with normal SF levels. Since the SF concentration is strongly dependent on the techniques and also on the used assay/Kit, we should adjust the SF level when use this data for iron DRIs setting.</p><p>Generally, the basic characteristics (age, weight, height, BMI), inflammatory parameters, iron status, most of the daily average intakes of major nutrients and enhancers and inhibitors of iron absorption (including calories, calcium, carbohydrate, fat, protein, dietary fiber, phytic acid), oral <sup>57</sup>Fe dose and iv administrated <sup>58</sup>Fe dose of the subjects in the rice and streamed buns groups were almost consistent without significant difference (all <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). There was no significant difference in the iron absorption from dietary iron and absorbed iron utilization between the two groups (both <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). These results indicate the iron absorption and utilization from typical whole Chinese staple food are not influenced by the representative patterns of the staple food in China.</p><p>We recruited young men, the standard population for the setting of DRIs, to observe the non-heme iron absorption and utilization from typical whole Chinese dietary (including rice as the representative staple food in Southern China and wheat-based streamed buns as the representative staple food in Northern China). For women, Pizarro et al. showed mean iron absorption of 10.5% (4.1&#x02013;27.0%) from the wheat flour bread fortified with ferrous sulfate [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Moretti et al. showed from the rice meals fortified with ferrous sulfate, the iron absorption in young women was 11.6% [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It was reported that there was no significant difference in the iron bioavailability from meals between male and female [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The iron utilization between male and female is unknown. A parallel study to observe the non-heme iron absorption and utilization from typical Chinese staple food in women is being performed by our group, whereby the non-heme iron absorption and utilization from typical Chinese staple food in male versus female will be directly compared.</p><p>Iron absorption varies, which depends on the food sources, subject&#x02019;s nutritious status, etc. It was shown that the mean iron absorption from the dal was low as 2.20 &#x000b1; 3.40% in nonpregnant women [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Non-heme iron absorption from the beef meal in children was significantly greater than from the soy meal [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. A report showed mean iron absorption was low (4.6%) from the millet, but was increased from rice (8.3%) and wheat (11.2%)-based meals in the iron deficiency healthy young Indian women [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Iron absorption from a rice-based meal was low in iron replete (2.7%) but was higher in iron deficiency anemia Indian adult women (2.7% versus 8.3%) [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Further studies need to be carried out to observe the iron absorption and utilization from other staple foods (e.g. maize, potato) and in subjects with different health status (e.g. iron-replete, iron-deficient) in China.</p><p>There are some limitations of this study. First, this study has a relatively short feeding period with 6 meals. Observations during a longer experimental period are needed to verify the present results. Second, since there were neither data with regard to the dietary iron absorption from rice and wheat in Chinese population nor pilot data of the difference in the dietary iron absorption between rice and wheat in young Chinese men, it was not easy to estimate the minimum sample size for this randomized controlled study. In this study, the determination of the sample size was based on some previous studies involving double-labeled iron stable isotopes [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153885.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153885.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153885.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The sample size of 22 in this study appears to be small. However, the double-labeled stable isotopic technique used in this study involves labeling with two kinds of stable isotopes, which is expensive for the analysis. As a result, such studies usually involve rather limited number (10 or a bit more than 10 subjects) [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153885.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153885.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153885.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The subject number in our study is comparable to and even a bit more than in the above studies. Nevertheless, in the next randomized controlled study, more subjects will be included and the minimum sample size will be estimated on the basis of the present study to validate these results. Third, it is known that mutations in several genes such as <italic>HFE</italic>, <italic>Hjv</italic>, <italic>HAMP</italic> and <italic>FPN</italic> result in hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), a disorder that causes excess high iron absorption [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153885.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We did not clarify whether or not these gene mutations occurred in the subjects in this study, however, it is a fact that HH is rare in Chinese Han population, which is related to the low incidence of the HFE gene mutations [<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153885.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, these subjects in this study were healthy with good iron nutritional statuses. Therefore, the possibility of the existence of HFE gene mutations could be excluded. Nevertheless, next we will detect the gene mutations associated with HH to fully exclude the influence of the mutations of these HH genes on the dietary iron absorption. Next studies will also be focused on investigating the iron absorption and utilization among different populations, especially those from high incidence areas of anemia and those (e.g. pregnant women, children) prone to have anemia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We strictly assessed the non-heme iron absorption and utilization rates from typical whole Chinese diets in young Chinese healthy adult urban men, which was not affected by the representative staple food patterns of Southern and Northern China. This study will provide the basis for the setting of iron DRIs for Chinese inhabitants. Further studies with longer observation period and more number of subjects, and studies investigating iron absorption and utilization from other staple foods, in subjects with different health status, and in different populations in China will be performed to validate these results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153885.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for Rice group.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0153885.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153885.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for Steamed buns group.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0153885.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0153885.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>McLean</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Cogswell</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Egli</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wojdyla</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <name><surname>de Benoist</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name> (<year>2009</year>) <article-title>Worldwide prevalence of anaemia, WHO Vitamin and Mineral Nutrition Information System, 1993&#x02013;2005</article-title>. <source>Public Health Nutr</source>
