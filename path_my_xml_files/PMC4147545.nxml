There are 5 billion episodes of diarrhea every year out of which 3.5 million children die. Bhumyamalaki is known for its antiviral activity, 90 % of infantile diarrheas are due to some enteroviruses. Therefore the present research work was planned to evaluate the effect of Bhumyamalaki syrup.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Method:</title><p>The present study was conducted on 30children presenting with viral diarrhea in between the age group of 1 to 10 years. The patients were selected from S.D.M.C.A &#x00026; Hospital, Hassan. They were divided into two groups with 15 children in each group, viz. Group B (Bhumyamalaki syrup) and Group S (sugar syrup as placebo). The syrup was given in a dose of 5ml and 10ml for the age group 1to 5 years and 5 to 10 years four times a day for 7 days respectively. The cases were recorded according to the case proforma prepared for the study and observations were graded according to the gradation chart prepared.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Result:</title><p>Bhumyamalaki Syrup provided significant relief in the symptoms of viral diarrhea such as Malavega (73.19%), consistency (67.48%), fever (88.49%),vomiting (89.24%), abdominal pain (89.68%), loss of appetite (95%) and dehydration (95.89%). In this group, 73.33% and 26.67% patients showed marked and moderate improvements respectively.
