After preliminary and familiarization trials, seven amateur cyclists performed three 4-km cycling TT in a double-blind, randomized and crossover design. The trials were performed either after no previous exercise (CON), or after a CHO availability-lowering exercise protocol (DEP) performed in the previous evening, followed by either placebo (DEP-PLA) or 5 mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of caffeine intake (DEP-CAF) 1 hour before the trial. Performance was reduced (&#x02212;2.1%) in DEP-PLA vs CON (421.0&#x000b1;12.3 vs 412.4&#x000b1;9.7 s). However, performance was restored in DEP-CAF (404.6&#x000b1;17.1 s) compared with DEP-PLA, while no differences were found between DEP-CAF and CON. The anaerobic contribution was increased in DEP-CAF compared with both DEP-PLA and CON (67.4&#x000b1;14.91, 47. 3&#x000b1;14.6 and 55.3&#x000b1;14.0 W, respectively), and this was more pronounced in the first 3 km of the trial. Similarly, total anaerobic work was higher in DEP-CAF than in the other conditions. The integrated electromyographic activity, plasma lactate concentration, oxygen uptake, aerobic contribution and total aerobic work were not different between the conditions. The reduction in performance associated with low CHO availability is reversed with caffeine ingestion due to a higher anaerobic contribution, suggesting that caffeine could access an anaerobic &#x0201c;reserve&#x0201d; that is not used under normal conditions.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This project was supported by Coordination of Improvement of Personnel of Superior Level (CAPES-PRODOC, MEC/CAPES 29/2010).

For example, Langfort et al. <xref rid="pone.0072025-Langfort1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> reported that after three days of a low-CHO diet (&#x0223c; 5% CHO) the average power output measured during a 30-s Wingate test in healthy men not engaged in any competitive sport was significantly reduced (from 581&#x000b1;7 to 533&#x000b1;7 W) when compared with a normal diet (&#x0223c; 50% CHO). According to these authors, the reduction in performance (&#x0223c;9%) with low CHO availability was due to a lower contribution of the anaerobic energy system. Similarly, Miura et al. <xref rid="pone.0072025-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> found a reduction in the anaerobic work capacity of healthy, non-athletic men when exercise was performed after a muscle-glycogen-depletion protocol compared to a control condition (10.33&#x000b1;2.41 vs 12.83&#x000b1;2.21 kJ, respectively), suggesting that low CHO availability can reduce the anaerobic contribution to total energy expenditure during high-intensity exercise. In addition, reduction in self-selected power output during high-intensity interval training when performed with low endogenous CHO availability has been also reported in well-trained subjects, and it may be associated with a reduction in the anaerobic contribution <xref rid="pone.0072025-Yeo1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072025-Hulston1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>While low CHO availability seems to reduce the anaerobic contribution and impair performance during high-intensity exercise, acute ingestion of caffeine seems to have the opposite effect <xref rid="pone.0072025-Collomp1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072025-Doherty1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Doherty <xref rid="pone.0072025-Doherty1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> observed an increase of 10% and 14% in the anaerobic energy supply (measured by maximum accumulated oxygen deficit) and performance (time to exhaustion), respectively, during high-intensity exercise performed at 125% of the maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max) after caffeine ingestion (5 mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Using the same exercise intensity and caffeine dose, Bell et al. <xref rid="pone.0072025-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> reported a 7&#x02013;8% increase in total anaerobic energy contribution and time to exhaustion. Recently, a similar increase in the anaerobic contribution (6.5%) and time to exhaustion (14%) at 120% VO<sub>2</sub>peak was also found by Simmonds et al. <xref rid="pone.0072025-Simmonds1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> after caffeine ingestion (5 mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Although all of the aforementioned studies have investigated the effects of caffeine on performance during time-to-exhaustion tests, some studies have also found a positive effect of caffeine on performance during time-trials <xref rid="pone.0072025-Wiles1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072025-Kilding1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>; however, anaerobic contribution has not been measured in these studies. Taken together, these findings suggest that acute ingestion of caffeine may improve performance during high-intensity exercise via an increase in the anaerobic contribution.</p><p>The mechanisms by which caffeine increases the anaerobic contribution and performance during high-intensity exercise is not fully understood, but it has been proposed that caffeine intake would promote an inhibitory action on adenosine receptors, which would increase the activity of the enzyme phosphofructokinase, thereby increasing anaerobic glycolysis <xref rid="pone.0072025-Simmonds1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072025-Bridge1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Alternatively, caffeine may act on the central nervous system leading to an increase in motivational drive and neuromuscular excitability, which, in turn, results in a lowered rating of perceived exertion (RPE) for a given workload <xref rid="pone.0072025-Doherty2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and improved neuromuscular function, as measured via electromyography activity (EMG) <xref rid="pone.0072025-Bazzucchi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In addition, it has also been suggested that caffeine attenuates muscle sensory signals to the brain and decreases the threshold of activation of motor neurons <xref rid="pone.0072025-Doherty3" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. All of these central alterations could lead to an ability to produce more work anaerobically.</p><p>Although several studies have investigated the isolated effects of both CHO availability and caffeine intake on anaerobic contribution and performance <xref rid="pone.0072025-Greenhaff1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072025-LimaSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072025-Doherty1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072025-Simmonds1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, no study has examined whether acute caffeine ingestion could counteract the negative effects of low CHO availability on both the anaerobic contribution and performance. This seems to be particularly important since many athletes perform two training sessions in the same day, or participate in multi-stage event races (e.g., <italic>tour de France</italic>), where the time to replenish endogenous CHO stores between sessions or races may not be sufficient. Furthermore, most studies with either caffeine <xref rid="pone.0072025-Doherty1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072025-Simmonds1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> or CHO availability <xref rid="pone.0072025-Greenhaff1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072025-LimaSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> have focused on investigating their effects during time-to-exhaustion tests. However, time trials (TT) appear to be more reliable <xref rid="pone.0072025-Stone1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and to have greater external validity <xref rid="pone.0072025-Atkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> compared to constant-workload tests until exhaustion. Furthermore, during a high-intensity TT, where athletes are free to vary power output, anaerobic metabolism seems to exert a decisive effect on both performance <xref rid="pone.0072025-Craig1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and the distribution of work <xref rid="pone.0072025-Aisbett1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072025-Hettinga2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine whether caffeine ingestion promotes an increase in the anaerobic contribution and performance during a 4-km cycling TT, when athletes begin the trial after reduced endogenous CHO availability <xref rid="pone.0072025-Gollnick1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072025-Heigenhauser1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. We hypothesized that low CHO availability would reduce the anaerobic contribution and performance during a 4-km cycling TT; however, this reduction in the anaerobic contribution and performance would be attenuated or even reversed with caffeine supplementation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Before beginning the study, participants answered a questionnaire on readiness for physical activity (PAR-Q) and performed a cardiac screening test, including electrocardiogram.

To prevent movement artifact, the electrode wires were taped to the skin using adhesive tape (MicroporeTM 3 M, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil). Five seconds of raw EMG signal was recorded each 200 m with a sample rate of 2000 Hz (model 410c EMG System of Brazil Ltda, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil). Raw EMG signals were full-wave rectified and filtered with second-order Butterworth band-pass filters with cut-off frequencies set at 10 and 400 Hz to remove external interference noise and movement artifacts. Integrated EMG (iEMG) obtained each 200 m during the TT was normalized by dividing by the iEMG calculated at the point coinciding with peak torque of the highest MVC.

The Effect size (ES) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to evaluate differences between conditions for mean values of Wtot, Waer, Wan, PO, Pan, Paer and time to cover the TT.

Furthermore, the reestablishment of the performance with caffeine ingestion was associated with an increase in the Pan and total anaerobic work generated during the 4-km cycling TT, indicating that caffeine allows access to an anaerobic &#x0201c;reserve&#x0201d; that is not normally used. The increase in the performance with caffeine ingestion seems to be explained by a higher PO and anaerobic contribution during the first 2&#x02013;3 km of the trial.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Effect of Caffeine on 4-km Cycling TT Performance</title><p>Previous studies have reported an increase in high-intensity exercise performance after caffeine ingestion <xref rid="pone.0072025-Doherty1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072025-Simmonds1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Recently, Wiles et al. <xref rid="pone.0072025-Wiles1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, using the same caffeine dose as the present study (5 mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), reported an improvement (3.1%) in 1-km cycling TT performance compared to a placebo. This improvement was accompanied by a 3.6% increase in the mean PO <xref rid="pone.0072025-Wiles1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In the present study, we observed a 7.0% reduction in mean PO and a 2.1% increase in the time to complete the trial when TT was performed after an exercise protocol designed to reduce CHO availability, in comparison with CON. However, caffeine intake increased mean PO by 10.8% and reduced the time to cover the 4-km TT by 4.1%, when compared with DEP-PLA. When compared with control, caffeine intake increased mean PO by 4.3% and reduced the time to complete the trial by 1.9%. Qualitative inferences indicated that a benefit was &#x02018;very likely&#x02019; and &#x02018;likely&#x02019; when DEP-CAF was compared to DEP-PLA and CON, respectively, suggesting that performance improvements of 4.1 and 1.9% are meaningful for our participants. Our study demonstrates for the first time that, even with a reduced CHO availability, caffeine intake restores time-trial performance to levels found when endogenous CHO availability is normal.</p><p>Athletes adopted a more conservative starting pacing strategy when CHO stores were depleted. It is not fully clear if this conservative starting was caused by an intramuscular effect of the muscle glycogen depletion and/or a psychological strategy. However, despite the subjects being aware that they were depleted, they were not able to identify which capsule (caffeine or placebo) had subsequently been ingested, and, even then, adopted a more aggressive pacing strategy in DEP-CAF than DEP-PLA. Both iEMG and RPE at the beginning of the DEP-PLA trial were also similar to the DEP-CAF trial, even with a lower PO, suggesting that any effect of manipulation may have happened in the muscle. Furthermore, caffeine supplementation restored the PO in the first two kilometers and it was not associated with a reduced PO in the rest of the time trial.</p><p>In contrast to the results of the present study, Hettinga et al. <xref rid="pone.0072025-Hettinga1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> reported that a higher PO in the first 2 km of a 4-km cycling TT results in an impairment of the PO in the second half of the trial. It should be noted however, that the pacing strategy during the first 2 km in the Hettinga study was dictated by the researchers, and the participants were &#x0201c;enforced&#x0201d; to perform a constant PO at 105% above the mean PO until the end of the second kilometer. This &#x0201c;enforced&#x0201d;, constant-paced exercise during the first 2 km may have induced a greater physiological strain than self-paced exercise, and provoked a reduction in PO during the second half of the trial <xref rid="pone.0072025-Billat1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072025-Lander1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

This is in accordance with previous results suggesting that, independent of the physiological or metabolic status, athletes normally adopt a pattern of increase in RPE proportional to the exercise distance completed <xref rid="pone.0072025-Amann1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072025-LimaSilva2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. For example, positive (e.g. nutritional supplementation) and negative (e.g. hypoxia) changes in the homeostatic status throughout the TT have been reported to provoke an increase or reduction in PO, respectively, in order to maintain the same RPE template during exercise trials <xref rid="pone.0072025-Joseph1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072025-Abbiss1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.

However, although any alteration in RPE with caffeine should have increased motor drive and neuromuscular excitability <xref rid="pone.0072025-Bazzucchi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, the iEMG was not altered in the present study. Alternatively, caffeine may have had a peripheral effect on increasing muscle function, which, in turn, would reduce muscle sensory signals to the brain and consequently reduce RPE.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Effect of Caffeine on Anaerobic and Aerobic Contribution</title><p>According to some studies <xref rid="pone.0072025-Langfort1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072025-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, endogenous CHO depletion reduces the contribution of the anaerobic system, possibly due to a limitation in the rates of glycogenolysis and glycolysis. In fact, Blomstrand and Saltin <xref rid="pone.0072025-Blomstrand1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, using a protocol to reduce endogenous CHO availability in one leg, showed that the breakdown of muscle glycogen during 60 minutes of exercise at 75% VO<sub>2</sub>max was &#x0223c; 48% less in the leg that started the exercise with low muscle glycogen (99&#x000b1;18 &#x000b5;mol.kg dry wt<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) than the leg that began with normal muscle glycogen levels (207&#x000b1;22 &#x000b5;mol.kg dry wt<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). When analyzing each km, we observed an increase in the Pan during the first 3 km for DEP-CAF compared to the DEP-PLA. This large anaerobic production early in the trial was accompanied by a significant increase in the PO, supporting the idea that power distribution during a TT appears to be regulated primarily by changes in the anaerobic contribution <xref rid="pone.0072025-Aisbett1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072025-Hettinga1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In related results, Hettinga el al. <xref rid="pone.0072025-Hettinga1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> reported that the Pan was higher during the first 2 km of a 4-km cycling time trial when athletes were asked to perform the first 2 km at a supra-mean PO intensity (105% of the mean PO), but was significantly reduced in the second half of the trial when the athletes were free to reduce the PO. These results are consistent with those reported recently by Aisbett et al. <xref rid="pone.0072025-Aisbett1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> who induced fast-, even-, and slow-starting during the first 25% of a 5-min cycling time trial (approximating the duration of a 4000-m cycling TT), and observed that the oxygen deficit (anaerobic contribution) was greater in the first quarter and lower in the second and third quarters of exercise in the fast-start trial, compared with the two other pacing strategies. In contrast, we found that despite a higher Pan in first 3 km after caffeine ingestion, the Pan in the last km was not impaired when compared with the other conditions, suggesting that caffeine maintained the Pan throughout the trial and promoted an increase in the total anaerobic contribution.</p><p>Several studies have suggested that the total amount of anaerobic energy that can be produced during a TT is fixed <xref rid="pone.0072025-Aisbett1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072025-Hettinga2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Indeed, Hettinga et al. <xref rid="pone.0072025-Hettinga2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> demonstrated that despite inducing their participants to perform the first 750 m of a 1500-m cycling TT at 105% (supra) and 95% (sub) of the mean PO measured during the even-paced time trial, the total amount of anaerobic work generated over the time trial remained unchanged. Similarly, Aisbett et al. <xref rid="pone.0072025-Aisbett1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> also reported no difference in the total energy provided by the anaerobic system when the cyclists performed a 5-min cycling TT using different starting strategies. These results suggested that the pattern of anaerobic energy distribution can vary with pacing strategy, but that the total anaerobic capacity remains fixed. On the other hand, it has been reported that caffeine intake promotes an increase in the quantity of anaerobic energy produced during high-intensity, time-to-exhaustion exercise <xref rid="pone.0072025-Doherty1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072025-Simmonds1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, although this has not been measured during closed-loop exercise such as a TT.</p><p>In the present study, we found that the total amount of anaerobic energy was higher in DEP-CAF than in both DEP-PLA and CON, indicating that caffeine exerts a more potent effect on the anaerobic contribution than low CHO availability. Furthermore, the greater Wan during the 4-km cycling TT after caffeine ingestion indicates that the total amount of anaerobic energy expenditure during TT exercise may not be fixed and that caffeine allows access to an anaerobic &#x0201c;reserve&#x0201d; that is not used under normal conditions. The existence of an anaerobic reserve has been demonstrated recently by Corbett et al. <xref rid="pone.0072025-Corbett1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, who reported that the total anaerobic energy yield during a 2000-m cycling TT was higher when the participants believed that they were competing against another athlete of similar ability (head-to-head), than when they exercised alone (time trial), suggesting that a motivational stimulus promotes the use of a greater degree of the anaerobic &#x0201c;reserve&#x0201d;. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that caffeine intake increases the total anaerobic work produced during a middle-distance cycling TT, even though the athletes started the trial with a low CHO availability. In addition, although PO and Pan were increased at the beginning and in the middle of the TT with caffeine ingestion, when compared to the DEP-PLA condition, there were no differences in the last 600 m between the conditions, and this was accompanied by a similar [La] Post-TT, suggesting that CAF was not able to increase the anaerobic contribution at the end of the trial.</p><p>The mechanism by which caffeine ingestion exerts its effect on the anaerobic contribution remains unclear. Simmonds et al. <xref rid="pone.0072025-Simmonds1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> suggested that caffeine increases the anaerobic contribution through its antagonistic action on the adenosine receptors, which could unlock any inhibitory effect of adenosine on phosphofructokinase enzyme activity in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, Bridge and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0072025-Bridge1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> have suggested that caffeine ingestion results in an increase in the release of calcium, facilitating the conversion of the enzyme phosphorylase <italic>b</italic> to it more active form <italic>a</italic>, which would lead to an acceleration of glycogenolysis. However, this last mechanism seems unlikely <italic>in vivo</italic>, since a greater mobilization of calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum has been observed only at high concentrations of caffeine that would be toxic to humans <xref rid="pone.0072025-Rosser1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Effects of Caffeine on Neuromuscular Responses</title><p>It has been hypothesized that caffeine intake improves performance during high-intensity exercise through an increase in electromyography activity <xref rid="pone.0072025-Bazzucchi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. An increase in both EMG activity and performance during short-duration, maximal-dynamic contractions has been demonstrated after caffeine ingestion <xref rid="pone.0072025-Bazzucchi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In the present study however, although the PO was greater with caffeine intake, there was no difference in iEMG between conditions. These conflicting results could possibly be explained by the different protocols adopted and the muscles analyzed. While we used a cycling time-trial test, and measured the EMG of the vastus lateralis muscle, Bazzucchi et al. <xref rid="pone.0072025-Bazzucchi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> assessed elbow flexion torque with an isokinetic dynamometer and EMG was recorded from the biceps brachii. On the other hand, our results are consistent with findings from other studies <xref rid="pone.0072025-Kalmar1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072025-Meyers1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> that observed no significant differences in the EMG recorded from the vastus lateralis muscle during isometric contractions after caffeine ingestion. However, the measurement and interpretation of EMG during dynamic exercise is difficult and may not be sufficiently sensitive to measure small changes in muscle activation <xref rid="pone.0072025-Kalmar1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Therefore, conclusions about the effects of caffeine on iEMG during dynamic exercise have to be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, in the absence of other methods to quantify muscle activation levels during dynamic exercise, changes in iEMG amplitude are the only way to indirectly measure muscle activation levels during a cycling time trial. Thus, while we interpret our iEMG data with caution, our findings indicate that iEMG activity did not change with caffeine intake.</p><p>A potential limitation is that we did not include a control session (without CHO depletion) with caffeine ingestion. Despite the fact that this could have provided a more complete knowledge about the effects of caffeine on pacing strategy and TT performance with different levels of endogenous CHO availability, the inclusion of more experimental sessions had the potential to reduce the motivation of participants to participate in so many trials, potentially affecting our performance results. Thus, we focused the present study on verifying if caffeine could reverse the deleterious effect of low CHO availability on performance. In addition, the standardisation of the starting gear and the prevision of verbal instead visual distance feedback should also be acknowledged. However, the hard gear ratio as the used in the present study (53&#x000d7;16) has been described in the literature and justified due the high-intensity, fast-start nature of the 4-km cycling TT <xref rid="pone.0072025-Stone1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Verbal instead of visual distance feedback has also been used in previous research <xref rid="pone.0072025-Stone1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Finally, we were unable to blind the participants to the reduced CHO availability and this may have influenced pacing in the trials. While blinding the participants to the CHO availability in the diet is practically impossible, we cannot fully discard the possibility of any conscious alteration in pacing due to awareness of being in a low-CHO state. However, this could be expected to affect pacing equally in both CHO-depletion conditions, but the participants paced themselves faster in DEP-CAF than DEP-PLA, while iEMG signal was not altered, suggesting that pacing modifications during depleted-CHO condition may have not been &#x0201c;consciously&#x0201d; determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the results from the present study have shown that acute ingestion of caffeine induced a higher mean PO and anaerobic contribution during the first 2&#x02013;3 km of the 4-km time trial. Furthermore, caffeine seems to attenuate the decrement in power output observed early in CON and DEP-PLA conditions, and preserves the ability to optimally perform the second half of the trial. In addition, caffeine ingestion reversed the impairment in time-trial performance caused by low CHO availability to levels found when endogenous CHO availability is normal. This improvement in performance was associated with a greater total anaerobic energy contribution with caffeine ingestion compared to both DEP-PLA and CON, indicating that caffeine exerts a more potent effect on the anaerobic contribution than low CHO availability. Therefore, we suggest that the total amount of anaerobic energy expenditure during TT exercise may not be fixed and that caffeine ingestion (even following a protocol to reduce endogenous CHO availability) allows access an anaerobic &#x0201c;reserve&#x0201d; that is not accessed under normal conditions. Our results suggest that caffeine may have an effect on intramuscular metabolism, i.e. increase on anaerobic contribution and total anaerobic work, rather than any significant effect on muscle recruitment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Silva-Cavalcante MD is grateful to National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq) for his scholarship (133832/2010-4).
