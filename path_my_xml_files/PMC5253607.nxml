Often, technique choice remains dependent on patient preference and convenience as well as age and stage of disease.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> Recent research strategy has shifted from examining the comparative efficacy of different ACT to the study of ways to optimise the application of techniques.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Finding the optimal treatment for a patient at any specific time requires consideration of available research evidence on efficacy among a range of other factors including coordination with inhaled therapies.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Some forms of ACT now offer the possibility to deliver inhaled therapies during treatment and while these devices are attractive in terms of reducing the time burden associated with treatment, it is unclear how the timing of inhaled therapies impact on the effectiveness of ACT. Mucoactive agents such as hypertonic saline (HTS) are recommended to facilitate mucociliary clearance based on clear evidence from high-quality clinical trials across the age range and disease trajectory in CF.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;14</xref> These trials typically administered HTS before ACT and this is currently the clinical recommendation. Notably, some technologies to deliver HTS during ACT were not available when these trials were conducted and further studies of these methods may yield useful results.</p><p>A recent Cochrane review highlighted how clinical effect could be influenced by the timing of HTS delivery in relation to ACT. The review outlined a number of potential theoretical benefits to inhalation of HTS during airway clearance, including maximising the benefits of the immediate peak in the airway surface liquid volume and reduced treatment time.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Following this review, a randomised controlled trial of 50 adult patients with CF assessed the change in lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second % (FEV<sub>1</sub>%) predicted) and perceived effectiveness and satisfaction of three treatment regimens (HTS before, during and after ACT) at the end of a hospital admission.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This study found that effects on FEV<sub>1</sub> were not significant. Satisfaction was rated significantly worse when HTS was inhaled after ACT compared with before or during ACT. Perceived effectiveness of treatment showed similar effects. The study concluded that people with CF should be encouraged to time HTS before or during ACT to maximise perceived efficacy and satisfaction. There are currently no data on the effect of HTS and ACT timing on the Lung Clearance Index (LCI). LCI provides an assessment of ventilation distribution as measured by multiple-breath washout (MBW) which is increasingly being used in CF interventional studies.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It is established that FEV<sub>1</sub> lacks sufficient sensitivity to detect changes in the peripheral airways.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> LCI has shown greater sensitivity to abnormalities in lung function compared with spirometry across the age ranges in CF<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>

Secondary outcomes included the change in FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted, forced expiratory flow (FEF)<sub>25&#x02013;75</sub>% predicted, 24-hour sputum volumes, patient-perceived and physiotherapist-perceived ease of clearance and satisfaction with treatment, number of coughs and duration of treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subject recruitment</title><p>Inclusion criteria for the study were subjects with CF aged &#x02265;18&#x02005;years, near the end of an intravenous antibiotic (IVAB) therapy course (days 10&#x02013;14) for a pulmonary exacerbation at Belfast Health and Social Care Trust (BHSCT), who were productive of sputum &#x02265;10&#x02005;g over 24&#x02005;hours on enrolment, currently use or had previously used and tolerated HTS (Nebusal 7%) and provided written informed consent.

This pilot study aimed to explore the effectiveness of one such strategy, HTS during ACT using the Acapella Duet.</p><p>This pilot study found that the timing of HTS in relation to ACT did not have a significant effect on the change in LCI after a single treatment session. Although HTS during ACT was significantly shorter in duration, secondary end points of spirometry, sputum volumes, patient and physiotherapist perception of ease and satisfaction, and number of coughs were also not significantly different between treatments.</p><p>These results are in agreement with the findings by Dentice and colleagues,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> who found no difference in lung function between regimens (HTS before, during or after ACT) and reported similar numbers of patients stating a preference for ACT after or during HTS, compared with ACT before HTS. The authors concluded that preference for HTS before or during ACT over HTS after ACT, could have implications for long-term adherence. The pilot data presented in this paper adds to this topic further exploring differences between HTS before or during ACT regimens. Results suggest that if length of treatment time is an issue affecting adherence, HTS during ACT may offer a regimen which is equally effective but of shorter duration. Furthermore, although not statistically significant, notably fewer coughs were required to expectorate the same volume of sputum with ACT during HTS treatment compared with the HTS before ACT treatment.</p><p>Importantly, these results indicate that as a novel end point, LCI did not offer any further information in response to ACT and HTS treatment compared with spirometry. FEV<sub>1</sub> is not always a suitable outcome measure for ACT trials due to its lack of sensitivity as an end point.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> LCI was chosen as the primary outcome measure in this study as it has demonstrated superior sensitivity to changes in disease compared with spirometry<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and has proven responsiveness to treatment effect with inhaled therapies<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and ACT<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> in CF. However, in this study, LCI did not detect any change within or between treatments. Change in LCI also did not significantly correlate with FEV<sub>1</sub>, with either treatment. Studies by Fuchs and colleagues<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and Pfleger and colleagues<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> have also reported small and inconsistent changes (increasing and decreasing) in LCI after physiotherapy with weak to modest correlations between change in LCI and FEV<sub>1.</sub> Results from this pilot study of patients primarily with moderate to severe lung disease, add to this data providing results from two time points (immediately post and 90&#x02005;min post treatment) from a clearly defined intervention (inhaled therapy and ACT). The change in FRC as a component of LCI with HTS during ACT treatment was significantly decreased, but this did not translate to a change in LCI. These results suggest that the effects of sputum clearance on LCI and FRC are complex, as ACT may open previously completely obstructed airways resulting in the recruitment of lung units paradoxically increasing LCI. LCI may also be much less informative in those with significant airflow obstruction<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> which made up a large proportion of patients in this study (8/13 FEV<sub>1</sub> &#x0003c;50% predicted at baseline). Discordant results with LCI and FEV<sub>1</sub> may not be surprising as they each measure a different aspect of lung physiology. These results add to the argument that LCI may not be a suitable short-term end point for airways clearance trials as response is unpredictable. Previous studies reporting significant effects assessed treatment effect were not short term but over a period 4&#x02013;48&#x02005;weeks with inhaled therapies<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and 3&#x02005;months with airways clearance therapy.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Lack of overall change in LCI in this study was in agreement with other end points including spirometry, sputum weight and patient preference supporting the validity of these results. The mean change in FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline to 90&#x02005;min post treatment (with HTS before ACT) could not be considered clinically significant.</p><p>Wet-weight sputum was chosen as a secondary outcome measure as it is feasible to perform. However, we acknowledge the inherent limitations of this measure as a clinical trial end point. Expectorated wet-weight sputum can include saliva, introducing error. An increase of decrease in sputum can be interpreted as an improvement, that is, an increase may mean improvement in clearance or a decrease may mean a resolution in infection. These issues limit the use of sputum as a reliable trial end point, although it remains an end point that is meaningful to patients.</p><p>In this study, inpatients receiving IVAB for treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation were the target group for recruitment. This was for feasibility reasons as the study design involved treatment on two consecutive days which would likely have been prohibitive for outpatients. Although our study design aimed to ensure participants were as close to their stable status as possible (days 10&#x02013;14 IVAB), our recruitment process demonstrated how some patients were still unwell at this time point (ie, two patients failed screening as they felt too unwell to proceed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJRESP2016000168F1">figure 1</xref>) and we cannot completely rule out the effect of pulmonary exacerbation on the variability of lung function results.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> However, this study represents a &#x02018;real-life&#x02019; evaluation of a treatment that is often carried out during hospital admission.</p><p>This study investigated the use of a less commonly used adjunct (Acapella Duet) through which to deliver HTS during ACT. Using this device, we did not observe any significant deposition of HTS directly in the device and the resistance levels achieved remained optimum (between 10 and 20&#x02005;cmH<sub>2</sub>O) in both treatments. Limitations of this study include the small sample size and findings need to be reproduced in a larger sample, therefore the conclusions must be interpreted with caution. Recruitment was challenging due to inclusion criteria in the study which required that subjects had previously taken and tolerated HTS and be productive of &#x02265;10&#x02005;g of sputum at the end of IVAB treatment. Of the subjects who met the criteria, the majority progressed to screening (20/32; 63%) and thereafter randomisation (14/20; 70%). Opening the study to outpatients could have increased the number of potentially eligible patients; however, adherence to the study design (attendance on two consecutive days), we believe, would have been challenging.</p><p>This pilot study is the first study to assess the effect of HTS and ACT timing using LCI as an outcome measure and employed rigorous study design including blinded outcome measure assessor and a broad range of measures.</p><p>Overall, the results from this pilot study could not support the hypothesis that HTS before ACT was more effective than HTS during ACT as measured by LCI. Results indicate that HTS during ACT was no more effective than HTS before ACT, although it did result in a shorter treatment duration.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the patients who participated in this study, physiotherapist Dr Kathryn McDowell for her assistance in delivering treatments, Dr Alex Horsley (University of Manchester) and Dr Nick Bell (Department of Respiratory Medicine, Bristol Royal Infirmary) for permission to use the modified Innocor device standard operating procedure and the Simple Washout Programme for the analysis of MBW data.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> KO'N, FM, MMT, JSE and JMB conceived and designed research; KO'N, FM and JMB recruited patients, performed treatment, collected clinical data and performed the assessments; KO'N, FM, MMT, IB, JSE and JMB analysed data; DGD and JR provided intellectual contributions; KO'N, FM, JMB, MMT and JSE wrote the paper.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This work was supported by Forest Laboratories Europe.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> None declared.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Ethics approval:</bold> This study was approved by the Office for Research Ethics Committees Northern Ireland (REC reference number 12/NI/0153).</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Provenance and peer review:</bold> Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Data sharing statement:</bold> No additional data are available.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Warnock</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gates</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group>
