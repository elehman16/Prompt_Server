Recent results indicate that guided self-help via the internet is a promising treatment format also for psychodynamic therapy. However, to date and to our knowledge, no study has evaluated internet-delivered psychodynamic therapy as a transdiagnostic treatment. The affect-phobia model of psychopathology by McCullough <italic>et al</italic> provides a psychodynamic conceptualisation of a range of psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study will be to test the effects of a transdiagnostic guided self-help treatment based on the affect-phobia model in a sample of clients with depression and anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This study will be a randomised controlled trial with a total sample size of 100 participants. The treatment group receives a 10-week, psychodynamic, guided self-help treatment based on the transdiagnostic affect-phobia model of psychopathology. The treatment consists of eight text-based treatment modules and includes therapist contact in a secure online environment. Participants in the control group receive similar online therapist support without any treatment modules. Outcome measures are the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale and the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Process measures that concerns emotional processing and mindfulness are included. All outcome and process measures will be administered weekly via the internet and at 6-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial will add to the body of knowledge on internet-delivered psychological treatments in general and to psychodynamic treatments in particular.

The model, called <italic>affect-phobia treatment</italic> (APT), follows the fundamental structure of psychodynamic psychotherapy as outlined by Malan's triangle of conflict (ie, defences and anxieties block the expression of feelings) and triangle of person (ie, work with conflicts in relation to the therapist and current and past persons).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> In a psychodynamic therapy based on the APT model, the therapist typically clarifies defences, helps the client to observe and experience the underlying affects and helps the client to regulate associated anxiety.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Formally, the treatment includes three main treatment objectives: defence restructuring (recognising and relinquishing maladaptive defences), affect restructuring (desensitisation of affects through exposure to conflicted feeling) and self/other restructuring (improvement in sense of self and relationship with others). In summary, the main goal of psychodynamic psychotherapy based on the APT model is to help clients experience and to adaptively express feelings, that have been previously avoided.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></p><p>Two randomised trials have investigated the efficacy of APT for personality disorders.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> These trials showed that APT can be effective in reducing general psychiatric symptoms. However, except for case-series and some small uncontrolled studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> to date no trial has investigated the efficacy of APT for patients with a primary Axis I disorder.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Processes of change</title><p>To develop more effective psychotherapeutic treatments, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms of change that contribute to improvement in therapy. However, the mechanisms that cause therapeutic change are still largely unknown. In the experiential and psychodynamic traditions, including APT, experiencing and processing of the affective experience is considered central to therapeutic change.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> Typically, the therapist in APT helps the client recognise maladaptive defences, regulate anxiety and gradually experience feelings through systematic desensitisation to the conflicted emotions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Thus, emotional processing seems to be a relevant concept for understanding psychological treatments based on the APT model.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Main research questions and hypotheses</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Is a transdiagnostic, affect-focused, psychodynamic, internet-delivered, guided self-help approach effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety, when compared with an active control condition?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Do the degrees of emotional processing and mindfulness change more in the treatment condition than in the active control condition?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Do the degrees of emotional processing and mindfulness mediate symptom change on depression and anxiety measures?</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design of the study and ethics statement</title><p>The current study will be a randomised controlled trial with a sample size of 100 participants.

Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants using an online screening environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study population</title><p>Patients will be recruited from the community via advertisements in newspapers and on the internet. To be included in the study, the participant must be at least 18&#x02005;years of age and fulfil a principal DSM-IV diagnosis of either depression, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder or GAD. The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) will be used to diagnose DSM-IV disorders. Last-semester MSc students from a 5-year clinical psychology programme, who have been trained in the diagnostic procedure, will conduct the interviews by telephone. In addition, the participant must score at least 10 on either the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-9<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) or the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Participants with a principal diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder will be excluded. This restriction is due to the fact that the APT model does not conceptualise these disorders as phobias of affect, and hence, the treatment material used is not assumed to be applicable in these cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Additional exclusion criteria include suffering from a severe psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder or psychosis; risk of suicide, assessed by the MINI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> alcohol or drug abuse and ongoing participation in any psychotherapy. Moreover, if the participant is receiving psychotropic medication, the dosage must have been stable for at least 3&#x02005;months prior to the start of the treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sample size</title><p>A power calculation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> using a linear mixed-effects model (10 time points with an autoregressive error structure with a random intercept and slope) showed that approximately 46 (46.3) participants in each condition would be sufficient to detect a moderate between-group effect size of Cohen's d=0.50 (&#x003b1; level=0.05) with 80% power. Assuming a total attrition rate of 10% (at equal rate across time and condition), a similar power calculation estimated sample size to be approximately 51 (51.3) participants per condition. Given these results, we aim to include 100 participants in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Interventions</title><p>The treatment will be given as guided self-help with minimal text-based guidance provided on a weekly basis. This treatment format is an established way of delivering psychological treatments for depression and anxiety disorders.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> The text material used in the treatment modules will be based on the book &#x02018;Living Like You Mean It&#x02019; by Ronald J Frederick,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> which is theoretically grounded in psychodynamic theory and affective science and follows a similar structure as the original APT manual. There are eight modules in total, which all contain homework exercises that a client needs to complete before proceeding to the next module.</p><p>This treatment emphasises the practice of mindfulness more than in traditional psychodynamic therapy. Throughout treatment, the client is taught how to apply mindfulness in the process of identifying, attending to, and being present with emotional experience. In the context of the APT model, practicing &#x02018;emotional mindfulness&#x02019; can be one way of learning how to be aware of, experience and tolerate emotions. The treatment teaches the client to gradually develop mindful presence as a response to the physical manifestation of emotions which, within the APT model, can be considered as exposure to one's feelings. All interventions are grounded in the affect-phobia model illustrated by the conflict triangle: maladaptive defences are identified and relinquished, anxiety is regulated, and warded off feelings are approached and experienced. After experiencing one's core feelings, the client is encouraged, when appropriate, to express these feelings in interpersonal contexts. Expressing feelings to others is seen as essential to shifting both the sense of self and others. Detailed steps of the treatment are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002167F1">figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2012002167F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Description of the modules in the treatment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2012002167f01"/></fig><p>The online therapists will have contact with clients using a secure online environment resembling email, but with enhanced security. This mode of communication follows a standard procedure used in a range of studies investigating ICBT.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> The primary role of the therapists will be to give feedback on the clients&#x02019; exercises and experiences, and to administer gradual access to the treatment modules. In addition, the therapists will provide support, clarifications of the material and other forms of help that will enable the clients to complete the material on time. The therapists will answer questions once every day, during weekdays. All therapists will be supervised biweekly by Ronald J. Frederick, the author of the book on which the treatment is based.</p><p>The therapists will be three last-semester MSc students from a 5-year clinical psychologist programme. All therapists will have a clinical training in affect-focused psychodynamic psychotherapy and treatment experience using this method.</p><p>Participants in the active control group will not receive any text-based treatment modules. They will, however, receive online therapist contact, where the therapists will provide support but will not use any specific psychological techniques other than basic therapeutic skills such as empathic listening and asking for clarifications. A similar active control condition has been used in previous treatment studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Randomisation and procedure</title><p>After applying to the study, the participant will be directed to an online screening consisting of demographic questions and of online versions of the clinical outcome measures and the process measures (see below). These results will later be used as a pretreatment assessment. A participant will be contacted for a telephone-based diagnostic interview if he or she has completed the screening and meets the initial inclusion criteria (a score of at least 10 on either the PHQ-9 or the GAD-7). The interview consists of diagnostic interview questions about depression and anxiety disorders in addition to questions about use of medications and psychological treatments. The principal diagnosis assessed during the interview will be recorded. Psychiatric diagnoses are confirmed using the MINI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> The participants will be allocated to one of the two groups in a 1:1 ratio using block randomisation. An independent person, separate from the staff conducting the study, will handle the randomisation using an online randomisation tool.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Assessments</title><p>Clinical outcome will be measured both by self-report questionnaires and a clinical interview. Mechanisms of change will be measured by two self-report measures. Clinical and process self-report measures will be administered weekly during the treatment phase.

Psychiatric diagnoses will be assessed at post-treatment and at follow-up using the MINI. The interview also aims to give an estimate of global improvement, measured by the seven-point version of the Clinical Global Impression&#x02014;Improvement scale.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> Assessors of outcome in the clinical interview will be blind to treatment condition.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Process measures</title><p>In affect-phobia therapy, emotional processing is assumed to be related to symptom change. To explore this further in the current study, the Emotional Processing Scale (EPS-25)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> will be used to assess emotional processing deficits and the process of emotional change during treatment. The measure contains five subscales, three of these relate to emotional control or dysregulation (emotional avoidance, suppression, unregulated emotion, one subscale (impoverished emotional experience) shares some properties with the alexithymia construct<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> and the last subscale (signs of unprocessed emotion) refers to persistent and intrusive emotional phenomena. The total score of the EPS-25 reflects the overall level of emotional processing deficit.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> Psychometric properties for the EPS-25 has been found to be strong (Cronbach's &#x003b1;=0.92).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> While the EPS-25 is primarily included to measure a specific change process, it is also considered a secondary outcome measure in this trial.</p><p>As described above, the treatment has a strong mindfulness component. Thus, the amount of mindfulness skills that the client acquires during treatment may be related to outcome. To assess the influence of mindfulness, the Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) is included to measure general mindfulness skills. The original FFMQ by Baer <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> contains 39 items, while the Swedish version that will be used in this study consists of 29 items.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> The correlation between the Swedish FFMQ and the original FFMQ is r=0.98.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> The FFMQ was constructed as a multifaceted assessment of mindfulness, measuring a general tendency to be mindful in daily life, which is defined by five factors: observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience and non-reactivity to inner experience.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> Psychometric properties have been proved to be good for the Swedish 29-item FFMQ (Cronbach's &#x003b1;=0.81).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> The FFMQ is considered a secondary outcome measure, besides being a process measure.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Differences in efficacy between the treatment and the active control group will primarily be investigated by modelling interaction effects of group and time.

In addition, the study will explore working mechanisms of the treatment.</p><p>An important aim of the treatment tested is to stay close to the APT model. The conceptualisation of psychological problems are the same as in the original manual and the treatment is structured similarly. We assume that the essence of affect-phobia therapy is preserved in the guided self-help treatment. However, the treatments do differ in some aspects, for example, by not explicitly making use of transference relations. While we do not rule out that transference phenomena can occur, no interventions are included that address this. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the efficacy of a similar treatment protocol via the internet. Hence, this study will contribute to the empirical base of internet-delivered psychological treatments in general and to that of psychodynamic approaches in particular. Moreover, no previous treatment study exists that evaluates the efficacy of face-to-face affect-phobia therapy for Axis I disorders using a randomised controlled trial. Therefore, this study also adds to the empirical base of psychodynamic therapies in general.</p><p>Investigating the mediating effects of emotional processing and mindfulness provides an opportunity to explore the mechanisms of change in affect-focused, psychodynamic therapy. The processes that contribute to therapeutic change are largely unknown. This study aims to explore how emotional processing is related to treatment outcome and thus tests the assumption that emotional processing is a crucial process in psychodynamic treatments based on the APT model. In addition, the role of mindfulness is similarly explored.</p><p>Moreover, there is a lack of psychodynamic therapy in other treatment formats than individual and group. Using the internet format of delivery makes it possible to reach individuals who lack access to therapists nearby, or who simply do not want to meet face-to-face.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></p><p>In addition, there are also benefits of using one transdiagnostic protocol compared with having several specific programmes.
