We evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of recombinant, live-attenuated, tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) in Indian adults. In this observer-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase II study, adults aged 18&#x02013;45&#x000a0;years were randomized 2:1 to receive CYD-TDV or placebo at 0, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months in sub-cutaneous administration. Immunogenicity was assessed using a 50% plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT<sub>50</sub>) at baseline and 28&#x000a0;days after each study injection. 189 participants were enrolled (CYD-TDV [n = 128]; placebo, [n = 61]). At baseline, seropositivity rates for dengue serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 ranged from 77.0% to 86.9%. Seropositivity rates for each serotype increased after each CYD-TDV injection with a more pronounced increase after the first injection. In the CYD-TDV group, geometric mean titres (GMTs) were 2.38 to 6.11-fold higher after the third injection compared with baseline but remained similar to baseline in the placebo group. In the CYD-TDV group, the GMTs were 1.66 to 4.95-fold higher and 9.23 to 24.6-fold higher after the third injection compared with baseline in those who were dengue seropositive and dengue seronegative, respectively. Pain was the most commonly reported solicited injection site reaction after the first injection in both the CYD-TDV (6.3%) and placebo groups (4.9%), but occurred less frequently after subsequent injections. No serious adverse events were vaccine-related, no immediate unsolicited adverse events, and no virologically-confirmed cases of dengue, were reported during the study. The immunogenicity and safety of CYD-TDV was satisfactory in both dengue seropositive and seronegative Indian adults.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>CYD vaccine</kwd><kwd>dengue</kwd><kwd>immunogenicity</kwd><kwd>India</kwd><kwd>live attenuated vaccine</kwd><kwd>phase II trial</kwd><kwd>recombinant</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd><kwd>tetravalent dengue vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="23"/><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is endemic in tropical and subtropical countries and represents a global pandemic threat.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The virus is endemic in India, with several known hyper-endemic sub-regions.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref> Dengue is a notifiable disease, that is of significant public health concern in India due to annual outbreaks and all 4 dengue virus serotypes circulate in the country.

Among the 128 participants randomized in the CYD-TDV group, 127 (99.2%) received the first injection and one participant was excluded due to chronic type 2 diabetes mellitus and did not receive study injection. One hundred and 17 participants (91.4%) received the second injection, and 115 (89.8%) received the third injection. A total of 17 participants (9.0%) discontinued the study, but none were withdrawn from the study due to an SAE or AE. Overall, 172 participants completed the study (115 in the CYD-TDV group and 57 in the placebo group).

However, solicited injection site reactions and solicited systemic reactions were reported by higher percentages of participants in the CYD-TDV group (9.5% and 19.0%, respectively) compared to the placebo group (4.9% and 6.6%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0002"><bold>Table&#x000a0;2</bold></xref>). Pain, which appeared within 3&#x000a0;days of the first injection and resolved spontaneously, was the only reported solicited injection site reaction after the first injection in both the CYD-TDV group (8/126 [6.3%]) and the placebo group (3/61 [4.9%]). Most of the solicited injection site pain was of Grade 1 intensity. Two participants in the CYD-TDV group (1.6%) experienced Grade 2 injection site pain. No action was taken and both reactions resolved spontaneously. No Grade 3 solicited injection site reactions were reported after the first injection. Similarly, pain was the only reported solicited injection site reaction after the second injection in the CYD-TDV and placebo groups (2/117 [1.7%] vs 2/58 [3.4%], respectively) and after the third injection in the CYD-TDV group (3/115 [2.6%]). Erythema and swelling were not reported within 7&#x000a0;days after any injection.</p><p>Unsolicited AEs within 28&#x000a0;days after any injection were also reported by a slightly higher proportion of participants in the CYD-TDV group (9.4%) compared to the placebo group (6.6%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0002"><bold>Table&#x000a0;2</bold></xref>). There were no immediate unsolicited AEs in either the CYD-TDV or placebo group. All unsolicited AEs were considered as non-serious in both groups and did not lead to participant discontinuation. There were no unsolicited adverse reactions and no deaths reported during the study and no virologically-confirmed cases of dengue. In the CYD-TDV group, 3/127 (2.4%) participants reported at least one non-serious AESI, suggestive of an allergic reaction (Grade 1 pruritus on the day of the first injection which resolved spontaneously on the same day (n = 2) and Grade 1 papular rash on the day of the first injection which resolved spontaneously 2&#x000a0;days after vaccination (n = 1)). None of these 3 participants had a medical history of allergy and for all of them the suspected allergen was unknown and these AESIs were considered as not related to study vaccination. No AESIs were observed in the placebo group and no other occurrences of these AESIs were observed after the second and third injections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s0005"><title>Discussion</title><p>This was the first clinical trial of CYD-TDV in India, a country which in 2010 was estimated to have contributed approximately 34% of the global total of dengue infections.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> The high dengue seropositivity rates (80&#x02013;87% against all 4 serotypes) at enrolment in this study in healthy Indian adults confirm the high degree of endemicity of dengue disease in India.</p><p>Overall, CYD-TDV administered at 0, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months produced a balanced humoral immune response against all 4 dengue serotypes in Indian adults regardless of baseline dengue immune status and displayed a satisfactory safety profile, comparable to that observed in similar trials elsewhere in Asia.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10,15,16</sup></xref> The majority of participants completed the study and no safety issues with CYD-TDV were reported during vaccine administration and subsequent 6&#x000a0;month safety follow-up.

The study was conducted at centers in New Delhi, Pune, Ludhiana, Bangalore and Kolkata between 27 March 2012 and 10 June 2013. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on the Harmonization-Good Clinical Practice. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before study entry. An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) oversaw the conduct of the study and was involved in the review of all deaths, related serious adverse events (SAEs) and virologically-confirmed dengue cases.</p><p>Individuals aged 18 to 45&#x000a0;years in good health based on medical history and physical examination, able to attend all study visits and to comply with study procedures, were eligible for participation in this study. Participants were ineligible if they: had febrile illness (temperature &#x02265;38.0&#x000b0;C) or moderate or severe acute illness/infection on the day of vaccination; had known seropositivity for human immu-nodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, and hepatitis C; had known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy within the previous 6&#x000a0;months, or long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for &#x0003e;2 consecutive weeks within the previous months); had receipt of blood or blood-derived products in the previous 3&#x000a0;months that might interfere with assessment of immune responses; were in receipt of (or planned receipt of) any vaccine in the 4&#x000a0;weeks preceding or following any trial vaccination. Pregnant or lactating women were also ineligible for inclusion and all female participants were required to be of non-child-bearing potential (i.e., post-menopausal for at least 1&#x000a0;year, surgically sterile, or using an effective method of contraception or were abstinence from at least 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to the first vaccination and until at least 4&#x000a0;weeks after the last vaccination). Women who became pregnant during the study were not to be vaccinated further. Contraindications for the second or third CYD-TDV doses included: evidence of anaphylactic or other significant allergic reaction to the previous study vaccination; an ongoing clinical adverse event (AE) related to the previous study vaccination or SAE following the previous study vaccination.</p><p>Participants were randomized 2:1 at enrolment by study site personnel via an interactive voice response system/interactive web response system (IVRS/IWRS), using a permuted block method with block size of 9 and stratification by site. A double randomization system was used, such that the participant treatment allocation was separated from dose dispensing. Each dose had both a code number and a dose number. The code number was used by the IVRS while the dose number was entered in the participant's eCRF. The unique dose numbers were defined according to a random list to ensure that dose numbers could not be used to distinguish between treatment groups.</p><p>Participants received a 3-dose primary series of subcutaneous injections of CYD-TDV or an inactive placebo (0.5&#x000a0;mL NaCl 0.9% solution) in the deltoid region of the upper arm at visits 0, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months, followed by a 6-month safety follow-up. Observers, investigators, the sponsor and participants were all blinded to the allocation of study injections. Phase III lots of CYD-TDV (Sanofi Pasteur S.A., France) were supplied as powder and solvent for suspension for subcutaneous injection. Each 0.5&#x000a0;mL injection of reconstituted vaccine contained 4.5&#x02013;6.0 log<sub>10</sub> cell-culture infectious dose 50% (CCID<sub>50</sub>) of each live, attenuated, recombinant dengue serotype 1, 2, 3, 4 virus.

AEs monitored throughout the study included: unsolicited systemic AEs within 30 minutes of each injection; solicited injection site reactions (tenderness, redness, and swelling) up to 7&#x000a0;days after each injection; solicited systemic reactions (headache, fever, malaise, myalgia and asthenia) up to 14&#x000a0;days after each injection; unsolicited AEs up to 28&#x000a0;days after each vaccination; SAEs throughout the trial; and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) considered to be relevant for the monitoring of the safety profile of CYD-TDV. AESIs included: hypersensitivity/allergic reactions within 7&#x000a0;days; serious viscerotropic disease and serious neurotropic disease within 30&#x000a0;days; and serious dengue disease at any time during the study. AE data after the initial 30-minute observation period were collected using diary cards with the specific solicited adverse reactions and an open field for unsolicited AEs. AEs were classified according to the following scale: Grade 1, no interference with activity; Grade 2, some interference with activity; and Grade 3, significant (prevents daily activity). Investigators assessed the causal relationship of each unsolicited systematic AE and vaccination and the participants rated the intensity of solicited and unsolicited AEs on their diary cards. SAEs were defined as events that were life-threatening or resulted in death, required in-patient hospitalization or prolonged existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, resulted in a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or were regarded as an important medical event.

For the main parameters, 95% confidence intervals (CI) of point estimates were calculated using the normal approximation for quantitative data and the exact binomial distribution (Clopper-Pearson method) for proportions. Analyses were performed on all available data, with no replacement of missing data. The full analysis set (FAS) for immunogenicity included all participants who received at least one dose of CYD-TDV or placebo and had at least one valid serology result after study injection.
