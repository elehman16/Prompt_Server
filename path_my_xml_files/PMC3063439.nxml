The ACE-inhibitors have previously been shown to be effective in migraine prophylaxis. Furthermore, ACE inhibitors have beneficial effects on endothelial dysfunction. We therefore investigated whether Enalapril is effective in endothelial function improvement.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>METHODS:</title><p>In this randomized clinical trial, 10 mg Enalapril daily was compared with matched placebo in 40 patients with migraine for two months. Flow Mediated Dilation (FMD), serum total nitrite and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured in all patients at the baseline and after 2 months.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>RESULTS:</title><p>patients&#x02019; FMD increased in the case group after treatment with Enalapril (p = 0.002) while there was no significant change in control group. Total nitrite concentration increased in case group (p = 0.000), while there was no significant difference before treatment. There was no significant difference in the CRP concentrations in two groups.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>These results indicate that ACE inhibition can improve endothelial function in patients with migraine, as it has been shown by both FMD and serum levels of nitric oxide. The mechanism could be either that Enalapril limits the angiotensin IIinduced production of superoxide radicals which would normally inactivate nitric oxide, or that it may increase bradykinin-mediated nitric oxide release.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Endothelium</kwd><kwd>Migraine Disorders</kwd><kwd>Nitrites</kwd><kwd>C-Reactive Protein</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>There are several relations between migraine, endothelial function, and vascular disease.

Patients, with diagnosis of migraine without aura in accordance with the International Headache Society criteria (second edition) (IHS-1.1),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> who agreed to participate after full clarification of the risk and benefits of Enalapril were enrolled in the study.</p><p>Patients who had hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, infectious diseases, known liver or kidney disorders, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, gynecologic disorders (such as polymenorrhea, cystic ovary disease), morbid obesity (Body Mass Index &#x0003e; 35), current cigarette smoking habit, alcohol or other substances consumption, anemia, sinusitis, tension type headache more than 5 days per month, or less than 5 migraine attacks per month, were not included in this study.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included hypersensitivity to ACE inhibitors, pregnancy or lactation, presenting Enalapril complications and use of vitamin B12-containing supplements. All patients have used at least one firstline prophylactic drug without advantage in the past. None of the patients had previously used ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor blockers.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study Design</title><p>The diagram of patients&#x02019; participation through the study has been shown in figure 1. In this randomized clinical trial, patients started one month as a baseline period, in which no prophylactic medication was used. After this time patients underwent a complete examination that included: physical examination, blood sampling for biochemistry measurements (NO2/NO3, CRP) and forearm flow mediated dilation (FMD). Patients were randomized to receive 5 mg Enalapril or placebo twice a day for two months with the use of a computer generated randomization list with 11 consecutive balanced blocks of four patients (two Enalapril, two placebo). The placebo was matched with Enalapril tablets in shape, color and size. Patients were allowed to treat their acute migraine attacks with non-steroid anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or Triptans. During these 2 months the patients advised not to use any drugs without our permission. Every two weeks all patients were evaluated about Enalapril complications and the usage of other medications by an observer blinded to case and control groups. After these 2 months, all patients were recalled and complete examination was done, blood samples for biochemistry measurements (NO2/NO3, CRP) were drawn, and forearm FMD was performed.</p><p>In the current study we tested the hypothesis that using 10 mg Enalapril daily would improve endothelial function of patients with migraine according to chemical and functional markers.</p><p>The primary outcome was the FMD index which was appraise before and after two months of treatment.</p><p>And secondary efficacy measures were the levels of CRP and NO2 and NO3 which were assessed before and after two months of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents</title><p>The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients participating in the study. This trial is registered with Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT), number IRCT138711011570N1.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Biochemical Measurements</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Sample Preparation:</title><p>5 ml blood samples were obtained from the antecubital vein in supine position before the FMD study. Sera were separated by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes and then were aliquot and stored at -70&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>CRP Assay:</title><p>The serum levels of CRP were determined by ELISA kit according to manufactures&#x02032; instruction (IBL, Hamburg, Germany). The sensitivity of the assay was less than 1 &#x003bc;g/ml.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>NO Assay:</title><p>The serum level of stable NO metabolites nitrite and nitrate were measured using a colorimetric assay (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, USA) based on Griess reaction as previously described.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> For nitrite measurement, briefly, after serum addition into wells, sulphanilamide solution was added to all experimental samples, and after incubation, N-1-naphtylethylenediamine dihydrochloride solution was added. Then, absorbance was measured by a microreader in 540 nm wavelength. For nitrate measurement the enzymatic conversion of nitrate to nitrite by nitrate reductase was done. The reaction was followed by colorimetric detection of nitrite as an azo dye product of the Griess Reaction. This assay measures total nitrite by converting nitrate to nitrite. To determine the nitrate concentration, the endogenous nitrite concentration measured from the nitrite assay that was subtracted from the nitrite concentration measured in this procedure.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Flow Mediated Dilation (FMD):</title><p>A highresolution B-mode ultrasonographic system (ATL Ultrasound, HDI 5000, Bothell, Washington, USA) with a linear transducer mid-frequency of 7.5 MHz was used to determine FMD of the brachial artery. An expert blinded to case and control groups performed all FMDs. At first, patients laid back at rest for 10 minutes. Then baseline brachial artery diameter was determined by locating probe on 4-5 cm above the antecubital fossa of the non-dominant arm. After that a pneumatic tourniquet of a sphygmomanometer was inflated on the most proximal portion of the forearm to a pressure of 300 mmHg for 5 minutes. The cuff was then released and second scan was taken 30 seconds before and 90 seconds after cuff deflation. Artery diameters were determined with ultrasonic calipers from the leading edge of the anterior wall to the leading edge of posterior wall of the brachial artery at the end of diastolic period. 3 other observers supervised the procedures. Changes in diameter were computed as percentage relative to the baseline diameter. None of the patients were experienced headache during measurements. Also FMD was not measured during menstrual phase in female patients. All the FMDs were performed between 10 A.M. and 12 A.M.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The results are expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard error (SE). A normal distribution was proven with the test of Kolmogorov-Smirnov. Differences in FMD, serum NO&#x003c7; and CRP concentrations between case and control groups were analyzed using the independent sample t test and differences within the groups (before and after treating with Enalapril or placebo) were determined by paired sample t test. Differences between the groups were examined by independent sample t test and inside the groups were determined by paired sample t test. P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 16.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2-6"><title>The Demographic Information</title><p>Forty patients with migraine without aura (IHS-1.1) were enrolled in this study, between July 2008 and June 2009. 6 (15 percents) of them were males and 34 (85 percents) were female.

This distorted balance induces an increase of oxidative stress, inflammation, and hypercoagulability state. It has been shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have multiple beneficial effects on endothelial function.</p><p>It has been shown that endothelial dysfunction is mediated by impaired vascular reactivity and decreased NO bioavailability; an important factor in normal function of endothelial system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> There are many evidences suggesting that patients with migraine have changed reactivity in the systemic as well as cranial vasculature in the interictal period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref> It has been reported that patients with migraine have decreased endothelium dependent function assessed by FMD and increased nitrate-mediated response in their brachial artery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></p><p>Evidence of enothelial dysfunction in migraine is increasing. It has been shown that levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a reliable endothelial dysfunction biomarker, were significantly higher in patients with migraine than in nonheadache controls during the interictal phase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></p><p>In young, relatively healthy cohort of women, a strong relation between biomarkers of endothelial activation, including VWF activity, high sensitive CRP, tissue plasminogen activator antigen, and total nitrite/nitrate concentration and migraine has been demonstrated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></p><p>Migraine is associated with reduction in the number and function of endothelial progenitor cells, serving as a marker for dysfunctional endothelium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></p><p>Our results showed that daily consumption of 10 mg Enalapril results in significant FMD increase as compared to before treatment and control group. In line of our results, ACEI therapy has been associated with improved FMD and increased NO bioavailability in several other diseases with endothelial dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></p><p>Although, NO has been implicated in migraine attacks, but the role of NO in migraine remains unclear. There are several studies that have shown decreased or unchanged NO metabolites in patients with migraine in interictal periods.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref> It has been shown that decreased NO bioavailability is associated with decreased cerebral blood flow.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref> In our study, there is a significant change in patients&#x02019; nitrite concentration. Among the NO metabolites nitrite is a major oxidative metabolite, which was implicated to be an indicator of NO synthase (NOS) activity. It has been shown that up to 70-90% of plasma nitrite is derived from endothelial NOS (eNOS) activity in fasted humans and others.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref> Furthermore plasma nitrite levels progressively decrease with increasing cardiovascular risk load.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></p><p>It is well known that ACE inhibitors augment endothelium-dependent vasodilation through an increase in NO bioavailability, by an increase in NO production and a decrease in NO inactivation.</p><p>It has been shown that the ACEI therapy increased eNOS protein expression and cardiac NOS activity, however, inducible and neuronal NO synthase expression was not changed by the ACE inhibition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref> So, it can be assumed that Enalapril might increase the eNOS expression in vessels of patients with migraine in our study. ACEIs suppress angiotensin II production and inhibit break down of bradykinin leading to increase in nitric oxide production.</p><p>Angiotensin II induces the production of reactive oxygen species and stimulates the expression of adhesion molecules and cytokines, leading to endothelial dysfunction, adhesion and invasion of leukocytes. So, ACEIs may also be contributed to increased NO bioactivity by limiting oxidative degradation of NO.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></p><p>Vascular inflammation is another downstream result of endothelial dysfunction. In our study, contrary to our hypothesis, Enalapril supplementation could not decrease CRP significantly. Similar results have been recently attained from ACEIs therapy in patients with several other endothelial dysfunction associated diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref> These finding may suggest that beneficial effects of ACEIs cannot be explained by anti inflammatory action of these drugs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our study revealed that Enalapril can possibly improve endothelial function.
