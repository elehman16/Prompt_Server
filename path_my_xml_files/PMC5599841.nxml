exercise therapy protocol among patients with thoracolumbar and/or lumbar scoliosis.
[Subjects and Methods] Fifty patients (10&#x02013;17 years), Cobb&#x02019;s angle 10&#x02013;20 degrees with
thoracolumbar and lumbar scoliosis participated in the study. Soleus H-reflex was tested
on both sides during prone lying position and standing position. Patients were randomly
assigned into two groups. Group I received direction sensitive exercise therapy while the
participants in group II received traditional exercise. Exercises were applied three times
per week for twelve successive weeks. [Results] There were significant differences
indicating asymmetry in the H-reflex amplitude on concave side. Cobb&#x02019;s angle significantly
decreased and the H-reflex amplitude on concave side as well as H concave/convex ratios in
both lying and standing significantly increased in both groups. Direction sensitive
exercise therapy showed a more significant increase in the measured outcomes than
traditional exercises therapy protocol. [Conclusion] H-reflex test was effective in
discovering the asymmetry between concave and convex sides. Based on H-reflex test,
direction-sensitive exercise therapy was more effective than traditional exercises in
decreasing Cobb&#x02019;s angle and increasing H-reflex values as well as H/H percent in concave
side in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Direction sensitive exercise therapy</kwd><kwd>Exercises</kwd><kwd>Idiopathic scoliosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Scoliosis is a spinal deformity that has abnormal lateral curvature of the spine with the
Cobb angle is greater than 10&#x000b0;<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It
affects the school-going children during the growth spurts of adolescents involving coronal,
sagittal and axial angulations with unknown etiology<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> and considered as adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS)<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It affects girls to boys equally in adolescents with spinal curvatures of 10 degrees. With
Cobb&#x02019;s angle greater than 30 degrees, the ratio increases to 10 girls for every boy, and the
scoliosis in girls tends to progress more often<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The prevalence of AIS is 2&#x02013;3% of the growing age population between
10 and 16&#x02005;years of age<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In Saudi Arabia,
the prevalence was reported to be in the range of 0.16 to 0.5% from which 59% are AIS with
mean age of discovery was 12.5&#x02005;years<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The conservative therapies include exercises, physiotherapy, intensive rehabilitation
programs and bracing<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies provide evidences support the efficacy of
physiotherapy and rehabilitation programs in treatment of AIS<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercises could correct a complex three-dimensional structural
deformity, reduce the Cobb angles of individuals and improve strength, mobility and balance
that occurs in AIS<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies suggest the muscle imbalance as a main cause of this disorder but scant or
even no researches attributed its occurrence to the central or peripheral nervous system
problems. Thus, there is a true need to search for possible underlying neural causes for
AIS. The H-reflex is an electrophysiological procedure for diagnosing side-to-side latency
differences at the lumbosacral spinal level<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. With the evidence of prolonged latency in
case of lumbar radiculopathy, the H-reflex amplitude asymmetry may be more evident than
latency changes in nerve root involvement as compared with latency<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Limited studies have suggested, but not tested the neural
source or causes of AIS that the spinal cord trigger the changes in spinal reflex
asymmetry<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies using
neural structures as a cause initiating the AIS was the neuro-dynamic effects of the
vestibular system<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Asymmetry of sensory
signal would be the most likely source of vertebral misalignment in AIS<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Detecting a reflex asymmetry at an earlier stage of development would be an alerting signal
to intervene for correction before other subservient structures e.g. muscle, soft tissues
and bony components to be involved. The rationale for the use of H-reflex as a measure of
neural compromise is the fact that H-reflex is the most sensitive measure for nerve root
function<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. A nerve root (L5 or S1) may
contain several thousand-nerve axons that transmit the peripheral signal to the spinal cord.
Such signal must be symmetrical if originated from equally symmetrical organs (sensory
sources). If these input signals from both lower limbs tend to be asymmetric, it would be
interpreted by the spinal cord as such. The spinal cord response would be to adjust the
spinal alignment of the vertebrae to offset such asymmetry causing the scoliotic curve. This
theoretical assumption is clearly noted in sciatic scoliosis and is reasonable to be assumed
in AIS.</p><p>If proved, this concept may slow the progress of such curves and it may help in reversing
the occurrence of such curve by applying appropriate intervention stress on improving the
amplitude of H-reflex and correcting this asymmetry. Direction sensitive exercise therapy
(DSET) based on reflex asymmetry. It has been significantly useful in eliminating lower back
pain in patients with lumbar radiculopathy. DSET might be useful in reducing the progress of
the pathologic curvature in AIS subjects by improving H-reflex symmetry. Therefore, the aim
of the study was to detect H-reflex asymmetry and investigate the effect of DSET protocol
among patients with thoracolumbar and/or lumbar scoliosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study design was a randomized clinical trial. The Ethics Review Committee at Umm

with Cobb&#x02019;s angle 10&#x02013;20 degrees measured from standing three-foot anteroposterior chest
radiograph was included in the study. They had good healthy condition except scoliosis, able
to tolerate H reflex including electric stimuli of the lower amplitude, can understand and
communicate with no mental abnormalities. Patients were excluded if they were cerebral palsy
or other neurological disorders, patients with nutritional disorders e.g. diabetes or
vascular disorders.</p><p>After initial evaluation, patients were randomly assigned into two equal groups. The Group
I received DSET while the participants in group II received traditional exercise therapy
protocol (TETP). Randomization was performed by a random number generator. Patients,
evaluator and therapists were blinded from the process of randomization.</p><p>Assessment of Soleus H-reflexes asymmetries to both legs was performed by EMG unit (Cadwell
Lab., Kennewik, WA, USA). The skin was abraded using light sand paper and cleaned with
alcohol in order to reduce the skin impedance before applying the electrodes. The recording
electrode was placed 3&#x02005;cm, distal to the bifurcation of the gastrocnemii muscles, over the
soleus muscle using surface electrodes with electro conductive gel. Subjects were instructed
not to turning their head or moving arms or legs during testing. A ground metal electrode
was placed to the skin of the lateral gastrocnemius. EMG unit was set at a gain of (1&#x02013;5
mv./div.) and filter bandpass of 10&#x02005;Hz&#x02013;10 kHz elicited the soleus H-reflex by electrically
by stimulate the tibial nerve at the popliteal fossa with pulse duration=1.0&#x02005;ms and
frequency=0.2&#x02005;Hz. Ten traces were elicited and recorded for each side. The stimulation
intensity for H-maximum (H<sub>max</sub>) was maintained by verifying the constant amplitude
of the minimal M-wave<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. H-reflex was
examined from lying and standing positions. The H<sub>max</sub> (peak-to-peak amplitude) and
the side-to-side amplitude (H/H) ratios for the concave and convex side from lying and
standing positions were obtained and recorded. Measurements were taken at the beginning of
the study and after 12 weeks (post treatment) after the completion of the treatment
intervention in both treatment groups.</p><p>Patients in the group I received DSET. Based on H-reflex measurements, the H-reflex
amplitude was measured during neutral standing posture, side bending and rotation (right and
left). Also, H<sub>max</sub> was measured while the patient in forward, backward bending and
during side bending and rotation (to the right and left sides). The position of maximum
neural decompression (H-reflex recovery) was considered as the optimum spinal posture (OSP)
and maximum compression (H-reflex depression) considered as unwanted spinal posture (USP)
was identified. After determining the OSP for each patient, a custom position and exercise
program that encourage this posture were applied 3times per week for 12 weeks and at home.
Patients were asked to sleep or sit in the decompression posture as long as possible.
Positioning, exercises, and mobilization stressed on the mobility more than the
strengthening phase of this protocol.</p><p>TETP was applied for patients in group II 3 times/week for 12 successive weeks and the same
program was repeated at home. A handout was given to the patient describing the exercise
program illustrating by photos. Treatment was included stretching on the concave side,
strengthening on the convex side, postural correction, mobilizing and breathing
exercises<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cobb&#x02019;s angle, H<sub>max</sub> on both sides during lying and standing was recorded from all
patients. The percentage of H<sub>max</sub> (concave to convex) sides from lying and
standing were also calculated. Standing to lying rations on the concave and convex sides
were also calculated.</p><p>Calculation of the estimated sample size based on power analysis was performed by G-Power
3.1 for Windows. Patient demographic data as age, weight, height and BMI were analyzed by
un-paired t-test using SPSS program for Windows, version 16. Comparison between groups were
carried out by un-paired t-test. Comparison between the baselines, after 12 weeks of
treatments in each group was performed by paired t-test. The level of significance was set
at p&#x0003e;0.05 for all tests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total number of 60 patients participated in the study. Ten patients withdrew and did not

patterns of faulty posture and aggravation of the radiculopathy during functional daily
activities, the severity of neural compromise at the root level may increase<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The continued barrage of sensory effect
from the lower limb&#x02019;s sensory afferents would be the most likely source of feeding the
signal to maintain the vertebral curvature. Asymmetry of such sensory signal would be the
most likely source of vertebral misalignment in AIS<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Neurophysiologic concepts stressed on the fact that the sensory signal always precedes the
motor signal and adjust it for the demand of the body segment. Such sensory signal would be
more located in the afferents of sensory nerve roots and its adjacent spinal cord root
ganglia. Muscular and body structure may follow as subservient to the neural components<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The result of the present study suggests that a reflex asymmetry may precede muscular and
bony structures. Furthermore, it is important to mention that the posture control lies
mainly in the central nervous system. Such control arises from spinal peripheral neural
structures such as muscle spindle afferents, Golgi tendon organs, cutaneous and joint
receptors in association with the central integrating circuits of the spinal cord<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. The rates of neural axis abnormalities in
infantile and juvenile idiopathic scoliosis may be as high as 50%<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such abnormalities in the spinal cord may cause variation
to the output by spinal cord alpha motoneurones to the axial vertebral muscles and resulting
in weakness in one side and more activity in the contralateral side and eventually the
scoliotic curve. A reflex asymmetry at one level would initiate a more caudal or rostral
corrective neural or reflex response causing a secondary curve.</p><p>In a previous study applied on normal subjects, it was reported 73% difference from both
sides in lying while about 72% difference between the right and left sides in standing
position while the difference between lying to standing was about 70%. This study suggesting
the use of H-reflex testing in such functional positions as a useful diagnostic tool in
detecting subtle changes in root impingement<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study comparing the difference in H-reflex amplitude in
patients with radiculopathy. The result showed 67% of the asymmetry between both sides while
the side to side difference was 83% in normal<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The values obtained by the current study was consistent with those
previous studies as it showed that the H/H standing to lying ratio at the concave side was
about 68.11% at the pre-treatment in both groups and the concave/convex asymmetry was 65.7%
in lying and 64.9% in standing.</p><p>Exercises were effective in the treatment of patients with AIS. Exercise was applied 3
times a week for 12 weeks was found to be effective even at a 40-degree or higher Cobb&#x02019;s
angle<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. Core stabilization training in
addition to traditional exercises was effective in the correction of vertebral rotation and
reduction of pain in AIS<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. A 10-week
core strengthening exercises decreases Cobb angle and improves back muscle strength in
patients with functional scoliosis<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Schroth exercises applied for five sessions in the two weeks with a daily home program in
supervised sessions improved the quality-of-life and back muscle endurance<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. Swiss ball exercise and chest resistance
exercise training applied for 30&#x02005;min per day, five times per week, for eight weeks were
effective in improving the static balancing ability<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>, the respiratory function and trunk control ability of patients
with scoliosis<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>. Adding Game-Trak to
three dimensional (3D) interactive game to specific physiotherapeutic scoliosis-specific
exercises intervention improved exercise performance<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. Physicians who believe in using exercise during conservative
management of AIS appreciate not only their capability to in&#x0fb02;uence positively the spinal
curvature but also to increase the neuro-motor control and stability of the spine, reduce
postural collapse, and increase breathing function<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are also several reports, which include positive results of
treatment of scoliosis of 10&#x02013;25&#x000b0; by means of exercises only<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Exercises, based for choosing a position that H-reflex was recovered and being in maximum
value, was more effective than traditional exercises in improving the H-reflex value as well
as the H/H ratios on the concave side. DSET is considered as 3D exercises as it may include
flexion or extension with bending and rotation to one side. As it was reported that 3D
exercises can be used for the treatment of small curves (15&#x02013;30 degrees) together with the
physio-logics program<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The H-reflex test was effective in discovering the asymmetry between both sides in patients
with AIS. Based on the H-reflex test, DSET was more effective in decreasing Cobb&#x02019;s angle and
increasing H-reflex values as well as H/H percent at concave side in patients with AIS.
Future studies investigating changes in other variables like pain, trunk range of motion and
muscle fiber action potentials at both sides of the curve during measuring H-reflex to
correlate the changes of H-reflex with the myogenic potentials. Studies on more complicated
cases, as in double curves and Cobb&#x02019;s angle 20&#x000b0; will be considered in future research.</p><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This project was funded by the National Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation
