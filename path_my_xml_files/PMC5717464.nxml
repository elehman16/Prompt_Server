It has resulted in significant improvement in the outcome of hypospadias repair. Despite this, the incidence of postoperative complications after hypospadias repair is 1&#x02013;24% <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Therefore, besides the surgical technique used for hypospadias repair, other factors affecting the outcome of hypospadias repair may exist. Some of these factors including patient age, type of hypospadias, presence and degree of chordee, quality and width of urethral plate, type of suture, type of suturing technique, use of magnification during repair, type of dressing used after repair, use of catheter during repair, provision of soft tissue coverage over urethra, and use of antibiotics after repair have been reported in literature <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

Prophylactic preoperative i.v. antibiotic (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) was administered routinely in all patients at the start of surgery. The surgery was performed under general anaesthesia with caudal analgesia to decrease the postoperative pain in all patients.

In an attempt to achieve these goals of hypospadias repair &#x0003e;250 reported methods of hypospadias repair have been described and even newer techniques and their modifications continue to evolve. Different types of urethroplasty techniques involve simple tubularisation of the urethral plate, midline incision and tubularisation of urethral plate (TIP), use of adjacent skin flaps, free skin grafts, buccal mucosal grafts, and mobilised vascular flaps (mostly using inner preputial skin) <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Amongst these, the TIP repair is more versatile than other repairs and has gained widespread acceptance for hypospadias repair especially for distal hypospadias. The fact that it is a consistent and easily reproducible technique, which produces acceptable cosmetic and functional results in a timely manner, is a testament to its simplicity.</p><p id="p0095">Variations in surgical techniques and various other factors can affect the functional and cosmetic outcome of the operation <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, the exact roles of these factors are yet to be determined. Whilst use of absorbable sutures for hypospadias repair has been universally accepted, there is no general agreement on the suturing technique (interrupted or continuous). The choice of suturing technique in hypospadias repair is mainly dictated by surgeon&#x02019;s preference. Moreover, the method of the suturing technique may affect the outcome of hypospadias repair as in bowel anastomosis. The effect of various suturing techniques has been best studied in bowel anastomosis and it has been found that the use of an interrupted-suturing technique for bowel anastomosis results in a decreased complication rate as compared to continuous suturing <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Similarly, the effect of suturing technique on outcome of hypospadias repair has also been studied <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, but still there are no specific guidelines for the suturing technique.</p><p id="p0100">In their study, Ulman et al. <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> compared the use of 6&#x02013;0 polyglactin in a single layer, full thickness, uninterrupted fashion to subcuticular suturing in uninterrupted fashion with 7&#x02013;0 polydioxanone. They found that use of a subcuticular 7&#x02013;0 continuous suture was associated with a lower incidence of complications as compared to full-thickness suture urethroplasty in hypospadias repair. Similarly, Khan et al. <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> also found that the use of an inverting continuous suture was associated with a lower incidence of urethrocutaneous fistula as compared to over-and-over suture continuous suture urethroplasty in hypospadias repair.</p><p id="p0105">In their study, El-Sherbiny et al. <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> found that on univariate analysis suturing technique was a significant risk factor that could affect the outcome of hypospadias repair. They found that on univariate analysis, the use of a running suture was significantly associated with a higher fistula rate (23%) as compared to an interrupted suturing technique (9%). However, on multivariate analysis they found that the suturing technique had no independent significance. In another univariate analysis study, Sarhan et al. <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> found no significant difference in the fistula rate after an interrupted (15%) or continuous suture (12.5%) technique in hypospadias repair. Snodgrass et al. <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, in their study, also found no difference in urethroplasty complications in patients on the basis of sutures and suturing techniques. Our present study also supports the findings of these studies, as we found no significant difference between the fistula rate amongst the interrupted- (12%) and continuous-suturing (14%) techniques in hypospadias repair. Similarly, there was no significant difference in overall outcomes of the interrupted- (20%) and continuous-suturing (22%) techniques in hypospadias repair. An advantage of our present study is that it was a prospective randomised study similar to that reported by Sarhan et al. <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A limitation of our study is that surgeons were not blinded to the suturing techniques in both groups, which may result in bias in outcome. However, we tried to eliminate any bias in outcome assessment by assigning the outcome assessment to author-3 and author-4, who were blinded to the type of suturing techniques used for urethroplasty in the patients selected for the study. Beside this, in our present study we matched most of the factors that could affect outcome of hypospadias repair in both groups, to concentrate on the effect of the suturing technique on the outcome of hypospadias repair so that the chance of error in statistical analysis due to the presence of confounding factors might be minimised. Another limitation of the present study is the small sample size in both groups, therefore the power of study was low and further studies with larger sample sizes are required to support these findings.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0110">In the present study, the type of suture technique had no significant effect on the occurrence of complications after Snodgrass hypospadias repair and thus suturing choice depends on surgeon preference. However, due to the small sample size of the present study, further studies with larger sample sizes are required to support this conclusion.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><title>Conflict of
