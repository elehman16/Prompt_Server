Patient involvement can be fostered by web-based Interactive Health Communication Applications (IHCAs) combining health information with decision support, social support and/or behaviour change support. They reach great numbers of patients at low cost and provide high-quality information and support at the time, place and learning speed patients prefer. Still, online tools often suffer from high attrition. Tailoring content and tone of IHCAs to the individual patient&#x000b4;s needs might improve their effectiveness. This study aims to test the effectiveness and usage of a tailored IHCA combining health information with decision support and behaviour change support for patients with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The effectiveness and usage of the tailored IHCA will be tested against a standard website with identical content in a single-blinded randomized trial with a parallel design. The content covers information on type 2 diabetes, its complications and sequelae, and its treatment options including health behaviour. In the intervention group the content is delivered in dialogue form, tailored to relevant patient characteristics (health literacy, attitudes towards self-care, and barriers to insulin treatment). In the control group the different sections are presented in a content tree, without any tailoring. Participants are blinded to group assignment. Eligibility criteria are age &#x02265; 18 years, self-reported type 2 diabetes, and Internet access. The study aims to include 414 participants in order to detect the expected small effect (Cohen&#x02019;s d=0.2), with measurements at baseline, directly after the first visit, and at 3-month follow-up. The primary hypothesis is that the tailored IHCA has larger effects on diabetes knowledge and patient empowerment (primary outcomes) than the standard website. Secondary outcomes are website usage as well as decisional conflict and preparation for decision making. All measurements are online self-report questionnaires.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>IHCAs are a promising way to foster diabetes knowledge and self-management competencies.

The number of people living with diabetes more than doubled during the last three decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Projections expect the prevalence to rise from 2.8% in 2000 to 4.4% in 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90 to 95% of diabetes cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Patients, practitioners, scientists and politicians have called for more active patient involvement in the making of medical decisions as well as in the management of diabetes. Patient involvement has been shown to reduce fasting blood glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin levels, and the need for diabetes medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Two main aspects of patient involvement are self-management and shared decision-making (SDM). Both for shared decision-making and for self-management patients need to be informed about their disease, its course, and the treatment options at hand, including their advantages and disadvantages. However, due to limited resources in health care, large numbers of patients still do not have access to feasible diabetes education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In times of rapidly growing Internet penetration, the web holds the opportunity to deliver health information and support to large numbers of participants on comparatively low cost and at the time, place and learning speed the individual users prefer. Trials of systematically and thoroughly developed online health interventions show small but consistent effects on clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] even in older populations that are generally thought to be less inclined to use the web [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Murray et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] reviewed the effects of a format that combines health information with at least one other type of support, e.g., social support, decision support, or behaviour change support (= &#x0201c;Interactive Health Communication Applications&#x0201d;, IHCAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. They found that IHCAs can have positive effects on knowledge, social support, clinical, and behavioural outcomes.</p><p>Still, the effectiveness of those online applications is limited by high attrition rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and few users visit a health intervention website more than once [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Since the effect of online interventions increases with dose (longer stays, repeated website visits, total contact hours) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], effectiveness is maximized if patients work intensively with the information offered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and return for repeated visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Individualization and personalization of information as well as an interactive presentation have been found to effectively increase exposure to and effectiveness of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These three strategies can be subsumed under the concept of tailoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><sec><title>Aims of the trial</title><p>This trial tests an IHCA presenting diabetes information, self-management education and decision support in a dialogue-based, tailored format against a website presenting the same information in a content tree without dialogue or tailoring. The primary hypothesis is that the interactive and individualized delivery format has larger effects on diabetes knowledge and patient empowerment than the standard website. Exploratory research questions are if usage is higher for the interactive and individualized delivery format and whether users facing a health decision experience less decisional conflict and feel better prepared for the consultation after using the interactive and individualized site rather than the standard website.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>We chose a single-blinded two-armed randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a parallel design. We aim to include N=414 participants. Measurements are scheduled immediately before the first use of the system, immediately after and at three month follow-up. Diabetes knowledge (primary outcome), decisional conflict, and preparation for decision making (secondary outcomes) are assessed immediately after the first visit. Patient empowerment (secondary outcome) is assessed three months after the first visit (see figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study procedures.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6947-13-24-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Study procedures</title><p>After providing an informed consent and completing the pre-assessment (eligibility criteria, demographic data, time since diagnosis, treatment) the participants are randomly assigned to the tailored IHCA or the standard website with the content tree. In the intervention group, the questions used for tailoring are presented during the dialogue. Participants assigned to the control condition where no tailoring takes place fill in these questionnaires immediately before visiting the website in order to control for baseline disparities between intervention and control group. Immediately after their first visit to the IHCA or the standard website all participants are asked to fill in the post-assessment.</p><p>All participants receive an e-mail three months after their first visit asking them to fill in the follow-up online questionnaire. Because non-monetary incentives have been shown to reduce attrition in online trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], participants who have answered all questionnaires receive a 10 &#x020ac; amazon gift voucher. The voucher code is sent to them by e-mail at the end of the study. Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> gives an overview of the study procedures.</p><p>Participants are free to use the intervention as often and as long as they wish, also between the post and follow-up assessment. Information on frequency and duration of usage is gathered via server registrations. Usage data, data from the self-assessment questionnaires, and personal data such as name and e-mail address are saved separately. Data are pseudonymesed. After data collection, personal data will be deleted. If a participant withdraws his or her informed consent to study participation his or her data shall be erased immediately. All data will be erased five years after the end of the study. The study was approved by the Hamburg Medical Chamber ethics committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment allocation</title><p>The informed consent informs participants that they will be randomly assigned to one of two presentation formats holding the same content. The two formats are not further elucidated so participants do not know whether they are in the intervention or control group. Randomisation is performed by computer.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>In Germany, health care for chronically ill patients is organized in different sectors, mainly in acute-care clinics and rehabilitation centres for in-patient care, and primary care and diabetology practices for out-patient care. Treatment in acute-care clinics, in primary care practices, and in diabetology practices is funded by health insurance while rehabilitation in rehabilitation centres is usually funded by pension funds. Study aim is to include patients from all sectors. Recruitment takes place via support from different health insurance companies, pension funds, primary care practices and diabetology practices, hospitals and rehabilitation centres, and self-help groups. The study is advertised in various media such as newspapers, magazines, patient websites, and flyers.

According to the American Diabetes Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], type 2 diabetes should be diagnosed if a fasting plasma glucose of &#x02265; 126 mg/dl or a non-fasting plasma glucose of &#x02265; 200 mg/dl or a plasma glucose of &#x02265; 200 mg/dl two hours after oral intake of 75g glucose (oral Glucose Tolerance Test, oGTT) is measured. Supposing that most patients cannot give these exact numbers and that self-reported diagnoses are a valid criterion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], we decided to rely on self-reported diagnosis of type 2 diabetes as inclusion criterion.</p></sec><sec><title>Description of the intervention and control condition</title><p>The content of both the tailored IHCA and the standard website covers basic information on diabetes (pathophysiology, epidemiology, subtypes, symptoms) and its sequelae (neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, heart and vessel problems, sexual dysfunction, and depression), information on health behaviour and lifestyle changes, and treatment options (see section Chapters and sections). The look of the website (colours, typing, figures and pictures) is identical in both conditions.

A tunnelled design where the user is guided through the content was found to increase website use and knowledge gained from a website more than a design with more user control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Still, it might also annoy the user and evoke resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Consequently we decided to give the user some control over the path he/she takes through the dialogue. At the end of each text passage the user chooses one of at least three reply options and receives a tailored answer. The answers mirror what the user has said, convey esteem and empathy and build an individualized bridge to the next content block.</p><p><italic>Tailoring</italic> is performed on the following patient characteristics: health literacy, attitudes towards self-care, and, if insulin treatment is a relevant topic, psychological barriers to it. The questionnaires that assess patient characteristics are presented during the dialogue: In the beginning of the respective section (e.g. diabetic foot), the participant is asked about his or her knowledge or attitude toward the topic. The following section is then modified according to his/her answer.

In order to find out which topics are relevant to patients with type 2 diabetes, we performed a needs assessment with two steps: First, semi-structured interviews with seven physicians (all internists, 1 working as a general practitioner, 2 specialized in diabetology) and ten patients with type 2 diabetes were conducted. In the second step, a self-assessment questionnaire was developed based on the main results of the interviews, and it was administered to a new and larger patient sample (N=178). The needs assessment will be described in more detail elsewhere. In order to ensure that information is evidence-based treatment guidelines were used as primary sources. Based on review articles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], expert advice and up-to-dateness, the British [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and the American [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] guidelines were chosen. Throughout the development, the content was revised by an interdisciplinary advisory committee in an iterative process. The development will be described in more detail elsewhere.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome assessment</title><p>The primary outcomes are diabetes knowledge (assessed immediately after the first visit) and patient empowerment (assessed at three month follow-up). Diabetes knowledge is assessed with 16 multiple-choice questions we developed according to the IHCA&#x000b4;s content. Patient empowerment is measured with the Health Education Impact Questionnaire (HeiQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The HeiQ includes 42 items and eight dimensions: Positive and Active Engagement in Life, Health Directed Behavior, Skill and Technique Acquisition, Constructive Attitudes and Approaches, Self-Monitoring and Insight, Health Service Navigation, Social Integration and Support, and Emotional Wellbeing. Schuler and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] translated the questionnaire into German and evaluated its psychometric properties (Raykov&#x02019;s Composite Reliability Coefficient, factorial and concurrent validity). They were able to replicate the structure of the eight scales and found the questionnaire to be a reliable and valid measure. We removed Social Integration and Support from our testing battery since we did not expect an effect of our IHCA on that dimension.</p><p>Secondary outcomes are decisional conflict and preparation for decision making. Decisional conflict is assessed with the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) by O&#x000b4;Connor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. This questionnaire measures personal perceptions of uncertainty in choosing options, modifiable factors contributing to uncertainty such as feeling uninformed, unclear about personal values and unsupported in decision making, and effective decision making such as feeling the choice is informed, values-based, likely to be implemented, and expressing satisfaction with the choice. Reliability is good with a Cronbach&#x000b4;s &#x003b1; between 0.78 and 0.92 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Discriminant validity is acceptable.</p><p>Preparation for decision making is measured with the Preparation for Decision Making Scale (PDMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. This 11 item scale assesses a patient&#x000b4;s or participant&#x000b4;s perception of how useful a decision aid or decision support intervention was in preparing him or her to communicate with his or her practitioner in making a health decision. Reliability is very good ranging from &#x003b1;=.92 to &#x003b1;=.94. Both questionnaires are offered only to those participants who have indicated that they are facing a health decision concerning their type 2 diabetes. In order to avoid missing data, all questionnaires include validation checks that alert participants when their answers are implausible or items are skipped.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>T-tests for independent samples will be performed to test the hypotheses. Due to randomization and the supposed structural equality of the groups we do not expect confounding factors. If we detect baseline disparities between the control and intervention group they will be included in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) as confounding variables. Following the intention-to-treat approach we will include all randomized participants in the analyses in order to avoid biases such as non-random attrition of participants. Additionally we will perform a sensitivity analysis following the per-protocol approach including only participants that have filled in all the questionnaires. For all analyses &#x003b1; &#x02264; 0.05 will be the critical value for statistical significance. We expect only small sample sizes with respect to the exploratory research questions because only a fraction of the participants will be facing a health decision and will therefore be asked to fill in the DCS and PDMS. For all parameters 95% confidence intervals will be defined so we will be able to appraise the exactitude of testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Power calculation</title><p>On the basis of the Cochrane review by Murray et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] we expect a small effect on the primary outcomes (Cohen&#x02019;s d=0.2). To detect a small effect with an &#x003b1; of 0.05 and a power of 0.80 (one-tailed t-test), a sample size of N=310 (155 per group) is required. Expecting a rate of dropout 20% between registration and follow-up (3 months), we aim at including a sample of N=414 at baseline.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In an on-going RCT, we are testing a web-based, tailored, dialogue-based information system that contains information on type 2 diabetes and its sequelae, health behaviour, and treatment options, against a standard website providing identical information without dialogue structure, tailoring or interactive elements. Both websites were thoroughly developed based on a needs assessment and two evidence-based guidelines, and reviewed by an interdisciplinary advisory committee. The primary outcomes of the trial are diabetes knowledge and patient empowerment. Secondary outcomes are decisional conflict, preparation for decision making, and website usage. The present study is the first trial on a German language IHCA on type 2 diabetes.</p><p>There are some limitations to the work presented. The most obvious limitation is that only people with Internet access can be included in the study. 73% of the German general population use the Internet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], but of the population over 50 years of age, 47% are online. Since the prevalence of type 2 diabetes increases strongly with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] we run the risk of excluding a part of our target group. This is a limitation both with respect to implementation and reach, and as a source of selection bias.</p><p>There are some disadvantages of online questionnaires, namely the relatively high nonresponse rates and concerns regarding data quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. With regard to the quality of the data obtained online, there are indications that the psychometric properties are equivalent with data obtained from paper pencil questionnaires or even better [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Quality can be improved by validation checks that alert participants when their answers are implausible or items are skipped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Furthermore, online assessments seem to be less prone to social desirability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. With respect to non-responders we try to reduce attrition by keeping the questionnaires as short as possible, making the intervention itself attractive, and offering an incentive for answering all questionnaires. Another limitation concerning our measurements is that only some of them are standardized (DCS, PDMS, BIT) while others are adapted (attitudes toward self-care) or developed (diabetes knowledge) for our purposes. None of the measurements have been adapted for online use which puts their comparability to results obtained from paper pencil tests into question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>SDM: Shared decision-making; IHCA: Interactive Health Communication Application; RCT: Randomized controlled trial; PDMS: Preparation for Decision Making Scale; DCS: Decisional Conflict Scale; HeiQ: Health Education Impact Questionnaire; ADA: American Diabetes Association; oGTT: Oral Glucose Tolerance Test; ANCOVA: Analysis of covariance.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>NW participated in the conception and design of the study and drafted the manuscript.
