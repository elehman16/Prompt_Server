Heterologous prime-boost with the viral vectors simian adenovirus 63 (ChAd63)-modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is the most potent inducer of T-cells in humans, demonstrating significant efficacy when expressing the preerythrocytic antigen insert multiple epitope&#x02013;thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (ME-TRAP).

In quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses, ChAd63-MVA CS was estimated to reduce the liver parasite burden by 69%&#x02013;79%, compared with 79%&#x02013;84% for ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP.</p><p><bold><italic>Conclusions.</italic></bold>&#x02003;ChAd63-MVA CS does reduce the liver parasite burden, but ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP remains the most promising antigenic insert for a vectored liver-stage vaccine.

The preerythrocytic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> vaccine RTS,S, formed from fusion of the circumsporozoite protein (CS) to the surface-antigen of hepatitis B virus, is the most advanced malaria vaccine in development. However, it confers only limited, relatively short-lived protection in African infants [<xref rid="JIU579C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIU579C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Analysis of the immunological correlates of immunity induced by RTS,S suggests that high levels of antibodies against CS on the sporozoite correlate with protection, with a possible minor contribution from low levels of induced CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="JIU579C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIU579C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. While these clinical results are the most effective to date in a field setting, there remains a need to improve on this limited clinical efficacy [<xref rid="JIU579C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="JIU579C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], either through modifications to RTS,S or by developing vaccine strategies that combine numerous antigens or vaccine platforms.</p><p>Increasingly, data from animal models and vectored immunizations demonstrate a correlation between CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and immunity to liver-stage parasites, even in the absence of antibodies [<xref rid="JIU579C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIU579C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Clinical vaccine development had been hampered by the limited ability of traditional subunit vaccine strategies, namely adjuvanted protein constructs, to induce high enough numbers of antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that may confer protection [<xref rid="JIU579C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, more recently, adenoviral-vectored malaria vaccines administered in heterologous prime-boost regimens with a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) boost have been capable of inducing good humoral and T-cell responses that include high levels of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="JIU579C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIU579C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses have been associated with clinical efficacy [<xref rid="JIU579C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Given concerns regarding the effect of preexisting immunity on the immunological potency of human adenoviruses, simian adenoviruses (ChAd) are being developed as alternative, potent vectors [<xref rid="JIU579C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Indeed, prime-boost vaccination with ChAd63 and MVA expressing the leading preerythrocytic antigen, ME-TRAP, is clinically the most potent inducer of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in humans and the most effective malaria vaccine besides RTS,S, demonstrating efficacy, defined as sterile protection or delay, in 8 of 14 malaria-naive volunteers (57%) following sporozoite challenge [<xref rid="JIU579C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Given that CS is expressed during both the sporozoite and liver stages of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection and therefore is possibly susceptible to both humoral and cell-mediated immunity at both stages, we assess here the efficacy of ChAd63-MVA expressing CS. If effective, this vaccine could then be combined with ChAd63-MVA expressing ME-TRAP or RTS,S, to improve clinical efficacy. Following a phase 1a study of ChAd63-MVA CS in malaria-naive volunteers, in which the regimen was shown to be safe and immunogenic (de Barra et al, submitted), we performed a study of controlled human infection with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoites (also known as &#x0201c;controlled human malaria infection&#x0201d; [CHMI]) [<xref rid="JIU579C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], using the standard challenge model involving infectious bites from 5 mosquitoes, to compare the efficacy of ChAd63-MVA CS with that of ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>The study was conducted at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, University of Oxford (Oxford, United Kingdom), and at the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, part of the University of Southampton and University Hospital Southampton National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust (Southampton, United Kingdom). The challenge procedure was performed as previously described [<xref rid="JIU579C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], using 5 infectious bites from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain 3D7&#x02013;infected <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> mosquitoes. This took place at the Alexander Fleming Building, Imperial College (London, United Kingdom), and mosquitoes were supplied by the Department of Entomology, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR; Washington, DC). Healthy, malaria-naive men and non-pregnant women aged 18&#x02013;45 years were invited to participate in the study. All volunteers gave written informed consent prior to participation, and the study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with good clinical practice. There was no selection of volunteers on the basis of preexisting neutralizing antibodies to the ChAd63 vector before enrollment.

The study was additionally reviewed by the Western Institution Review Board (Seattle, WA; reference 20120266) at the request of the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative and was approved. The Genetically Modified Organisms Safety Committee of the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust (reference GM462.11.65) authorized recombinant vaccine use. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (reference NCT01623557).

This efficacy is slightly less than that recently reported in another CHMI study of ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP [<xref rid="JIU579C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], despite the induction of similar, very high frequency of antigen-specific T cells (peak median IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;secreting T cell count, 2027 in this study vs 2436 SFCs/million PBMCs in the previous study). Because the median time to diagnosis for unvaccinated control volunteers in this study was 1.5 days shorter than that of the previously reported CHMI study [<xref rid="JIU579C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], it is possible that a larger challenge inoculum in this CHMI study could explain the small, suggested difference in efficacy results (there were no other differences in study methods). By the same reasoning, this could mean that the efficacy attained with ChAd63-MVA CS (sterile protection was achieved in 7% [1 of 15], and a delayed time to diagnosis was achieved by 20% [3 of 15]) underestimates that which may have been seen under less stringent CHMI conditions. Indeed, given that the infectious dose experienced by individuals in malaria-endemic countries is generally considerably less than that administered in CHMI studies [<xref rid="JIU579C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], efficacy may prove to be greater in field studies.</p><p>ChAd63-MVA CS induced moderate to high IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;expressing T-cell responses, but anti-CS IgG levels were markedly lower than that seen with in a sporozoite CHMI trial assessing RTS,S, in which 50% of vaccinees (18 of 36) receiving RTS,S/AS01B and 32% (14 of 44) receiving RTS,S/AS02A achieved sterile protection (2.1 &#x000b5;g/mL with ChAd63 MVA CS vs 144 mg/mL with RTS,S/AS01B and 83 mg/mL with RTS,S/AS02A) [<xref rid="JIU579C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The correlation between anti-CS antibodies and time to treatment suggests this may, surprisingly, be contributing to the mechanism of efficacy even at very low levels. This study provides the first evidence that sterile immunity can be generated with viral vectors encoding CS alone [<xref rid="JIU579C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], although it is notable that some sterile efficacy has been reported using combinations of DNA and adenoviral vectors encoding CS and AMA1 [<xref rid="JIU579C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis of time to diagnosis between vaccinees and unvaccinated controls and numerous analyses of the qPCR data demonstrated significant efficacy for ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP alone. There was no such statistically significant difference for the ChAd63-MVA CS vaccines using the same analysis. However, the AUC analysis, comparison of parasitemia at 7.5 days after CHMI, the evidence of sterile protection, and a delay to diagnosis in certain vaccinees all support the view that ChAd63-MVA CS led to a reduction (by approximately 69%&#x02013;79%, depending on the analysis) in the number of parasites released from the liver. Because ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP was, by use of the same measures, estimated to reduce the liver parasite burden by 79%&#x02013;84%, it appears that relatively large reductions in liver-stage infection are required to significantly influence clinical outcomes after mosquito bite CHMI, as suggested previously [<xref rid="JIU579C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="JIU579C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. As this study shows, it can be difficult to quantify the efficacy of preerythrocytic vaccines that do not provide sterile immunity. We would argue that, given the necessarily small numbers of participants in CHMI studies and the importance of CHMI studies to deselect novel vaccine strategies and antigens [<xref rid="JIU579C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], detailed analysis of qPCR data should be routinely performed to ensure that promising signals suggestive of clinically important efficacy are correctly identified.</p><p>Our data, importantly, compare the efficacy of ChAd63-MVA containing CS or ME-TRAP and, together with previous data comparing these antigens in DNA-MVA [<xref rid="JIU579C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and fowlpox-MVA regimes [<xref rid="JIU579C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="JIU579C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="JIU579C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], support ME-TRAP as currently the most promising liver-stage antigen for inclusion in a future multistage vaccine. However, given the efficacy we have demonstrated here and the possibility that immunization with ME-TRAP and CS could prove to be more efficacious than either antigen alone, our next priority is to clinically assess the combination of ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP and ChAd63-MVA CS in a CHMI trial.</p><p>We suggest that detailed analyses of parasite kinetics should be routinely performed in future CHMI vaccine studies to allow detection of smaller but biologically important differences in vaccine efficacy that could influence future vaccine development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiu579/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at <italic>The Journal of Infectious Diseases</italic> online (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org">http://jid.oxfordjournals.org</uri>).
