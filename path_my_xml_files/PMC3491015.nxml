Twenty active male subjects were randomly assigned to a 4-min exposure of WBC or CWI. A minimum of 7 days later subjects were exposed to the other treatment. Muscle temperature in the right vastus lateralis (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10); thigh skin (average, maximum and minimum) and rectal temperature (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10) were recorded before and 60 min after treatment. The greatest reduction (P&#x0003c;0.05) in muscle (mean &#x000b1; SD; 1 cm: WBC, 1.6&#x000b1;1.2&#x000b0;C; CWI, 2.0&#x000b1;1.0&#x000b0;C; 2 cm: WBC, 1.2&#x000b1;0.7&#x000b0;C; CWI, 1.7&#x000b1;0.9&#x000b0;C; 3 cm: WBC, 1.6&#x000b1;0.6&#x000b0;C; CWI, 1.7&#x000b1;0.5&#x000b0;C) and rectal temperature (WBC, 0.3&#x000b1;0.2&#x000b0;C; CWI, 0.4&#x000b1;0.2&#x000b0;C) were observed 60 min after treatment. The largest reductions in average (WBC, 12.1&#x000b1;1.0&#x000b0;C; CWI, 8.4&#x000b1;0.7&#x000b0;C), minimum (WBC, 13.2&#x000b1;1.4&#x000b0;C; CWI, 8.7&#x000b1;0.7&#x000b0;C) and maximum (WBC, 8.8&#x000b1;2.0&#x000b0;C; CWI, 7.2&#x000b1;1.9&#x000b0;C) skin temperature occurred immediately after both CWI and WBC (P&#x0003c;0.05). Skin temperature was significantly lower (P&#x0003c;0.05) immediately after WBC compared to CWI. The present study demonstrates that a single WBC exposure decreases muscle and core temperature to a similar level of those experienced after CWI. Although both treatments significantly reduced skin temperature, WBC elicited a greater decrease compared to CWI. These data may provide information to clinicians and researchers attempting to optimise WBC and CWI protocols in a clinical or sporting setting.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>These authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Whole body cryotherapy (WBC) is a treatment involving very short exposures to extreme cold, and is growing in popularity amongst athletes and coaches <xref rid="pone.0048190-Costello1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048190-Hausswirth1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048190-Pournot1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Most WBC protocols repeatedly expose minimally dressed individuals to extremely cold dry air (&#x02212;110&#x000b0;C to &#x02212;140&#x000b0;C) in an environmentally controlled room for a short duration of time (2&#x02013;4 min) <xref rid="pone.0048190-Banfi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although the use of cryotherapy or therapeutic tissue cooling is a common form of treatment dating back to ancient Greece <xref rid="pone.0048190-Enwemeka1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, WBC is a relatively novel modality of cryotherapy. The first WBC chamber was built in Japan in the late 1970s, but it was only introduced to Europe in 1982 and America in the last decade <xref rid="pone.0048190-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>A range of claims, based around these thermoregulatory responses, have been made about the benefits of WBC. Currently, the evidence base supporting these claims is extremely limited <xref rid="pone.0048190-Banfi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Studies examining WBC are traditionally limited, in terms of quality and statistical power, or published in non-English literature. Initial WBC studies have reported a reduction in creatine kinase activity after training <xref rid="pone.0048190-Banfi2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048190-Wozniak1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, total oxidative status in plasma <xref rid="pone.0048190-Lubkowska1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> as well as an increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 <xref rid="pone.0048190-Lubkowska2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and IL-6 <xref rid="pone.0048190-Lubkowska1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048190-Lubkowska2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Hausswirth and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0048190-Hausswirth1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> have recently reported that three WBC sessions accelerated recovery from exercise induced muscle damage (EIMD), but it has also been shown that WBC administered 24 h after eccentric exercise, is ineffective in alleviating muscle soreness or enhancing muscle force recovery <xref rid="pone.0048190-Costello1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Despite the increasing popularity and use of WBC in sports medicine, randomised controlled studies regarding its efficacy are sparse <xref rid="pone.0048190-Banfi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Presently, clinicians and sporting organizations are exposing individuals to these extreme temperatures based on anecdotal evidence and very little is known regarding its effectiveness or the physiological changes that occur during or after the treatment <xref rid="pone.0048190-Costello1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Similarly, despite its widespread adoption in an attempt to alleviate some of the physiologic and functional deficits associated with EIMD and to treat some clinical conditions, the use of cold water immersion (CWI) remains controversial owing in part to the lack of data regarding underlying mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0048190-Gregson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048190-Bleakley1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Although there is much confusion around how much cooling is clinically adequate the basic premise of cryotherapy is to cool injured or damaged tissue <xref rid="pone.0048190-Bleakley2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Previous research has demonstrated the mechanisms that underpin CWI such as reductions in blood flow and muscle, skin and core temperature <xref rid="pone.0048190-Gregson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> but currently there is a paucity of published research <xref rid="pone.0048190-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048190-Cholewka1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> addressing the thermodynamics of WBC. Furthermore, as thermal conductance in water can be as much as three times greater than in air <xref rid="pone.0048190-Westerlund1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, these cooling modalities (WBC and CWI) have a different thermal conduction property and therefore a different skin, muscle and core cooling potential.</p><p>In cryotherapy research there is perhaps no more relevant and divisive question than &#x02018;what is the optimal modality, temperature and duration required to elicit the required physiological response?&#x02019; For example, in order to reduce nerve conduction velocity, and consequently pain, the magnitude of tissue cooling following cryotherapy is critically important. Nerve conduction velocity has been shown to progressively reduce concomitantly with skin temperature <xref rid="pone.0048190-Algafly1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Similarly, a reduction of 5&#x02013;15&#x000b0;C in tissue temperature, with the critical level of skin temperature less than 12&#x000b0;C, is required to achieve an analgesic response <xref rid="pone.0048190-Bleakley2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Cooling has also been shown to decrease the dynamic contractile force by 4&#x02013;6% for each 1&#x000b0;C reduction in muscle temperature <xref rid="pone.0048190-Bergh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, alter EMG activity during submaximal leg extensions <xref rid="pone.0048190-Coulange1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and reduce power output in humans <xref rid="pone.0048190-Sargeant1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In addition, if administered incorrectly or for a prolonged period of time, clinicians and researchers need to be aware that cryotherapy can result in cold injury, with cases such as ice burn <xref rid="pone.0048190-Selfe1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and even amputation <xref rid="pone.0048190-Wilke1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> previously being reported within the literature, following crushed ice application and a continuous flow cryotherapy unit respectively. Consequently, despite the optimal tissue temperature following cryotherapy still to be established, it is pivotal that practitioners are familiarised with the thermodynamics of different cooling modalities.</p><p>The majority of claims regarding the effectiveness of WBC refer to the ability of the treatment to reduce muscle, skin and core temperature. These claims have yet to be substantiated. To our knowledge, no researchers have sought to simultaneously establish the effects of WBC on muscle, skin and core temperature and compare it to the more commonly used method of cryotherapy, CWI. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the effects of two modalities of cryotherapy (WBC and CWI) on muscle (vastus lateralis), skin and core (rectal) temperature after an identical duration of treatment. It was hypothesized that CWI would facilitate a greater reduction in all three temperature (muscle, skin and core) measurements, primarily due to the thermal conductivity of water compared to air.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>These experiments were conducted according to the Helsinki Declaration (1964: revised in 2001) and the protocol was approved by the local ethics committee (University of Limerick Research Ethics Committee, Limerick, Ireland.

Subjects were familiarized with the experimental procedures and associated risks, completed a medical questionnaire and gave their written informed consent prior to participation. Subjects were excluded if they had any contradiction to cryotherapy including Raynaud&#x02019;s disease. All subjects were required to refrain from smoking and consumption of alcohol and caffeine 12 hours prior to each laboratory session. In addition, subjects were tested at the same time of day for each trial (separated by 7&#x02013;10 days), and did not undertake exercise for 24 hours prior to each laboratory session.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Experimental Protocol</title><p>This study was a randomized controlled crossover design. The subjects were assigned, using a random numbers generator, to start with either the WBC or CWI. A minimum of seven days later the subject repeated the other treatment. We have previously described the methodology for the WBC exposure <xref rid="pone.0048190-Costello1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The WBC exposure was administered in a specially built, temperature-controlled unit (Zimmer Elektromedizin, Germany), which consists of two rooms (&#x02212;60 and &#x02212;110&#x000b0;C). The temperature of the therapy room remained at a constant level (&#x02212;110&#x000b1;3&#x000b0;C [mean &#x000b1; SD]), and the air in the room was dry and clear. Subjects entered and stood in the first room (&#x02212;60&#x000b1;3&#x000b0;C) for 20 sec before entering the second room (&#x02212;110&#x000b1;3&#x000b0;C) for 3 min and 40 sec. Subjects were instructed by the trained machine operator to walk slowly around the chamber and to flex and extend their elbow and fingers throughout the exposure. In the chamber, subjects wore shorts, two pairs of gloves and their nose and mouth were covered with a surgical mask; their ears were covered with a woollen headband and they wore their own dry shoes and socks. All jewellery, piercings, glasses and contact lenses were removed before entry to the chamber.</p><p>The temperature and duration of the CWI exposure was similar to other studies in the literature <xref rid="pone.0048190-Gregson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048190-Wilcock1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and a protocol similar to our previous work was employed <xref rid="pone.0048190-Costello2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Following the baseline recordings subjects, wearing only shorts, were seated in a tank filled with cold water (8&#x000b0;C &#x000b1;0.3&#x000b0;C) and immersed to the level of the sternum for 4 min. A duration of 4 min was chosen as it replicated the duration of WBC exposure. Immediately after CWI, subjects were asked to towel-dry their body, change into dry shorts and transfer to an adjacent laboratory for post tests. The temperature of the water was measured throughout using a digital aquarium thermometer. The ambient temperature of the laboratory during each testing session (WBC and CWI) was 22.0&#x000b1;0.5&#x000b0;C and subjects spent 20 min acclimatising to the room before the commencement of testing.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Muscle Temperature</title><p>The temperature of the vastus lateralis in the right limb was recorded manually on a Medical Precision Thermometer (DM852, Ellab A/S, Hvidovre, Denmark), with an accuracy of 0.1&#x000b0;C. A flexible intramuscular temperature probe (MAC flexible probe, Ellab, Denmark) was inserted through an indwelling flexible cannula (venflon 18GA Becton Dickinson, Sweden) into the muscle in the direction of the muscle fibres and advanced 0.5 cm beyond the end of the cannula into the muscle <xref rid="pone.0048190-Dewhurst1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Subjects thigh skinfold (Harpenden Skinfold Caliper Baty International, West Sussex, UK) was measured, prior to insertion, and the probe was inserted 3 cm below the subcutaneous fat layer (skinfold x 0.5) <xref rid="pone.0048190-Dykstra1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> by a trained physician. The location of the probe in the vastus lateralis was verified during pilot tests by the use of a GE Logiq e ultrasound scanner ultrasound (GE Medical, Wauwatosa, WI, USA). Muscle temperature data (3 cm subcutaneous) was recorded pre, post treatment and every 10 min thereafter. During data collection subjects remained in a semi reclined position for 60 min before after both treatments. Baseline data was recorded at the end of this 60 min period. A 60 min was chosen as pilot tests demonstrated this to be the maximum time a subject could comfortably sit in a semi reclined position with an indwelling muscle probe inserted in their thigh. Immediately before, and 60 min after the cryotherapy exposure, the probe was withdrawn incrementally to ascertain the muscle temperature at 2 cm and 1 cm respectively below the subcutaneous fat layer. Before each treatment the probe was removed and the injection site covered with waterproof dressing.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Skin Temperature</title><p>Skin temperature was assessed using a ThermoVision A40M Thermal Imaging camera (Flir Systems, Danderyd, Sweden) in accordance with the standard protocol of infrared imaging in medicine <xref rid="pone.0048190-Ring1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The camera, with the emissivity set at 0.97&#x02013;0.98, was connected to a personal computer (Portege A100, Toshiba, Japan) with appropriate software (Thermacam Researcher Pro 2.8, Flir systems, Danderyd, Sweden). The camera was mounted on a tripod and the distance between the camera and the subject ranged from 3.7&#x02013;4.2 m (depending on the height and the size of the individual). The validity and reliability of using noncontact, digital, infrared, thermal imaging (TI) cameras to measure skin surface temperature has previously been established <xref rid="pone.0048190-Selfe2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and we have recently reviewed the benefits of TI as a method of assessing skin temperature following cryotherapy <xref rid="pone.0048190-Costello3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. To create a quadrilateral region of interest (ROI) around the thigh area an inert marker was placed 5 cm above the most superior aspect of the patella <xref rid="pone.0048190-Costello3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This marker created the inferior horizontal line of the quadrilateral, while the apex of the groin created the superior line during post process analysis <xref rid="pone.0048190-Costello3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The minimum, maximum and average skin temperature within this ROI on the subjects&#x02019; right thigh was manually recorded pre, immediately post and 10 min thereafter for 60 min after both treatments. The subjects wore shorts, stood for the duration of the testing period and were asked to remain in the anatomical position while images were being recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Core Temperature</title><p>To record core temperature, a rectal probe (MRV Adult Rectal Probe, Ellab A/S, Hvidovre, Denmark) was inserted by the volunteers 10&#x02013;12 cm beyond the external anal sphincter. The thermistor was connected to a portable thermometer (DM852, Ellab A/S, Hvidovre, Denmark) and the rectal temperature was recorded manually using the same protocol as skin temperature.

We performed a priori analysis where the final baseline (&#x000b0;C) recording of muscle, skin (minimum, maximum and average) and core temperature was compared to that of the post treatment temperature at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min following both cryotherapy modalities. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA (treatment x time) was used to investigate changes in time with one between-subjects variable, treatment, with two levels (WBC and CWI) and one within-subject variable, time, with eight levels (baseline (recording immediately before treatment), 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min post) for muscle (3 cm subcutaneous), skin (minimum, maximum and average) and core temperature. In addition, to determine the relationship between treatment and muscle temperature depth, we ran a further repeated measures AVOVA (treatment x time x subcutaneous depth) with one between-subjects variable, treatment, with two levels (WBC and CWI) and two within-subject variable, time (pre, post) and subcutaneous depth (1, 2, 3 cm). The effect of time, treatment, and treatment by time interactions were tested in all analysis. When the main effect was significant, a Bonferroni adjusted post-hoc test was used to investigate within-group differences. To examine if baseline data, before CWI and WBC, were similar for muscle, skin or core temperature, a paired sample t-test was employed. All variables were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. When the assumption of sphericity was violated, significance was adjusted using the Greenhouse-Geisser method. The current study had an 80% power to detect a difference of 1&#x000b0;C in muscle, 1&#x000b0;C in skin and 0.25&#x000b0;C in core temperature between conditions. Ratings of thermal comfort were analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A Friedman test was used to detect differences across time for the nonparametric data obtained from the Likert-type measurement scale for thermal sensation. A follow-up analysis using the Wilcoxon signed-rank procedure, with a Bonferroni correction, was used to examine differences between baseline and data obtained during each follow-up. All statistical analyses were performed in SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), version 19.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) with the level of significance set at P&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Muscle Temperature</title><p>Baseline temperature in the vastus lateralis muscle before CWI and WBC were similar (P&#x0003e;0.05 [paired sample t-test]) at a probe depth of 1 cm (WBC, 34.0&#x000b1;0.7; CWI, 33.8&#x000b1;1.2&#x000b0;C), 2 cm (WBC, 34.9&#x000b1;1.0&#x000b0;C; CWI, 35.1&#x000b1;0.8&#x000b0;C) and 3 cm (WBC, 35.7&#x000b1;0.7&#x000b0;C; CWI, 35.7&#x000b1;0.7&#x000b0;C).

This hypothesis has to be rejected as a similar reduction, in both deep and superficial muscle temperature, was observed in a population of healthy active males after both treatments. Significant differences compared to baseline were observed for both treatments at 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min post treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048190-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).

The duration of immersion employed (6 min longer than the current study) and the fact that the legs were not dried in the study by Gregson <xref rid="pone.0048190-Gregson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> may explain this discrepancy. The reductions in muscle temperature observed after a 4 min exposure to WBC and CWI do not compare well to that of other cryotherapy modalities.

However, as the temperature at a depth of 3 cm was recorded continuously in the current study, muscle temperature at a depth of 1 and 2 cm subcutaneous was only recorded 60 min after treatment (when the probe was removed incrementally). It is likely that the more superficial muscle temperature, especially 1 cm subcutaneous, had a similar temperature decline and recovery to that of the skin temperate. This may be attributed to a progressive reversal of the temperature gradients of the superficial and deep tissues, with the deeper tissues losing heat (cooling) simultaneously as the superficial tissues were rewarming to attain their initial baseline temperatures <xref rid="pone.0048190-Enwemeka1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Although significant reductions in tissue temperature are believed to be required to reduce inflammation <xref rid="pone.0048190-Bleakley3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and create and analgesic response <xref rid="pone.0048190-Costello3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, it should be noted that reductions in tissue temperature may be delirious to functional performance <xref rid="pone.0048190-Bleakley3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and proprioceptive acuity <xref rid="pone.0048190-Costello1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048190-Costello2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048190-Costello4" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.

Despite the similar reductions in skin temperature after both treatment modalities, we observed evidence of a greater reduction in thigh temperature immediately after WBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048190-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). However, both modalities display different recovery patterns and average skin temperature after CWI was significantly lower than WBC at 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min after treatment. In order to record accurate TI data, moisture from the CWI would affect the analysis of skin temperature, the subjects in the current study were asked to towel dry after immersion and this friction may have helped to slightly increase skin temperature. As towel drying is an artefact of CWI, we considered this an integral component of the treatment.</p><p>The present findings of a skin temperature reduction of 12.1&#x000b1;1.0&#x000b0;C in the thigh immediately after WBC exposure is similar to that reported elsewhere after WBC <xref rid="pone.0048190-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048190-Cholewka1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Furthermore, using a similar CWI protocol Gregson and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0048190-Gregson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> have also reported a comparable reduction of &#x0223c;10&#x000b0;C (8.4&#x000b1;0.7&#x000b0;C in the current study) in thigh skin temperature after a 5 min treatment. Although a skin temperature reduction of &#x0223c;2&#x000b0;C less than these results were found after CWI in the current study it is possible that the extra min of immersion employed by Gregson <xref rid="pone.0048190-Gregson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> explains the slight discrepancy. Similar to muscle temperature, these findings do not compare favourably to other modalities of locally applied cryotherapy such as ice bag or wet ice application. Other investigators have reported skin temperature reductions of between 21&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C following the local application of various types of cryotherapy for 20&#x02013;30 min <xref rid="pone.0048190-Merrick1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Based on the information reported by Bleakley and Hopkins <xref rid="pone.0048190-Bleakley2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> it can be deduced that, although a skin temperature reduction of within the 5&#x02013;15&#x000b0;C range was reached after both CWI and WBC in the thigh, analgesia was not achieved as the skin temperature remained above the critical 12&#x000b0;C mark. Similarly, as a skin temperature of 12.5&#x02013;13.5&#x000b0;C is required to observe a 10% decrease in nerve conduction velocity <xref rid="pone.0048190-McMeeken1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, although not measured as part of the current methodology, it can be assumed that a reduction in nerve conduction velocity of less than 10% would have been observed following both treatments. Although skin temperature following WBC has previously been reported, to our knowledge, this is the first study that aimed to compare and contrast skin temperature reduction, and indeed recovery, following WBC and CWI in a randomised crossover design. Consequently, these findings may be useful to clinicians, physiotherapists, athletic trainers and other researchers, who intend to utilise cryotherapy to reduce skin temperature to a safe degree.</p><p>A reduction in rectal temperature was observed 40, 50 and 60 min after both treatments compared to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048190-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), but no significance was observed between treatments. Our results are similar to the reductions reported by others after CWI&#x02019;s <xref rid="pone.0048190-Gregson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, but data on the effects of WBC on core temperature are scant. Although, we have previously shown that WBC reduces tympanic temperature by 0.3&#x000b0;C <xref rid="pone.0048190-Costello1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, it has previously been reported that WBC exposure does not cause a change in rectal temperature in an older population (48&#x000b1;7.9 years) <xref rid="pone.0048190-Cholewka1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, Westerlund and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0048190-Cholewka1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> utilised an exposure duration of 2 min shorter than the current study and only recorded data for 30 min after exposure despite a steady decline similar to the current study.</p><p>The thermodynamics of cryotherapy, or cooling, works on the principle that heat is transferred unidirectional from high heat to low heat <xref rid="pone.0048190-Westerlund1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and tissue temperature loses heat to the external cooling modality. Our results fit well with this concept as we see muscle temperature fall and the skin temperature increase after treatment. This transfer of heat from one body to another depends on several factors including the relative masses of the bodies, the size of the contact area, the difference in starting temperatures, the heat capacity of each material and the re-warming of the tissue from its own metabolic activity and perfusion <xref rid="pone.0048190-Merrick1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Considering the methodology of the two cooling modalities employed in the current study (WBC and CWI) the duration was the same (4 min), the masses of the bodies were the same during both treatments (randomized crossover), the contact area was similar (whole body versus heat out immersion) and the baseline temperature of the skin was similar. The major discrepancies between the modalities in the current study were the temperature difference of the two treatments (&#x0223c;118&#x000b0;C), the hydrostatic pressure of water and the difference in the ability of air and water to conduct heat.</p><p>The temperature of the muscle, skin and core did not return to baseline levels 60 min following treatment and this agrees with the finding of others <xref rid="pone.0048190-Costello3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Furthermore, rectal temperature continued to decline up to 60 min after treatment. It has previously been reported that it may take as long as 4 hours for tissue temperature to return to baseline following cooling and both Merrick et al. <xref rid="pone.0048190-Merrick1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and Enwemeka et al. <xref rid="pone.0048190-Enwemeka1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> have highlighted the need for continued monitoring of tissue temperature following the removal of the cooling agent. Therefore, an extended period of temperature recording (60 min after both treatments) was utilised in the current study. The results of this study are limited to a homogenous group of active healthy male subjects, between the ages of 18 to 35, as the depth of subcutaneous fat is a significant factor in the magnitude and rate of intramuscular cooling. The insulation effects of adipose tissue during cryotherapy treatment and re-warming after treatment has previously been established <xref rid="pone.0048190-Myrer3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The mid-thigh skinfold thickness of this group was 10.5&#x000b1;5.9 mm and these results are similar to that of other studies using physically active male volunteers <xref rid="pone.0048190-Thornley1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Future research studying the effects of WBC is therefore warranted on females, who tend to have a different percentage and distribution of body fat.</p><p>One limitation of the present study was that methodological constraints did not allow the assessment of muscle, skin and rectal temperature on the same subjects at the same time. However, we used a homogeneous population and the treatment protocols conditions remained constant throughout. As the equipment used in the current study was not functional in temperatures below &#x02212;100&#x000b0;C, skin and rectal temperatures were not recorded during WBC or CWI. Furthermore, in an attempt to reduce the risk of infection, muscle temperature was not recorded during the treatments. As superficial muscle temperature was only recorded 60 min after treatment it is possible that larger reductions in the more superficial muscle temperature occurred before this time and future research is required to clarify this. Finally, we only assessed muscle, skin and core temperature after one treatment of CWI and WBC. As both these treatments, especially WBC, are often repeated several times on the one day future research is required to assess the dose response of both treatment.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study demonstrates that a single WBC exposure (&#x02212;110&#x000b0;C for 4 min) decreases muscle and core temperature to a similar level of those experienced after CWI (8&#x000b0;C for 4 min). Although both treatments significantly reduced skin temperature from baseline, WBC elicited a greater decrease compared to CWI. It is likely that a temperature deficit of 118&#x000b0;C experienced during WBC exposure compensated for the reduced thermal conductivity of air compared to water. These data may provide information to clinicians and researchers alike who utilise WBC and CWI protocols in a clinical or sporting setting. As such, further investigation is warranted to explore the effects of a reduction in tissue temperature following WBC and CWI in athletic recovery and acute injury.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Ciar&#x000e1;n McInerney, Gr&#x000e1;inne Hayes and Neasa Canavan for their assistance during data collection.
