include all children regardless of state of health. Here, we assess whether
mass distribution of a broad-spectrum antibiotic to pre-school children
reduces mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods.</title><p>MORDOR was a large simple trial that randomized communities in Malawi, Niger,
and Tanzania to 4 biannual mass distributions of either oral azithromycin or
placebo. Children aged 1-59 months were enumerated and offered treatment.
Vital status was assessed at the subsequent biannual census. The primary
outcome was aggregate all-cause mortality, with country-specific rates as
pre-specified subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results.</title><p>In total, 1533 communities were randomized, 190,238 children censused at
baseline, and 323,302 person-years monitored. Mean antibiotic coverage over
the 4 biannual distributions was 90.4% (SD 10.4%) of the censused
population. The overall annual mortality rate in placebo- treated
communities was 16.5 per 1000 person-years (9.6 per 1000 person-years in
Malawi, 27.5 in Niger, and 5.5 in Tanzania). Antibiotic-treated communities
had an estimated 13.5% lower mortality overall (95% CI 6.7%&#x02014;19.8%,
<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Mortality was 5.7% lower in Malawi (CI -
9.7%&#x02014;18.9%, <italic>P</italic>=0.45), 18.1% lower in Niger (CI 10.0%&#x02014;25.5%,
<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), and 3.4% lower in Tanzania (CI
-21.2%&#x02014;23.0%, <italic>P</italic>=0.77). The greatest reduction was observed
in 1-5 month-old children (24.9% lower, CI 10.6%&#x02014;37.0%,
<italic>P</italic>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions.</title><p>Mass azithromycin distribution to post-neonatal, pre-school children may
reduce childhood mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in high
mortality areas such as Niger. Any implementation would need to consider
selection for antibiotic resistance.</p></sec></abstract><counts><count count-type="abstract" count="247"/><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="1"/><ref-count count="37"/><word-count count="2693"/></counts></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Supplementary Material Appendix (Mordor Study Group and 8 Tables), MOP,

can reduce mortality in children aged 1-59 months. The study was performed in 3
geographically distinct areas: Malawi in Southern Africa, Niger in West Africa, and
Tanzania in East Africa. Azithromycin affects transmissible diseases, so treating
one individual might influence others in the same community. Thus randomization and
intervention were at the community level, and inferences of efficacy were made at
the community level. As mortality is a relatively rare event even in these settings,
a large study population was required. Hence we adopted a large simple trial
paradigm with a straightforward intervention and primary outcome.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Eligibility</title><p>MORDOR (<italic>Macrolides Oraux pour R&#x000e9;duire les D&#x000e9;c&#x000e8;s avec un Oeil sur la
R&#x000e9;sistance</italic>) was a community-randomized trial conducted in the
Malawian district of Mangochi, the Nigerien districts of Boboye and Loga, and
the Tanzanian districts of Kilosa and Gairo. The randomization unit was a health
surveillance assistant area in Malawi, a <italic>grappe</italic> in Niger, and a
hamlet in Tanzania. Communities with a population between 200 and 2000
inhabitants on the most recent census were eligible for enrollment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Appendix</xref>).
Enrollment was based on census information available prior to the study.
Communities remained in the study even if the population drifted out of this
range. All children aged 1-59 months (truncated to month) weighing at least
3,800 grams were eligible for treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and masking</title><p>Lists of communities from the most recent pre-trial census were submitted to the
UCSF data coordinating center. For each country, communities were randomly
assigned in equal proportions to 1 of 10 letters, with 5 letters coded for
azithromycin and 5 for placebo (Statistical Analysis Plan, SAP). Randomization
was generated in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)
using the <italic>sample</italic> command (TCP), with knowledge of the link
between treatment letter and arm assignment limited (TCP, KJR, and personnel
necessary for labeling and packaging). Centralized randomization and
simultaneous assignment of communities facilitated complete allocation
concealment. Participants, observers, investigators, and data-cleaning team
members were masked to treatment arm. The placebo contained the vehicle of the
oral azithromycin suspension and was identical in appearance with identical
bottles and labels.</p></sec><sec><title>Census</title><p>A house-to-house census was performed during 5 prescribed 6-month periods,
allowing a 2-month grace period for the initial census. At the initial census,
all households in the community were entered into a custom-built mobile
application (Conexus Inc., Los Gatos, CA), with the head of household name and
GPS coordinates used to facilitate locating the household at the subsequent
census. All children in the household aged 1-59 months were enumerated. Pregnant
women and children under 1 month were also documented in anticipation of the
following census. At follow-up censuses, the vital status (alive, dead, or
unknown) and residence (living in community, moved outside community, or
unknown) were recorded for children present in census records. New 0-59
month-old children and pregnant women were also entered. Communities were
censused in the same general order throughout the study. Data were uploaded to
the Salesforce Cloud Database Service (Salesforce.com, San Francisco, CA). Data
cleaning was performed using Salesforce.com, Stata (Statacorp, College Station,
TX), and R. </p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Each child aged 1-59 months at the census was offered a single, directly observed
dose of oral azithromycin or placebo (both provided by Pfizer, Inc., New York,
NY). A volume of suspension corresponding to at least 20 mg/kg was given by
height-stick approximation according to the country&#x02019;s trachoma program
guidelines, or by weight for those unable to stand. Children known to be
allergic to macrolides were not treated. Treatments were administered at the
census and during additional visits in an attempt to achieve at least 80%
coverage. Administration of study medication was documented for each child in
the mobile application, and community coverage was calculated relative to the
census. Guardians were instructed to contact a village representative for any
adverse events noted after taking the study medication. This individual reported
to the site study coordinator, who in turn reported to the Data Coordinating
Center at UCSF. </p></sec><sec><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The pre-specified primary outcome was the community-level, aggregate, 3- country
mortality rate determined by biannual census. Each inter-census period was
treated separately, with a mortality event counted only when a child was
recorded as being alive and living in the household at the initial census, and
recorded as having died while residing in the community at the subsequent
census. By design, no attempt was made to track down a child&#x02019;s status after
movement outside the community. Person-time at risk was calculated as days
between consecutive censuses, with children who moved, died, or had an unknown
follow-up status contributing one half the inter-census period. All children
documented as alive and living in the household at the initial census of each
inter-census period were included in the analysis. No changes to trial outcomes
were made after the trial had commenced.</p></sec><sec><title>Subgroup analyses</title><p>Mortality rates were assessed by country site and age group. An abbreviated
version of the 2007 World Health Organization verbal autopsy questionnaire for
children aged 4 weeks to 14 years was used to collect data for verbal
autopsies.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Causes of death were
assigned using an algorithm based on a published verbal autopsy hierarchy.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Sample size and statistical analysis plan</title><p>We estimated that inclusion of 620 communities per country would provide at least
80% power to detect an overall reduction in all-cause mortality of 10%.
Specifically, we assumed mortality rates of between 14 and 20 per 1000
child-years, average community sizes of 600 to 799 people (16.7% to 19.0% of
which were children aged 1- 59 months), coefficients of variation of between
0.40 and 0.51, and loss to follow-up of 10% (SAP).</p><p>The pre-specified primary analysis was negative binomial regression of the number
of deaths per community, with treatment arm and country as predictors and total
person-time at risk as an offset. All 3 country sites contributed to the primary
outcome. Hypothesis testing was 2-sided, allowing a total alpha of 0.05 for the
interim and final analyses. A <italic>P</italic>-value was determined by Monte
Carlo permutation testing (10,000 replications). An interim efficacy analysis
after the 12- month census was designed to spend 0.001 of the total alpha,
reserving an alpha of 0.049 for the primary 24-month analysis. Community-level
clustering was taken into account by the dispersion parameter in the negative
binomial regression. Pre-specified subgroup analyses included negative binomial
regression of community-level mortality rates by country, age group, and
inter-census period (SAP). A sample of 250 verbal autopsies from each site were
compared using the chi-squared statistic, with clustering taken into account by
permutation at the community level. All statistical analyses were conducted in
R. </p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>Approval for the study was obtained from the ethical committees of the College of
Medicine, University of Malawi, Blantyre, the Niger Ministry of Health, and the
Tanzanian National Institute for Medical Research, as well as London School of
Hygiene &#x00026; Tropical Medicine, UCSF Committee for Human Research, Emory
University, and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Informed consent
was obtained from the local Ministries of Health, village leaders, and guardians
of children. No incentives were offered for participation, although all children
in the Niger site were offered azithromycin at the conclusion of the study, and
those in Malawi entered into the country&#x02019;s trachoma program. The study was
undertaken in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee provided oversight. Members of the

life-threatening illnesses occurred: 1 from Malawi, 3 from Niger, and 16 from
Tanzania. 11 events were in the treated arm and 9 in the untreated arm. Medical
review was unable to declare that any serious adverse event was probably caused
by azithromycin. A random sample of 250 verbal autopsies from each of the 3
sites estimated that 41% of deaths were due to malaria, 18% diarrhea or
dysentery, and 12% pneumonia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Appendix</xref>). Cause of death was significantly different
between the country sites (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), with relatively more
deaths attributed to malaria in Niger and pneumonia in Tanzania.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Biannual distribution of oral azithromycin to post-neonatal preschool children
significantly reduced all-cause mortality by approximately 14%. A majority of the
deaths and of the observed effect was seen in Niger, which had an 18% reduction. In
subgroup analysis, only the Niger site revealed a statistically significant
reduction of mortality. The overall 14% effect is less than that seen in a previous
case-control study and community-randomized trial in Ethiopia, but is in line with
the 18% effect that a group of experts had anticipated when polled before the
study.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Azithromycin was most effective in children aged 1-5 months, preventing 1 in 4
deaths. The United States Food and Drug Administration has not approved azithromycin
for children in that age group, and the World Health Organization does not currently
recommend including them in trachoma distributions.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> However, the Centers for Disease Control does recommend oral
azithromycin for all ages for treatment and prophylaxis of pertussis.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Any mass distribution below 1 month of age
would need to consider the risk of inducing infantile hypertophic pyloric stenosis
(IHPS).<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>This study did not investigate the mechanism by which azithromycin reduced mortality.
Before the trial, experts thought a protective effect would most likely be due to
reductions in respiratory infections, diarrhea, and malaria, in that order.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Such a hypothesis seems reasonable, given
azithromycin&#x02019;s activity against bacterial pathogens of the lung and gastrointestinal
tract, and the plasmodial apicoplast. Further study will be necessary to identify
how azithromycin prevents mortality. Investigation is already underway. Smaller
parallel trials with detailed microbiological and anthropometric assessments were
conducted at each study site. Inference from these smaller trials will be directly
applicable to the mortality result, because they drew communities at random from the
same pool as the parent trial. Azithromycin has been linked to cardiac death in
adults, although results are mixed and may not be relevant to children in this
setting.<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This community-based trial, and even the more detailed
parallel studies, did not have the capacity to monitor QT intervals as would be
possible in a hospital-based setting.<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>Non-specific antibiotic use is discouraged due to concern over antibiotic resistance.

distributions could curb or even reverse any potential mortality benefit. We did not
observe such a waning effect&#x02014;in fact, the observed effect increased from 7% to 22%
over the 4 biannual inter-census periods. Nonetheless, longer follow-up is warranted
to determine whether the mortality effect observed in the present trial changes with
subsequent rounds of treatment.</p><p>The study had several limitations. As a large simple trial, little information was
collected on each child and community. Deaths were determined by consecutive
censuses. Children who were born and died between censuses did not contribute to
either death count or person-time at risk for the primary outcome. Secondary
analyses may reveal whether these children were better off being in a treated
community even if they themselves were not born in time for treatment. No effort was
made to follow children after they had moved. Death rates may have differed in
children who moved or had an unknown census status. As distributions were offered
only biannually, a child&#x02019;s first treatment might not be until 7 months of age.
Supplementary treatments given to infants during a scheduled vaccination visit to a
health clinic could potentially add benefit. While mortality is seasonal,
communities were treated in a rolling fashion over each 6-month time period for
logistical reasons. Secondary analyses may reveal whether the drug was particularly
effective in certain seasons. Lastly, the study was performed in 3 geographically
diverse sites in Africa, but the results may not be generalizable outside of these
districts. In fact, subgroup analyses only confirmed a statistically significant
reduction in 1 of the 3 sites.</p><p>Two doses of oral azithromycin per year significantly reduced childhood mortality
across 3 geographically diverse settings in sub-Saharan Africa. The largest effect
was found in Niger, which has one of the highest child mortality rates in the world.
Identifying specific mechanisms for mortality reduction will require further
investigation. Any policy recommending mass distribution of oral azithromycin for
childhood mortality would need to consider not only cost, but also the potential for
antibiotic resistance.<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Appendix</label><media xlink:href="NEJMoa1715474_Lietman_SupplementalAppendix.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e847" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Funding</title><p>The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation provided the funding for the trial (OP1032340).
