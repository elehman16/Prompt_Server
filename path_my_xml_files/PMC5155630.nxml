treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet the predictors to its response remains unclear. A
two-stage trial was designed to identify and verify the baseline symptomatic predictors of
this therapy. 167 patients with active RA were enrolled with a 24-week TwHF based therapy
treatment and the symptomatic predictors were identified in an open trial; then in a
randomized clinical trial (RCT) for verification, 218 RA patients were enrolled and
classified into predictor positive (P+) and predictor negative (P&#x02212;) group, and were randomly
assigned to accept the TwHF based therapy and Methotrexate and Sulfasalazine combination
therapy (M&#x00026;S) for 24 weeks, respectively. Five predictors were identified (diuresis,
excessive sweating, night sweats for positive; and yellow tongue-coating, thermalgia in the
joints for negative). In the RCT, The ACR 20 responses were 82.61% in TwHF/P+ group,
significantly higher than that in TwHF/P&#x02212; group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0001) and in M&#x00026;S/P+ group
(<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), but not higher than in M&#x00026;S/P&#x02212; group. Similar results were
yielded in ACR 50 yet not in ACR 70 response. No significant differences were detected in
safety profiles among groups. The identified predictors enable the TwHF based therapy more
efficiently in treating RA subpopulations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune inflammatory disorder of unknown
aetiology that occurs in about 1% of the adult population, which leads to disability and
premature death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The management of RA includes pharmacological,
non-pharmacological, invasive and surgical interventions that should be tailored to each
patient's disease manifestations, such as disease activity, current symptoms, laboratory
findings, and prognostic indicators. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are
recommended as the first-line treatment for RA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Immunoselective biologic
agents, such as TNF inhibitors, have been introduced for RA treatment as second-line
drugs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. However, no treatment cures RA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Due to the
insufficient response, adverse events, and high expense of the current pharmacological
therapies, new source of drugs in RA treatment is still warranted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p><p>Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) is regarded as a potential source of new drugs in RA
treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> for the TwHF based therapy has been proved to be able
to achieve better effectiveness than DMARDS monotherapy in controlling disease activity in
patients with active RA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. However, the lack of consensus on the
effectiveness and safety evaluation of TwHF products in treating RA has limited the new drug
development based on TwHF: systematic reviews presented an inconsistent or ambiguous
evaluation on the efficacy of TwHF products<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, some indicated TwHF
extracts could be as effective as synthetic DMARDs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>; others concluded
these products were not recommended for RA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p><p>One major cause for this inconsistency lies in that the optimal effect of TwHF based therapy
could be obtained if only the TwHF products being used to treat the right subgroup of patient
defined by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) pattern (syndrome or Zheng) classification, as
claimed by TCM clinicians<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. TCM identifies and treats the patients with
corresponding TCM patterns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, and baseline symptoms, which are the basis of
pattern differentiation, are regarded as important predictors of response.</p><p>Researchers are trying to establish various predictors of response to therapy in rheumatic
diseases, which may facilitate to improved patient selection and therapeutic outcomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, yet these predictors, including baseline characteristics, gene
polymorphism, proteins, microRNAs, or mixed model, etc. are seldom verified in a randomized,
controlled trial (RCT), although that is a must precedence to the clinical usage of these
findings. Before the solid biomarkers can be conveniently and affordably used in daily
clinical practice, baseline symptoms should be the most ideal predictors of response for its
convenience and facility of acquire and identification.</p><p>Actually, some baseline clinical factors have been detected to be able to predict better
outcome in treating rheumatic diseases with various drugs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.
Furthermore, in our previous multicenter RCT, some symptoms, including those inquired based on
TCM pattern classification theory were indicated to have potential correlation with the effect
and safety of TwHF based therapy in RA patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. These findings
merit further study to ascertain the accurate baseline symptomatic predictors of response to
the TwHF based therapy in light of TCM experiences thus to help clinicians to make
evidence-based decisions which might maximize the benefits from treatment by targeting
subgroups of patients most likely to respond.</p><p>Given these concerns, in this study we developed a rigorously designed two-stage clinical
trial aiming at proving the impact of the baseline symptomatic predictors of response to TwHF
based therapy in treating RA. The predictors was identified in the first stage open-labeled
trial and then verified in the second stage double-blind and double-dummy RCT. The
effectiveness and safety of this therapy in the subgroup of RA patients defined with this
predictors were also assessed compared to the control therapy, combinative methotrexate (MTX)
with sulfasalazine (SSZ) therapy.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Design Overview</title><p>The design of this two-stage trial in the management of RA was previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. The first stage trial was a 24-week open-labeled, multicenter trial and
aimed at identifying the baseline symptomatic predictors of the TwHF based intervention.
The second stage trail was designed as a randomized, double-blind, stratified,
double-dummy, positive controlled, multicenter study and aimed at verifying the prediction
of the identified symptomatic predictors as well as assessing the effectiveness and safety
of the TwHF based therapy in the subgroups of RA patients defined by the predictors.</p><p>The whole study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the
International Conference on Harmonization Tripartite Guideline on Good Clinical
Practice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Approvals from the appropriate research ethics committees
were obtained before the trials began: Ethics Committee of Institute of Basic Research in
Clinical Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (No. 2008NO3 for the
first-stage open trial; No.2010NO6 for the second-stage RCT). All patients were asked to
provide written, informed consent before participating. Trial registration no. was
ChiCTR-TRC-10000989.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Setting and Participants</title><p>In the open clinic trial, 167 patients were enrolled from March, 2008 to January, 2010.
In the RCT, 218 patients were enrolled from August, 2010 to June, 2012, from eight
authorized rheumatology departments in general hospitals in China (Beijing China-Japan
Hospital, The first affiliated hospital of Tianjin University of TCM, Hunan Xiangya
Hopital, Hubei Tongji Hospital, The first hospital affiliated to Jilin Changchun
University of TCM, The first hospital affiliated to Anhui University of TCM, The first
hospital affiliated to Jiangxi University of TCM, Affiliated Hospital to Shandong
University of TCM) and 2 rheumatology hospitals in China (Nantong Liangchun Rheumatology
Hospital, Shanxi Taiyuan Rheumatology Hospital).</p><p>The criteria for entry into the study were an age of 18 to 70 years; class I, II, or III
stage RA fulfilling the criteria of the American Rheumatism Association<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>;
and active disease (active RA was defined by the presence of three or more swollen joints,
six or more tender joints, morning stiffness that lasted at least 30 minutes, and at least
one of the following: an erythrocytese dimentation rate of at least 28 mm per hour, or an
elevated serum C-reactive protein concentration of at least 20% higher than normal value).
Patients were not eligible for the study if they had other important concurrent illnesses;
if they were allergic to any of the study drugs; if they received other commercial or
experimental biological therapies for RA, if they were women of childbearing age who were
not using contraception. DMARDs other than MTX and SSZ, including hydroxychloroquine,
cyclophosphamide, oral corticosteroids (&#x02264;10 mg prednisone or equivalent), were
discontinued at least four weeks before the study began. Stable doses of nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs were allowed.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Randomization and Interventions</title><p>An independent clinical research coordinator (CRC) performed the randomization with a
central randomization system designed by the Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing University of
Chinese Medicine (Version No. 115ZD_BJ_RA_LFG001). </p><p>The randomization number for each subject was produced by the randomization system
according to the patients' disease courses. Patients were stratified based on the disease
courses: within 1 years; from 1 to 3 years; longer than 3 years. Block randomization was
applied in each center (the block number was 144 and the block length was 6). First, the
randomization form with the basic information of the participant who passed the screening
phase was transmitted by the internet randomization system/telephone, then the system
would allocate the randomization number (specific ID number) based on the study design.
The completion of this procedure was guaranteed by the research organization. The CRC was
separated from all researchers, and the researchers didn't have any influence on
enrollment or randomization. Any contact between the statistician and clinical researchers
would not occur. The CRC also acted as the independent data and safety monitoring
board.</p><p>In the open trial, all the recruited patients received the TwHF based intervention: the
combination of Glucosidorum Tripterygll Totorum (GTT, Leigongteng Duogan tablets) and a
Chinese herbal product Yi Shen Juan Bi pill (YSJB). Both medicines are marketed as herbal
medications for RA patients, the combinative therapy is recommended by the Chinese
Association of Integrative Medicine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. GTT tablets (provided by Jiangsu
Meitong Co., Ltd. Z43020138) were prescribed at 10 mg 3 times a day after meals. YSJB
(patent number: ZL200510040550; prepared by Qingjiang Co., Ltd. Z10890004; the
fingerprints of YSJB is shown as Supplemetary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> to make sure
the consistency of the quality of the product) was prescribed at 8 g/each time and 3 times
a day after meals. Oral Votalin (Diclofenac) sustained release tablet (provided by Beijing
Novartis Pharma. Ltd. Drug registration Number: X0271) was permitted for the patients with
severe joint pain based on the doctor's judgment, and the dosage was 75 mg once a day. No
other drugs for treating RA were permitted.</p><p>In the RCT, 218 RA patients (recruited according to the inclusion criteria set for the
open trial) were enrolled. According to the symptomatic predictors identified in the open
trial (referring to results part), patients were classified into predictor positive group
(P+) and predictor negative group (P&#x02212;). Then the 2 groups of patients went on the
randomization allocation, respectively.</p><p>In both P+ and P&#x02212; group, patients were randomly assigned to two subgroups, one received
the TwHF based therapy as in the open trial and placebos of MTX plus SSZ therapy; the
other received MTX plus SSZ therapy and placebos of TwHF based therapy. The ratio of
randomization allocation to the sites was 1:1. MTX plus SSZ therapy included Methotrexate
(MTX, provided by Shanghai Xinyi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Drug registration Number:
Z070404), 10 mg/week and Sulfasalazine (SSZ, provided by Xi'an Kangbaier Pharmaceutical
Co., Ltd. Drug registration Number: Z070404), at an initial dose of 0.5 g 3 times a day in
the first week, from the second week the dose was 1.0 g twice a day. All placebos were
provided by the pharmaceutical factory which provided the associated drugs for ensuring
the identical appearance, taste and package.</p><p>The treatment course in both stages was 24 weeks. Study visits occurred at screening, at
baseline (day 1), at week 2, 4, and every 4 weeks through week 24 or withdrawal from the
study.</p><p>Use of oral Votalin and other drug, the treatment course and study visits were the same
as design in the open trial.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Outcomes and follow-up</title><p>In both stages of the trial, the primary effectiveness endpoint is the ACR 20 responsive
rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> at week 24, which was defined according to the ACR definition of a
20% improvement. Secondary effectiveness endpoints include the ACR50 and ACR70 responses
and the individual components of the ACR. Symptoms, joint function, physical exam,
laboratory tests, and patient-reported outcomes, including the scores of the Health
Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) were also noted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. All of these endpoints
over time in the study were analyzed as exploratory endpoints. Safety endpoints include
adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and laboratory abnormalities.</p><p>The symptoms and signs were evaluated by two independent assessors who had no knowledge
of the patient's treatment assignment. Given that in TCM practice, clinicians pay more
attention to symptoms and signs which are described in detail, the TCM symptoms are
included in this study, yet the ones easy to be confused are omitted, such as pulse
manifestation.</p><p>In TCM, the defining symptoms and signs of a patient are all those deviations in all
bodily functions and appearances from the norms of Chinese medicine as gathered by the
four examinations. The four examinations are looking, listening-smelling, palpating, and
questioning. Thus those symptoms and signs were obtained both from patient-reported
outcomes and physicians. They are terminologically standardized by China TCM academics who
published <italic>Traditional Chinese Medicine Dictionary (In Chinese, People's Health Press,
2005)</italic>, and also in <italic>the English-Chinese Chinese-English Dictionary of Chinese
Medicine (Hunan Science &#x00026; Technology Press, 1995)</italic> and <italic>WHO international
standard terminologies on traditional medicine in the western pacific region (World
Health Organization, 2007)</italic>. By referring to those term standards, we defined all the
symptoms and signs investigated in this study, which were shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>.</p><p>To make sure to get objective observation on those symptoms and signs, they were firstly
explained to patient by investigators to guarantee the patient can fully understand each
item, and then were recorded by clinicians who performed the inquiry and explanation using
a specific designed symptom questionnaire.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Sample size was calculated using PASS (version 11.0, NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, Utah, USA)
software. For open clinical trial: concerning the aim of the open trial, a logistic
regression of a binary response variable (Y) on a binary independent variable (X) was
adopted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. The sample size was of 149 observations (of which 50% are in
the group X = 0 and 50% are in the group X = 1) achieves 80% power at a 0.050 significance
level to detect a change in Prob (Y = 1) from the baseline value of 0.532 to 0.750.</p><p>Sample size calculation for RCT: the RCT was designed to detect differences of TwHF based
therapy in treating patients in the predictor positive group (P+) versus in predictor
negative group (P&#x02212;). Sample size was calculated to detect differences in the primary end
point with greater than 80% power at a 2-side level of significance of 0.05 between the
two groups. Given the two groups of patients are belonging to two separate subgroups, the
term for such a comparison is a test of interaction. Therefore, we designed a control
group using a standard combination therapy (MTX plus SSZ, M&#x00026;S). According to previous
studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and the first stage trial, the ACR 20 responsive rate is
supposed to be in this order: TwHF/P+ group &#x0003e; M&#x00026;S &#x0003e; TwHF/P&#x02212; group assuming the
effective rates of MTX plus SSZ are insusceptible with the indicators (similar effective
rate in P+ and P&#x02212; group). Thus the sample size calculation for RCT was calculated to
detect differences of TwHF based therapy versus M&#x00026;S in RA patients. The ACR20
responsive rate was set to be 58% of M&#x00026;S<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, and 87.7% of TwHF/P+ group
(based on the predictive results from the open trial data): P1 = 0.877 (TwHF based therapy
group proportion | H1), P2 = 0.58 (control group proportion). Thus it was estimated that
group sample sizes was 33 in each group. In the open trial, there were 57 out of 147
patients identified as in I+ group (38.5%), thus it was estimated in the RCT, at least
33/38.5% = 86 patients would need to be enrolled to assure 33 patients assigned in P+
group under each intervention. Given a dropout rate for follow-up as 20%, the sample size
should be 214 cases in total.</p><p>For predictor determination analysis, the correlation between ACR 20 response at 24 week
and baseline symptoms was analyzed by univariate analysis. The 30 TCM symptoms (including
tongue appearances) at baseline were screened using chi square test, the symptoms
significantly correlated with ACR20 response (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.2) were selected and entered
in a multivariate model. In the multivariate analysis, partial lease square (PLS) method
was employed to establish the predictive model for ACR 20 response by baseline symptoms,
ACR20 response was adopted as dependent variable, and TCM symptom was independent
variable, factor number was 2 in the model. The results were expressed as weight value,
the symptoms with highest weight absolute values were identified as the predictors.</p><p>For assessment, in the open clinical trial, patients were analyzed according to the
open-label study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>; in the RCT, all statistical tests were based on a
2-sided 5% level of significance using SAS software (version 9.3, SAS Institute, Cary,
North Carolina, USA).</p><p>In the baseline information analysis, for dichotomous variables, chi square test was
used; for ordered variables, Wilcoxon Rank test was used; for continuous variables,
analysis of variance and Wilcoxon Rank test were used.</p><p>Effectiveness was assessed in the patients with 100% drug compliance [Drug compliance is
defined as: (Distributive dosage of study drug &#x02013; retrieved dosage of study drug)/medical
ordered dosage of drug &#x000d7;100%]. For the primary effectiveness endpoint analysis, firstly
the ACR 20 responsive rate at week 24 was compared between TwHF based therapy and M&#x00026;S
in P+ and P&#x02212; group, respectively. For second effectiveness endpoint and safety analysis,
the comparisons of proportions (for dichotomous variables) between TwHF based therapy and
M&#x00026;S in the same subgroups were performed using chi square test. In respect to the
comparison of TwHF based therapy effectiveness between P+ and P&#x02212; groups, the method
introduced for comparing two estimates of the same quantity derived from separate
analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> were adopted.</p><p>Safety was assessed in patients who received one or more drug doses and had one or more
post baseline safety assessments. The frequencies of AEs were calculated, and the
incidences were compared by chi square test and exact probability methods.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Study Process</title><p>A total of 148 patients completed the 24 week treatment in the open trial; 192

function classification between TwHF/P&#x02212; and M&#x00026;S/P&#x02212; group in the RCT.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Clinical Effectiveness</title><p>In the open trial, 60.8% of patients achieved ACR20 response after 24 week treatment (95%
CI, 53.0% to 68.7%) among patients who completed the study. ACR50 and 70 responsive rates
were 43.1% (59 cases) and 24.1% (33 cases), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>,
upper part). The result was accessed as stable and credible comparing with the
corresponding ACR20 responsive rate at 53.2% in TwHF based therapy in the previous
randomized controlled study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.</p><p>Through univariate Chi Square analysis and multivariate analysis approaches PLS method
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table 1 and 2</xref>), diuresis, excessive sweating, and
night sweats were identified as the predictors which have positive correlation with
response; yellow tongue coating, and thermalgia in the joints were as the predictors
having inverse correlation with response. As described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary
table 2</xref>, the diuresis means long voidings of clear urine; excessive sweating is
described as excessive sweating during the daytime with no apparent cause such as physical
exertion, hot weather, thick clothing or medication; night sweats means sweating during
sleep that ceases on awakening; yellow tongue coating means there are a yellow colored
coating in tongue; and thermalgia in the joints means local with burning sensation in
joints.</p><p>In short, if a patient was presented with any one of diuresis, excessive sweating, and
night sweats; AND without yellow tongue coating and thermalgia in the joints, then the
patient was classified into the predictor positive group (P+); otherwise, the patient was
classified into the predictor negative group (P&#x02212;). Presumably, the ACR 20 responsive rate
in the P+ group of patients in the open trial would be predicted to be 87.7%, and in the
P&#x02212; group would be at 43.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, lower part).</p><p>In the RCT, after 24 week treatment, ACR 20 responsive rates in TwHF/P+ group, M&#x00026;S/P+
group, TwHF/P&#x02212; group, M&#x00026;S/P&#x02212; group were 82.6% (38 from 46 patients), 64.6% (31 from

1.2791 (95% CI: 0.9982&#x02013;1.639, P = 0.0492), which showed that, in the P+ group of patients,
the ACR 20 responsive rate of TwHF based therapy was greater than M&#x00026;S therapy; RRR
value (RR in P+ group/RR in P&#x02212; group) is 2.0563, and the 95% CI (1.4095&#x02013;3) indicated the
ACR 20 responsive rate of TwHF based therapy was better in P+ group than in P&#x02212; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Similar improvement in the ACR 50 response was observed, yet

therapy in treating RA patients. The results indicates a huge potential of the TwFH based
therapies in the value of treating the subpopulation of RA patients as an alternative
therapy. Furthermore, the predicting ability of symptoms combination of response to therapy
in RA was proved with RCT.</p><p>The first notable advantage of this study lies in the two-staged design, which, different
from the retrospective analysis and single clinical trial, paying fully attention to the
symptomatic predictors identification and verification in light of TCM experiences in two
steps under a reasonable logical framework, which has been ignored in many clinical
studies.</p><p>The process of comprehensive analysis of clinical information obtained by the TCM
diagnostic procedures including observation, listening, questioning, and pulse analyses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. These baseline symptoms and signs are used as predictors of intervention
selection, therapy outcomes and prognostic indicators in TCM for thousands of years, which
are composed of multiple symptoms across the whole body, for example, the color of tongue
coating, yet they are easy and intuitional to collect by inspection and inquiry, thus the
use of them is convenient and affordable.</p><p>In the real practice of TCM, the pattern could be defined by the TCM doctors who make
decision based on TCM pattern information; however the information might be slightly
diversified among different TCM doctors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, and also it would be hard to be
convincing for setting the information into the inclusion criteria in a RCT directly, which
is recommended to establish the efficacy of TCM treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. In order to
have convincing symptomatic predictor for a RCT based on TCM pattern classification,
two-stage clinical trial is proposed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, and the convincing symptomatic
predictors could be obtained in the first stage, open clinical trial.</p><p>Given there were as many as thirty symptom candidates, the determination of predictors was
the crucial step in the whole study. The predictor analysis was divided to two steps. In the
first step chi square test was used to screen the symptoms which was closely correlated with
clinical response preliminarily as in many similar studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Then
multivariate analysis procedure was utilized to narrow the number of predictors by obtaining
a weight score for each parameter candidate as there are multiple parameters in
analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. PLS method was employed as a variance based technique which
is less sensitive to multicollinearity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Most importantly, the final
identified predictors were also approved by TCM clinicians based on TCM theory and clinical
experiences, which ensured the fulfilling of the second stage trial.</p><p>Another strength of this study was the intervention selection for control group, the
combination of MTX plus SSZ was selected. Previous studies tended to use DMARD monotherapy
as the positive control drug, which can bring a higher possibility of positive outcomes, for
the effectiveness of DMARDs monotherapy is usually lower than combination therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Thus in the present trials, our results can ascertain the greater
effectiveness of TwHF based therapy with higher power and practicality. In the TwHF based
therapy, GTT, as one of the most frequently used TwHF products, has been extensively used in
China for RA treatment. GTT have been shown to inhibit production of proinflammatory
cytokines by monocytes and lymphocytes, as well as prostaglandin E2 production via the
cyclooxygenase, COX-2, pathway, a potential mechanism of action in patients with RA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. In an expert consensus study, GTT was recommended by 85.7% of the clinical
experts in China for the treatment of active RA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. YSJB pill is a potential
anti-rheumatic agent targeting the inflammatory and immunomodulatory response of
macrophages, it has been reported to be able to significantly decrease the production of
peritoneal macrophages derived TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1 and NO of serum, and decrease the TNF-alpha mRNA,
IL-1beta mRNA, and caspase-3 expression in synoviocytes in Freund's complete induced
adjuvant arthritis (AA) in rat model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. YSJB also has protective effect
on the TCM kidney deficiency pattern induced by androgen deficiency in CIA rats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Such characteristics of YSJB may be advantageous to the treatment of clinical
RA with TCM deficiency pattern. In our trial, TwHF product is used with combination of YSJB,
which is recommended as a therapy of RA in TCM clinical practice guideline for RA treatment.
Pharmacologically, both GTT and YSJB have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and immune
inhibitory effects for the treatment of RA animal models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, yet there
was no study concentrate on the synergetic effect of YSJB with TwHF.</p><p>According to the TCM clinical practice, the patients with RA can be classified into two
main patterns: the cold pattern and the hot pattern. The RA with cold pattern can be
described as severe pain in a joint or muscle that limits the range of comfortable movement
which does not move to other locations. The pain is relieved by applying warmth to the
affected area, but increases with exposure to cold. Loose stools are characteristic as well
as an absence of thirst and clear profuse urine. A thin white tongue coating is seen,
combined with a wiry and tight pulse. In contrast, the RA with heat pattern is characterized
by severe pain with hot, red, swollen and inflamed joints. Pain is generally relieved by
applying cold to the joints. Other symptoms include fever, thirst, a flushed face,
irritability, restlessness, constipation and deep-colored urine. The tongue may be red with
a yellow coating and the pulse may be rapid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p><p>The identified symptomatic predictors for the TwHF based therapy included three symptoms
with positive correlation (Diuresis, excessive sweating, night sweats) and two symptoms with
negative correlation to effectiveness (yellow tongue coating, and thermalgia in the joints).
The formers are frequently seen in the patients with TCM cold or deficiency pattern while
both the latter symptoms belong to TCM hot pattern according to TCM pattern classification
theory. Thus our results indicated the TwHF based therapy would have better effectiveness in
patients with cold/deficiency pattern rather than patients with hot pattern, which was in
accordance with traditional TCM cognition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p><p>Also interestingly, MTX plus SSZ therapy showed different effectiveness in different
subgroups of patients defined with the predictors. This finding indicates a possible
biological difference between the two subgroups of RA patients, although the underlying
mechanism still remains unclear. However, the TwHF based therapy showed a higher effective
rate in treating the RA patients who showed lower response to MTX plus SSZ combination
therapy. This finding might be valuable and inspiring for identifying the specific
responders for the therapy.</p><p>Actually, similar outcome (different effectiveness in different subgroups of MTX based
therapy in RA patients based on Chinese symptoms) was achieved and published in our previous
study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, the underlying mechanism was analyzed using bio-network based
approaches<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. To date, there has been several types of biomarkers being
used in clinical setting, including proteins, specific variations in the DNA sequence,
abnormal methylation patterns, aberrant transcripts, microRNAs, or other biological
molecules, such as lipids and metabolic products, these biomarkers are used to assess the
progress of some disease and treatment effect, or to estimate the risk of some disease such
as cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. However, all these biomarkers are targeting to some specific
disease, none of them can be used to elucidate the symptom or symptom combination. It has
been demonstrated that in the context of TCM theory, network biology based approaches can
prioritize disease-associated genes, predict the target profiles and pharmacological actions
of herbal compounds, interpret the combinational rules and network regulation effects of
herbal formulae<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>, thus the biomarkers for our symptomatic indicators
might be a network based profile instead of a single molecule. The identification of such a
network based profile will rely on a larger scale study, which is now developed underway as
further study of this two-staged trial.</p><p>There are still some limitations in this study. Firstly, only 24 week therapy was
conducted. Long-term data were not collected in the participants, and thus the differences
among groups on healing of bone erosions and protective efficacy couldn't be observed.
Secondly the symptomatic predictors based biomarkers are not yet identified because of its
complexity. Finally the washout period of DMARDs was ever questioned as not long enough, yet
after referring to some highly cited studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>, with a consideration for
guarantee of the patient compliance, a longer washout period was denied for it might result
in a higher difficulty in patient recruitment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The identified five symptomatic predictors enable the TwHF based therapy more efficiently
in treating RA subpopulations. TwHF based therapy can effectively and safely treat the
subgroup of active RA patient defined by the symptomatic predictors comparing with MTX plus
SSZ combination therapy. This may assist to guide clinicians in making treatment decisions
in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d32e23" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Supplementary Information</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep09700-s1.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Weiping Kong, Yuan Xu, Dongmei Gu, Xiaoxiang Mao, Qian Sun, Guimei Yu,
