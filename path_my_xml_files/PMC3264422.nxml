Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) is a systemic skeletal disease associated with high levels of RANKL, resulting in a high rate of bone remodeling and an imbalance of bone resorption over bone formation. By inhibiting RANKL in women with PMO, denosumab reduces the rate of bone remodeling, thereby increasing bone mineral density, improving bone strength, and reducing the risk of fractures. In clinical trials of women with osteoporosis and low bone mineral density, denosumab has been well tolerated, with overall rates of adverse events and serious adverse events in women treated with denosumab similar to those receiving placebo. In the largest clinical trial of denosumab for the treatment of women with PMO, there was a significantly greater incidence of cellulitis reported as a serious adverse event, with no difference in the overall incidence of cellulitis, and a significantly lower incidence of the serious adverse event of concussions with denosumab compared with placebo. The evidence supports a favorable balance of benefits versus risks of denosumab for the treatment of PMO. Assessments of the long-term safety of denosumab are ongoing. Denosumab 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 months is an approved treatment for women with PMO who are at high risk for fracture.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>denosumab</kwd><kwd>osteoporosis</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd><kwd>risk</kwd><kwd>benefit</kwd><kwd>FDA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and poor bone quality that reduces bone strength and increases the risk of fractures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dhps-3-079">1</xref> It is a major public health concern, with more than 200 million men and women reported to have osteoporosis worldwide,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dhps-3-079">2</xref> including about 75 million individuals in Europe, Japan, and the USA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-dhps-3-079">3</xref> Approximately one-third of postmenopausal women in Europe and the USA have osteoporosis, with about 40% of them expected to have at least one fragility fracture during their remaining lifetimes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-dhps-3-079">4</xref> Any fracture may be painful and disabling.

Additional information on denosumab safety was selected from abstracts and oral presentations at recent scientific congresses.</p></sec><sec><title>Bone remodeling</title><p>The pathophysiology of PMO and the mechanism of action of the drugs used to treat osteoporosis, including denosumab, involve alterations of bone remodeling. The adult skeleton undergoes a lifelong process of resorption and formation in numerous localized areas called &#x0201c;bone multicellular units&#x0201d; (BMUs), with each BMU having an estimated volume of about 0.025 mm<sup>3</sup> and a lifespan of about 6&#x02013;9 months, resulting in a turnover of approximately 10% of the entire skeleton each year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-dhps-3-079">19</xref> BMUs can be identified microscopically as tiny pits on the surface of trabecular bone (the type of bone in the interior of vertebral bodies and inside the ends of long bones) and tunnels (Haversian systems) in cortical bone, the exterior envelope around all bones. Bone remodeling may be &#x0201c;targeted&#x0201d; at repairing areas of microdamage that occur from normal physical activities as well as with severe repetitive microtrauma, or may be &#x0201c;nontargeted&#x0201d; when it occurs at apparently random locations on bone to maintain mineral homeostasis, keeping extracellular calcium levels within a very narrow range.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-dhps-3-079">20</xref> In healthy premenopausal women, there is a low rate of remodeling and an even balance between bone resorption and formation. With declining estrogen levels in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, the remodeling rate is accelerated and unbalanced, with bone resorption being greater than formation. As a consequence, there is a degradation of microarchitectural elements that may eventually result in measurable bone loss, increased skeletal fragility, and high fracture risk.</p><p>The cells involved in the highly coordinated process of bone remodeling are osteoclasts (bone resorbing cells), osteoblasts (bone forming cells), and osteocytes (mechanosensory cells). Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), a member of the tumor necrosis family of proteins that is expressed by cells of the osteoblast lineage, has been identified as the principal regulator of osteoclastic bone resorption.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-dhps-3-079">21</xref> When RANKL binds to its receptor, RANK, on the cell membrane of osteoclasts and preosteoclasts,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-dhps-3-079">22</xref> it stimulates their formation, activity, and survival, thereby increasing the rate of bone resorption.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-dhps-3-079">23</xref> Osteoprotegerin (OPG), also expressed by osteoblasts, is a counter-regulatory nonsignaling &#x0201c;decoy receptor&#x0201d; for RANKL. The binding of RANKL to OPG reduces the amount of RANKL available for binding to RANK, resulting in a decrease in osteoclast formation, activity, and survival. The balance between RANKL and OPG is thought to be a major determinant of the rate of bone resorption, with an abundance of RANKL favoring more bone resorption and, conversely, an abundance of OPG favoring less bone resorption. The decline of estrogen in postmenopausal women leads to an excess of RANKL over OPG<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-dhps-3-079">24</xref> and an increase in bone resorption. The discovery that high levels of RANKL were associated with increased bone resorption and bone loss suggested that inhibition of RANKL might be an effective treatment for osteoporosis and other skeletal diseases characterized by high bone turnover.</p></sec><sec><title>Early studies of RANKL inhibition</title><p>In vitro studies have shown that recombinant OPG inhibits osteoclast differentiation in a dose-dependent manner.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-dhps-3-079">25</xref> Recombinant OPG prevents bone loss in ovariectomized rats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-dhps-3-079">25</xref> and causes nonlethal osteopetrosis in normal mice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-dhps-3-079">25</xref> In young male rats, RANKL inhibition increases bone mineralization and improves mechanical strength in the femur.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-dhps-3-079">26</xref> These preclinical studies and others with similar findings paved the way for the study of RANKL inhibition in humans.</p><p>The first clinical trial of RANKL inhibition was a Phase I randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential dose-escalation study of OPG-Fc, a fusion molecule of recombinant OPG with the Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G, in 52 healthy postmenopausal women.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-dhps-3-079">27</xref> Administration of a single SC dose of OPG-Fc resulted in a rapid, reversible, and dose-dependent suppression of bone resorption, and was not associated with serious adverse events or identification of neutralizing antibodies. The results of this study led to further clinical investigation of RANKL inhibition with denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANKL that acts similarly to OPG-Fc, with the additional advantages of having greater antiresorptive potency, a longer duration of action, and avoidance of the potential risk of an OPG molecule generating anti-OPG antibodies that might crossreact with endogenous OPG.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of denosumab</title><p>Bone turnover markers (BTMs) such as N-telopeptide (NTX) and C-telopeptide, markers of bone resorption, and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), a marker of bone formation, have been used to assess the effect of denosumab on the rate of bone turnover. Changes in NTX and BSAP were measured in a Phase I randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-dose, dose-escalation study of SC denosumab (0.01 to 3.0 mg/kg) in 49 healthy postmenopausal women followed for up to 9 months. Treatment with denosumab was followed by a rapid (within 12 hours of dosing) dose-dependent decrease in urinary NTX, with a maximum decrease of 84% at 3 months and a rise in NTX levels at the end of the observational period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-dhps-3-079">28</xref> Decreases in BSAP occurred later and were less pronounced than NTX.</p><p>In the same study, the pharmacokinetics of denosumab was nonlinear with dose, as reported with other fully human monoclonal antibodies.

The reasons that clinical trials fail to identify all adverse drug effects include the relatively small number of subjects compared with the total number of patients eventually exposed to the drug, the homogeneity of the study population compared with patients in clinical practice, and the limited duration of observation during studies compared with a much longer time of treatment for many clinical practice patients. For these reasons, postmarketing surveillance for the safety of approved medications is appropriate and necessary.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety data</title><p>In the report of the Phase I study of denosumab in healthy postmenopausal women, there were no related serious adverse events and no discontinuations from the study due to adverse events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-dhps-3-079">28</xref> Mild transient dose-dependent decreases in albumin-adjusted serum calcium and corresponding increases in serum intact PTH levels were observed. Infectious adverse events were similar with the combined denosumab dosing groups (38%) and placebo (33%). Two subjects treated with denosumab had mild injection-site reactions. There were no changes in white blood cell counts, T-, B-, or NK-cell counts, immunoglobulins, or coagulation parameters associated with denosumab treatment.</p><p>Safety data for subjects in the Phase II study of denosumab in postmenopausal women with low BMD have been incrementally reported for time points beginning at 1 year and progressing most recently to 8 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-dhps-3-079">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-dhps-3-079">33</xref> At 4 years, all adverse events, including infections, and all serious adverse events, including malignancies, were similar in groups receiving denosumab, alendronate, and placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-dhps-3-079">31</xref> Most patients reported an adverse event at some stage during the 4 years, the most common events being an upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, and back pain. Infections requiring hospitalization were reported in 3.2% of subjects treated with denosumab and none of those receiving placebo or alendronate. The infections were typical community-acquired infections that responded appropriately to conventional antibiotic therapy. No opportunistic infections suggestive of impaired immune function were reported. Serum calcium levels remained stable and within the normal range with denosumab, with no patient having symptomatic hypocalcemia. No patient developed neutralizing antibodies to denosumab. Of the 262 subjects who completed the 4-year parent study, 200 enrolled in the 4-year single-arm study extension, with all receiving open-label SC denosumab 60 mg Q6M; 116 completed the extension and 80 of these received 8 years of continuous denosumab treatment.

There was no evidence of hypersensitivity or allergic drug reactions. Neutralizing antibodies to denosumab were not detected in any of the clinical trial subjects. The overall risk of infections, opportunistic infections, cardiovascular events, atrial fibrillation, stroke, cataracts, hypocalcemia, malignancies, and death was similar in subjects receiving denosumab or placebo. In pooled data from FREEDOM and other studies in women with PMO (n = 4050 for denosumab-treated subjects, n = 4041 for placebo-treated subjects), pancreatitis was reported in eight subjects on denosumab and four subjects on placebo; cataracts were reported for 232 subjects on denosumab and 253 subjects on placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-dhps-3-079">51</xref></p><p>In a prespecified analysis, complications in the healing of nonvertebral fractures were evaluated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78-dhps-3-079">78</xref> Complications associated with the fracture or its surgical repair occurred in 1.7% of denosumab subjects and 5.7% of placebo subjects (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). There were two reports of delayed union with denosumab and four with placebo, and one nonunion with placebo. There was no signal for impaired fracture healing with denosumab.

Skin infections were not related to the injection site or to the timing of the injection. Denosumab was well tolerated with no reported injection-site reactions. Local reactions after injection occurred in 0.8% of subjects in the denosumab group and 0.7% in the placebo group.</p><p>The quality of bone with denosumab treatment and the mechanism of action of denosumab have been evaluated in bone biopsy substudies of FREEDOM and STAND. Transiliac bone biopsies with a standardized double-tetracycline labeling procedure were obtained at 24 and/or 36 months in FREEDOM (47 women on denosumab, 46 on placebo) and at 12 months in STAND (15 women on denosumab after alendronate, 21 continuing alendronate).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63-dhps-3-079">63</xref> Qualitative bone histology was unremarkable in all women treated with denosumab, showing normal lamellar bone, normal mineralization, and the absence of marrow fibrosis. Data from FREEDOM biopsies at 24 and 36 months were not significantly different and were therefore combined to provide greater statistical power. In the FREEDOM substudy, double tetracycline labeling was observed in trabecular or cortical bone in all biopsies of subjects on placebo, while for subjects treated with denosumab, 40% had double label, 25% had single label only, and 36% had no label. There was no correlation between BTM levels and the presence or absence of labeling. Nine subjects in the substudy had fractures: six in the placebo group (all with double labels) and three in the denosumab group (one with single labels and two with no labels), with no reports of impaired fracture healing. Structural indices measured by histomorphometry and microcomputed tomography were consistent with reduced bone turnover in the denosumab group. Reduced cortical porosity and increased cortical volumetric BMD were observed in the denosumab group with microcomputed tomography at 24 months. In the STAND substudy, indices of bone turnover tended to be lower in the denosumab group than the alendronate group; double labeling was observed in trabecular or cortical bone in all biopsies of subjects in the alendronate group, while for subjects switched to denosumab, 60% had double label, 20% had single label only, and 20% had no label. These bone biopsy substudies confirmed that denosumab is a robust inhibitor of bone remodeling. The clinical relevance and long-term safety of such a low level of remodeling with a reduction or absence of detectable tetracycline labeling in a substantial number of subjects is unknown. Reversibility of the antiresorptive effects of denosumab has been demonstrated by changes in BTMs and BMD in subjects discontinuing denosumab in the Phase II study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-dhps-3-079">31</xref> Reversibility was confirmed in a bone biopsy study in 15 women who had been treated with denosumab and discontinued treatment an average of 2 years before a double tetracycline-labeled bone biopsy was done.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79-dhps-3-079">79</xref> These biopsies showed normal histology and bone remodeling similar to untreated women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.</p><p>A detailed analysis of adverse events and serious adverse events of specific types of infections reported in the 3-year FREEDOM dataset has recently been released.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80-dhps-3-079">80</xref> The incidence of serious adverse events of infections did not change with increasing duration of denosumab exposure. The incidence of serious adverse events of opportunistic infections was low and similar in both groups, with no temporal relationship between administration of drug and the onset of infection. Serious adverse events of skin infections in denosumab-treated subjects were mostly cellulitis and clinically diagnosed erysipelas in the lower extremities (unrelated to the injection site) that resolved with the use of common antibiotics. Preexisting risk factors of venous ulcers and skin wounds were reported in five of the twelve denosumab-treated subjects with these infections. There was no temporal relationship between administration of drug and the onset of skin infections. Serious adverse events of urinary tract infections were reported in 29 (0.7%) of denosumab-treated subjects and 20 (0.5%) of those receiving placebo; these were typically caused by <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> or other common Gram-negative bacteria. Endocarditis, without identification of a causative organism, was reported in three subjects in the denosumab group and none in the placebo group. Two of the subjects with reported endocarditis underwent echocardiography and were treated, while the third subject had suspected acute bacterial endocarditis associated with fatal multiorgan failure, but no further details were available and no autopsy was performed. Neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts were similar in both groups with no change in cell counts with increased duration of exposure to denosumab.</p><p>Of the 6468 women who completed the 3-year study, 4550 enrolled in the 7-year extension (total of 10 years) to receive open-label SC denosumab 60 mg Q6M. Preliminary data are available for the first 2 years of the extension, with 2343 women in the group with 5 years of continuous exposure to denosumab (&#x0201c;long-term group&#x0201d;) and 2207 in the group receiving placebo for 3 years followed by denosumab for 2 years (&#x0201c;cross-over group&#x0201d;).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81-dhps-3-079">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b82-dhps-3-079">82</xref> The yearly incidence rates for serious adverse events of infections, including cellulitis and erysipelas, and adverse events of malignancies for the long-term and cross-over groups in the first 2 years of the extension were similar to or lower than the observed yearly rates in the FREEDOM placebo group.

The focus on treating women &#x0201c;at high risk for fracture&#x0201d; is generally consistent with current clinical practice guidelines, although different definitions of &#x0201c;high risk&#x0201d; have been used. The National Osteoporosis Foundation in the USA, for example, considers a postmenopausal woman to be at sufficiently high risk for fracture to initiate pharmacological therapy, including denosumab, under any of the following conditions:<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b90-dhps-3-079">90</xref> (1) T-score of &#x02212;2.5 or below at the femoral neck or lumbar spine (without the need for additional risk factors); (2) T-score between &#x02212;1.0 and &#x02212;2.5 at the femoral neck or lumbar spine with a FRAX (World Health Organization fracture risk assessment tool) 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture &#x02265;20% or 10-year probability of hip fracture &#x02265;3% (without the need for a densitometric classification of osteoporosis); or (3) previous hip or vertebral fracture. Denosumab, as well as alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronic acid, is recommended by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists as a first-line agent for the treatment of PMO.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b91-dhps-3-079">91</xref> Denosumab is distinguished by: its infrequent injectable administration, which avoids issues of malabsorption and gastrointestinal intolerance, and may improve long-term adherence to therapy compared with oral bisphosphonates; its SC method of injection, which is less disruptive to the office routine of most physicians than intravenous bisphosphonates and expands the potential number of facilities willing to administer the drug compared with intravenous bisphosphonates; the absence of restrictions on its usage in patients with severe chronic kidney disease; and by reversibility of antiresorptive effect soon after the 6-month dosing period has passed, which may be reassuring to patients who are concerned with the long skeletal half-life of bisphosphonates. Treatment decisions should be made after an evaluation for secondary causes of osteoporosis has been conducted. The expected benefit and potential risks with each medication under consideration should be discussed with the patient prior to starting treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b92-dhps-3-079">92</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANKL associated with a rapid, sustained, and reversible reduction in BTM levels, an increase in BMD, and decrease in the risk of vertebral fractures, hip fractures, and nonvertebral fractures in women with PMO. Compared with alendronate, denosumab is associated with a greater increase in BMD and, in women previously treated with alendronate, switching to denosumab increases BMD more than continuing alendronate.
