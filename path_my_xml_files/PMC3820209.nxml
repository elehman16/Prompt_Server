appropriate position in response to external stimuli. The maintenance of balance requires
normal pressure and an appropriate integration process at the higher center with continuity
of the center of gravity within the support plane. The improvement and maintenance of
balance is very important, because a decrease in balance increases the frequency of falls
and aggravates the physical impairments of patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Aging brings about anatomical and physiological changes, and such
physiological conditions as a loss of perception, dysfunction of the musculoskeletal system,
and instability of posure positions, which are connected to balance problems and can lead to
serious injuries. In particular, visual acuity, pallesthesia, proprioceptive sense, relative
degradation of the lower extremity muscle strength, and delayed response time can all affect
balance and cause accidental falls.</p><p>Treatment methods for enhancing balance recovery and position adjustment include trunk
stabilization exercises, fixed bicycle riding exercises, visual feedback training, and Swiss
ball workouts. In recent years, studies have been actively conducted on exercise methods
based on motor learning theories for voluntary problem solving with visual, auditory, and
biofeedback methods in continuous exercise tasks and conditions. Furthermore, therapeutic
approaches on an unstable support plane that requires postural adjustment in changing
environmental conditions are being used to treat various health problems including stroke,
sports injuries, and falls by the elderly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Shumway-Cook and Woollacott<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that balance training on an unstable support plane was more effective at improving
proprioception of the foot and enhancing the adaptability of balance elements than training
on a stable support plane. Exercise on an unstable support plane has very different effects
from exercise on a stable support plane and is one of the methods that can potentially
change the neuromuscular recruitment pattern. Furthermore, exercise on an unstable support
plane increases muscle activity compared to a stable support plane. Accordingly, this study
was conducted to investigate the effects of aero-step equipment, which can provide an
unstable support plane in any location, enable exercises even in narrow places, and generate
various exercise motions, to promote balance ability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 21 young adults (male: 9, female: 12) in their 20s who were
students of Y University in Chungcheongbukdo. The average age, height, and weight of the
flat floor exercise program group (FEG) were 20.86 &#x000b1; 1.57&#x02005;years, 170.0 &#x000b1; 8.46&#x02005;cm, and 60.64
&#x000b1; 8.61&#x02005;kg respectively. The average age, height, and weight of the aero-step exercise
program group (AEG) were 20 &#x000b1; 1.43&#x02005;years, 166.29 &#x000b1; 5.22&#x02005;cm, and 59.34 &#x000b1; 11.55&#x02005;kg,
respectively. The average age, height, and weight of the control group (CG) were 20.86 &#x000b1;
0.38&#x02005;years, 164.71 &#x000b1; 7.45&#x02005;cm, and 60.16 &#x000b1; 5.67&#x02005;kg. respectively. All of the subjects
listened to an explanation about the purpose and exercise method of this study and
voluntarily consented to participate in this study in advance. The inclusion criteria for
the subjects were no physical defects affecting balance ability, no history of orthopedic or
neurologic injuries in the last six months, and no deficiency in visual sense and sense of
equilibrium for the maintenance of balance.</p><p>Aero-step equipment (Aero-step XL, TOGU, Germany) was used to provide an unstable base
during the performance of the exercise program. The size of the aero-step equipment is 51&#x02005;cm
in length, 37&#x02005;cm in width, and 8&#x02005;cm in height. It is composed of soft rubber and two spaces,
which are filled with air. The aero-step equipment enables exercise in a narrow space and is
easy to handle. Due to the nature of the balloons filled with air, it prevents any large
shocks to the body. Furthermore, it can avoid the boredom that attends monotonous exercise,
because it can generate various exercise motions. Thus, it is an exercise tool that would be
useful for the elderly at home.</p><p>The subjects of this study were randomized into three groups. The FEG performed the
exercise program on a hard, flat surface. The AEG performed the exercise program with the
aero-step equipment, which has an unstable support surface. The CG did not receive any
treatment.</p><p>Both FEG and AEG performed the exercise program in four 30-min sessions per week for 2
weeks. The subjects repeated the motions of step 1 to step 6 in each session, and took a
rest for 3 minutes between each step. All the exercise programs were performed in the
standing position. In step 1, subjects crossed their hands in front of their chest and put
them on both their shoulders. When ready, they closed their eyes, and stood for 6 seconds on
their toes, and then for 6 seconds on their heels. In step 2, while bending their shoulders
at 45 degrees and keeping their elbows spread, they turned their upper body to the right and
left. Then, they raised the toes and heels of their feet. In step 3, the motion was
identical to step 2, but it was performed while holding subject a 2&#x02005;kg weight in both hands.
In step 4, both hands were crossed in front of the chest and put on both shoulders. Subjects
supported their weight on one leg and maintained the position for 6 seconds, before
returning to the original position. Then, they supported their weight on the other leg. In
step 5, with both arms crossed, the shoulders flexed at 45 degrees and the elbows extended,
subjects bent their knee and hip joints for 6 seconds before returning to the original
position. In step 6, with both arms crossed in front of their chest and the hands placed on
both shoulders, subjects balanced on one foot alternately.</p><p>To collect clinical data related to balance, the Biodex Balance System (Biodex medical
systems Inc, USA) was used. The subjects stood with their hands on their shoulders on a
round foothold, which could be moved in all directions at an angle of up to 20 degrees
according to the movement of weight. While gazing at a cursor (point) at the center of a
circle on a computer monitor, they were asked to maintain their eyes on the cursor (point)
at the center of a circle without taking their feet off the foothold when the foothold was
inclined. The positions of their feet on the foothold were adjusted so that the line of
gravity of the body passing through the ankle joint and the line indicated on the foothold
met at a right angle. The distance between both feet was kept at four inches in all
measurements. The stability level of the foothold ranges from level 8, which is the highest,
to level 1, which is the lowest. In this study, levels 1 to 6 were set and the averages of
two measurements were used. For the overall stability index (OSI), anteroposterior stability
index (APSI), and mediolateral stability index (MLSI), a higher value of the balance index
indicates a lower level of balance.</p><p>For statistical analysis of the balance ability within each group, the paired t-test was
performed. SPSS 12.0 for Windows was used for statistical analysis with a significance level
&#x003b1; of 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> The within group comparison of OSI, APSI, and MLSI (unit: score)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Index</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">OSI</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FEG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><sup>a</sup> 2.8&#x000b1;0.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.2&#x000b1;0.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AEG<sup>**</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.3&#x000b1;1.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.2&#x000b1;1.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.0&#x000b1;0.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.9&#x000b1;0.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">APSI</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FEG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.4&#x000b1;1.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.1&#x000b1;1.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AEG<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.6&#x000b1;1.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.5&#x000b1;1.08</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.2&#x000b1;0.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.1&#x000b1;0.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">MLSI</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FEG<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.9&#x000b1;0.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.3&#x000b1;0.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AEG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.4&#x000b1;0.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.3&#x000b1;0.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6&#x000b1;0.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.7&#x000b1;0.6</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>OSI: overall stability index, APSI: anteroposterior stability index, MLSI: mediolateral

for many years. The methods of research for balance recovery and functional improvement
include lateral weight movement training, visual feedback training, task-oriented training,
and trunk stabilization exercise using proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF). In
recent years, studies have been actively conducted of exercise methods based on motor
learning theories for voluntary problem solving with visual, auditory, and biofeedback
methods in continuous exercise tasks and conditions. In this study, the effects of an
exercise program using an aero-step device on balance ability were investigated.</p><p>Katz-Leurer et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup> trained stroke
patients using static bicycle riding exercises. Kim<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a trunk stabilization exercise using PNF elicited
functional movement control and brought about positive reactions in balance and position
adjustment in hemiplegic patients. Lee et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup> used a balance ability exercise therapy system to treat post-stroke
patients with acute hemiplegia, and Lee<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>
improved the balance and movement abilities of stroke patients using a balance pad with an
unstable support plane. In this study, a balance program was performed on an unstable
support plane with aero-step equipment, which is easily movable to any place, can be used by
many persons, and is not limited by location.</p><p>Lee<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup> performed a study of 36 elderly
patients over 60 and reported that the aero-step exercise significantly improved
cardiopulmonary endurance, systemic flexibility, shoulder flexibility, confidence in
balance, multi-directional body twist, and balance tests, and reported that aero-step
exercising was more effective for the improvement of physical strength than weight training.
Oh<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted Swiss ball and aero-step
exercises with elderly subjects aged over 70, and reported that while both exercises
significantly increased static balance, the Swiss ball exercise group improved static
balance on a stable surface and the aero-step exercise group improved static balance on an
unstable surface. Park and Yoon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup> measured
elderly subjects aged 65 or older for 8 weeks and reported that aero-step exercise
significantly increased the muscle strengths of the abdomen, the back, and the lower
extremities, and that the increased muscle strength of the lower extremities improved the
static and dynamic balance abilities of the elderly, which in turn decreased the risk of
falls due to unstable walking. Bae et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted exercises for 40 elderly subjects aged 65 or older for 8
weeks and reported that the aero-step program group showed external ear and the knee joint
alignment closer to the central line of gravity in the sagittal plane than the control
group; and in the coronal plane, the differences in ASIS, indicating the positions of the
bilateral acromion processes and the pelvis, decreased suggesting that proprioceptive
exercises using aero-step can improve the muscular competency along with the proprioceptive
sense as well as the postural alignment of the elderly. Kim and Yoon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted an experiment with elderly women subjects for
eight weeks, and reported the group which used the aero-step program significantly increased
their abdominal and leg muscle strengths. Chang et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted an experiment with normal adult subjects in their 20s for
six weeks, and reported the activities of the right multifidus and the left external
abdominal oblique muscles of those in the stabilization exercise group that used an
aero-step were higher than those in the stabilization exercise group that used an unstable
support. Park<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a 12-week
experiment with patients who had been diagnosed with stroke, and reported the exercise group
that used an aero-step improved their overall balance, anteroposterior balance, and external
and internal balance relative to the exercise group that used flat ground.</p><p>The intragroup comparison of the present study showed significant differences in OSI and
APSI of AEG, and MLSI of FEG, but no significant differences were found in OSI, APSI, and
MLSI in CG. In AEG, anterioposterior sway was elicited by steps 1 to 3 of the exercise
program, and dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the ankle joint stimulated the Golgi tendon
organs and muscle spindles following joint movement, increasing muscle activity and muscle
competency due to an instant reaction to this. Therefore, AEG, which used an unstable
support plane, received greater stimulation of proprioceptors and more smooth stimulation of
the mechanoreceptors in the plantar skin and ankle joint than FEG, which used a stable
support plane. Thus, it seems that the activities of the muscles involved in dorsiflexion
and plantarflexion of the ankle joint and the muscles involved in flexion and extension of
the knee and hip joints were enhanced and the balance ability of APSI increased. FEG, which
used a stable support plane, showed a significant difference in MLSI. It seems that
mediolateral sway was elicited by steps 4 to 6 of the exercise program, and postural balance
was maintined at the hip joint and trunk rather than at the ankle, which improved the
balance ability of MLSI. As shown by the results of this study, the plantar skin sense plays
an important part in postural adjustment and balance. It seems that aero-step equipment,
which has an unstable support surface, more effectively stimulates the plantar skin
receptors and the joint receptors of the ankle during performance of proprioceptive
stimulation exercises than standing upright on a hard ground.</p><p>This study had some limitations. First, the number of subjects was small. Second, it is
difficult to generalize the results because the subjects were young adults from the
Chungcheongbukdo region of South Korea. Third, long-term effects were not evaluated because
this study was conducted for a short period of 2 weeks. Fourth, sufficient evidentiary
materials were not presented because a previous study of aero-step has not been conducted in
South Korea, and it was difficult to find international papers. Fifth and last, objective
data were insufficient because the muscle activities of the lower extremities that affect
balance were not measured. Future studies should develop a program for the elderly exposed
to falls using aero-step equipment with an unstable support plane and investigate its
effects on balance ability and muscle activity.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Shimada</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Obuchi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Furuna</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><etal> et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>New intervention program for preventing falls among frail
