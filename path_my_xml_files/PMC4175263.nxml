performed in toilet-using postures on the blood flow velocity of the lower extremities for
the prevention of deep vein thrombosis. [Subjects] The subjects were 28 students who were
attending B University in Cheonan. They were divided into a group of 14 subjects of
sitting toilet users and a group of 14 subjects of squat toilet users. [Methods] The
subjects performed squat exercises in different toilet-using postures and we investigated
the changes in blood flow velocity. [Results] The variations in blood flow velocities
before and after the exercises showed significant differences in both groups but the
differences between the two groups were not significant. [Conclusion] Based on the results
of this study, we consider squat exercises are effective at improving the variation in
lower-extremity blood flow velocity when using a toilet.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Blood flow velocity</kwd><kwd>Squat exercises</kwd><kwd>Toilet-using postures</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Squatting positions refer to positions in which the shoulder is placed on the knee, while
the ankle, knee, and hip joints are bent. These positions are universal motions among
Asians, including Koreans, that are repeatedly undertaken for daily living activities,
agricultural activities, or work<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>If squatting positions are undertaken repeatedly for long periods of time, the blood
vessels in the lower extremities will be compressed, and the blood flow velocity will
decrease. If the wall of the lower-extremity vein is damaged, blood flow congestion and/or
excessive coagulation may overcome the tendency to inhibit thrombus formation, and deep vein
thrombosis (DVT) may occur in the lower extremity<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. DVT is a major public health challenge with an incidence rate of
0.3% in the general elderly population<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
DVT prevention is crucial and cost effective for critically ill patients. DVT tends to
expand into proximal veins and/or pulmonary emboli<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Examples of squatting positions undertaken for a long period of time in daily living
activities include defecating activities when using a toilet. Previous studies of squatting
positions have reported that 22.5% of the subjects could not perform squatting
positions<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, due to problems associated
with ankle joint movements<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies have also reported that weight bearing exercises such as squats were
functional, because these exercises require the movement of more joints than non weight
bearing exercises, promote functional patterns of muscle mobilization, and stimulate
proprioceptive senses<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, static
resistance exercises increase vascular compliance more than aerobic exercises<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and one-shot gradual maximum exercises
induce significant increases in the blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a previous study that measured the degrees of inconvenience in relation to
lower-extremity positions, high degrees of inconvenience were shown at knee joint angles of
60&#x000b0; and 90&#x000b0;, and low degrees of inconvenience were shown at chair heights of 40&#x02005;cm and 20&#x02005;cm
and in cross-legged sitting positions<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although studies have been conducted on the degrees of inconvenience related to
lower-extremity positions, few studies of the effects of lower-extremity positions on the
blood flow velocity of the lower extremities have been conducted.</p><p>Therefore, this study examined the effects of squat exercises performed in toilet-using
postures on the blood flow velocity of the lower extremities for the prevention of DVT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was conducted with 28 students who were attending B University in Cheonan.
They were divided into a group of 14 subjects (6 males, 8 females) of sitting toilet users
and a group of 14 subjects (7 males, 7 females) of squat toilet users. The mean age of the
sitting toilet-using group was 22.78 &#x000b1; 2.93&#x02005;years, the mean height was 165.71 &#x000b1; 6.67&#x02005;cm,
and the mean weight was 57.92 &#x000b1; 11.39&#x02005;kg. The mean age of the squat toilet-using group was
23.07 &#x000b1; 2.58&#x02005;years, the mean height was 168.00 &#x000b1; 8.19&#x02005;cm, and the mean weight was 62.07 &#x000b1;
11.67&#x02005;kg. When selecting the subjects, those who had limited range of lower-extremity
joint motion, those who had problems found by ultrasonic diagnosis, and those who had
vasomotor dysfunction<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> were excluded.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Bronco Memorial Hospital.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>To examine the effects of squat exercises in different toilet-using postures on changes
in blood flow velocity, the subjects were instructed to perform sitting toilet-using
postures and squat toilet-using postures.</p><p>For the sitting toilet-using postures, the subjects were instructed to sit on a model
toilet with a height of 40&#x02005;cm, the standard height of pedestal toilets, and place their
feet as they usually did, while maintaining their back upright. For the squat toilet-using
postures, the subjects were instructed to sit with their heels 30&#x02005;cm apart from each
other, which is the standard width of squat toilets.</p><p>Blood flow velocities were measured using ultrasonic imaging equipment (LOGIQ e Portable,
GE Inc., USA) with 10&#x02005;MHz linear probes. To take images of the same measurement regions of
the subjects, the region where the right medial ankle bone meets the second toe (the
location where the dorsal venous arch and the great saphenous vein meet) was marked using
the color flow mode of the ultrasonic equipment<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Blood flow velocities were measured in individual measurement
postures and measured again 15 minutes later. A rest was given for 20 minutes
thereafter.</p><p>Squat exercises were performed with the subject&#x02019;s arms folded and the subject&#x02019;s back
maintained upright while putting the feet at shoulder width and maintaining a knee angle
of 60&#x000b0;<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Each motion was maintained
for 10 seconds, and 5 sets of 10 repetitions were performed. A rest of one minute was
given after each set. Blood flow velocities were measured in individual measurement
postures after the exercises and remeasured 15 minutes later. Variations in blood flow
velocities were measured using analytic software (R5.x.x software for the LOGIQ e
ultrasound system, GE Inc., USA).</p><p>Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS for Windows (version 18.0). The data were
analyzed using independent t-test to verify the homogeneity of demographic characteristics
and dependent variables. The data were also analyzed using the paired t-test to compare
differences in the variations in blood flow velocities before and after the exercises and
the independent t-tests for comparisons between the two groups. The significance level was
chosen as 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The variations in blood flow velocities before and after the exercises showed significant

The motions are
comparable to the motions used to sit on chairs in Western culture. Squatting positions lead
to complaints of pain in the lower leg rather than in the lower back or the upper leg,
because squat positions move the center of mass forward and increase loads on the ankles and
the feet<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Performing activies of daily
living or work in squatting positions with diverse knee joint angles for a long time affects
the blood flow velocity of the lower extremities. If the motions that affect the blood flow
velocity of the lower extremities are repeatedly performed, deformation and defects may
occur in the knee cartilage and the collagen fiber networks of the meniscus, even though the
motions&#x02019; momentary loads are not large<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>,
and squatting positions for long periods of time may cause musculoskeletal system diseases
in workers<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the variations in blood flow velocities in the different toilet-using
postures after squat exercises showed significant decreases from the variations before the
exercises. Squat exercises are closed-chain exercises, which are widely used in knee joint
rehabilitation because of their functional characteristics, including simultaneous
contractions of the quadriceps femoris muscle and the hamstring muscle. In addition
decreases in the anterior-posterior knee-femoral displacement, decreases in the pressure on
the knee joint, and selective contraction of the vastus medialis muscle have been
reported<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Resistance exercises, which are one of the best methods for
developing muscle strength, stimulate the body to promote interactions between skeletal
muscles and neuromuscles, and also affect the nervous system by increasing the number of
motor units, thereby improving muscle strength and increasing muscle size<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In previous studies of blood flow rates, Zhang et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that increases in arterial tension would increase blood
flow velocity in the arteries. Sato et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> reported increases in blood flow velocities in the carotid and
vertebral arteries after exercises at 40%, 60%, and 80% of VO2 peak compared to at rest,
indicating increases in blood flow after exercises, and Jang<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> showed there was a significant decrease in the variation in the
average blood flow velocity of the left subclavian artery, from 38.2&#x02005;cm/sec before a dance
exercise to 33.4&#x02005;cm/sec after the exercise. Therefore, although the measurement sites were
different, we consider the decrease in the variation in blood flow velocities seen in our
present study is attributable to the fact that the squat exercises stimulated the
temperature control centers in the muscles, triggering the spinal reflex to increase blood
flow rates.</p><p>In this study, differences in the variation in blood flow velocities between the types of
toilets were not significant, and the variation in blood flow velocities was found to be
lower when sitting toilets were used.</p><p>Based on the results of this study, we consider squat exercises are effective at reducing
the variation in lower-extremity blood flow velocity and can be recommended for increasing
blood flow rates. Limitations of this study were that the subjects comprised males and
females in their twenties, and thus the results cannot be generalized to all age groups.
Also, diverse sitting postures were not investigated, and patients with lower-extremity
blood flow disorders were not included. In future studies, the effects of exercises
performed for a long period of time and blood flow rates in diverse sitting postures should
be compared.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>MK</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Kee</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Effect of stool height and holding time on postural load
