It is suggested that the oxytocinergic system exerts context- and person-dependent effects. We examined how sexual sadistic contexts influenced the effects of the oxytocinergic system on empathic-related behaviors and brain activity in healthy adults. Combining genetic neuroimaging, pharmacological techniques and a psychological paradigm of empathy, we recorded EEG neural responses in female OXTR rs53756 G/G and A/A carriers and measured subjective empathic ratings after intranasal administration of oxytocin/placebo in healthy male adults during the perception of painful facial expressions in sadistic/general social contexts. The results revealed that sadistic contexts modulate oxytocinergic effects on empathy at both behavioral and neural levels. The oxytocinergic system preferentially modulated empathic responses to sadistic contexts. These effects are moderated by individual&#x02019;s trait empathy. Our combined genetic-pharmacological-imaging results provide a neurochemical mechanism for sadistic context-dependent effects of the oxytocinergic system on empathy.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Empathy, which is the understanding and sharing of the emotional states or conditions of others, plays a vital role in social interaction and benefits human society by promoting prosocial behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Impaired empathy may lead to serious social-cognitive dysfunctions, such as psychopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Researchers have recently begun to pay more attention to the specific neurochemical systems involved in empathy, such as the oxytocinergic system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Both the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) and intranasal oxytocin administration (OT) are associated with empathic responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and the experience of empathy, which leads to subsequent generosity toward others, is associated with a 47% increase in oxytocin release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">However, the reported results concerning the effects of the oxytocinergic system on empathy are inconsistent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Several studies that evaluated the effects of oxytocin or OXTR on affect sharing/empathy reported nonsignificant main effects; instead, the effects of the oxytocinergic system on emotional processes were influenced by personal factors or task/stimulus variables<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. For example, in the study by Domes <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, oxytocin improved performance on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) only on more difficult test items. However, oxytocin had no main effect on the accuracy of interpersonal judgments during emotion recognition in other studies; instead, the effect of oxytocin was moderated by individual differences in social proficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, direct experimental evidence that sadistic contexts modulate the effect of the oxytocinergic system on empathy is not yet available. Unlike in non-social contexts (e.g., someone accidentally bumped his head on a door), in the common sadistic context, victims&#x02019; suffering was intentionally inflicted by someone else (e.g., one&#x02019;s body was being beaten with a whip). These sadistic contexts have clear social meanings, suggesting a relationship between the sadist and victims, as well as the subsequent sustained sadistic behavior. The social context in which pain occurs modulates the brain responses to another&#x02019;s pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In the sadistic context, sexual sadists lack the ability to empathize with victims<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, which may lead to an increased likelihood of perpetrating instrumental violence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Thus, an understanding of the functional role of the oxytocin system in modulating the sadistic context-dependent empathic responses may raise important issues regarding the molecular underpinnings of sadistic behavior.</p><p id="Par4">Recently, Ma <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> proposed a social adaptation model (SAM) that provides an integrative understanding of discrepant effects of oxytocin and the modulation of oxytocin action by the personal milieu and context. According to this model, the fundamental function of the oxytocinergic system is to promote social adaptation by modulating emotional responses and adjusting behaviors during social interactions. Humans are social creatures who must maintain a high level of social sensitivity to better adapt to the social environment. Thus, based on accumulating evidence, the social influences of oxytocin vary across social contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, rather than the suggest that oxytocin generally promotes prosociality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, we propose the hypothesis that oxytocin preferentially enhances individuals&#x02019; empathy toward others&#x02019; suffering (e.g., painful expressions) in sadistic (social salience) contexts in which the individuals simultaneously face various social contexts.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we primarily focused on the functional effects of the oxytocinergic system on individuals&#x02019; empathic responses to others&#x02019; suffering in sexual sadistic contexts (vs. general contexts). Compared with painful stimuli in daily contexts, painful stimuli in sexual sadistic contexts show higher social salience and close relationships with participants&#x02019; prosocial/antisocial behaviors. As shown in our previous research, both early (92&#x02013;112&#x02009;ms) and late (700&#x02013;1000&#x02009;ms) empathic neural responses in sexual sadistic contexts, but not in general context, were reduced in female BDSM (B/D (bondage and discipline), D/S (dominance and submission), and S/M (sadism and masochism)) practitioners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In the current study, we further explore the role that oxytocinergic system plays in these sadistic context-dependent empathic responses. We designed two experiments to examine whether the effects of the oxytocinergic system on empathy are influenced by sadistic contexts. Experiment 1 measured empathic neural responses to others&#x02019; suffering in different social contexts (sadistic painful, general painful, and general neutral) by recording electroencephalography (EEG) responses in individuals with the homozygous A/A and G/G genotypes of OXTR rs53576. This approach allowed us to examine whether there is an association between OXTR rs53576 and empathic responses and whether this association is modulated by sadistic contexts. Empathic neural responses to others&#x02019; suffering were quantified by contrasting perceived painful vs. non-painful expressions, similar to the approach used in previous research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Experiment 2 further investigated whether intranasal oxytocin interacts with social contexts to affect subjective empathic ratings and whether this sadistic context-dependent oxytocin effect is driven by enhanced empathic responses to painful expressions in sadistic contexts or decreased empathic responses to painful expressions in general contexts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Behavioral results</title><p id="Par6">We conducted ANOVAs of the subjective ratings of self-esteem, life satisfaction and trait empathy.

We have provided genetic, imaging and pharmacologic evidence that both OXTR and intranasal oxytocin interact with the sadistic context to modulate neural activity and subjective responses related to empathic processes. Specifically, in Experiment 1, the P3 amplitude was enlarged in response to sadistic painful stimuli (vs. neutral) but not in response to general painful stimuli in individuals with the G/G genotype of OXTR rs53576, and this difference was not observed in A/A carriers. Furthermore, in Experiment 2, intranasal oxytocin (vs. placebo) increased context-dependent empathic responses driven by enhanced empathic responses to sadistic painful stimuli, but not by decreased empathic responses to general painful stimuli. Thus, the genetic structure of the oxytocinergic system and relevant molecules play important roles in empathic processes in healthy adults, and this effect may be moderated by different contexts. These results provide neuro-pharmaco-genetic evidence that improves our understanding of the previous inconsistent results describing how the oxytocinergic system modulates subjective feelings and neural responses related to empathy.</p><p id="Par22">Based on our EEG results, the sadistic context modulated the relationship between the OXTR and empathic neural responses, as indicated by P3 amplitudes. The P3 amplitude is a controlled component that is used as a neurophysiological indicator of emotional evaluation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. This indicator appears to be sensitive to both the intrinsic affective properties of the stimulus and the local affective context in which the stimulus is presented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. As shown in the study by Sessa <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, painful contexts, but not painful expressions, selectively modulated the P3 amplitude when contexts and expressions were presented. Consistent with these findings, our results suggested that the OXTR genotype may influence context-dependent empathic neural responses, and G allele carriers showed higher sensitivity to social contexts that included painful stimuli than A/A homozygotes.</p><p id="Par23">In early intranasal oxytocin studies, researchers regarded oxytocin as the &#x0201c;prosocial hormone&#x0201d;, based on evidence showing that intranasal oxytocin promotes prosocial behaviors such as trust. However, in other studies using specific contexts, intranasal oxytocin also increased antisocial behaviors such as envy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Accumulating evidence suggests that the effects of the oxytocinergic system on emotional processes are influenced by personal factors or task contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. For example, in the study by Hurlemann <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> using the feedback-guided item-category association task, participants&#x02019; exhibited higher learning performance when social rather than non-social reinforcement was used. Moreover, an intranasal OT potentiated this social reinforcement advantage by enhancing social reinforcement learning but not decreasing non-social reinforcement learning, suggesting a neural basis of the effects of oxytocin on the facilitation of social salience. Consistent with these findings, oxytocin increased the differential subjective pain intensity and self-unpleasantness ratings between various social contexts in our study. Furthermore, the mediation analysis confirmed that the effect of oxytocin on context-dependent empathic responses was mainly due to enhanced ratings for a social salience context (sadistic painful) but not decreased ratings for a general context (general painful). Other researchers have proposed that attentional orientation to social stimuli, like the eye regions, was enhanced by the increased salience of social cues after intranasal oxytocin administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Thus, OT plays a general role in increasing the salience of social cues and is sensitive to social contexts and individual differences. Moreover, the OT has important roles in processing social information and in allowing individuals to prepare for social engagement and social consequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">Furthermore, we did not observe a similar context-dependent effect of oxytocin on arousal and perceived threat. OT treatments significantly decreased arousal ratings for sadistic painful stimuli, but not perceived threat ratings, compared to the PL treatments, suggesting that the sadistic context-dependent modulation of the effect of oxytocin on subjective empathic responses was not simply attributed to general alert responses. Similarly, the intranasal administration of oxytocin specifically improves recognition memory for faces but not for non-social stimuli, and the effects did not covary with arousal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. This finding is consistent with the SAM of the oxytocinergic system, which suggests that the fundamental function of the oxytocinergic system is to promote social adaptation by modulating emotional responses and adjusting behaviors during social interactions, rather than simply enhancing alert responses.</p><p id="Par25">Our genetic imaging and pharmacologic findings have important implications. First, recent studies have suggested a vital effect of the oxytocinergic system on empathy, but have reported inconsistent results, such as a lack of significant main effects of oxytocin or OXTR on affect sharing/empathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In the current study, we did not observe significant main effects of the OXTR genotype and intranasal oxytocin on empathic neural responses and behavioral tendencies. However, the effects were modulated by social contexts, suggesting that social salience information plays an important role in regulating the effects of the oxytocinergic system on social affective processes. Our findings imply that the oxytocinergic system evaluates the social salience levels of various contexts and preferentially modulates affective processes in high-social-salience contexts.</p><p id="Par26">Second, sexual sadists have been reported to lack the ability to empathize with victims, which may lead to an increased likelihood of perpetrating instrumental violence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, in other studies, sexual sadists did not differ from non-sadistic sexual offenders with regard to emotional empathy for either positive or negative stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The sadistic context in our studies, in which the suffering of victims was intentionally inflicted by someone else, has clear social meanings and suggests a relationship between the sadist and victims, as well as the subsequent sustained sadistic behavior. As shown in our previous studies, both early (92&#x02013;112&#x02009;ms) and late (700&#x02013;1000&#x02009;ms) empathic neural responses in sexual sadistic contexts, but not in general context, were reduced in female BDSM practitioners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, suggesting that BDSM practitioners may have weaker ability to empathize with the suffering of others in sexual sadistic contexts, but not in general contexts. The results of the current study further suggest a functional role for the oxytocin system in these context-dependent empathic responses, as intranasal oxytocin enhanced these context-dependent empathic responses. Taken together, these results provide a possible explanation for the previous discrepancies in the results describing the empathic abilities of sexual sadists. The oxytocinergic system of sexual sadists may function abnormally, preventing them from effectively empathizing with the suffering of others in social salience contexts (such as sexual assault), in which sexual sadists are more likely to commit crimes than in common contexts. However, exogenous oxytocin (e.g., intranasal oxytocin) may potentially function to buffer these context-dependent weaken empathic responses in sexual sadists. This theoretical framework should be examined in the future by exploring the relationship between the function of the oxytocinergic system and various social contexts in psychopathic participants.</p><p id="Par27">A potential limitation of the current study is the lack of female participants in the intranasal oxytocin study, which prevents us from testing whether social context modulates the effect of oxytocin on empathic responses similarly in males and females. An intranasal OT was recently shown to produce significant gender-specific effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Although the social context interacts with the OXTR genotype to modulate empathic neural responses in female participants, we did not determine whether a significant intranasal oxytocin&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;gender interaction exists for social context-dependent empathic responses.</p><p id="Par28">In this study, we did not examine the effects of intranasal oxytocin on different OXTR genotypes. To date, no direct evidence indicates whether the distribution or activity of the receptor in the central nervous system differs between individuals with the A/A and G/G OXTR genotypes.

A total of 96 trials were included in each block. Each photo was presented 2 times in a random order in each block. The participants made judgments about the expression of each face (painful vs. neutral) and pressed a button with their right index or middle fingers.</p><p id="Par34">After the EEG recording, the participants completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, which measures empathy traits. The original 28-item questionnaire consists of four 7-item subscales (Fantasy, Perspective Taking, Empathic Concern and Personal Distress), which measure separate but intercorrelated components of empathy. The items were presented as statements, and the participants rated their agreements on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;does not describe me well, 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;describes me well). The participants were also asked to complete the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> and the Satisfaction with Life Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> to estimate their self-esteem and life satisfaction, respectively.</p><p id="Par35">
<bold>EEG recording and analysis:</bold> The EEG recordings were collected from 64 scalp electrodes based on the 10/20 system, as well as two electrodes placed on the left and right mastoids. All data were re-referenced off-line to an average mastoid reference. Eye blinks and vertical eye movements were monitored with electrodes located above and below the left eye. The horizontal electrooculogram was recorded from electrodes placed 1.5&#x02009;cm lateral to the left and right external canthi. The EEG was amplified (bandpass 0.1&#x02013;100&#x02009;Hz) and digitized at a sampling rate of 250&#x02009;Hz. The event-related potentials (ERPs) in each condition were averaged separately off-line, with an epoch beginning 200 ms before stimulus onset and continuing for 1500 ms. Trials that were contaminated by eye movements, muscle potentials exceeding&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;50 &#x000b5;V at any electrode and response errors were excluded from the averages. This approach resulted in the rejection of 22.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11.9% of the trials. The baseline for the ERP measurements was the mean voltage of a 200 ms pre-stimulus interval, and latency was measured relative to the stimulus onset. The mean amplitudes of each ERP component were calculated at electrodes selected from the frontal (Fz, F1, F2, F3, F4, FCz, FC1, FC2, FC3, and FC4), central (Cz, C1, C2, CPz, CP1, and CP2), parietal (Pz, P1, and P2), and occipito-temporal (PO7, PO8, P7, and P8) regions. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests of the mean ERP amplitudes recorded at the bilateral electrodes included the hemisphere (electrode over the left vs right hemisphere) as a within-subjects variable. We used the false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons.</p><p id="Par36">Both voltage topography and standardized Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (sLORETA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> were used to estimate potential sources of empathic neural responses (see the online supplementary material for details).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Experiment 2</title><p id="Par37">
<bold>Oxytocin administration:</bold> The procedure used to administer oxytocin and the placebo was similar to the procedures reported in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. A single intranasal dose of 24 IU of oxytocin (OT) or placebo (PL) (containing the active ingredients but not the neuropeptide) was self-administered by nasal spray approximately 40&#x02009;min before the experimental task under experimenter supervision. The spray was administered to participants three times, and each administration consisted of one inhalation of 4 IU into each nostril. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subjects design, 10 groups of 4 participants were randomly assigned to the placebo treatment, and the other 10 groups of 4 participants were assigned to the OT treatment. A group of 4 participants who were performing the experiment at the same time was assigned to the same treatment (oxytocin or placebo) to avoid potential influences of oxytocin or placebo between individuals.</p><p id="Par38">
<bold>Stimuli and procedure:</bold> We estimated participants&#x02019; self-esteem, SES, life satisfaction, and trait empathy using the same measurements as described in Experiment 1, which aimed to identify any differences in participants&#x02019; basic psychological states and trait empathy between the two treatment groups. Then, the participants were administered OT or PL and asked to perform the empathic rating task 40&#x02009;min later. The participants were required to rest during this 40-min period, consistent with previous intranasal oxytocin research. The rating stimuli used for this experiment were the same as in Experiment 1. Presentation 0.73 sofeware was used to program and display the stimuli. The participants evaluated each photograph along the following four dimensions on a 9-point Likert scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;not at all, 9&#x02009;=&#x02009;extremely strong): 1) pain intensity, 2) self-unpleasantness, 3) threat, and 4) arousal. The pain intensity ratings reflect the subjective empathic responses of the participants, self-unpleasantness reflects the subjective feelings of the participants during empathy processes, and the threat and arousal ratings reflect the subjective alert responses of the participants. In addition, the participants also made judgments about whether each photograph was realted to sexual sadism on a 9-point Likert scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;not at all related to sexual sadism, 9&#x02009;=&#x02009;absolutely related to sexual sadism).</p><p id="Par39">
<bold>Mediation analysis:</bold> Similar to our previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, a resampling method known as bootstrapping was used to establish mediation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Mediation analyses were conducted to examine whether the treatment effect on context-dependent empathic responses occurs through enhanced empathic responses to sadistic painful expressions or decreased empathic responses to general painful expressions (see the online supplementary material for details).</p><p id="Par40">
<bold>Non-parametric bootstrap analysis:</bold> Non-parametric bootstrap analyses were conducted to further determine the significance of the effect of the treatment on context-dependent empathic responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> (see the online supplementary material for details).</p><p id="Par41">
<bold>Moderation analysis:</bold> Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine whether empathy traits moderated the effect of the treatment (as the independent variable (IV)) on context-dependent empathic responses (as the dependent variable (DV)) (see the online supplementary material for details).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>
