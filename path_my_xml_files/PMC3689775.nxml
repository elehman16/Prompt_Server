Individuals with type 2 diabetes have a reduced plasma adiponectin concentrations <xref rid="pone.0062973-Hotta1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, reduced number of mitochondria <xref rid="pone.0062973-Ritov1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and lower skeletal muscle gene/protein expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; coactivator-1&#x003b1; (PGC-1&#x003b1;), a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis <xref rid="pone.0062973-Mootha1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and oxidative metabolism <xref rid="pone.0062973-Puigserver1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. While increased PGC-1&#x003b1; has been observed with acute exercise in humans <xref rid="pone.0062973-Pilegaard1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, studies examining the effects of chronic exercise training on adiponectin and PGC-1&#x003b1; and their relationship to the change in glycemic control (HbA<sub>1C</sub>) in individuals with type 2 diabetes are absent.</p><p>We recently demonstrated in the Health Benefits of Aerobic and Resistance Training in individuals with type 2 Diabetes (HART-D) study that 9 months of combined aerobic (AT) and resistance (RT) training significantly reduced HbA<sub>1C</sub> levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0062973-Church1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The HART-D study also included AT only and RT only training groups that, together with the combined AT and RT training group, provide a unique opportunity to examine the influence of factors known to influence glycemic control, specifically serum FFA and adiponectin, skeletal muscle PGC-1&#x003b1; protein content, and anthropometric/demographic measures. We therefore hypothesized that the change in HbA<sub>1C</sub> after exercise would be independently associated with serum FFA and adiponectin and the activation of skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis pathways as determined by PGC-1&#x003b1; protein content.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Seventy-eight participants from the previously reported HART-D study volunteered for and were enrolled into an ancillary study that included the collection of muscle samples at baseline and after 9 months of intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062973-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Detailed methods as well as inclusion/exclusion criteria are provided in the main outcomes paper <xref rid="pone.0062973-Church1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>]. Briefly, 262 sedentary individuals with type 2 diabetes (HbA<sub>1C</sub> 6.5% to 11%, inclusive) aged 30 to 75 years were enrolled into the study. Volunteers were excluded if body mass index was &#x02265;48 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, blood pressure was &#x02265;160/100 mmHg, fasting triglycerides were &#x02265;500 mg/dL, urine protein was &#x0003e;100 mg/dL, or serum creatinine was &#x0003e;1.5 mg/dL. In addition, volunteers were excluded if they used an insulin pump or had a history of stroke, advanced neuropathy or retinopathy, or any other serious medical condition that prevented them from adhering to the protocol or exercising safety. Of the original 78 participants, 23 were lost to follow-up due to non-compliance (&#x0003c;80% attendance) with the study protocol leaving a total of 55 participants with both baseline and follow-up data. An additional 10 participants randomized to the control group were excluded from these analyses. An additional 10 participants' samples did not have protein extracted. The final group of 35 participants (17 males and 18 females) aged 57.0&#x000b1;7.7 y are included in the present analysis. The follow-up bloods draw and muscle biopsy for this ancillary project occurred approximately 1 week after their last exercise bout. The study was approved by the Pennington Biomedical Research Center institutional review board and written informed consent was obtained prior to study screening.

Peak oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) was expressed relative to fat-free mass (mL&#x022c5;kg FFM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x022c5;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).

Blood samples were placed into pre-chilled red-top tubes (serum FFA and adiponectin) or EDTA collection tubes (plasma HbA<sub>1C</sub>) and transported to the laboratory on ice (FFA and HbA<sub>1C</sub>). The blood samples for FFA and HbA<sub>1C</sub> were cold centrifuged and the media was immediately analyzed for FFA and HbA<sub>1C</sub> (Beckman Coulter DXC600 Pro; Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA). Blood collected for total serum adiponectin (Linco, St. Charles, MO) concentrations were transferred to the laboratory at room temperature, centrifuged, and serum was stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until run in a single batch at the end of the trial. The intra-assay variation for HbA<sub>1C</sub>, FFA, and adiponectin was &#x000b1;2.84%, &#x000b1;0.75%, and &#x000b1;6.21%, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Muscle analysis</title><p>Muscle samples were obtained under local anaesthesia from the <italic>vastus lateralis</italic> using the Bergstrom technique and immediately snap frozen.

Total protein content was quantified by BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and 25 uL was added to each gel for determination of PGC-1&#x003b1; protein content. PGC-1&#x003b1; protein content quantified relative to GAPDH (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was determined by Western blot using an Odyssey 9120 Imaging System (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) after probing with goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 680 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

Volunteers were later randomized to an intervention group according to the randomization schema within the main HART-D trial resulting in unequal group randomization. The nature of this intervention study prevents blinding of the exercise intervention personnel. However, every effort was made to maintain blinding of the assessment staff from the participant's intervention group.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess baseline group differences (JMP 9.0.2, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and dichotomous variables were examined using a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. All exercise groups were collapsed into a single group for the remaining analyses since no effect of exercise group was observed in the final model (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.15), and the addition of exercise group to the final model did not influence the other factors in the model. Linear regression (Pearson r) was used to determine the relationships among change (post-pre) scores. Baseline-adjusted changes in anthropometric data, HbA<sub>1C</sub>, PGC-1&#x003b1; protein content, and fasting adiponectin and free-fatty acids were determined using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with group differences analyzed using Student-t post-hoc tests. In addition, ANCOVA was used to examine the relationships between changes in HbA<sub>1C</sub> and changes in independent determinants (semi-partial correlation coefficients (r)). To determine the relationship between changes in HbA<sub>1C</sub> and changes in FFA, adiponectin, and PGC1a content, we first adjusted for baseline HbA<sub>1C</sub>, sex, ethnicity, and duration of diabetes; all variables that were adjusted for in the main outcomes paper <xref rid="pone.0062973-Church1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Furthermore, we aimed to determine whether weight, body composition and/or fitness (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) further explained the change in HbA<sub>1C</sub> or removed any of the existing parameters from the model.

Free-fatty acid accumulation in the circulation may be the result of an imbalance between skeletal muscle uptake and oxidation and defects in adipose tissue insulin signaling <xref rid="pone.0062973-Ravussin1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Lipid oversupply to skeletal muscle may cause insulin resistance through accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipid species <xref rid="pone.0062973-Koves1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In the present investigation, improved balance between muscle lipid storage and oxidation (less lipid species storage), as suggested by a decrease in serum FFA, may be an important contributor to the improvement in HbA<sub>1C</sub>.</p><p>We observed a strong inverse relationship between the changes in adiponectin and the changes in HbA<sub>1C</sub>.

Our results demonstrate a clinically relevant situation in which the change in serum adiponectin was associated with an improvement in HbA<sub>1C</sub>.</p><p>A recent review called for more effective and sophisticated exercise prescriptions for the improvement of glucose control through increasing intramuscular PGC-1&#x003b1; <xref rid="pone.0062973-Benton1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Studies demonstrate increased PGC-1&#x003b1; with aerobic training <xref rid="pone.0062973-Pilegaard1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, while others show no effect or improvements with resistance training <xref rid="pone.0062973-Layne1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062973-Heilbronn1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. We tested different exercise modalities and only resistance training had a tendency to increase PGC-1&#x003b1; content. Additionally, the change in PGC-1&#x003b1; was greater in those with longer duration of type 2 diabetes. In our final model, a greater increase in PGC-1&#x003b1; and a shorter duration of type 2 diabetes were independently associated with improved glycemic control. The main results from the HART-D trial together with this ancillary study suggest that: 1) a program of combined aerobic and resistance training has the greatest effect on HbA<sub>1C</sub>; 2) resistance training may potentiate a greater change in PGC-1&#x003b1;, and therefore, HbA<sub>1C;</sub> and 3) individuals who start an exercise program soon after diagnosis may see a larger effect on HbA1C levels.</p><p>Our investigation is limited by a small sample size with almost 50% of the participants assigned to the resistance training group. However, we had adequate power to detect independent effects of substrate (FFA), hormone (adiponectin) and muscle (PGC-1&#x003b1;) changes on glycemic control after collapsing the exercise groups. Drug changes were not controlled during the intervention period resulting in a limitation whereby a tendency to reduce diabetes medications after the combination intervention reduces the effect on change in HbA<sub>1C</sub> levels. Furthermore, dietary assessments were taken at baseline and follow-up by food frequency questionnaire thus limiting our ability to determine the impact of dietary modifications such as changes in caloric intake and dietary composition. Finally, research suggests that GAPDH gene transcription may be sensitive to treatments that may influence PGC-1&#x003b1; protein content, including exercise-induced changes in insulin sensitivity <xref rid="pone.0062973-AlexanderBridges1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, analysis of the crude and GAPDH adjusted PGC-1&#x003b1; data yielded similar results providing evidence that the effects noted in this manuscript were the result of the exercise intervention on PGC-1&#x003b1; specifically and not secondary changes in GAPDH. The primary strengths are a well-controlled exercise training study with high adherence rates and a wide range of changes in the dependent and independent variables.</p><p>In summary, exercise in individuals with type 2 diabetes should be initiated soon after diagnosis and include training programs aimed at improving plasma substrate availability, endocrine function, and skeletal muscle factors shown to improve glycemic outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062973.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
