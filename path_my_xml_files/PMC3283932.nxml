Periodontal disease is multifaceted and creates myriad problems, such as mucogingival problems, osseous deformities, loss of supporting alveolar bone, and periodontal pocket formation to state a few.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Gingival recession or marginal soft tissue recession is the location of the gingival margin apical to the cementoenamel junction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Observed more frequently on buccal surfaces, gingival recession has long been a concern of many patients who feel that the &#x0201c;long-in-the-tooth&#x0201d; look is universally accepted as a sign of aging and tooth loss.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Although marginal tissue recession seldom results in tooth loss, it is associated with root hypersensitivity, frenal involvement, marginal tissue irritation, esthetic concerns, and a predilection to root caries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Any one of these problems or a combination of these, along with patient's intense esthetic desire promotes the patient to seek treatment for gingival recession. Hence, root coverage forms an important part of periodontal therapy.</p><p>In the past, various treatment modalities such as pedicle flaps, free gingival grafts, and coronally repositioned flaps have been used in the treatment of gingival recession. The disadvantages of these techniques have led to the development of subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) procedures. The SCTGs have been highly predictable in gingival recession therapy with respect to a high percentage of root coverage, better healing and less postoperative discomfort at the donor site when compared with free gingival grafts.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>More recently, guided tissue regeneration (GTR) has emerged as another treatment modality for gingival recession. However, the need for a second surgical procedure for the removal of non-absorbable membrane and its associated complications has made use of absorbable barrier membranes more favorable. Of these absorbable membranes, collagen membranes are being used widely.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Collagen is a natural protein and an integral part of mammalian tissues. There is a similarity between collagen in human skin and certain animal tissues. The rationale for selecting collagen were that collagen is the major extracellular macromolecule of the periodontal connective tissue and is physiologically metabolized by these tissues, it has been shown to be chemotactic for fibroblasts, acts as a barrier for migrating gingival epithelial cells, serves as a fibrillar scaffold for early vascular and tissue ingrowth, facilitates early wound stabilization and maturation, possess hemostatic properties through its ability to aggregate platelets, and is very weakly immunogenic, therefore biocompatible.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Hence, an attempt is made through this study to compare the efficacy of bioabsorbable collagen membrane with SCTG for the treatment of localized gingival recession.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patient selection</title><p>Ten systemically healthy patients, showing at least two localized Miller's Class I or Class II gingival recession, from among the patients referred to the Department of Periodontics, JSS Dental College and Hospital, Mysore, participated in this study.

Patients were informed that they could withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Presurgical treatment</title><p>The patients were educated and motivated with emphasis on proper oral hygiene maintenance. All the patients underwent the initial phase of treatment, which consisted of thorough scaling and root planning. In a split mouth design, the pairs of defects were randomly assigned for treatment with either SCTG Group or GTR-based collagen membrane (GTRC Group). Each group included 8 Miller's Class I and 2 Miller's Class II gingival recession cases. Both the grafts were covered with coronally advanced flap.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Measurements</title><p>All measurements were performed by one examiner.

Statistically, the difference in root coverage between groups was not significant (<italic>t</italic> = 0.117).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present study demonstrated the clinical applicability of a bioabsorbable collagen membrane in comparison to autogenous CTG for root coverage in localized facial gingival recession defects.</p><p>In this study, the autogenous subepithelial CTG was harvested from the patient's palatal mucosa. The anterior and posterior extensions of the donor site were limited to canine and palatal root of the first molar region as the palatal root of the first molar represents a natural barrier to graft harvesting because the tissue is thinnest in this area.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The lateral border site was formed by a horizontal line 2&#x02013;3mm from the marginal gingiva of the maxillary teeth. The medial extension was restricted by the neurovascular bundle.</p><p>The collagen membrane used in this study was developed by Central Leather Research Institute, Chennai, which was type I collagen prepared from purified soluble bovine Achilles tendon. The collagen membrane was cross-linked by gluteraldehyde and sterilized by ethylene oxide gas and had a resorption time of 3&#x02013;4 weeks. The resorption of the collagen membrane falls well within the time specified by a study, which has reported that during GTR procedures, bone and/ or periodontal ligament cell migration reach their peaks in 2&#x02013;7 days after surgery, with a decrease in mitotic activity to almost normal levels by the end of 3&#x02013;4 weeks.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Therefore, the length of time that the collagen membrane retains its integrity should be sufficient (3-4 weeks) to allow selective cell population.</p><p>The grafted sites were followed up for a period of 6 months. The mean root coverage obtained with a CTG was 84.84% and with collagen membrane graft was 84%. The difference in root coverage between the two groups was statistically not significant; the reason for this could be that the subepithelial CTG is principally composed of collagen fibers which is similar to that of the collagen membrane graft used in this study. Thus, high percentage and almost equal amounts of mean root coverage in both the groups imply that both surgical procedures have definite therapeutic utility.</p><p>However, the benefit of utilizing resorbable collagen material eliminates the need for any donor site, and being completely absorbed by the host tissues, there is no need for surgical reentry for its removal unlike the nonresorbable barrier membranes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Other studies using collagen membrane for root coverage have reported a mean root coverage between 51% and 85%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The mean root coverage of 84% with collagen membrane grafting observed in the present study falls within the reported range. Comparing CTG and GTR, other studies have reported thus, Zucchelli <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] SCTG=93.5%, GTR=85.7%; Trombelli <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] SCTG=81%, GTR=48%; and Harris <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] SCTG=97.1%, GTR=75.1%. Rosetti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] reported a root coverage of 95.6% for SCTG and 84.2% for collagen-based GTR techniques. The mean root coverage obtained with a CTG in the present study was 84.84%.</p><p>In the present study, the mean keratinized gingival width increase was 1.50 &#x000b1; 0.70 mm and 2.30 &#x000b1; 0.67 mm in the SCTG and GTRC group, respectively.

To confirm the use of collagen membrane as a good alternative for treatment of gingival recession, more longitudinal studies are required in this field of periodontal plastic
