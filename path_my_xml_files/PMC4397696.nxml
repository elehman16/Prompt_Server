The minimally invasive technique of transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS TLIF) is increasingly used but has been found to generate increased radiation exposure to the patient and staff. Modern three-dimensional (3D) C-arm devices are capable of providing conventional two-dimensional fluoroscopic images (x-rays) as well as 3D image sets for intraoperative navigation. This study was designed to compare the radiation exposure between these two intraoperative imaging techniques in MIS TLIF procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study is a randomized controlled trial. Forty participants scheduled to undergo monosegmental MIS TLIF will be recruited and randomly allocated to one of two groups with respect to the applied intraoperative imaging technique: conventional fluoroscopy (FLUORO group) and 3D fluoroscopy-based navigation combined with conventional fluoroscopy (NAV group). Furthermore, patients scheduled to undergo bisegmental MIS TLIF during the recruitment period for monosegmental MIS TLIF will be assessed for eligibility and will be randomly assigned separately. The primary endpoint is the radiation exposure to the surgeon and is measured by dosimeter readings. Secondary endpoints are the radiation exposure to the assistant surgeon, scrub nurse, anesthetist, patient, and C-arm as well as radiation exposure in relation to the body mass index of the patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Results of this randomized study will help to compare the radiation exposure to the operating staff and patient during MIS TLIF procedures using conventional fluoroscopy versus 3D fluoroscopy-based navigation combined with conventional fluoroscopy.

The traditional open surgical technique includes a long skin incision with dissection and retraction of paravertebral muscles, thereby exposing the bony structures of the posterior spine. In 2003, Foley <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] first described a minimally invasive technique for transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS TLIF) using tubular retractors under fluoroscopic guidance. A recent meta-analysis showed that MIS TLIF resulted in less blood loss and shorter hospital stay but increased x-ray exposure time compared with the open TLIF technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Modern three-dimensional (3D) C-arm devices are capable of providing conventional two-dimensional (2D) fluoroscopic images (x-rays) as well as 3D image sets for intraoperative navigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The main principle of intraoperative C-arm-based 3D imaging is an automated orbital rotation of the C-arm around the patient who has already been draped and positioned on the operating table. During this rotational scan, a 3D image data set is obtained from multiple successive 2D fluoroscopic images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The 3D scan is performed after the staff has left the operating room. Additionally using navigated instruments and a navigation device, the surgeon can then perform accurate screw placement without additional radiation exposure.</p><p>The radiation exposures of MIS TLIF procedures using conventional 2D fluoroscopic images and 3D fluoroscopy-based navigation have not been systematically compared so far. Thus, the purpose of this study is to compare the radiation exposure to the surgeon, assistant surgeon, scrub nurse, anesthetist, and patient in monosegmental and bisegmental MIS TLIF using conventional fluoroscopy (FLUORO group) and 3D fluoroscopy-based navigation (NAV group) as intraoperative imaging techniques.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>This study is a randomized controlled trial to assess the intraoperative radiation exposure during monosegmental and bisegmental MIS TLIF procedures to the surgeon, assistant surgeon, scrub nurse, anesthetist, and patient.

Adult patients with chronic low back pain of at least 3 out of 10 at rest and at least 5 out of 10 under physical strain on the visual analogue scale (VAS) are to be enrolled if conservative treatment, including physiotherapy and adequate pain medication therapy, of at least 3&#x000a0;months failed to improve symptoms according to the multidisciplinary treatment path for chronic back pain of our university hospital. The cause of their symptoms has to be attributable to monosegmental or bisegmental degenerative disc disease or instability, including spondylolisthesis according to Meyerding grade I and II within L2 and S1. Radiographic signs indicative for symptomatic segments concerning degenerative disc disease or instability include spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, Modic changes, facet joint degeneration, facet joint effusion, spinal stenosis, and severe disc collapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

Four different types of dosimeters are used (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Film dosimeters (AWST-FILM GD 60, <italic>H</italic><sub>p</sub>(10); Helmholtz Zentrum M&#x000fc;nchen, part of the German Research Center for Environmental Health, Personal Monitoring Service, Munich, Germany) are attached to the trunk of the surgeon, assistant surgeon, scrub nurse, anesthetist, patient, and C-arm. Eye lens thermoluminescence dosimeters (EYE-D, <italic>H</italic><sub>p</sub>(3); Radcard, Krakow, Poland) are attached to the surgeon, assistant surgeon, and scrub nurse. Ring dosimeters (AWST-TL-TD 60, type W; Helmholtz Zentrum M&#x000fc;nchen) are tightened around the ring fingers of the surgeon. Moreover, an Electronic Personal Dosimeter (EPD Mk2, <italic>H</italic><sub>p</sub>(10) mode; Thermo Scientific, Schwerte, Germany) is installed at the flat panel detector of the C-arm to read radiation exposures at predetermined time points during surgery. This dosimeter location approximately corresponds to a surgeon who does not step back from the radiation source when applying x-rays, and this is regularly the case in most operating rooms. With the EPD, we have radiation exposure readings at any time of the operation and thus have the possibility to approximately relate radiation exposures to certain steps of the operation.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>

The anesthetist wears a one-piece lead apron (lead equivalent value of 0.35&#x000a0;mm Pb in the front part).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Surgical technique</title><p>All MIS TLIFs are performed primarily by the first author (UH) (and by RS by proxy). The patient is positioned prone on a radiolucent table, allowing fluoroscopic images in anterior-posterior and lateral projection as well as 3D scans. Prior to draping of the patient, the projections of the pedicles were identified and marked on the skin by using fluoroscopic images. The mobile 3D C-arm device, Ziehm Vision FD Vario 3D with flat panel detector (Ziehm Imaging, Nuremberg, Germany), is used for all MIS TLIFs in this study and is set on automatic exposure control with corresponding kilovolt and milliampere values of varying magnitudes; this is usual in daily practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. No continuous fluoroscopy is used. Only single fluoroscopic images are acquired (C-arm in pulsed mode with 12.5 images per second).</p><p>For insertion of transpedicular Kirschner wires in the NAV group, a navigation tracker is mounted on the spinous process of one of the index vertebras via a median skin incision of approximately 2.5&#x000a0;cm. Subsequently, an automated 3D navigation scan is performed in apnea by using the 3D capable C-arm Ziehm Vision FD Vario 3D. During the 3D scan, the entire staff leaves the operating room and thus has a minimum distance of 6&#x000a0;m from the x-ray generator and patient. The 3D image set is automatically transferred to a navigation device (for example, Cart II system device; Stryker, Freiburg, Germany: SpineMap 3D navigation), and navigation tools are referenced. Via bilateral short skin incisions (2 to 3&#x000a0;cm), a navigated Jamshidi needle is introduced into the target vertebras through the pedicles, and Kirschner wires are inserted through the Jamshidi needle without additional use of fluoroscopic images.</p><p>In the FLUORO group, a Jamshidi needle is introduced via bilateral short skin incisions (2 to 3&#x000a0;cm) to locate the ideal pedicle entry point between the transverse process and lateral facet joint. This is accomplished by using tactile feedback and conventional fluoroscopic image guidance in lateral projection without exposing the anatomical structures. Then the Jamshidi needle is introduced into the target vertebras through the pedicles verified by fluoroscopic images in lateral projection when necessary, and Kirschner wires are inserted through the Jamshidi needle (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>

</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_690_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p>Since the surgeon inserts all Kirschner wires himself, he is changing sides of the table and therefore is exposed to the corresponding scatter radiation at the ipsilateral or contralateral side of the C-arm generator, respectively. Thereafter, neurophysiological monitoring is performed for safe pedicle screw placement in both treatment groups. Integrity of the pedicle wall is evaluated with monopolar and bipolar stimulation by using a tip stimulation probe with recording of the compound muscle action potentials. With monopolar stimulation, a constant current below 7 milliampere is regarded as suspicious of pedicle perforation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and revising the trajectory has to be considered. Then the Kirschner wires are drawn back under fluoroscopic image guidance in lateral projection, so that their tips are positioned at the posterior border of the vertebral bodies. Their intrapedicular position is controlled by using fluoroscopic image guidance in anterior-posterior projection.</p><p>The next step is to insert and mount the non-expandable tubular retractor system METRx (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) on the facet joint for the MIS TLIF approach. In the NAV group, the facet joint is located by using the navigated Jamshidi needle without additional use of fluoroscopic images. In the FLUORO group, the localization with the Jamshidi needle has to be performed by using fluoroscopic image guidance in lateral projection. Thereafter, in both treatment groups, the transmuscular approach is created by using METRx dilators. Finally, a METRx operation tube (diameter of 20&#x000a0;mm) is inserted and fixed to the table. During the following transforaminal access including facetectomy, unilateral or bilateral decompression of the spinal canal via unilateral partial hemilaminectomy, nucleotomy and implantation of the TLIF cage (with additional insertion of autologous bone into the intervertebral disc space, which has been collected during facetectomy), the surgeon uses the operating microscope from the ipsilateral side. Implantation of the cage is performed under fluoroscopic image guidance in lateral projection.</p><p>Subsequent screw insertion via the Kirschner wires and rod insertion (using CD Horizon Sextant II, CD Horizon Sextant Solera, or CD Horizon Longitude; Medtronic) is performed identically in both treatment groups without routine use of conventional fluoroscopy. If bone density is considered to be low, cement augmentation of the vertebras is performed via perforated screws under fluoroscopic image control in lateral projection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Final control is made by using fluoroscopic image guidance in lateral and anterior-posterior projection.</p><p>The following guidelines must be followed as radiation protection principles: (a) continuous fluoroscopy is not used, (b) the distance between the patient&#x02019;s surface and the flat panel detector is minimized, (c) beam collimation is used whenever possible, (d) a distance from the radiation source and patient&#x02019;s surface (as the origin of the Compton scatter) is maintained whenever possible, (e) the hand is removed from the path of the x-ray beam when holding an instrument, and (f) no staff member stays in the operating room during acquisition of the 3D scan.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Data collection</title><p>In this study, the primary endpoint is the radiation exposure to the surgeon during monosegmental MIS TLIFs in the FLUORO and NAV groups.

A retrospective survey in our department showed an average radiation time of 55.75&#x000a0;seconds in 16 consecutive MIS TLIF procedures using conventional fluoroscopy. Comparing this radiation time with the data of Bindal <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], we assume a calculated radiation exposure to the surgeon of 146.2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;Sv (266&#x000a0;&#x003bc;Sv&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;55.75&#x000a0;seconds/101.4&#x000a0;seconds) in our department.</p><p>For estimating the radiation exposure in the NAV group, we made the following assumptions: We estimate that 12 conventional fluoroscopic images are obtained for one monosegmental MIS TLIF procedure in attendance of the surgeon (the 3D fluoroscopy-based image data set is attained in an automated fashion after the staff has left the operating room, thus not causing radiation exposure to the staff). Rampersaud <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] stated an average radiation time of 1.1&#x000a0;seconds per fluoroscopic image. With this data, we assume a radiation exposure to the surgeon of 34.6&#x000a0;&#x003bc;Sv (12 images&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1.1&#x000a0;seconds/image&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;266&#x000a0;&#x003bc;Sv/101.4&#x000a0;seconds) during a monosegmental MIS TLIF procedure using 3D fluoroscopy-based navigation.</p><p>Based on the above-mentioned assumptions, we used radiation exposures of 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;Sv (FLUORO group) and 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;Sv (NAV group) for calculation of the estimated sample size. The alpha level was set to 0.05, and the level of statistical power for calculating the sample size was set to 0.8. This power analysis led to a sample size of n&#x02009;=&#x02009;17 for each group for monosegmental MIS TLIF procedures applying the two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test for independent samples. We aim to include 20 patients with monosegmental MIS TLIF procedures in each group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary endpoint (radiation exposure to the surgeon) will be tested at the 0.05 level. Results will be expressed as means with standard deviations. Analysis of independent continuous quantitative variables between groups will be performed by using the two-tailed Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test. Pearson&#x02019;s correlation test will be used to determine correlations between two variables. Statistical comparisons for categorical values between groups will be performed by using the two-tailed Fisher exact test. Prism 6 for Mac (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) will be used as statistical software.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Since there is no threshold dose according to the stochastic model for radiation injuries, spine surgeons should apply x-rays thoughtfully and sparingly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Minimally invasive fusion techniques, in particular, can result in increased x-ray exposure times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Bearing in mind that surgeon and staff are exposed to radiation during their daily routine, one has to find solutions to reduce the occupational radiation exposure. Radiation protection principles like wearing adequate lead equipment (including thyroid shield and lead glass goggles), application of beam collimation, and keeping a distance from the radiation source should be self-evident [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Further reduction might be obtained by using 3D fluoroscopy-based navigation since the staff is leaving the operating room for acquisition of the 3D image scan, thus avoiding additional radiation exposure. In contrast, application of 3D fluoroscopy-based navigation might increase radiation exposure to the patient. This randomized study aims to compare the radiation exposure to the operating staff and patient during MIS TLIF procedures using conventional fluoroscopy or 3D fluoroscopy-based navigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial is currently recruiting participants.
