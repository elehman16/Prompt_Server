It is characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue, caused by antibodies directed against skeletal muscle receptors and proteins at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Symptoms of MG may include impaired speech, difficulty swallowing or chewing, shortness of breath, drooping of one or both eyelids, blurred vision and weakness in limbs, which have considerable impact on health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">MG can be classified based on: pathogenic antibody specificity [anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive, anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody-positive, anti-low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4)-positive or seronegative]; thymus histology (thymitis, thymoma or atrophy), age of onset (before puberty,&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;50 or&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;50&#x000a0;years) and extent of involvement (ocular or generalized) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The majority (&#x02248;&#x000a0;85%) of patients with MG have circulating antibodies against AChRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Binding of these anti-AChR antibodies to complement factors induces the formation of membrane attack complexes (MAC), which damage the muscle membrane and reduce the number of functional AChRs, leading to impaired neurotransmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Treatment strategies for MG include: (1) improving neuromuscular transmission with the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. pyridostigmine), (2) treatment of acute exacerbations [e.g. plasma exchange (PLEX), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)], (3) immunosuppressive therapy (IST; e.g. corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclosporine) and (4) thymectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, of these, only acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. pyridostigmine) are specifically indicated for use in patients with MG. Patients with MG are often treated successfully with these therapies and live productive lives; however, despite improved life-expectancy with advances in medical therapy, quality of life remains reduced, particularly in patients with generalized symptoms or active disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, a small subgroup of patients have treatment-refractory disease and require more aggressive therapy to prevent life-threatening crises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Although its exact prevalence is unknown, treatment-refractory MG is estimated to affect&#x000a0;&#x02248;&#x000a0;10&#x02013;15% of patients with generalized MG (gMG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Treatment options for these patients include chronic PLEX, chronic IVIg, rituximab and cyclophosphamide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, until recently, there were no options for patients who were refractory to currently available therapies, indicating an unmet need for additional therapies.</p><p id="Par6">Complement plays a key role in the pathogenesis of disease. In clinical studies in patients with MG, IgG and C3 colocalized on the segments of the postsynaptic membrane and on fragments of degenerating junctional folds in the synaptic space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and MACs were detected at the muscle end-plates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Moreover, in experimental autoimmune MG (EMAG) studies, inhibition of complement pathways reduced MAC deposits at the NMJ, thereby diminishing the destruction of the NMJ by anti-AChR antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Based on these observations, it was hypothesized that inhibition of complement activation in patients who have anti-AChR antibodies could prevent damage at the postsynaptic membrane of the NMJ, providing a rationale for the development of complement inhibitors.</p><p id="Par7">Eculizumab (Soliris<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal IgG2/4<sub>K</sub> antibody that binds to human C5 complement protein and inhibits the activation of terminal complement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is the first targeted complement inhibitor approved worldwide for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases, including paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Recently, eculizumab was also approved for the treatment of adults with anti-AChR antibody-positive gMG in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], anti-AChR antibody-positive refractory gMG in the EU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] or patients with anti-AChR antibody-positive gMG whose symptoms are difficult to control with high-dose IVIg therapy or PLEX in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] (Sect. <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">5</xref>). This narrative review focuses on the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of eculizumab in these patients and summarizes relevant pharmacological data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Pharmacological Properties of Eculizumab</title><p id="Par8">The pharmacological properties of eculizumab have been reviewed in detail previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; a brief summary of data relevant to gMG are discussed here.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mechanism of Action</title><p id="Par9">Eculizumab is a terminal complement inhibitor comprising human constant regions from human IgG2 and IgG4 sequences and murine complementarity-determining regions grafted onto the human framework light- and heavy-chain variable regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It binds with high affinity and specificity to the complement protein C5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and is thought to sterically hinder the C5 convertases from associating with C5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which inhibits C5 cleavage to the proinflammatory complement component C5a and C5b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, it is believed that eculizumab exerts its therapeutic effects in patients with gMG by reducing the formation and deposition of the MAC C5b-9 at the NMJ and destruction of the post-synaptic structure (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Immediate, complete and sustained inhibition of terminal complement activity is seen with chronic administration of eculizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Eculizumab blocks the complement cascade at the level of C5, but preserves the generation of C3b, which is essential for the clearance of circulating immune complexes and the normal phagocytosis of bacterial and fungal pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The clinical efficacy of eculizumab in the pivotal, phase 3 REGAIN trial in patients with refractory gMG is discussed in Sect. <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">3</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Mechanism of action of eculizumab. <italic>ACh</italic> acetylcholine, <italic>AChR</italic> acetylcholine receptor</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40265_2018_875_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

According to a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with gMG, eculizumab 900&#x000a0;mg every week for 4&#x000a0;weeks, 1200&#x000a0;mg at week 5 and 1200&#x000a0;mg every 2&#x000a0;weeks thereafter (approved dosage; Sect. <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">5</xref>) was expected to result in eculizumab concentrations above the minimum target (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;50&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL) for complete complement blockade in 95% of patients, thereby reducing the risk of clinical deterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. With this regimen, the exposure to eculizumab (mean area under the concentration-time curve) was higher than the exposure associated with 50% of maximal effect [assessed by the quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG) total score] and close to the plateau of effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. After maintenance doses of 1200&#x000a0;mg every 2&#x000a0;weeks in patients with gMG, the observed mean peak plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) of eculizumab at week 26 was 783&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL and the mean trough concentration was 341&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

Currently there are no pharmacoeconomic analyses of eculizumab in patients with gMG; well-designed studies assessing the cost-effectiveness of eculizumab are needed, especially considering the high acquisition cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] of eculizumab.</p><p id="Par44">To conclude, eculizumab is the first targeted complement inhibitor to be approved for use in anti-AChR antibody-positive adults with gMG or refractory gMG. In the well-designed REGAIN study, although a statistically significant benefit of eculizumab over placebo in the prespecified primary endpoint analysis was not formally demonstrated, preplanned and post hoc sensitivity analyses of this outcome and other secondary outcomes, as well as data from an extension study supported the efficacy of eculizumab in this indication. Eculizumab was generally well tolerated, with a tolerability profile generally similar to that reported previously in other indications. Although several questions remain, such as duration of treatment, cost effectiveness and long-term efficacy and tolerability, current evidence indicates that eculizumab is a valuable emerging therapy for patients with refractory gMG.</p><sec id="FPar2"><title>Data Selection Eculizumab: 287 records identified</title><p id="Par45">
