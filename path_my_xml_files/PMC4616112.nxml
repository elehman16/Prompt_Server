caused by displacement of the patella from its position between the femoral condyles<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Repetitive occurrence of this displacement
may lead to the development of degenerative arthritis due to the resulting abrasion of the
articular surface<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many studies have
demonstrated that in patients with PFPS, the patellae are dragged excessively outward<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported that this excessive
outward dragging is caused by an imbalance between the vastus medialis oblique (VMO) and
vastus lateralis (VL) muscles and is the main cause of PFPS<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the etiology of
PFPS has not yet been clearly defined. One of the main mechanisms for abnormal patellar
tracking in PFPS is an imbalance in the muscle activity of the VMO relative to the VL<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, several exercise interventions emphasize the importance of the VMO<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The squat exercise is a common weight bearing exercise used by athletes and other
individuals with healthy knees to train the hip and thigh musculature<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several studies have reported that a remarkably weaker VMO
or delayed activation of the VMO compared with the VL is due to an imbalance between the two
muscles<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The squat exercise does not
cause an anterior shear force because of the cooperative contraction of the quadriceps and
the hamstrings in the patellofemoral joint, and functional muscle recruitment patterns can
be provided as many joints move<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study
demonstrated that an intervention program, which involved the use of one&#x02019;s own body weight
as resistance during performance of exercises at a slow movement speed, improves physical
function<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, in this study, a
slow speed-targeting squat exercise device was developed, and the effects of the slow
speed-targeting squat exercise on the VMO/VL ratio were investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study involved 10 asymptomatic men aged 35.4 &#x000b1; 2.0&#x02005;years (mean &#x000b1; SD), with a mean
height and weight of 176 &#x000b1; 5.1&#x02005;cm and 65.0 &#x000b1; 3.2&#x02005;kg, respectively. All subjects were healthy
and free of back pain for a minimum of 1&#x02005;year before the study; they had no lower limb or
spine pathologies and no rheumatological or neurological conditions. The purpose and
procedures of the study were explained to the subjects prior to their participation, and
they provided informed consent according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p><p>The EMG signals were sent to the data acquisition unit of the MP150 system (BIOPAC Systems,
Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The EMG data were analyzed using a program created with the
AcqKnowledge software (version 3.9.1) and expressed as the maximum voluntary contraction.
Surface electrodes were attached over the VL and VMO. EMG surface electrodes were placed on
the muscle belly of the VMO, 4&#x02005;cm superior and 4&#x02005;cm medial to the supromedial border of the
patella, at approximately 55 degrees to the long axis of the femur. The VL electrode was
placed 10&#x02005;cm superior and 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;cm lateral to the superior lateral border of the patella and
orientated 15 degrees to the vertical. The subjects stood with their heels and back against
the wall, allowing their back to slide down the wall during the squat. They performed the
squat exercise to 60 degrees of knee flexion. The knee flexion angle was controlled by the
guide bar. In this study, the slow speed-targeting device was applied on the front of the
subject&#x02019;s knees. The tester provided instructions for squat exercises at three exercise
speeds. Condition 1 was the usual-speed squat exercise. Condition 2 was 70&#x02013;50% below slow
speed squat exercise for habitual speed using the slow speed targeting device. Data on the
speed used were provided by the slow speed-targeting device. This device has two display
components, which show: (1) the current velocity and (2) the broken record data for slow
velocity. Condition 3 was the super-slow speed squat exercise without use of the targeting
device. To test for differences in the VMO/VL ratio among the different squat exercise
conditions, repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to determine if the exercise
speed had a significant effect on the VMO/VL ratio. For the significant main effect,
Bonferroni&#x02019;s correction was performed to identify the specific mean differences. Differences
were defined as significant at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The VMO/VL ratio in condition 2 (1.5 &#x000b1; 0.7) was significantly higher than that in
conditions 1 and 3 (1.0 &#x000b1; 0.5, 1.1 &#x000b1; 0.8, respectively) (p &#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, a slow speed-targeting device was developed, and the effects of the slow
speed-targeting squat exercise on the VMO/VL ratio were investigated. According to the study
results, the VMO/VL ratio in condition 2 (slow speed-targeting squat exercise) was
significantly higher than that in conditions 1 (habitual speed) and 3 (super-slow speed
without use of the targeting device). A previous study reported that super-slow training is
an effective method for increasing strength in middle-aged and older adults. Although
studies on at-risk populations are yet to be performed, repetition speed should be
considered when prescribing resistance training<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, slow-speed resistance training has been shown to
effectively cause an increase in muscular strength<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Maintaining a slow movement speed in both lifting and lowering
actions may be necessary to achieve constant tension. Another study demonstrated that an
intervention program using one&#x02019;s own body weight as resistance during slow movement and
plyometric exercise can improve physical function in the elderly, even with single sets for
each exercise<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there was no
enhanced muscle hypertrophy effect. Exercise utilizing a biofeedback program is very
effective. Yoo suggests that proper selection of the push-up exercise speed may be necessary
for selective strengthening of the serratus anterior and that isokinetic biofeedback
information obtained using an accelerator can help in selective strengthening of the middle
SA<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Squat exercises are often used in
the rehabilitation of individuals with knee pathologies in the field of physical therapy.
According to these results, the super-slow speed squat exercise without targeting was not an
effective exercise for selective strengthening of the VMO. A slow speed-targeting device was
developed in this study for selective strengthening of the VMO in subjects with PFPS. This
device provides the biofeedback information for a slightly slow-speed (50&#x02013;70%) exercise.
Therefore, an effectively slow movement speed is recommended for selective strengthening of
the VMO, with the use of a slow speed-targeting device that provides biofeedback.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Escamilla</surname><given-names>RF</given-names></name><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Macleod</surname><given-names>TD</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Patellofemoral joint force and stress during the wall
