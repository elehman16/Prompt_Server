The effect of OPV0 depended on age of administration; the MRR (2-dose/1-dose MV) was 0.45 (0.29 to 0.71) for children receiving OPV0 in the first week of life, but 3.63 (0.87 to 15.2) for those receiving OPV0 after the first month of life (p=0.007, test of no interaction). Second, campaign-OPV may have reduced the difference between the randomisation groups since the MRR (2-dose/1-dose MV) was 0.60 (0.42 to 0.85) for children who had not received campaign-OPV before RCT-enrolment versus 0.72 (0.23 to 2.31) and 1.42 (0.70 to 2.90) for children who had received 1 or 2 doses of campaign-OPV-before-enrolment, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Bissau had no polio infection during this trial, so OPV0 and campaign-OPV may have NSEs since they modified the effect of 2-dose MV in an RCT.

The review concluded that BCG and MV approximately halved the mortality risk.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The studies of MV in which measles infection or measles deaths were censored in the survival analyses<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref> suggest that the effects of MV on mortality are not fully explained by the prevention of measles infection. Likewise, there was no indication that prevention of tuberculosis (TB) explained the beneficial effect of BCG vaccination.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Hence, these two vaccines may have NSEs. Several immunological studies supports that vaccines can induce non-specific or heterologous effects by inducing cross-reactive T-cells or by training of innate immunity.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Hence, we need to examine the potential NSEs of other routine vaccines than those initially reviewed by SAGE.</p><p>We have therefore examined the potential NSEs of oral polio vaccine (OPV).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> Investigations of NSEs of routine vaccines are complex because it is usually not possible to randomise children to vaccines already recommended if it means that the vaccine is withheld or delayed for some children. OPV is additionally difficult to study because it is routinely given together with DTP in three doses in the first months of life, and it is therefore nearly impossible to assess the separate effects of OPV. Hence, &#x02018;natural experiments&#x02019; where the national immunisation programme are missing vaccine or implement a new vaccine campaign are useful to assess the effect of OPV.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Vaccine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with focus on NSEs examine whether the study vaccine modifies susceptibility to unrelated infections with implications for mortality.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> If another vaccine given in both intervention groups has NSEs, it is likely to alter the difference between the randomisation groups within the RCT. A potential way to assess NSEs therefore arises if a natural experiment with a vaccine occurs during the conduct of a vaccine RCT. It is then possible to assess if the estimated effect of the RCT vaccine changes as a result of the natural experiments. If that happens, it would be evidence of NSEs of the natural experiment vaccine.</p><p>We used this approach in connection with an RCT of two doses of MV at 4.5 and 9&#x02005;months versus one dose of MV at 9&#x02005;months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016013335F1">figure 1</xref>). We experienced two natural experiments with OPV during the trial: (1) OPV at birth (OPV0) was not provided during several months; and (2) additional doses of OPV were administered in several national OPV campaigns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016013335F2">figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016013335F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Design of the two-dose versus one-dose MV randomised controlled trial.

In the first campaign, campaign-OPV (OPVc) was given to all children aged 0&#x02013;59&#x02005;months and in the second campaign OPVc was given to the same age group together with vitamin A supplementation (VAS) to children aged 6&#x02013;59&#x02005;months.

At 9&#x02005;months of age, all children were invited back to receive the standard MV recommended by the WHO. The two-dose group received EZ MV; the one-dose group had been randomised at 4.5&#x02005;months to receive either EZ or Schwarz MV at 9&#x02005;months of age. Hence, between 4.5 and 9&#x02005;months of age, the trial compared the effect on mortality of one early dose of MV versus no MV (ie, having the third doses of DTP and OPV as the most recent vaccination); between 9 and 36&#x02005;months of age, the trial compared two doses of MV versus one dose of MV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016013335F1">figure 1</xref>).

More than 80% of the children enrolled in the two-dose MV trial had previously taken part in trials<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> in which the dates of BCG and OPV vaccinations after birth were documented. OPV was missing in Guinea-Bissau for several months in 2004 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016013335F2">figure 2</xref>) and many children did therefore not receive OPV0.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Whether the children had received OPV0 or not was registered as part of these trials in which the date of BCG and OPV vaccinations was noted. We examined whether receiving OPV0 and the age at which BCG and OPV0 was given modified the effect of a two-dose versus one-dose MV in the RCT.</p><p><italic>Natural experiment II: OPV campaigns in 2004 and 2005</italic>. There were two national campaigns with trivalent OPV with 1&#x02005;month's interval in 2004 and in 2005 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016013335F2">figure 2</xref>). In both years, OPV was first provided alone, and then 1&#x02005;month later OPV was administered together with vitamin A supplementation (VAS). OPV was provided to all children between birth and 5&#x02005;years of age, whereas VAS was only administered to children who were 6&#x02005;months and older. In 2004, the campaigns took place in the end of October (OPV only) and November (OPV+VAS); in 2005, campaigns were in November (OPV only) and December (OPV+VAS).</p><p>The OPV campaigns were conducted by staff from the three health centres in the study area. They went from house to house. The nurses were accompanied by trained HDSS fieldworkers who had lists of all children in the study area generated from the HDSS database. Fieldworkers were followed by a supervisor for at least 1&#x02005;day during the 4-day long campaigns. The fieldworkers registered the presence of the children, and whether they received OPV (and VAS) on that day, or whether they had received it elsewhere.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Patient involvement</title><p>The timing of the campaigns was decided by national public health authorities. The authors decided after the campaigns had occurred to examine whether the campaigns had an impact on the RCT. Hence, guardians of patients were not involved in the planning of the study. The results will be disseminated to the general public through medical journals and specifically to the WHO, which determines global vaccination policies, and to the Ministry of Health if there is scientific evidence to support a change in policy or practice.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>We used the previously presented RCT data set to compare mortality of children randomised to two doses of MV at 4.5 and 9&#x02005;months or one dose of MV at 9&#x02005;months of age, providing mortality rate ratios (MRRs) (two-dose/one-dose MV) from 4.5&#x02005;months to 36&#x02005;months of age.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> We conducted all analyses including all 6417 children, and also conducted all analyses in the subgroup of 3402 children who had not received NVAS at birth.

Since the key point of the present analysis is to see whether the campaigns changed the effect measured in the RCT, we are not adjusting for other background factors in the main analyses.

First, the beneficial effect of early MV administered at 4.5&#x02005;months of age depended on early priming with OPV0. Second, the beneficial effect of early MV was strongest when the children had not received campaign-OPV before or after enrolment in the trial.</p><p><italic>Strengths and weaknesses</italic>: Although the present study was not a planned study, its design limited the possibility of uncontrolled confounding because all children were enrolled in the two-dose MV trial, which used the same inclusion criteria throughout. The unavailability of OPV0 and the availability of OPV campaigns were natural experiments not dependent on the health status of the children.</p><p>The mortality rate between 4.5 and 36&#x02005;months was significantly lower the earlier OPV0 (and BCG) had been given. The timing of OPV0 could have depended on the health status and the socioeconomic conditions of the child. For example, the best families or healthiest children might be delivered at the maternity ward or come first for vaccination at a health centre. Alternatively, sick and disadvantaged children may have been brought later for vaccination. However, such confounding would not explain why two doses of MV had the best effect among those vaccinated with OPV0 in the first week of life, as children from the best families presumably have the least to gain. Furthermore, we found in an RCT of OPV0 that the effect was considerably stronger when the OPV0 had been given within the first 2&#x02005;days of life.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The observation therefore suggests that OPV0 primes the immune system in ways which are subsequently enhanced by early MV at 4&#x02013;5&#x02005;months of age.</p><p>It should be noted, however, that the period during 2004 with missing OPV0 has previously produced the unexpected result that male infant mortality was lower in neonates who had not received OPV0 than in neonates who had received OPV0.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This finding was contradicted in a subsequent RCT.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The unexpected result may have been due partly to the 2004-OPV campaigns coming just after the period with missing OPV0, which lowered the general mortality rate and had a particularly beneficial effect for males (submitted).</p><p>The main potential confounding factor for the effect of campaign-OPV would be a change in mortality rate coinciding with the timing of the OPV campaigns. However, adjustment for calendar time had no impact on the estimates. The study had limited power to analyse the interactions between trial randomisation and the many combinations of campaign-OPV before and after enrolment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016013335TB2">tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016013335TB3">3</xref>).</p><p><italic>Single intervention paradigm</italic>: In the current epidemiology culture, an RCT measures the effect of an intervention in a controlled situation, that is, other interventions are not tested at the same time. Hence, the effect measured in the RCT is believed to be the &#x02018;true&#x02019; effect. If the intervention becomes policy, it will be assumed in future modelling of programme impact that this &#x02018;true&#x02019; effect will continue. For example, high-dose VAS was tested in eight trials in the 1980s and early 1990s and found to reduce mortality by 23&#x02013;30% in two meta-analyses. This effect is still assumed to exist,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> even though the only two recent trials contradict the assumption.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> There are similar conflicting stories for other interventions including neonatal vitamin A (NVAS)<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and MV.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>There are probably several causes of these conflicting stories, but a main reason is the disease-specific perspective underlying preventive global childcare programmes. It is usually assumed that interventions have only one specific effect on the immune system preventing a specific disease or deficiency. However, a growing number of studies show that interventions may have much wider effects by reprogramming the immune system to enhanced protection or susceptibility to unrelated infections.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> From this perspective, the &#x02018;true&#x02019; effect of an intervention is the measured reduction in overall mortality/morbidity under a certain set of specified conditions in relation to other interventions affecting mortality. For example, the optimal effect of early MV at 4.5&#x02005;months of age was obtained when children were primed with OPV0 (and BCG) in the first weeks of life (this study), did not receive NVAS,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> did not receive campaign-OPV before (this study), did not receive DTP after early MV<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and did receive MV in the presence of maternal antibodies.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> When altering these conditions, and other potential priming conditions that we do not know about yet, the &#x02018;true&#x02019; effect is no longer observed. However, departures from the expected effects may be a fruitful instrument for accumulating new knowledge about the limits or conditions under which an intervention will work or have deleterious effects.</p><p><italic>Consistency or contradiction with previous observations</italic>: Our finding that OPV has NSEs is supported in the literature. Earlier studies from the 1960s when OPV was developed reported that OPV reduced diarrhoeal mortality in Chile and Brazil and Russian researchers claimed more general effects on health including reducing respiratory infection from stimulation with non-pathogenic enterovirus including OPV.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref> These observations<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> were not pursued outside the Soviet Union.</p><p>When the first OPV campaigns were implemented in Guinea-Bissau in 1998, we examined the effect on child survival of having participated versus not having participated in the campaign.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> OPV apparently had a beneficial effect for the youngest children &#x0003c;6&#x02005;months of age; for older children, it was difficult to determine a separate effect due to the strongly beneficial effect of MV. We have also found in a natural experiment, when DTP was missing, that the case fatality at the hospital was much lower for children who had received OPV only and not OPV+DTP as currently recommended.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>We have also conducted two RCTs of OPV0 in Bissau; in one trial, OPV0 was compared with neonatal VAS among low birthweight boys who normally do not receive BCG at birth, and in another RCT BCG+OPV0 was compared with BCG only among normal birthweight children. OPV0 was associated with 32% lower infant mortality in both trials, an effect which was statistically significant in the larger trial among normal birthweight children.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Studies from high income countries have likewise suggested that OPV may have beneficial NSEs. In Finland, children who received OPV in a trial had fewer episodes of otitis media at age 6&#x02013;18&#x02005;months than control children who received inactivated polio vaccine (IPV).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In a nationwide study in Denmark, the routine OPV which used to be given at 2&#x02005;years of age (until 2001) was associated with a 15% (5&#x02013;23%) reduction in the risk of hospital admissions compared with children who had acellular DTP, Haemophilus influenzae type b and inactivated polio vaccine (DTaP-Hib-IPV) as their most recent vaccination, most of the effect coming from prevention of admissions for lower respiratory infections.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The effect of OPV was similar to the effect of MMR.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In Denmark, a second and third dose of OPV was recommended at 3 and 4&#x02005;years of age. These additional doses were associated with significant reductions in admissions.</p><p><italic>Interpretation</italic>: OPV produced different NSEs in this study and we have tried to summarise these in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016013335TB4">table 4</xref>.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;31</xref> Apparently, OPV given early in life provided priming which subsequently enhanced the beneficial effects of early MV. In our RCT of OPV0+BCG versus BCG only, the effect on infant mortality was particularly strong when OPV0 was given in the first days of life.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Studies of BCG have likewise indicated that the beneficial effect is particularly good when administered early.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Although the effect in the present analysis is different since it is generated by a subsequent early MV, it does suggest that OPV0 is capable of inducing strong immune training. It is known that other live vaccines may induce an immune training effect which reduces susceptibility to unrelated infections. For example, BCG reprogrammes monocytes through epigenetic changes to a more proinflammatory response; in animal models, this response reduces mortality from challenge to unrelated infections.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> It would be indicated to conduct similar studies for OPV.</p><p>We have found in several studies that subsequent boosting with a live vaccine with a beneficial effect enhanced the beneficial effect. The present analysis suggests that different live vaccines with beneficial effects may interact with each other.

<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> so maybe the vaccines boost similar responses.</p><p>Although OPV0 and OPV campaigns may have lowered mortality, campaign-OPV given before and after administration of early MV at 4.5&#x02005;months of age may have increased mortality in the early two-dose MV group, at least relative to the one-dose MV group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016013335TB3">table 3</xref>). We have had a similar experience of negative interaction between interventions with NVAS which neutralised the beneficial effect of early two-dose MV (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016013335TB4">table 4</xref>).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Children who received the two-dose regime and no NVAS had a 50% reduction in mortality between 4.5 and 36&#x02005;months. However, if they had been randomised to receive NVAS, there was no effect from receiving MV at 4.5&#x02005;months. NVAS apparently reduced mortality in the one-dose group and increased it in the two-dose group. This appears to be parallel to what happened to children who received campaign-OPV both before and after enrolment in the present trial.

Hence, it is a challenge to explain why additional doses of OPV before enrolment should affect the immune system and result in a modification of the response to early MV. It is an additional challenge that it seemingly makes a difference whether this additional dose is given at birth as OPV0 (which primes for a beneficial response to early MV) or campaign-OPV (which primes for a negative response to early MV). One speculation could be that OPV has different NSEs depending on the age and the type of vaccine it is given with: OPV0 was often given at birth, into the sterile gut, where it may affect the microbiome, and it was given with BCG. Campaign-OPV-before-enrolment, on the other hand, was given alone, and campaign-OPV seems to be beneficial in its own right (A Andersen, <italic>et al.</italic> National immunisation campaigns with OPV reduce all-cause mortality: a natural experiment within seven randomised trials. (In review)). Campaign-OPV-after-enrolment was often given with VAS and may have had yet other NSEs.</p><p><italic>Implications</italic>: An increasing number of studies suggest that OPV may be associated with beneficial NSEs. With the beneficial NSEs of OPV0 and of campaign-OPV for children who received the currently recommended vaccination schedule, it is possible that the repeated campaigns with OPV have been a driving force in the decline towards Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG4) which has been going on in the past 15&#x02013;20&#x02005;years (A Andersen, et al. National immunisation campaigns with OPV reduce all-cause mortality: a natural experiment within seven randomised trials. (In review)). This needs to be explored now before OPV is stopped, phased out or replaced by IPV. We have previously documented that IPV was associated with significantly higher female than male mortality in randomised trials in which IPV was given as a comparator vaccine.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Hence, stopping OPV campaigns or replacing OPV with IPV could lead to changes in mortality level.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> During the period we are studying here, it was triple OPV which was given in the campaigns. This vaccine was discontinued in April 2016 to be replaced by bivalent OPV. Subsequent analyses have shown no significant differences in their beneficial effects (A Andersen, et al. National immunisation campaigns with OPV reduce all-cause mortality: a natural experiment within seven randomised trials. (In review)).</p><p>This study also suggests that campaign-OPV-before-enrolment interfered with the otherwise beneficial effect of early MV. This negative interaction could potentially be important in the situations where early MV is recommended, for example to children with HIV infection who should receive a first dose of MV already at 6&#x02005;months of age.</p><p>Many interventions which have been recommended based on RCTs showing a beneficial effect on children survival, for example, VAS, have turned out to present different effects in subsequent RCTs. Campaigns with OPV, MV, VAS or NVAS may be behind the situations in which effects change. This phenomenon of interactions between interventions with an early priming effect on the immune system needs to be understood better to be able to predict whether new interventions will have beneficial or deleterious effects on overall health. It is worth emphasising that among children who received OPV0 and BCG in the first weeks of life, received no NVAS, received no campaign-OPV and received no DTP after MV, early MV was associated with 85% (53% to 96%) reduction in mortality between 4.5 and 36&#x02005;months of age (data not shown). This effect was not in relation to unvaccinated control children but compared with the current strategy of one dose of MV at 9&#x02005;months of age. Hence, we might be able to do much more to reduce mortality if we fully understood early immune training and used this knowledge.</p><p>The specific disease perspective in global public health has generated the idea that once we have eradicated a disease, we can remove the preventive intervention and save resources. To the extent interventions have beneficial immune training effects, this may be a disastrous misunderstanding. Since both polio and measles are targeted for eradication within the next 10&#x02013;20&#x02005;years, there are good reasons to further explore the beneficial NSEs of OPV and MV and possibly be able to induce them in other ways.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> PA and CSB planned the analysis.
