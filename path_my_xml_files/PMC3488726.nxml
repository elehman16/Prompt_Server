Hospital-at-home aims to avoid admission, or reduce length of stay (early assisted discharge schemes).

Therefore we designed an early assisted discharge hospital-at-home scheme for COPD exacerbations, mainly operated by generic community nurses who performed the home visits.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> Main objective of the GO AHEAD study (GO AHEAD is the acronym for Assessment Of Going Home under Early Assisted Discharge) was to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of early assisted discharge followed by community-based nursing care at home. In addition, evaluation of patient satisfaction and preferences, carer strain and preferences and an evaluation among professional care providers were performed. The focus of this paper is on the effectiveness of early assisted discharge, with the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) as the primary outcome measure. In addition, treatment failures, readmissions, mortality and generic quality of life were assessed as secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>GO AHEAD was a randomised controlled trial comparing usual hospital care with early assisted discharge for COPD exacerbations. Five hospitals and three home care organisations participated. Treatment consisted of 7&#x02005;days in-hospital care as usual or 3&#x02005;days in-hospital treatment followed by 4&#x02005;days care at home. Patients were followed until 3&#x02005;months after randomisation.</p><p>All patients admitted to one of the participating hospitals with a COPD exacerbation, as diagnosed by the reviewing physician, were screened for potential eligibility on their first day of admission according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012001684TB1">table 1</xref>). On day 3 of admission, clinical stability was assessed in patients who gave written informed consent (see randomisation criteria in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012001684TB1">table 1</xref>). For each hospital separately, participating patients were randomised on day 3 of admission, in a 1:1 ratio using a block-size of 6. Randomisation was performed by the study nurses. The randomisation sequence was computer generated a priori by an independent researcher. Allocation sequence was placed in sealed envelopes. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Catharina Hospital, the Netherlands, approval number M07-1755.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2012001684TB1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria (applied at admission) and randomisation criteria (applied at day 3 of admission)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Inclusion criteria (checked on day 1)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exclusion criteria (checked on day 1)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age &#x02265;40&#x02005;years</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Major uncontrolled co morbidity, including pneumonia that is prominent, heart failure that is prominent or acute changes on ECG and (suspected) underlying malignancy</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Competent to give informed consent</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mental disability, including dementia, impaired level of consciousness and acute confusion</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diagnosed with COPD.

Exacerbation symptoms were scored each day. Physiotherapists visited all patients for instruction of breathing and coughing techniques. On the fourth day of admission all randomised patients switched to oral medication and metered-dosed inhalations. Patients randomised to early assisted discharge were discharged home on the fourth day of admission and further treated at home. Community nurses visited or contacted the patient at least once daily on the day of discharge and the three consecutive days. They continued to score exacerbation symptoms and provided reassurance and counselling. Furthermore, medication compliance and inhalation techniques were addressed. Community nurses had the highest levels of generic nursing training in the Netherlands. No additional training was provided for the trial. The nurses could contact the hospital to discuss the patient's condition. If necessary, patients were readmitted to the hospital. For patients a 24&#x02005;h telephone access to the hospital respiratory ward was installed for emergencies.</p><p>Patients in the usual hospital care group received care as usual at the discretion of the hospital staff. General practitioners were informed about the patient's participation in the trial and the discharge date. Clinical responsibility during home care remained with the respiratory physician. A detailed description of the research protocol and the early assisted discharge intervention has been published previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></p><p>Primary outcome was the change in CCQ scores between baseline (T0=day 3 of admission) and the end of the supervised treatment (T+4&#x02005;days). The CCQ is a disease-specific questionnaire measuring health status.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> It consists of 10 questions in three domains: symptoms, functional state and mental state, resulting in an overall, continuous score varying from 6 (worst score) to 0 (best score).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> In order to produce a valid overall score, three, three and two questions on the symptoms domain, functional state and mental state domain, respectively, need to be answered. The CCQ has proved to be responsive to change. The minimal clinical important difference is 0.4.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> Secondary outcomes were: (1) change in CCQ scores between baseline and 3&#x02005;months after randomisation (T+90&#x02005;days); (2) number of treatment failures (ie, either death or clinical deterioration leading to prolonged hospital stay beyond the standardised 7&#x02005;days (usual hospital care) or death or readmission during the 4&#x02005;days treatment at home (early discharge)); (3) mortality; (4) readmissions during the 3&#x02005;month follow-up and (5) generic health-related quality of life measured by the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> at baseline, T+4&#x02005;days and T+90&#x02005;days.

An unstructured covariance matrix for the residuals of the different measurements was used. Backward selection of covariates was applied. In addition to time (ie, measurement at T+4&#x02005;days, end of treatment and T+90&#x02005;days, end of follow-up), the interaction of time and treatment, the following variables were tested: baseline CCQ or EQ-5D score, treatment centre, age, gender, comorbidity,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> smoking status, living situation, availability informal caregiver, presence of home care prior to admission, course of oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics prior to admission. Variables were retained in the model if their exclusion led to a 10% change in the estimated treatment effect.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> For the analysis of CCQ scores, only baseline score was included in the final model. For the analysis of EQ-5D scores, baseline score, comorbidity and gender were included. Results are presented as mean differences in change and 95% CI. Numbers of patients with treatment failures, readmissions and mortality were analysed using multiple logistic regression analysis. Numbers of readmissions per patient in each group were analysed in a Poisson regression. Time to readmission was analysed with a Cox proportional hazards model. Results are presented as OR or HR with 95% CI. Again, backward selection was used to select covariates. Only baseline CCQ score was retained in the models. The significance level for a difference between treatment groups was set at p&#x02264;0.05.

The total dropout over the study period was 16%, 25% in the usual hospital care group and 10% in the early assisted discharge group. Baseline CCQ scores of patients dropping out were not different from those who completed the study, but they did have more comorbidities. At T+4&#x02005;days 118 of 129 still participating patients produced a valid overall score on the CCQ and were included in the analysis. The other patients did not withdraw consent and continued to participate in the study in order to contribute to the other analyses and to produce a valid score at other measuring points.

In addition, this is the first evaluation of early discharge for this disease in the Dutch healthcare system. While patients&#x02019; disease-specific health status as expressed in the mean CCQ score after7&#x02005;days treatment tended to be somewhat better in the usual hospital care group, the difference was small, not clinically relevant and not statistically significant. After 3&#x02005;months, the difference had disappeared. The same pattern was found in generic health-related quality of life measured with the EQ-5D, although this difference was statistically significant at the end of the supervised treatment. The difference had disappeared at the end of the 3-month follow-up period. There was no difference in treatment failures, readmissions or mortality.</p><p>These study results confirm previously published positive results by Davison <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> and Nicholson <italic>et al</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> but these two studies were either not randomised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> or included a small number of patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> We found no significant difference in CCQ scores, which corresponds with the findings of Davies <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> and Hernandez <italic>et al</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> who found no differences in disease-specific quality of life measured with the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire.

We found a significant difference between the two groups, in favour of usual hospital care, at the end of the hospital and home treatment. This difference had disappeared after 3&#x02005;months. The utility scores are in line with O'Reilly <italic>et al</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> but they found much worse scores at admission than in our study, probably because we did not include patients with more severe exacerbations. Utility and CCQ scores in both groups follow the same pattern. The greater improvement in CCQ and EQ-5D scores of the usual hospital care group at the end of the hospital treatment in comparison with the early discharge group may reflect a true difference in recovery, in which case usual hospital care is the preferred treatment. However, an alternative explanation could be that patients who were discharged early were confronted with their symptoms and limitations earlier and more intensely when they tried to pick up normal life at home. Furthermore, some patients have difficulties viewing hospital care followed by early discharge as one treatment period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> Expecting to be in a certain state at discharge, and experiencing this is not the case, might be expressed in worse scores on the CCQ and the EQ-5D.</p><p>In our trial multiple hospitals participated with different socioeconomic and geographic characteristics, which make it likely that our sample is representative of eligible patients. The percentage of admissions initially considered to be eligible for early discharge at admission was similar to that of previous studies (&#x000b1;37%). Early discharge is possible when the exacerbation is the main problem and comorbidities are (relatively) stable. The percentage of patients living alone suggests that this is not an absolute reason for exclusion, provided that patients have a sufficiently functioning social support system. Still, 25% of screened patients were considered ineligible, because of living in a nursing home, overburden of informal caregiver(s) or living alone with insufficient social support. This suggests that social environment is an important factor when deciding for admission and (early) discharge. Finally, 37% of screened patients were ineligible because of comorbidities.</p><p>Considering the very low number of treatment failures in the early discharge group it might be possible to relax the inclusion criteria and randomisation criteria. In our trial, criteria were applied very strictly for safety reasons, but more patients with comorbidities might be eligible in daily practice. Furthermore, the strict review and exclusion of patients at day 1 of admission (eg, those treated with NIV), precluded patients from early discharge even if they had become eligible at day 3 of admission. Therefore, review of eligibility for early discharge should be performed after a few days of hospital treatment. Thirty per cent of patients who consented to participate were not randomised because they showed insufficient recovery and/or were depending on oxygen supply. Unlike in the British hospital-at-home schemes, patients were not sent home with nebulisers or oxygen cylinders, unless these were already part of their treatment. Extension of the treatment possibilities at home may enable early discharge of patient with more severe disease. However, it would also require more expertise of the nursing staff supervising patients at home, which might currently not be present in community-based home care organisations. Future research should focus on determining which treatments can be safely provided at home, which treatments require the supervision of generic or specialised nurses and which criteria should be applied for selecting eligible patients. In addition, a direct comparison between early discharge with generic and early discharge with specialised nursing care would provide more information on which scheme&#x000a0;is most safe and effective.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. First, in total 139 patients were randomised, where a number of 165 was calculated to be needed to detect a difference of 0.4 in CCQ change scores between the two groups. A post hoc power analysis with these 139 patients and the actual variances in CCQ scores showed that the power to detect a difference in change from baseline of 0.4 between the groups was 73% instead of 80%, which was aimed for. We believe that this slight reduction in power does not have a substantial influence on our final results, because the difference between the groups was only 0.29. It is highly unlikely that this difference would have increased to the clinically relevant difference of 0.4 with an additional 26 patients. In previous randomised studies of early discharge in patients diagnosed with COPD numbers varied between 25 and 222, and only 15&#x02013;35% of admitted patients was randomised.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9 R10 R11 R12">9&#x02013;12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> Second, our study was not an equivalence trial, which would determine best whether hospital care and early discharge care are equally effective. However, in order to demonstrate equal effectiveness with CCQ score, over 500 patients would have been needed, which is beyond what is attainable in this population. Third, 16% of patients dropped out after randomisation. However, comparison of patients who dropped out with patients who completed the study only revealed more comorbidities for those who dropped out. CCQ scores were not different. Fourth, although our variable selection for the analyses is justifiable, treatment centre could also be considered as an important covariate in the analyses, based on the randomisation design of the study. However, adding treatment centre as additional fixed factor to the analyses did not result in different outcomes in any of the analyses. It was therefore omitted and the analyses remained unchanged. Finally, due to the nature of the intervention, patients and healthcare staff could not be blinded to the allocated group.</p><p>In conclusion, we found no significant short-term or long-term differences in outcomes between early discharge and usual hospital care, except for generic health-related quality of life at the end of treatment (T+4&#x02005;days). Early assisted discharge with home visits by community nurses can reduce length of hospital stay for a selected group of patients admitted with a COPD exacerbation and is an alternative to usual hospital care. The decision to implement early assisted discharge with community nursing does not only depend on the results of the effectiveness analysis. Costs and cost-effectiveness evaluations are of high importance as well. An economic evaluation is currently being performed and results will be published separately.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d34e193" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001684.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e195" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001684.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank all care professionals from the participating hospitals and home care organisations that made the trial and early assisted discharge possible: W van Litsenburg (Catharina-hospital), A Janssen (Catharina-hospital), W Seezink (Atrium Medical Centre), B van de Pas (M&#x000e1;xima Medical Centre), A van der Pouw (Rijnstate Hospital) and P de Laat (TweeSteden Hospital) who performed patient recruitment; R Eijsermans who coordinated the home care visits in the Tilburg region; D DeMunck (M&#x000e1;xima Medical Centre), J Retera (TweeSteden Hospital) and P de Bruijn (Rijnstate Hospital) who were responsible pulmonologists in the participating hospitals.
