There are an estimated 670&#x02005;000 people in the UK acting as primary family carers for people with dementia, saving the state &#x000a3;8 billion/year.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Dementia carers show high levels of psychological distress, including depression and anxiety.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This increases the risk of care home admission for the person with dementia.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Varying interventions have been proposed to support dementia carers, but few are evidence based. Cognitive behavioural therapy reduces carer burden and depression,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> but it is usually delivered by clinical psychologists who remain a relatively limited resource because they are highly trained and, as a corollary, more expensive. The UK national strategy for improving access to psychological therapies is a stepped care approach, where graduates supervised by clinical psychologists deliver less intensive therapy, allowing clinical psychologists to offer more high intensity interventions to those with more complex needs.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>The <italic>Coping with Caregiving</italic> complex psychological intervention was developed in the USA for groups of family carers. It reduced carer depression and anger and improved self-efficacy.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> We adapted the programme for delivery within the UK National Health Service and evaluated it in the START (STrAtegies for RelaTives) study, a pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT). Affective symptoms and case-level depression decreased and quality of life increased in carers receiving the intervention compared to those receiving treatment as usual over an 8-month follow-up period<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and was cost-effective.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Complex interventions comprise numerous components, which may be independent or interdependent, and the &#x02018;active ingredient&#x02019; is usually hard to determine.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Finding out why multicomponent interventions work is important for implementation and might enable the intervention to be refined, tailored for specific groups or reduced in length with associated economic benefits. Researchers have sought to understand mechanisms of action of psychological therapies through exploration of mediators and moderators, such as self-efficacy and coping.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This is useful but, in addition, participants often have views on which aspects of an intervention were valuable and asking them about this directly, as part of the trial process evaluation, has proved useful in diverse interventions. These have included breast-feeding support interventions,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> CBT self-management of IBS<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and maintaining healthy behaviour change.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>This approach has not, to the best of our knowledge, been used previously to evaluate complex interventions for dementia carers. We qualitatively analysed dementia carers&#x02019; experiences of taking part in START, a complex intervention. We aimed to explore which aspects of the therapy carers found helpful and unhelpful; carers&#x02019; perspectives on the stage of the illness at which the programme should be delivered and how the intervention could be developed to better meet their needs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Setting and intervention</title><p>The START study was a pragmatic multicentre RCT evaluating the effect on dementia carers&#x02019; affective symptoms of eight 1&#x02005;h sessions of a manual-based coping intervention compared to usual treatment. The study protocol has been detailed elsewhere.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The intervention was delivered by psychology graduates without clinical qualifications as a face-to-face, individual intervention at a location chosen by the carer, usually their home. The sessions consisted of psychoeducation about dementia, carer stress and access to emotional support; exploration of behaviours or situations that the carer found difficult and potential management strategies; challenging unhelpful thoughts; relaxation techniques accompanied by CDs of relaxation exercises; communication skills; planning pleasurable activities; future planning and maintaining skills learnt. The carers were also given homework to complete and a manual of the intervention in which to record their work. The participants kept the CD and manual to allow their continued use.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Consenting participants were included in the main START trial if they identified themselves as the primary family carer of a patient diagnosed with dementia who provided support at least weekly to their relative, who was not living in 24&#x02005;h care and referred to one of four different settings (three mental health services and a tertiary neurological service for dementia).</p><p>In total, 260 carers were randomised, of whom 173 participants were in the intervention group, allocated with a ratio of 2:1 (intervention:treatment as usual) to allow for potential therapist clustering effects in the trial intervention arm. Over the 24-month follow-up period, 41 carers from the intervention group withdrew or were lost to follow-up. We invited the remaining 132 participants to take part in this qualitative substudy.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data collection and procedure</title><p>At the 24-month follow-up interview, researchers gave participants a questionnaire, a covering letter and a stamped envelope addressed to the trial manager (rather than the researcher with whom they had previously had contact).</p><p>The questionnaire was developed with the carers on the trial management and steering committees and consisted of a self-completed questionnaire comprising the following questions:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Was there anything that you found particularly helpful?</p></list-item><list-item><p>How have you used the intervention (support sessions, manual or CD) since it ended?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Is there anything you would do differently?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Is there anything you would add in?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Looking back, do you feel that you took part in the intervention at the right time?</p></list-item></list></p><p>We subsequently sent all participants a transcript of their original response along with a freepost envelope, asking them whether it was representative of their true views and to make amendments if they wished. This method of quality control and validation allows participants to ensure that the transcript is what they intended to say. We also sent questionnaires to the participants who had previously withdrawn from the study asking the following questions:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>What did you think of the support sessions and manual?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Whether you did or did not attend the support sessions, was there anything we should change to make it more useful to you?</p></list-item></list></p><p>We evaluated questionnaire responses alongside sociodemographic and clinical data, including time since diagnosis of dementia, carers&#x02019; anxiety and depression&#x02014;measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> a self-rated scale which has been validated for use in a variety of settings&#x02014;and the severity of patients&#x02019; dementia&#x02014;measured by the clinical dementia rating (CDR),<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> which grades the level of impairment related to dementia. These quantitative data were collected at baseline and at 24&#x02005;months in the original study.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Analysis</title><p>We transcribed the returned questionnaires verbatim and used a thematic framework approach<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> for analysis. Two researchers (AS and MM) independently read the transcripts and identified a framework of initial themes which referred to the main study objectives. The researchers then used the qualitative software package NVivo (QSR International Pty Ltd, V.9, 2010) to code the transcripts according to these themes and jointly developed a thematic map with a hierarchy of themes and categories. We have anonymised all quotations, providing non-specific demographic information, and do not think that any carer could be identified.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Demographics</title><p>We received completed questionnaires from 75 participants (57% of the 132 participants at 24&#x02005;months); 17 of these questionnaires were completed during the research interview with the researcher, who had never been the carer's therapist and the remaining questionnaires were sent by post to our research team. <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2014005273TB1">Tables&#x000a0;1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2014005273TB2">2</xref> detail the baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants who received the START intervention and who did and did not complete our questionnaire. Those who did complete the questionnaire covered the demographic and clinical characteristics of the whole group, although spouses or partners of patients were under-represented, and children of people with dementia over-represented; related to this, the mean age of responders was slightly lower in those completing questionnaires and we had fewer responses from retired people and those living with the patient. Comparison using appropriate statistical analysis demonstrates that the lower age of the questionnaire respondents was statistically significant (p=0.03), but the differences in other demographic or clinical characteristics were not statistically significant.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2014005273TB1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Baseline carer characteristics of questionnaire respondents and non-respondents</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char=" " span="1"/><col align="char" char=" " span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Respondents (n=75) mean (SD)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non-respondents (n=98) mean (SD)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.3 (13.7);

We asked carers about their experiences of the therapy 2&#x02005;years after the 8&#x02013;12-week therapy began, so we were able to explore how it worked immediately and whether benefits were noted some time later.</p><p>Our main finding is that the study participants valued diverse components of the intervention. The most frequently cited aspects were relaxation techniques, education about dementia, interaction with the therapist, cognitive techniques for their own thoughts and feelings, specific strategies for behavioural management and communication techniques for the person with dementia as well as learning to seek and ask for help. Most said that they continued to use techniques at 2-year follow-up.</p><p>The heterogeneity of responses suggests that there were no particular aspects that were commonly unnecessary or unhelpful, and that a benefit of the multicomponent nature of this therapy is that it provides a diverse menu of strategies to suit the differing circumstances of dementia carers&#x02014;in terms of the relative's particular symptoms of dementia; carer knowledge; social situation and support from mental health and social services; preferences and coping strategies.</p><p>The HADS scores for each quoted participant allow speculation regarding the impact of their anxiety and depression levels on their mental state at the time of both the intervention and providing this feedback, which is instructive in some cases. However, they are used in illustrative quotes of participants, and cannot be assumed to represent other participants holding a similar view of the intervention.</p><p>Some of the responses demonstrate that participants had incorrectly interpreted the intervention's messages&#x02014;for example, that teaching people with dementia about their condition &#x02018;might help with their self-control&#x02019; or that one should &#x02018;go along with whatever the Alzheimer's sufferer says&#x02019; (the message was to avoid criticism)&#x02014;reflecting the subjective experience of psychological interventions, but the overall effect of the intervention was nonetheless positive. While some HADS scores went up, for example, the first quote from &#x02018;w1&#x02019;, she continued to use the relaxation techniques and felt this was beneficial; it may be that she would have felt worse without the intervention.</p><p>Suggestions about how to improve the intervention focused on form rather than content&#x02014;for example, shorter or more numerous sessions, with several carers suggesting a longer period of intervention with a reduced frequency of sessions. These participants may have been experiencing a higher level of psychological distress, in which case additional sessions for those who are most distressed at the end of therapy would be in line with the stepped care approach to access to psychological therapies. Alternatively, they may have benefited most and so were reluctant to stop.</p><p>Family carers have previously reported that receiving information over a longer period helps when making decisions about care,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref> and respondents welcomed the gradual accumulation of knowledge about dementia. Others made suggestions about broadening session attendance to include other family members or the person with dementia. While including more family members could reduce the individual feeling of therapist attention, it could broaden the impact of the intervention, and family interventions have been found to be effective in other studies.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Perhaps the diverse content helped the START intervention to support carers with a broad range of needs, and a flexible approach to its delivery, in terms of who is present in sessions and how they are scheduled, could assist implementation.</p><p>The contact with a professional was welcomed by many participants, who valued the empathetic approach, knowledge and interpersonal skills of the therapists. We know, from an analysis of the effect of clustering by therapists, that the clinical effectiveness of the therapy was not dependent on which therapist delivered the intervention,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> so this suggests that supervised psychology graduates can deliver this therapy while maintaining a personal approach. Some carers cited a cognitive therapeutic approach as helpful and this supports research findings that cognitive reframing may be an effective aspect of individualised multicomponent interventions.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, our qualitative analysis of participants&#x02019; experience of a clinically effective and cost-effective psychosocial intervention aimed at improving the mental health of dementia carers is the first study of this type. In order to maximise the validity of our findings, we aimed for and succeeded in gaining a maximum variation sample of people who completed the intervention; the participants in our study covered the spectrum of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of a broader group of individuals who received the intervention. However, the questionnaire respondents, compared to those who did not respond, were statistically significantly younger and tended to be children rather than spouses of people with dementia, less likely to be married, more likely to be in employment rather than retired and less likely to be living with the person with dementia.</p><p>In addition to this, the respondents had reached a higher educational level than non-respondents. It may be that participants with lower literacy attainment would have had more difficulties in filling in the questionnaire. The written format also meant that we could not probe participants&#x02019; answers. For example, 18 participants specified that they appreciated receiving information about dementia, but we do not know the opinion of the remaining 57 participants about this. Using self-completed questionnaires, however, had the strength that the participants were free to express their views. The lack of changes after we offered participants a chance to revise their transcripts also suggests this. It also supports the idea that the START intervention had a long-lasting and consistent effect on participants: the initial questionnaire responses providing a snapshot of the participants&#x02019; views but these remaining constant.</p><p>There is probably some response bias, with those who valued and benefited from the therapy most or least and had the strongest feelings being more likely to respond. As we did not receive any responses from participants whose relative had severe dementia at the beginning of the intervention, we cannot make assumptions about the experience of the intervention for this group. Nonetheless, many of the respondents cared for people who progressed to severe dementia or died, so delivering the intervention early may mean that it continues to confer benefit as dementia deteriorates. We have been unable to obtain views from most carers who withdrew from the study, which would suggest that we probably undersampled those who disliked the intervention or found it unacceptable. Nonetheless, a minority of respondents did criticise the therapy, suggesting that our strategies to minimise social desirability bias were successful.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Clinical implications and future research</title><p>This analysis indicates aspects of the START intervention which were helpful and suggests some possible reasons for lasting clinical efficacy.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Participants took part in a structured and guided intervention and their comments indicated a range of opinions about which parts were helpful. It seems that, although some individuals did not like components of the intervention, most were able to identify helpful aspects and that, by working with graduate psychologists over a period of time, they made some longer term changes. Supporting the structured sessions with a manual and CD-based intervention was valuable for the two-thirds of participants who continued to use them 2&#x02005;years later, and participants commented that they also felt more capable of seeking help for future changing circumstances.</p><p>Our analysis has implications for when it is best to offer the intervention to carers in order to maximise engagement and potential benefit. Responses suggest that most carers want the intervention to be delivered shortly after they had been told of a dementia diagnosis; this allows future social care planning and psychological preparation for the developing illness. Some carers for people with very mild dementia would have preferred to wait a few months following diagnosis. In clinical practice, having flexibility in terms of when people are offered the START intervention could increase the acceptability of the intervention.</p><p>Overall, we found that two-thirds of carers reported continued use of the intervention after 2&#x02005;years. This indicates a possible mechanism for continuing efficacy after the end of the intervention. Retaining a copy of the manual and CD provides an opportunity to revisit valued aspects of the therapy and adapt caring approaches to current challenges, while signposting to relevant voluntary organisations has been shown to be helpful<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and empowered the participants in our study to seek help elsewhere, providing help as circumstances changed. Our findings are in line with others that multicomponent interventions are necessary in complex conditions with multiple domain pathology and that a single active ingredient may be illusory.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
