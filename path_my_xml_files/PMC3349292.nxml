Lu AA21004 is a novel antidepressant that is a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor antagonist, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor agonist, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptor partial agonist and inhibitor of the 5-HT transporter in recombinant cell lines. In this 6-wk, multi-site study, 429 patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to 5 or 10 mg Lu AA21004, placebo or 225 mg venlafaxine XR. All patients had a baseline Montgomery&#x02013;&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score &#x02a7e;30. The primary efficacy analysis was based on the MADRS total score adjusting for multiplicity using a hierarchical testing procedure starting with the highest dose <italic>vs.</italic> placebo. Lu AA21004 was statistically significantly superior to placebo (<italic>n</italic>=105) in mean change from baseline in MADRS total score at week 6 (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001, last observation carried forward), with a mean treatment difference <italic>vs.</italic> placebo of 5.9 (5 mg, <italic>n</italic>=108), and 5.7 (10 mg, <italic>n</italic>=100) points. Venlafaxine XR (<italic>n</italic>=112) was also significantly superior to placebo at week 6 (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). In total, 30 patients withdrew due to adverse events (AEs) &#x02013; placebo: four (4%); 5 mg Lu AA21004: three (3%); 10 mg Lu AA21004: seven (7%); and venlafaxine: 16 (14%). The most common AEs were nausea, headache, hyperhidrosis, and dry mouth. No clinically relevant changes over time were seen in the clinical laboratory results, vital signs, weight, or ECG parameters. In this study, treatment with 5 mg and 10 mg Lu AA21004 for 6 wk was efficacious and well tolerated in patients with MDD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type=""><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Lu AA21004</kwd><kwd>MADRS</kwd><kwd>serotonin receptor affinity</kwd><kwd>venlafaxine</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lu AA21004 (1-[2-(2,4-dimethyl-phenylsulfanyl)-phenyl]-piperazine) is a novel compound under development as an antidepressant (Bang-Andersen <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref006">2011</xref>) with affinity for the human 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub> and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors and the 5-HT transporter (SERT) (Moore <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref022">2008</xref>). Based on preclinical data, these affinities are considered to be of clinical relevance and involved in the mechanism of action at therapeutic doses. <italic>In vivo</italic>, Lu AA21004 increases the extracellular levels of serotonin (5-HT), noradrenaline, dopamine, acetylcholine and histamine in rat prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (Moore <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref022">2008</xref>).</p><p>Lu AA21004 is extensively metabolized in the liver and at least five cytochrome P450 isoenzymes appear to be involved. The metabolism of Lu AA21004 to its major metabolite (pharmacologically inactive) is mediated primarily by CYP2D6. In addition, Lu AA21004 does not seem to be a clinically relevant inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The terminal elimination half-life after multiple doses is estimated at ~60&#x02013;70 h. The exposure (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and area under curve) increased linearly with dose (2.5&#x02013;60 mg). The absorption of Lu AA21004 is independent of food intake (Wang <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref028">2009</xref>) and maximum plasma concentrations are reached 3&#x02013;16 h after dosing. The rationale for choosing the Lu AA21004 doses (5 and 10 mg) in this proof-of-concept study was based on non-clinical and phase I data. Approximately 60&#x02013;80% occupancy of the human SERT is required to achieve a therapeutic effect with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Meyer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref018">2007</xref>). In contrast, an occupancy level of 41% with Lu AA20004 in rats led to a significant increase in extracellular levels of 5-HT, perhaps due to the additional pharmacological activities of Lu AA21004, which may counteract negative feedback mechanisms operating at cellular and network levels. The dose of 5 mg/d corresponds to a SERT occupancy of ~40% in human brain and was, therefore, expected to be an effective dose (Areberg <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref003">2009</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this phase II clinical study was to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of two fixed doses (5 and 10 mg/d) of Lu AA21004 <italic>vs.</italic> that of placebo after 6 wk treatment in adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Venlafaxine XR (225 mg/d) was used as the active reference.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec002"><title>Method</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled, active reference study recruited 429 randomized patients from 49 psychiatric settings in 11 countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Italy, Malaysia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden). Outpatients with MDD were recruited from psychiatric settings from August 2006 to August 2007. Advertisements were used in Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, Malaysia, and Sweden. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (ICH, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref011">1996</xref>) and the Declaration of Helsinki (WMA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref029">1964</xref>). Local ethics committees approved the study design and eligible patients gave their written informed consent before participating.</p><p>Eligible patients were randomized equally (1:1:1:1) to one of the four treatment arms for a 6-wk double-blind treatment period. Randomized patients were given 1-wk wallet cards at each visit and were instructed to take two capsules per day, orally, at the same time every day (preferably in the morning). Lu AA21004 was dosed at 5 or 10 mg/d for 6 wk and venlafaxine at 75 mg/d for 4 d, 150 mg/d for the following 3 d, and 225 mg/d for the remainder of the treatment period. Efficacy and tolerability were assessed at screening, baseline and after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 wk. Patients who completed the 6-wk double-blind treatment period entered a 2-wk double-blind taper period. During this period, patients on 5 mg/d Lu AA21004 switched to placebo; patients on 10 mg/d Lu AA21004 received 5 mg/d Lu AA21004 for the first week (week 7) and placebo for the second week (week 8); patients on placebo remained on placebo; patients on venlafaxine received 150 mg/d venlafaxine for the first week (week 7) and 75 mg/d for the second week (week 8). Patients were contacted for a safety follow-up 4 wk after the completion visit. Down-taper medication was also offered to patients who withdrew.</p><sec id="sec002-001"><title>Main entry criteria</title><p>Patients with MDD presenting with a current major depressive episode according to DSM-IV-TR criteria (APA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref002">1994</xref>) were included in the study if they were an outpatient of either sex, aged from 18 yr to 65 yr, with a Montgomery&#x02013;&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (Montgomery &#x00026; &#x000c5;sberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref021">1979</xref>) total score &#x02a7e;30 at the baseline visit.</p><p>Patients were excluded if they had any current psychiatric disorder other than MDD as defined in DSM-IV-TR [assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI; Sheehan <italic>et al.</italic>

Occasional use of zolpidem, zopiclone and zaleplon for insomnia was allowed.</p><p>Patients were withdrawn if they became pregnant during the study, if the investigator considered it to be in the best interest of the patient for safety/efficacy reasons, if laboratory values were outside normal ranges and clinically significant, if they were considered to be at significant risk of suicide, if they scored &#x02a7e;5 points on item 10 (suicidal thoughts) of the MADRS, if the randomization code for a patient was broken, if consent to participate was withdrawn, if they did not take study medication for more than 6 consecutive days, or if the patient was lost to follow-up. The patient could be withdrawn from the study if a serious adverse event (SAE) occurred. If adverse events (AEs) were contributory to withdrawal, they were always regarded as the primary reason for withdrawal.</p></sec><sec id="sec002-002"><title>Efficacy rating</title><p>Patients were evaluated using the MADRS from baseline to week 6. Rater training was undertaken to increase inter-rater reliability, and was chaired by an experienced investigator. Only those investigators who had actively participated in rater training sessions prior to inclusion of patients into the study and had received rater certification were allowed to rate patients. Patient ratings were assessed by the same investigator at each visit, whenever possible.</p></sec><sec id="sec002-003"><title>Allocation to treatment</title><p>The medication was given as capsules of identical appearance. Patients who met the selection criteria at the baseline visit were assigned to double-blind treatment according to a computer-generated randomization list. The details of the randomization series were unknown to any of the investigators and were contained in a set of sealed opaque envelopes. At each study site, sequentially enrolled patients were assigned the lowest randomization number available in blocks of four. All investigators, study personnel and participants were blinded to treatment assignment for the duration of the entire study. The randomization code was broken for one patient (accidentally) who had completed the study before this was discovered, and was therefore not withdrawn from the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec002-004"><title>Analysis sets</title><p>All safety analyses were based on the all-patients-treated set (APTS), comprising all randomized patients who took at least one dose of study medication.

The statistical model was an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of the change from baseline in MADRS total score (FAS, LOCF) with treatment and site as fixed factors and the baseline MADRS score as a covariate.

The active reference, venlafaxine XR (225 mg), was included with the purpose of validating the study methodology and patient population, and was effective on the primary efficacy analysis. Both doses of Lu AA21004 resulted in a significant improvement compared to placebo on the primary efficacy analysis. It has been suggested (Moncrieff &#x00026; Kirsch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref020">2005</xref>) that the difference in total scores for an active treatment <italic>vs.</italic> placebo can be driven by a few single individual items in a rating scale. However, this is not the case in the present study, in which both doses of Lu AA21004 showed significantly greater efficacy than placebo on nine of the 10 MADRS items.</p><p>There is a large difference to placebo for all active treatment groups of about 5&#x02013;6 points on the HAMD<sub>24</sub> (which translates to ~4 points on the HAMD<sub>17</sub>), which is more than the ~2 points on the HAMD<sub>17</sub> seen in FDA pivotal antidepressant studies (Kirsch <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref014">2002</xref>). This also confirms the assay sensitivity of the studied population, who were not only severely depressed, but also had a substantial level of anxiety symptoms at baseline. At week 6, the proportion of MADRS responders (patients with &#x02a7e;50% decrease in MADRS total score) and remitters (MADRS score &#x02a7d;10) was statistically significantly greater in all active treatment groups than in placebo (LOCF and OC). The difference between active treatment and placebo of ~6 points on the MADRS translates into a clinically relevant difference in response rates of between 22% and 32% units, compared to an average of 16% units for antidepressants approved by the competent European authorities (Melander <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref017">2008</xref>). The robustness of the results was also confirmed by the significantly better outcome than placebo on HAMD<sub>24</sub>, HAMA, CGI-I and CGI-S.</p><p>Several pharmacological mechanisms are likely to account for the multimodal antidepressant action of Lu AA21004. It has been estimated that an 80% occupancy of the human SERT is achieved at standard doses of SSRIs or SNRIs (Meyer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref018">2007</xref>). However, 5 mg Lu AA21004 occupies ~40% of SERT sites, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms involved in its therapeutic activity. Hence, SERT blockade by SSRIs evokes a series of negative feedback mechanisms that attenuate the increase in extracellular (synaptic) concentration of 5-HT, including the activation of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> autoreceptors on serotonergic neurons (Artigas <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref005">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref004">2001</xref>). The partial agonist activity of Lu AA21004 at 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptors may therefore help counteract the inhibition of terminal 5-HT synthesis and release evoked by 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptor activation. Likewise, its full agonist activity at human 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors expressed in cell lines is predicted to evoke a rapid desensitization of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors (Haddjeri <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref008">2009</xref>), thereby normalizing serotonergic cell firing and 5-HT release. On the other hand, given the presence of excitatory 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in GABAergic interneurons in cortical and limbic areas (Morales <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref023">1996</xref>; Puig <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref025">2004</xref>), their activation by 5-HT may induce a GABA-mediated inhibition of neurotransmitter release. In support of this view, the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist ondansetron augments the increase of extracellular 5-HT in the ventral hippocampus induced by the SSRI paroxetine (M&#x000f8;rk <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref024">2009</xref>). Moreover, blockade of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors has been shown to produce rapid antidepressant-like effects in the rat in behavioural and electrophysiological experimental paradigms (Mnie-Filali <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref019">2011</xref>). In addition to these effects on the 5-HT system, the systemic administration of Lu AA21004 increases the extracellular concentration of dopamine, noradrenaline and acetylcholine (Haddjeri <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref008">2009</xref>), an effect probably contributing to its antidepressant activity.</p><p>Due to the profile of Lu AA21004, a hierarchical procedure was used to test for onset of action at week 1. Although not significant on the MADRS, Lu AA21004 displayed onset of antidepressant action, with significant improvement <italic>vs.</italic> placebo at week 1 onwards for both doses on HAMD<sub>24</sub>, and for the 10 mg dose on CGI-I.</p><p>The proportion of patient withdrawals has been used in recent years as an indirect index of drug effectiveness in the real world (Kahn <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref012">2008</xref>; Lieberman <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref016">2005</xref>; Trivedi <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref027">2006</xref>). The analysis of withdrawal rates in patients treated with Lu AA21004 indicates a better tolerability profile compared to the active reference, venlafaxine. Compared to placebo, significantly more patients withdrew due to AEs only in the venlafaxine group.</p><p>The most common AEs reported in the active treatment groups were nausea, headache, hyperhidrosis, and dry mouth. No possibly suicide-related AEs were found. No consistent trends were observed for vital signs, weight, clinical laboratory values or ECG in the active treatment groups, and there were no marked differences between patients receiving active treatment and those receiving placebo.</p><p>Sexual dysfunction during antidepressant treatment is one of the main reasons for the lack of compliance (Kennedy &#x00026; Rizvi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref013">2009</xref>). According to the present data, the incidence of spontaneously reported AEs related to sexual dysfunction was similar to placebo in patients treated with either dose of Lu AA21004. In the venlafaxine group, the incidence of AEs related to sexual dysfunction was significantly higher than that of placebo (12.4% <italic>vs.</italic> 1.9%). Unlike SSRIs, Lu AA21004 also displays moderate to high affinity for 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub> and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors (see above). There is limited information on the role of these receptors on sexual drive, although the increase in plasma testosterone levels evoked in male rats by the proximity of female rats is further enhanced by the selective 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist ondansetron, which suggests that 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor blockade may lead to an enhanced sexual drive (Amstislavskaya &#x00026; Popova, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref001">2004</xref>).</p><p>The generalizability of results from this study to the broad population of depressed patients, like most randomized controlled trials, is limited by the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients aged &#x0003c;18 yr or &#x0003e;65 yr were not included, nor were patients with specified psychiatric or medical comorbidities, or patients at risk of suicidal behaviour, nor those with treatment-resistant depression or with mild to moderate depression. The titration of venlafaxine XR, from 75 mg to 225 mg over 7 d, was according to the manufacturer's instructions. Only one patient treated with venlafaxine withdrew in the first week of treatment, indicating that there was no bias due to early withdrawals in this treatment arm.</p><p>In conclusion, treatment with 5 mg and 10 mg Lu AA21004 for 6 wk in this proof-of-concept study was well tolerated and efficacious in reducing depressive and anxious symptoms in patients with MDD.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="sec007"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was sponsored by H.
