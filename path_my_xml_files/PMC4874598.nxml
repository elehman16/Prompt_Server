Standard treatment of exudative AMD is with intravitreal injections of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antagonists. These treatments maintain vision in up to 90 percent of patients but do not cure AMD. [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The most commonly used VEGF-antagonists are bevacizumab (Avastin <sup>&#x000ae;,</sup>
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genentech">Genentech</ext-link>/<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoffmann-La_Roche">Hoffmann-La Roche</ext-link>), ranibizumab (Lucentis<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Genentech/Novartis, Inc.) and aflibercept (Eylea<sup>&#x000ae;,</sup>, Bayer). The active part of the molecule is similar in bevacizumab and ranibizumab. However, bevacizumab is the whole anti-VEGF antibody (150 kD), while ranibizumab is an antibody fragment. Bevacizumab has a longer half-life in the systemic circulation than ranibizumab while ranibizumab is believed to penetrate the retina better and has higher affinity to VEGF-A than bevacizumab. These differences could have an impact on safety and efficacy of these drugs [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Since 2008, several comparative clinical trials were initiated to compare bevacizumab and ranibizumab in exudative AMD. Recently three of these reported bevacizumab not to be inferior to ranibizumab in the treatment of AMD [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] while one trial concluded bevacizumab to be neither non-inferior nor inferior to ranibizumab at the two-year endpoint.[<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The CATT study was a head-to-head comparison of bevacizumab and ranibizumab in 1,208 AMD patients using both monthly and &#x02018;as needed&#x02019; (Pro Re Nata, PRN) treatment regimens (4 groups). With the non-inferiority limit set at 5 letters, they found distance visual acuity (VA) after 1 year to be equivalent for the two drugs within each of these treatment regimens. [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The IVAN study in 610 patients had a similar study design (4 groups), although the criteria and regimen of retreatment in the PRN groups were different from CATT, and the non-inferiority limit was 3.5 letters. When patients treated with bevacizumab (monthly and PRN) were compared with one-sided testing (p&#x0003c;0.05), to all patients treated with ranibizumab, bevacizumab was neither non-inferior nor inferior to ranibizumab. Other efficacy and safety outcomes were similar between groups, such as retinal thickness using time-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The MANTA research group and the GEFAL research group included 317 and 501 patients respectively. They compared both drugs in PRN treatment regimens (2 groups). [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In the MANTA trial, again bevacizumab was non-inferior to ranibizumab for VA at all time points over 1 year. No significant differences were found in decrease of retinal thickness or in number of adverse events. [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In the GEFAL study, the difference in mean change in best corrected visual acuity favored bevacizumab with 1.68 letters (p &#x0003c;0.0001, 95% confidence interval, -1.16 to +4.93).

The commercially available formulations of bevacizumab and ranibizumab were used and both were prepared for injection by aspiration in a Kendall monoject syringe in an aseptic manufacturing facility to ensure masking for everybody taking part in the study, apart from the pharmacists. Syringes were only labelled with the patient identification number. Prepared syringes were kept at 4&#x000b0;Celsius and injections were given not later than 24 hours after preparation. Participants attended monthly for a protocolized BCVA measurement, SD-OCT (3D and cross scans) and intravitreal injection with the allocated drug. Besides the identical syringes masking was also ensured by the fact that the ophthalmologists who performed the injections did not take part in interpretation of any data or patient assessment. The patient was labelled as a poor-responder and treatment was changed to the other drug, if at any visit after the third injection there was a drop in BCVA of more than 10 letters compared to baseline and there was clear evidence of active CNV or leakage by qualitative SD-OCT and/or FA assessment or at least two of the following signs of leakage on OCT; central retinal thickening &#x0003e;300 micron (CRT), intraretinal cysts or subretinal fluid any time after the third injection. The choice for CRT &#x0003e; 300 micron was based on the assumption that this would be more than two standard deviations above the mean CRT of a healthy retina in all three the devices used (see also below). FA and a standardized full ophthalmic examination were done at baseline, 4 months and exit visit.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>The primary outcome was the change in BCVA in the study eye from baseline to month 12 assessed with ETDRS- like visual acuity charts at an initial distance of four meter. Secondary outcome measures were: the proportion of patients with a loss of BCVA less than 15 letters from baseline at 12 months (responders); the proportion of patients with a loss or a gain of BCVA less than 15 letters from baseline at 12 months (stabilizers); the proportion of patients with 15 letters loss or more of BCVA from baseline at 12 months (losers); the proportion of patients with 15 letters gain or more of BCVA from baseline at 12 months (gainers); the absolute and percentage change in CRT, as measured by SD-OCT at 4 and 12 months as determined by the Study Reading Centre at the AMC; the proportion of dropouts before the final 12 months assessments; the proportion of switchers after the third injection; the occurrence of (serious) adverse events during the 12 months of the study and the costs of the two treatments. The latter will be discussed in the companion paper.</p><p>For SD-OCT examinations, either Cirrus OCT, Spectralis OCT or Topcon OCT could be used. The type of SD-OCT device used differed between sites, but individual patients were always scanned with the same device during the study. Although the different devices have different definitions for the inner- and outer border of the retina, absolute differences were assumed not to differ. Additionally, all volume scans were reviewed by two investigators to check for proper positioning on the macula as well as consistency of detection of the inner and outer border of the retina. Where necessary, borders were adjusted manually. Data on injections with bevacizumab or ranibizumab and data on imaging and other therapeutic procedures were gathered with case report forms.</p><p>Trial coordinators questioned patients at each visit regarding adverse events and the events were coded by one researcher at the coordinating site using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MeDdra 14.1) system. All serious adverse events were reviewed by the principal investigator.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Differences in the BCVA change scores from baseline were tested statistically for non-inferiority. Starting from a common standard deviation of the change in BCVA score of 14 letters in both groups, and assuming an improvement from baseline of 9 letters in both the ranibizumab and bevacizumab groups, a sample size of 306 patients (153 in each group) has an 80% power of demonstrating non-inferiority by excluding a difference of 4 letters or more, using a one-sided t-test and a significance level of 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Randomization and Masking</title><p>The randomisation list was created in a 1:1 ratio by the TENALEA Clinical Trial Data Management System. The allocation scheme was stratified by centre, by BCVA in the study eye (&#x02264;52 versus &#x02265;53) and by BCVA in the fellow eye (&#x02264;52 versus &#x02265;53) using the (non-deterministic) minimization method as described by Pocock and Simon [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in each substratum. The randomization list was imported into the data management system Oracle Clinical. Upon randomization of a patient, an automatized email notification containing the allocation result was sent to the site's pharmacy keeping the investigator and trial personnel blinded from treatment allocation. In case a medication switch was requested in Oracle Clinical, an automatized e-mail notification containing the updated treatment allocation was sent to the site's pharmacy.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Non-inferiority is assumed if the difference between both groups is 4 letters or less using a one-sided t-test with a significance level of 0.05. Based on the literature available before January 2009, we set the non-inferiority margin at 4 letters. We performed intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. When patients did not complete the study, their last available BCVA-score was used as the BCVA-score at visit 14 (last-observation-carried-forward). Further, to minimize the risk of false claiming non-inferiority we used the BCVA at the moment of switch for patients who were switched to the other treatment. The mean BCVA-change per treatment group was calculated. Covariance analysis of the BCVA-change was used with treatment as fixed factor and baseline BCVA-score as covariate.</p><p>To evaluate the influence of carrying forward the last available BCVA-score to visit 14 in patients without BCVA-score at visit 14, we used a linear mixed-effects regression analysis to analyze the repeatedly measured BCVA-change from baseline. In this model we used treatment, visit-number and their interaction as fixed-factors and the baseline BCVA-score as covariate. We used cubic-splines to flexibly model the change of the BCVA over time. No assumptions concerning the covariance matrix between the repeated BCVA-scores were made. The 90% confidence interval of the difference between the estimated means of BCVA-change from baseline at visit 14 in the two treatment groups was calculated.</p><p>The absolute and percentage change from baseline in CRT, as measured by SD-OCT, at 4 and 12 months, were analyzed with covariance analysis. The significance level was 0.05 and last-observation-carried-forward was performed. Only measurements by the Study Reading Centre Amsterdam were used.</p><p>All proportions were compared between treatment groups using the Pearson chi-square statistic with a significance level of 0.05. These proportions were calculated after last-observation-carried-forward in patients without BCVA-score at visit 14.</p><p>The numbers of adverse events and serious adverse events during the 12 months of the study were compared between the treatment groups using the Mann-Whitney U test using a significance level of 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec017"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec018"><title>Patients</title><p>Between January 2009 and December 2011 we randomized 332 patients.

Although the design and outcome of the BRAMD study were similar to those from the CATT and IVAN trials in general terms, they differed in detail [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The BRAMD study is the first fully masked trial comparing bevacizumab and ranibizumab in exudative AMD, as injecting physicians were masked to the medication administrated.</p><p>In addition, in contrast to the CATT and IVAN studies, the BRAMD study also included patients with recurrent CNV. This seems to contribute to the slightly lower gain in visual acuity observed in both treatment arms of the BRAMD study.</p><p>Consistent with the results of CATT, IVAN and MANTA studies, the mean treatment outcome with bevacizumab showed slightly less gain in BCVA, but of a magnitude that can be regarded as clinically insignificant [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, in the BRAMD study, the response to bevacizumab was markedly more varied than the response to ranibizumab, as shown by the distribution of &#x000b4;stabilizers&#x000b4;, &#x000b4;gainers&#x000b4; and &#x000b4;losers&#x000b4; in both groups. The proportions of gainers (&#x02265; 15 letters gain) and losers (&#x02265;15 letters loss) were higher in the bevacizumab group at 24% and 11% versus 19% and 5% in the ranibizumab group, respectively. The larger spread in response can also be deduced from the larger standard deviation of change in visual acuity of this group (14 vs. 12). These results suggest that, although the overall mean outcome of bevacizumab and ranibizumab do not differ, the response to bevacizumab is more varied than to ranibizumab. This is clinically significant, as twice as many patients experienced substantial vision loss in the bevacizumab arm of the BRAMD trial as in the ranibizumab group. The percentage of patients with substantial vision loss in the ranibizumab group was consistent with previous results of the ANCHOR and MARINA trials, where 95% responded. In the bevacizumab group of the BRAMD study however, we identified only 89% responders. [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The IVAN study has not reported the distribution of gainers and losers, but in the CATT trial 31.3% gainers, 62.7% stabilizers and 6% losers in the bevacizumab monthly group versus 34.2%, 60.2% stabilizers and 5.6% in the ranibizumab monthly group were observed [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. They had 62.7% stabilizers in the bevacizumab monthly group versus 60.2% in the ranibizumab monthly group. These results are not consistent with the BRAMD study outcomes, but the different outcomes between our study and CATT could be due to several differences in the study design. The CATT protocol of BCVA measurements entailed e-EDTRS charts where computer screens were used and the protocol was semi-automated whereas we used refraction with analog charts by technicians. CATT included patients with a baseline BCVA between 23 and 82 letters whereas in the BRAMD this was 20 and 78 letters. Minimum time between injections in CATT protocol was 21 days whereas in our protocol treatment window was from 23 to 37 days. In addition, we included patients with new or recurrent disease and 43 of our patients had been treated previously whereas in CATT this was an exclusion criterion. More importantly, the CATT protocol allowed the treating physician to refrain from further injections for patients thought to unlikely benefit from further injections, whereas in our protocol patients with poor outcome were switched to the other drug.</p><p>Like in the CATT study, we observed that presence of any fluid on OCT after 12 monthly injections is more prevalent in the bevacizumab treated patients (41%) than in the ranibizumab treated patients (30%). However, this is not reflected in different visual acuity outcomes. Up till now there is no explanation for this observation and more research is warranted.</p><p>That a possible more effective inhibition of leakage by ranibizumab is not always accompanied by a better visual acuity result could be due to the induction of progression of atrophy. This latter possibility is supported by recent analyses of the CATT and IVAN studies which indicated more rapid progression of atrophy in patients on monthly treatment than on PRN treatment.</p><p>Our study was designed specifically to compare the effects of maximal treatment of both VEGF- antagonists. Other studies ([<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]) included also PRN treatment regimens which are often used in clinical practice. At present the two most commonly used variable treatment regiments are PRN, with monthly examinations, and a &#x0201c;treat and extend&#x0201d; strategy, where not only the number of injections but also the number of visits is reduced by extending the interval between visits based on clinical response[<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Retreatment is often based on the presence of fluid on OCT rather than thickness values and the observation of more frequent fluid on OCT could hence have an influence on the number of injections when using PRN, leading to more injections for PRN treatment with bevacizumab. Retreatment criteria in these studies were based on a presence of fluid on OCT, haemorrhage, decrease in VA and presence of leakage on FA. In CATT slightly more injections were reported with bevacizumab (7.7 &#x000b1;3.5) compared to ranibizumab (6.9 &#x000b1; 3.0) and this was statistically significant. [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For IVAN these data are not published at the moment but the lowest count of ranibizumab injections reported is 6 compared to 7 for bevacizumab [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In MANTA there was no significant difference (p = 0.26) with slightly less injections in the ranibizumab group (5.8 &#x000b1; 2.7) compared to bevacizumab (6.1 &#x000b1; 2.8). [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In GEFAL, patients treated with bevacizumab received 6.8 (SD = 2.7)) injections compared to 6.5 (SD = 2.4) for patients treated with ranibizumab (p = 0.39).[<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Bevacizumab and other anti-VEGF agents have serious side effects when used systemically for non-ocular indications, in particular in patients with an increased risk of stroke or other arterial thrombo-embolic events. [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Bevacizumab and ranibizumab differ substantially in pharmacokinetics such as systemic half-life. It is possible therefore that they also differ in systemic side effects in ocular use. [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, to this day, no convincing differences in systemic adverse events have been shown. The BRAMD study did not have the statistical power to detect small but clinically meaningful differences in systemic safety. In future studies, our safety data will be pooled with the results of the other international trials comparing bevacizumab and ranibizumab for this purpose.</p><sec id="sec022"><title>Limitations</title><p>The follow-up time of patients in the BRAMD study is restricted to 12 months. We recognize that patients with AMD are often treated for years. It is highly conceivable however that results achieved during the first year of monthly treatment are predictive of future results. One year of intensive treatment should be sufficient to assess whether a patient will or will not continue to respond. Further, one year of treatment seemed sufficient to our public national funding agency as well to assess the non-inferiority of bevacizumab against ranibizumab.</p><p>In the IVAN trial, increased atrophy was observed in patients treated monthly with ranibizumab for 2 years, [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The IVAN study group also reviewed this in the CATT 2 years results and confirmed their own observation. [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] This suggests that a trial with monthly injections might be safer if only conducted for one year.</p><p>The number of patients and the length of follow-up are not adequate to provide a full safety report on bevacizumab versus ranibizumab. Now that our study confirms the non-inferiority by visual acuity of bevacizumab against ranibizumab and market access of bevacizumab and ranibizumab in the Netherlands have been redefined as a result of it, we need further post-marketing surveillance to keep track of the safety in the long run.</p><p>We further recognize that we evaluated the efficacy of both drugs in a typically clinical trial setting, i.e. monthly injections while in every day practice most patients are treated on an as needed basis and we explicitly withhold ourselves from making statements about such treatment schedules.</p><p>What might be considered an inconsistency in our protocol is the definition of treatment failure on the one hand and the indication for becoming a switcher on the other hand. Patients are considered failures or losers to therapy once they lose 15 letters or more over the year. However, already when they were still &#x02018;stabilizers&#x02019; with a loss of between 10 to 15 letters exclusive, a cross-over to the alternative drug was indicated. We applied an ad-hoc analysis to show the percentages of patients losing or gaining more than 10 rather than 15 letters with the latter reported in the results section of this paper. There were 57 patients gaining 10 letters or more in the bevacizumab group (35%) versus 61 (37%) in the ranibizumab group. For the losers this was 20 (12%) and 13 (8%) respectively (p = 0.41). This is consistent with the results above showing more losers in the bevacizumab group.</p><p>Three different SD-OCT systems were used. This could lead to some differences. In the MANTA conversion algorithms were used to deal with this problem. However we believe this is unnecessary as we analyzed the absolute differences between baseline and exit measurements, and as de Kinkelder et al. found a maximum difference in mean thickness between brands to be 7.7 micron (Topcon, Spectralis, Cirrus and RTVue) which is an insignificant difference [<xref rid="pone.0153052.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Finally, we applied the last observation carried forward at the time of switching to the alternative drug. usually, this is not done in a intention-to-treat analysis, because the gain in vision after the switch is not accounted for. However, we did not want to run the risk of demonstrating non-inferiority of bevacizumab to ranibizumab because of patients switching therapies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The BRAMD study confirms that bevacizumab is non-inferior to ranibizumab in the treatment of exudative AMD. Our study did not result in new safety signals, but definitive results should come from safety data pooled over studies. Being much cheaper it is reasonable to suggest bevacizumab as the first choice of treatment in exudative AMD. However, in our study more patients obtained suboptimal results (more than 15 letters loss) in the bevacizumab than in the ranibizumab group. Therefore, for patients with an initial poor response to bevacizumab, ranibizumab may be useful as a second line treatment option.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153052.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>The S1 file is the study protocol as it was approved by the medical ethical committee.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0153052.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153052.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>The S2 file contains the Credit Roster.</title><p>This provides an overview of the entire study group.
