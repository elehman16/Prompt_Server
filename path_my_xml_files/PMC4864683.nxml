Usually, without any additive one can achieve 60&#x02013;90 min anesthesia with a spinal block.</p><p>Nowadays, anesthetists are fortunate enough to have agents that can be used either intrathecally or intravenously to enhance the efficacy and duration of the block they are called adjuvants. Some of the drugs that were previously used are epinephrine, magnesium sulphate, fentanyl, midazolam, clonidine,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] nowadays dexmedetomidine is trending.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine was a newer congener of clonidine, a dextro isomer of medetomidine, first introduced for short-term Intensive Care Unit sedation in 1999, is having 8 times more selectivity to &#x003b1;2-adrenergic receptors than clonidine which might permit its application in relatively high doses for sedation and analgesia without any unwanted vascular effects from activation of &#x003b1;1 receptors. Dexmedetomidine is rapidly emerging drug as an adjuvant to general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, spinal anesthesia, during monitored anesthesia care, as premedication and for postoperative sedation and analgesia.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is an excellent drug for sedation in intubated as well as non-intubated patients in critical care and for short procedures. Sleep induced with dexmedetomidine is termed as cooperative sleep, and the drug does not disturb the sleep architecture, as well as, the respiratory drive. Taking the advantage of these properties, we decided to study the effects of dexmedetomidine by administrating it intravenously in association with the subarachnoid block.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a selective &#x003b1;2 agonist; these receptors are found in many sites throughout the body including central nervous system (CNS), spinal, and peripheral tissues. In CNS, the highest densities of &#x003b1;2 receptors are found in the locus ceruleus, an important modulator of vigilance. Presynaptic activation of the &#x003b1;2A-adrenoceptors in the locus ceruleus inhibits the release of norepinephrine (NE) and results in the sedative and hypnotic effects. Furthermore, the locus ceruleus is the site of origin for the descending medullospinal noradrenergic pathway. Stimulation of the &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptors in this area terminates the propagation of pain signals leading to analgesia. At the spinal cord, stimulation of &#x003b1;2 receptors at the substantia gelatinosa of the dorsal horn leads to inhibition of the firing of nociceptive neurons and inhibition of the release of substance P. Furthermore, the &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptors located at the nerve endings have a possible role in the analgesic mechanisms of &#x003b1;2 agonists by preventing NE release. The spinal mechanism is the principal mechanism for the analgesic action of dexmedetomidine even though there is a clear evidence for both a supraspinal and peripheral sites of action. As it is a much known fact that dexmedetomidine is used as a bolus dose followed by continuous infusion, in our study, we have tried to bring out the same effect with single dose over 10 min, as it does with infusion.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objective</title><p>To evaluate the effect of intravenous dexmedetomidine on the duration of sensory block (regression to S1), hemodynamic profile, the level of sedation and postoperative analgesia (time when the first analgesic given and total analgesic consumption in 24 h).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted following approval of the Ethics Committee (dated 22/09/2011) and after obtaining written informed consent from patients scheduled to undergo elective infraumblical surgeries, duration of the study was from 30/09/2011 to 30/09/2012.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Selection of cases</title><p>

Each group contained 30 patients scheduled to undergo infraumbilical surgeries. Patients in the study group received dexmedetomidine infusion 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg over 10 min and patients in the control group received saline infusion over 10 min, 45 min after spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine 0.5% 15 mg (<italic>n</italic> = 30 per group).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Preparation of infusion</title><p>Two milliliters of injection dexmedetomidine, diluted in 48 ml of normal saline; hence, the concentration of the drug in the solution is 4 &#x003bc;g/ml. The infusion was prepared by an independent senior resident who was not involved in the subsequent phases of the study. Thus, both the resident conducting the case as well as the patient was not aware of the assigned group in all the cases.</p><p>All patients were prehydrated with 10 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate solution through 18-gauge, intravenous cannula. Standard monitoring done, which includes noninvasive blood pressure (BP), electrocardiography, heart rate (HR), and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) saturation. All patients were supplemented with 4 L/min of O<sub>2</sub> by simple face mask. Subarachnoid block with 3 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine was performed in the L3&#x02013;L4 interspace using a 25-gauge Quincke's spinal needle with the patient in the sitting position.</p><p>After performing the spinal block vital signs were recorded every 2 min initially, and every 5 min thereafter. Forty-five minutes after the subarachnoid block, dexmedetomidine group (Group D) received dexmedetomidine infusion 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg over 10 min, and the control group (Group C) received the same volume of normal saline infusion over 10 min.</p><p>Onset, height, duration, and regression of sensory block (two segment regression) were assessed with an ice cube and by the loss of pinprick sensations. Sensory block was assessed every 2 min for the first 10 min and thereafter every 5 min during surgery. Before giving the study drug or placebo, the sensory level was recorded. In the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), the sensory level was recorded every 15 min for the next 4 h or regression to S1 level, after which the patient was shifted to the ward.</p><p>The level of sedation was evaluated intraoperatively and postoperatively every 15 min using Ramsay level of sedation scale [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Ramsey level of sedation scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-273-g001"/></table-wrap><p>All sedation score was recorded considering the time of injecting dexmedetomidine.</p><p>If sensory levels of anesthesia were not equal bilaterally, we used the higher level for the statistical analysis.

In the coronary circulation, it causes a dose-dependent increase in coronary vascular resistance and O<sub>2</sub> extraction, but the supply/demand ratio is unaltered.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] A biphasic cardiovascular response has been described after the administration of dexmedetomidine. A bolus of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg results in a transient increase in BP and a reflex decrease in HR. This initial response is attributed to the direct effects of &#x003b2;-adrenoceptor stimulation of the vascular smooth muscle. This response can be attenuated by a slow infusion over 10 min, as given in our study, 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg over 10 min, which resulted in stabilization of the HR and BP 10&#x02013;15% below baseline values. In this study, changes in pulse rate, systolic, and diastolic BP were similar in both the groups. The decrease in the HR was more evident in Group D but not statistically significant when compared with Group C, and only two patients required atropine for bradycardia, which was comparable with the control group. The lower HR observed in Group D could be explained by the postsynaptic activation of &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptors in the CNS, which results in a decrease in sympathetic activity and circulating levels of catecholamines.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Other studies support the finding that the bradycardia caused by dexmedetomidine is long lasting when used as a premedication drug[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in these studies dexmedetomidine was given as premedication and in some as continuous infusion[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] throughout the procedure, which lead to hypotension and bradycardia intraoperatively, as well as, postoperatively and which lead to increase drug consumption to overcome these effects, by giving slow infusion and after spinal block when the peak hemodynamic effects of subarachnoid block were already settled we have avoided these complications in our study.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the hypotension caused by dexmedetomidine persists in the intraoperative as well as in the postoperative period.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In our patients, there was a fall in mean arterial pressure in Group D as well as in Group C and clinically was not significant. There was no further decrease in the BP after adding intravenous dexmedetomidine to patients with bupivacaine spinal anesthesia. Only two patients in Group D received ephedrine because of fall in systolic BP &#x0003c;90 mmHg, which was statistically not significant and comparable with Group C. Similarly, Al-Mustafa <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Tekin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Whizar-Lugo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported no significant difference in mean arterial pressures in the dexmedetomidine group.</p><p>The mean duration of two segment regression in Group D and Group C was 139.00 &#x000b1; 13.79 min and 96.67 &#x000b1; 7.64 min, respectively [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>]. The difference in the duration between the groups is statistically significant.
