Since 2010, more than 600.000 TKA have been performed annually in the United States and are becoming increasingly common.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
</p><p>TKA, as any surgical procedure, is prone to a number of postoperative complications, including considerable blood loss, reaching about 1000 to 1500 ml after a conventional knee arthroplasty,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref> blood transfusion being necessary in some cases. Along with blood loss, higher rates of postoperative anemia, increased predisposition to cardiopulmonary events, and increased cost for prolonged hospitalization could be identified, as well as complications related to blood transfusion such as immune reactions and infection, besides decreased rate of patient satisfaction.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>Other possible complications after TKA identified in the literature include: infections of the operative site, peripheral venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism, vascular lesions, aseptic loosening, exacerbation of pre-existing clinical diseases and death due to clinical and surgical complications.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
</p><p>In order to minimize a major complication of TKA, which is intra postoperative bleeding, some alternatives are constantly being studied. Among them, the use of intravenous or topic tranexamic acid (TA), epinephrine, fibrin glue, Floseal<sup>(r)</sup> and autotransfusion.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref> The analysis of the clinical efficacy of TA use in reducing blood loss in TKA is necessary, as the current literature shows no consensus on the more effective route of administration and dose. Recent studies show that TA is a key ally in reducing bleeding.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
</p><p>TA, a synthetic antifibrinolytic agent, has in its formula the trans isomer of 4-amino-methyl-cyclohexane carboxylic, commercialized as Transamin<sup>(r)</sup> in Brazil, which is the synthetic derivative from the amino acid lysine. This formula has a strong attraction to the lysine binding sites on plasminogen and plasmin, and by competitively inhibiting activation and action of plasmin.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref> Its action is mainly based on slowing the fibrinolysis process (a potent inhibitor of fibrinolytic activity of plasmin), a subsequent phase of clot formation, when the dissolution time of the fibrin network is extended. The clot is, then, preserved and does not result in activation of the coagulation cascade. These properties enhance the hemostatic effectiveness of the substance by reducing the intensity and risk of bleeding in surgical procedures, trauma and bleeding prone disease. TA is rapidly absorbed. Approximately 90% of an IV dose is excreted in urine in 24h, it has a plasma half-life of approximately 2h, maintaining therapeutic levels for 6-8h. Its action preserves the hemostatic clot making hemostasis more efficient, reducing the intensity and risk of bleeding either IV or topically administered. This study is justified in view of the need to obtain a reduction of bleeding in TKA procedures, avoiding increased complications in the postoperative period. The aim, therefore, is to evaluate the introduction of TA in TKA surgery, to reduce blood loss and hemoglobin reduction, consequently decreasing in the length of hospitalization and transfusion requirements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The research model adopted for this trial was an observational retrospective cohort study.

<sup>16</sup>
</xref> conducted a randomized clinical trial with 99 patients to evaluate the efficacy of TA in postoperative TKA, demonstrating a significant reduction in hemoglobin decrease in these patients.The use of IV TA presents satisfactory results, shown consistently on the literature. The IV medication has the advantage to be more quickly as compared to the topical application method. In some countries, such as Germany for example, use of topical TA is not allowed, as indicated in the medication leaflet. Similarly, it is not clear in the literature which is the effect of the medication in contact with bone or muscle tissue. Despite studies showing similar bleeding rates in both methods<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>, the knowledge on IV administration mechanism is more consistent. There are four TA administration methods: intramuscular, oral, intravenous and topic, the last two being the most widely used in Brazil. The time taken by TA to reach maximum plasma level is 30 min for intramuscular injection, 2h for oral administration and 5-15 min intravenously. The IV application was found the best method to obtain a rapid effect of TA and maintaining its therapeutic concentration during and after surgery.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>The use of TA did not cause any increase in side effects such as thromboembolic events, therefore suggesting a satisfactory degree of security. The use of IV TA as hemostasis mechanism can reduce costs, decrease the time of hospitalization, and avoid use of autologous blood and its complications, as well as enabling earlier rehabilitation of patients.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
</p><p>In this study, the median hemoglobin level preoperatively showed minimal decrease when using TA. On the other hand, the group that did not use the drug showed a significant decrease in serum hemoglobin levels, requiring blood transfusion. The preservation of hemoglobin levels after a surgery with great bleeding potential gives IV TA a major impact on decreased need for blood transfusion and possible complications.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">

These data can be related to decreased hemarthrosis and knee joint volume. The main limitation of this study is the number of patients, which was established based on previous studies with similar samples and on the flow of surgeries at our institution. The comparison between different TA application methods still needs to be researched in order to get a more accurate conclusion regarding the most effective application method.
