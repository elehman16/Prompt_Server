The volunteers began taking the study product or placebo (daily dosage 4.5 g) at the screening visit (V1-Day 0) and continued over the entire 72 day study period. After 30 days the subjects received the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine (V2). They were monitored the following day (V3-Day 31), as well as 21 days (V4-Day 51) and 42 days (V5-Day 72) after vaccination. Responses by the adaptive immune system (antigen specific) were measured via pneumococcal IgG antibodies (subtypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) and salivary IgA levels. Responses by the innate immune system (non-specific) were measured via white blood cell counts, inflammatory cytokines and the complement system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Vaccination significantly increased pneumococcal IgG levels as expected.

The immune system can be divided into two categories: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. Innate immunity is an immediate but non-specific response. Adaptive or acquired immunity involves a specific reaction to a pathogen which the immune system recognizes from a previous encounter. The process of acquired immunity is the basis for vaccination[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recent research has focused on the role of nutrition (foods and specific components of foods) in the responsiveness of the immune system to challenges. Vaccine-specific serum antibody production has been suggested as a highly suitable model to evaluate dietary intervention on the resistance to infection or to other immune system-related diseases[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The pneumococcal vaccine can reduce the incidence and/or severity of infections caused by <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>: namely, pneumonia, otitis media, sinusitis and meningitis. The 23-valent vaccine contains 23 pneumococcal polysaccharide antigens (serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19A, 19F, 20, 22F, 23F and 33F[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Although there are at least 90 distinct serotypes, these 23 serotypes accounted for 85% to 90% of invasive pneumococcal infections in the US[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The 23-valent vaccine produces a humoral (antibody-mediated) response: inducing the production of antibody from B-lymphocytes in the absence of help from T-lymphocytes. The type and concentration of antibody produced is dependent on the site of exposure. Systemic administration results primarily in the generating of circulating immunoglobulin(Ig)G whereas mucosal antigenic challenge results in a more vigorous IgA response[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In contrast to the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine, a 7-valent vaccine conjugated to a nontoxic diphtheria protein (used for children younger than 5 years) will induce a T-cell response[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Studies on improvement of the response to the pneumococcal vaccine by adults include revaccination, the addition on conjugates to the vaccine and alternative antigenic substances[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition, nutritional products have been tested on their effect on the response to vaccination. Supplementation with 200 mg/day vitamin E for 4 months to subjects at least 65 years of age caused a suggestive, but insignificant, increase in antibody response to the pneumococcal vaccine[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Another study evaluated the effects of prebiotic fructo-oligosaccharides (70% raftilose and 30% raftiline) derived from inulin on the response by an elderly population (70 years old and above). In this study the response to vaccination with the influenza B and pneumococcal vaccines was not significantly increased[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Arabinogalactans are high molecular weight, highly branched, water-soluble polysaccharides, which contain units of D-galactose and L-arabinose[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Arabinogalactans have previously demonstrated immunostimulatory activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. They are present in several immune-enhancing herbs, including <italic>Echinacea purpurea, Baptisia tinctoria, Thuja occidentalis, Angelica acutiloba, and Curucuma longa </italic>and the medicinal mushroom <italic>Ganoderma lucidum.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Arabinogalactans from Larch (<italic>Larix </italic>spp.) have been shown to stimulate natural killer cell cytotoxicity in vitro through the generation of interferon gamma and inhibit the metastasis of tumor cells to the liver in a rodent model[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A dog study demonstrated increases in white blood cell counts (due to increases in neutrophils and eosinophils), and no effect on serum IgG, IgM or IgA following oral adminstration indoses of 0.55 g/day or 1.65 g/day for 10 days[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the immunomodulating effects of a preparation of proprietary larch arabinogalactan (1.5 g/day) alone, and in combination with various preparations of Echinacea: an extract of <italic>Echinacea purpurea </italic>whole herb containing 4% phenolic compound (1.5 g/day), a preparation of <italic>E. purpurea </italic>whole herb and a preparation <italic>E. angustifolia </italic>root (36 to 680 mg/day)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The study included 48 adult women who were divided into six groups of eight women. After 4 weeks of treatment, complement properdin increased by 18% in the group that received all four preparations and by 21% in the group given preparations of both species of Echinacea.</p><p>The current human clinical pilot study was designed to test the hypothesis that the ingestion of Resistaid&#x02122;, a proprietary arabinogalactan extracted from Larch (<italic>Larix laricina</italic>), would selectively enhance the antibody response by adults to the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine. Indications that the product would have immunostimulatory activity came from previous studies conducted with this proprietary product[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. As there was no prior human data regarding the ability of this proprietary arabinogalactan extract to impact the immune response to the pneumococcal vaccine, a power calculation could not be performed. The sample size was set at a level consistent with prior human studies involving arabinogalactan and the immune system[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Investigational products</title><p>The proprietary arabinogalactan product ResistAid&#x02122;, supplied by Lonza Ltd, Switzerland, contains arabinogalactan extracted from Larch (<italic>Larix laricina</italic>). Arabinogalactan is a highly branched polysaccharide that is composed of galactose units and arabinose units in the approximate ratio of 6:1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. ResistAid&#x02122; is a fine, dry, light brown powder with a neutral taste that dissolves quickly in water or juice. ResistAid&#x02122; is produced via a water extraction patented process (US 5756098; EP 86608), in accordance with Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) standards and in compliance with the monograph in the Food Chemicals Codex. The Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP's) used during manufacturing are audited by the American Institute of Baking. The Larch arabinogalactan used in the ResistAid&#x02122; product has been designated as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) with the US FDA (GRAS Notice Nos. GRN000047 and GRN000084).</p><p>The placebo was maltodextrin (Maltrin M100, Grain Processing Corp., USA). The test product and the placebo were administered by mixing the powders into a beverage of the subject's choice. The subjects were advised to take their dosage (4.5 g) once a day in the morning with breakfast. They began taking their assigned powder on Day 1 and continued over the entire 72 day study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects between the ages of 18 and 65 were recruited for the study in the usual manner (subject database and community advertisements). Subjects were phone-screened prior to scheduling a screening visit.</p><p>Subjects were included if they were 18-65 years of age, had a Body Mass Index (BMI) &#x02265; 18 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>and &#x02264; 30 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>at screening, agreed to all study visits and visit procedures, agreed to use approved forms of birth control, and agreed not to initiate/change any exercise or diet programs during the study. Subjects were excluded if they had previously had the pneumococcal vaccine, had any major systemic, inflammatory or chronic disease, had any active infection or infection in the past month requiring antibiotics or anti-viral medication, used immunosuppressive drugs in the prior 5 years, were known to have alcohol or drug abuse, were pregnant or lactating or had any medical condition which in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with the subject's participation in the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial with an active investigational period of 72 days. The objective was to assess the immunomodulatory effect of the arabinogalactan product on selective markers of immune function following antigenic challenge by the pneumococcal vaccine. The primary endpoints were 7 different pneumococcal IgG antibodies. The secondary objective was to determine whether the arabinogalactan product would stimulate other arms of the immune system to which there was no direct antigenic stimulus. Secondary endpoints included salivary IgA, white blood cell counts, complement (C3 and C4) and inflammatory cytokine levels. The study was conducted at the Staywell Research clinical research site located in Northridge, CA and was designed and managed by the Medicus Research Contract Research Organization (CRO) also in Northridge, CA. IRB approval was obtained prior to the initiation of any study activities (Copernicus Group IRB, Cary, NC).</p><p>Subjects meeting all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria for this study were randomly assigned to receive either the arabinogalactan or placebo. Double-blinding was ensured by the use of identical opaque sachets, outer packaging, labelling and color for both investigational products (arabinogalactan and placebo). Unblinding of the entire research team, including data analysis team did not occur until after the analysis was completed; subjects were blinded throughout the trial.</p><p>The study began in August 2008 (first subject in) and lasted until December 2008 (last subject completed). The subjects in the study came to the research clinic for a total of 5 visits (V1-V5) over 72 days. Subjects took the first dose of assigned study product at the screening visit (V1-Day 0) and continued to take them over the entire study. They received the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>23, Merck and Co., Inc., USA) at the vaccine visit which took place 30 days after they began taking the product or placebo (V2-Day 30). They came in for safety monitoring the day immediately following the vaccine (V3-Day 31) to observe the reaction at the vaccine administration site. Then subjects returned 21 days after vaccine (V4-Day 51) and finally 42 days after vaccine administration (V5-Day 72). On study visits, blood, urine and saliva were collected and subjects were queried regarding any change in health status. Additionally, they were assessed for compliance by interview, diary, and through the return of unused study product sachets.</p><p>The most potentially immunogenic pneumococcal antibodies (Ab) were determined in consultation with the UCLA Vaccine Center (Torrance, CA, USA) as the antibodies most likely to respond to vaccination with the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine. These antibodies included 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F. Salivary IgA was measured to monitor for non-specific effects on the adaptive immune system using immuno-array assays with a minimum sensitivity of 1.0 &#x003bc;g/ml. Other markers of immune function were chosen to represent the innate arm of the immune system including white blood cell counts (totals and subtypes), inflammatory cytokines, and complement (C3 and C4) determined using immuno-turbidimetric methodology. Analysis of inflammatory cytokine levels were performed using sandwich immunoassay (Affymetrix, San Diego, CA, USA). Safety monitoring included: body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, physical exam, urinalysis, complete blood counts (CBC) and a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) including kidney and liver function tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Analyses</title><p>Excel 2003 (Microsoft Corp, Redmond WA, USA), was used for data entry, validation, restructuring, calculating changes in variables over time, reorganizing and reformatting results, and preparing graphs. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Base System ver. 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL, USA).</p><p>Data was analyzed using paired sample t-tests for within subject means comparisons, independent sample t-tests for between group comparisons (placebo vs. the active groups individually). Difference scores for both within and between group comparisons (placebo vs. the active groups individually) were analyzed using appropriate t-tests. Analysis was completed before the blinding code was broken.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Sixty five (65) subjects were screened in person at the research clinic and 53 qualified for randomization at the screening visit (V1). Of the 53, 8 did not return for V2 and therefore a total of 45 subjects were included in the intent-to-treat analysis.

When comparing the cytokine change from baseline values between groups, only the IL-6 change from Day 30 to Day 31 showed an increase in the arabinogalactan group compared to the placebo group. The change in the arabinoglactan group was from a mean of 17.8 &#x000b1; 7.7 to 19.8 &#x000b1; 7.7 pg/ml (+1.9), compared to a change from 50.1 &#x000b1; 113.8 to 48.7 &#x000b1; 112.5 pg/ml for the placebo group (-2.4) (p = 0.046).

All adverse events were followed by the medical staff at the research clinic.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this pilot study suggest that the arabinogalactan preparation had a selective immunostimulating effect on acquired or adaptive immunity, as shown in the increase in antibodies without any clinically significant effects on total white blood cells, cytokines or complement. Thus it is possible that rather than acting as a general immunostimulant, arabinogalactan acted in a specific manner. The caveat to this statement is that these results are preliminary and there are confounding variables to consider.</p><p>Variables that affect the immune response to vaccines include age, gender, race and genetic characteristics[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. One of the goals of this pilot study was to determine the effect of the intervention on a relatively broad population. As such, the study population included males and females from age 18 to 65. The randomization scheme was sequential and therefore the gender of subjects was not matched in advance. As gender and age differences may affect immunity these potentially confounding variable should be looked at in future studies. This study was an exploratory investigation into the effects of arabinogalactan with the goal of determining whether further studies are warranted. The result is that further studies with larger populations are indicated to clarify and potentially expand upon the effects of arabinogalactan on antibody production.</p><p>The suggestion that arabinogalactan might have a selective effect on the immune system is preliminary but promising. The immune system entails a complex matrix of responses to protect the body from pathogens and toxins. The innate immune system involves the rapid recruitment and upregulation of neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, complement factors, cytokines and antimicrobial peptides to the site of infection. The innate response is the first line of host defense and the adaptive response follows a few days later. While the innate and adaptogenic arms of the immune system are often described as separate, they often act together in a synergistic manner[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In addition to antibodies, the variables tested in this study included salivary IgA, white blood cell counts (lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, basophils and eosinophils), complement C-3 and C-4 as well as numerous cytokines. Additionally, suggestions of changes were observed in IL-6 levels and in eosinophil counts. IL-6 has immunostimulatory properties and eosinophils play a role in allergic responses. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown at this time. Additional measurements for future studies could include a breakdown of lymphocytes into subtypes, measuring natural killer (NK) lymphocytes and NK-T cells. NK cells are a heterogeneous population of innate T cells that have attracted interest because of their potential to regulate immune responses to a variety of pathogens and NK-T cells function as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Arabinogalactan was given for 30 days prior to vaccination and administration was continued throughout the study. The 30 days time period was chosen because a previous clinical trial studying the effect of arabinogalactan and echinacea preparations on the immune system observed a positive effect following treatment for this period of time[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>This is the first human study to demonstrate an effect by Larch arabinogalactan on immunoglobulin levels. No effect on IgG antibody levels was observed in another study wherein the subjects were administered 1.5 g larch arabinogalactan per day for four weeks[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This study utilized a larger dose (4.5 g per day), longer administration time (10 weeks) and the vaccine as a standardized antigenic challenge all of which appear to have been useful in delineating a difference between the proprietary arabinogalactan extract and placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The proprietary arabinogalactan extract (ResistAid&#x02122;) tested in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, increased the antibody response of healthy volunteers to the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine compared to placebo. The proprietary arabinogalactan product was administered safely in this study in a dose of 4.5 g per day for approximately 10 weeks. This was a pilot study that demonstrated promising effects and further studies with larger populations are indicated which may demonstrate additional effects of arabinogalactan on the immune system.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JKU conceptualized the study and was the Principal Investigator.
