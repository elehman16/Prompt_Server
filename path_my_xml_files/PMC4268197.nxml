The results indicated that using metformin with Vitamin D and calcium seems to have more significant effects on improvement of mentioned symptoms. Though metformin therapy had a significant effect also but the effectiveness of metformin with Vitamin D and calcium seems to be more specially for hirsutism and regularity of menstrual cycles and ovulation. Metformin had more significant effect on acne.</p><p>Several studies investigated different therapeutic strategies of PCOS because PCOS is very common and can change the life style PCOS often with obesity and hirsutism and irregular menstruation that can very important for a person.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The role of calcium and Vitamin D in the pathogenesis of PCOS, follicle maturation and ovulation have been demonstrated in many studies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] It is suggested that their role in this field is independent of the effect of insulin resistance.

Both metformin and metformin with Vitamin D and calcium have a potential role in improving menstrual regularity and follicular maturation. According to before-after results, it seems that the effectiveness of using metformin with Vitamin D and calcium in improving menstrual regularity and follicular maturation were more significant than using metformin (65% vs. 45% for menstrual regularity and 60% vs. 50% for follicular maturation). However for comparing the effectiveness of the two treatment strategies, further studies with larger sample size and long duration is recommended. Using metformin with Vitamin D and calcium have a significant effect on hirsutism, whereas it metformin administration had not significant effect on it. Metformin had a significant effect on acne. Though BMI reduction was not statistically significant in all studied groups, but the reduction was higher in group that received metformin with Vitamin D and calcium.</p><p>Several studies in Iran and different countries have also investigated the effectiveness of Mentioned treatment strategy.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In a similar study in Yazd-Iran, Firouzabadi <italic>et al</italic>. have compared the effectiveness of metformin and metformin plus Vitamin D and calcium supplementation on PCOS symptoms of 100 women. The treatment period was 6 months. They concluded that Vitamin D and calcium supplementation have a positive effect on BMI, follicular maturation, regularity of menses, androgen related symptoms, infertility and insulin resistance specially in women with Vitamin D deficiency. The limitation of their study was lack of a control group.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>In another study in Tehran, Rashidi <italic>et al</italic>. have studied the role of these supplementations on PCOS outcomes in 60 patients. Their studied groups were similar to ours. Treatment period was 3 months, which followed up for a further 3 months.

In this study, we did not compare the results of studied treatment strategies in PCOS women with and without Vitamin D deficiency because of small sample size. We used transabdominal ultrasonography for evaluation of follicular maturation due to that we have virgin patients with PCOS, whereas it seems that transvaginal sonography is more accurate.</p><p>It seems that other hormonal and biochemical measurements would be helpful in understanding the mechanisms of mentioned supplements. Long-term prospective studies with larger sample size of patients would remove the confounding effects of variables such as ethnicity, familiar history, environmental factors, and lifestyle methods in this regard.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The results of this trial indicated that Vitamin D and calcium supplementation in addition to metformin therapy in women with PCOS could result in better outcome in a variety of PCOS symptoms including menstrual regularity, ovulation, some features of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism) and BMI.
