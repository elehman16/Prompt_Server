The study was conducted between January 2011 and October 2011, initiated by baseline measurements of anthropometric characteristics, questionnaire containing questions on work-related factors (i.e. occupational seniority, departmental affiliation, etc.), muscle pain intensity and duration, work ability, and perceived physical exertion during work. During the 40 weeks training intervention, follow-up questionnaires were used after 12 and 40 weeks, respectively. The project was ethically approved by the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK), Norway (2010/2385&#x02013;8), and all participants gave their written informed consent (approved by REK) to participate in the study. The project is registered in the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN61986892). The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115059.s004">S1 Checklist</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115059.s005">S1 Protocol</xref>.

We aimed for recruiting health care personnel (primarily nurses and healthcare assistants) to this project. An inquiry was therefore directed to the Director of Personnel at a larger Hospital in Norway, consisting of several districts with approximately 3500 employees in total. A district located in the municipality of Bod&#x000f8;, with 961 employees in total, of which 674 worked as nurses or healthcare assistants was selected based on geographical convenience. An information note targeting these 674 employees, of which 548 were females, was published on the Hospital&#x02019;s intranet. However, due to a request from the manager of the Department of Laboratory Medicine, additional 112 female employees from other professions (mainly bioengineers) were invited. Based on this, a total of 660 female hospital employees were given the opportunity to participate in the study. Three information meetings on different dates and geographical locations were conducted between September 6 and 10, 2010. At the end of the meetings, the attending health personnel were asked to fill out a screening questionnaire, and give consent (consenters) or not (non-consenters) to enroll in the study. For employees who did not attend the information meeting, managers or other colleagues subsequently handed them written information about the project, and screening questionnaires with a stamped addressed envelope to the project manager. Consenters were then invited for physical testing and questionnaire session outside working hours.</p><p>A total number of 185 healthcare employees filled out the screening questionnaire. Of these, 147 were nurses or healthcare assistants and 38 employees of other professions, mainly bioengineers and social educators. Due to unforeseen administrative and logistic challenges at the workplace, there was a 10 week delay from filling out screening questionnaire to the baseline test. During this period, 62 dropped-out from the study. After the baseline tests, another 5 employees chose to withdraw.</p><p>The criteria for inclusion in the study were hospital employees of either sex, aged 25 to 65 years. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, diagnosed angina pectoris and life-threatening diseases. A total of 118 persons (107 females and 11 males) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and consented to participate in the study, and were randomly allocated either to a soccer group, a Zumba group or a control group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115059.s001">S1 Figure</xref>). The number of participants in the flow chart (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115059.s001">S1 Figure</xref>) corresponds to the number of participants who were randomized after the baseline test (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;107), whereas the number of participants in the tables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115059.s002">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115059.s003">S2 Tables</xref>) corresponds to the number responders both randomized and answering to the Questionnaire (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;103).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomization procedure</title><p>The randomization procedure was conducted by the project leader, and is previously reported <xref rid="pone.0115059-Barene1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In short, health care personnel in a single department working in close proximity to each other formed cluster 1 (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;28), then two almost equal sized clusters, cluster 2 (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;27) and 3 (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;29) were matched on sex, BMI, age and work seniority. Information about age and work seniority was obtained from questionnaire. The remaining consenters were then assigned into 3 smaller clusters, cluster A (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11), B (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11) and C (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12), matched on the same variables as above. The randomization was made by lot by blinded staff. The selection was conducted by drawing from 3 boxes; 1) the three different groups (soccer, Zumba or control), 2) the three large clusters (1, 2 or 3), and 3) the three small clusters (A, B or C). The selection was initiated by drawing one group from box 1, followed by drawing one cluster from box 2. This procedure was conducted until each cluster from box 2 was selected into either the soccer, Zumba or control group. The selection of the small clusters was conducted in the same manner as the above, i.e. randomly combined with one of the groups. The group composition was as follows; the soccer group: cluster 3+C, the Zumba group: cluster 2+B and the control group: cluster 1+A <xref rid="pone.0115059-Barene1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Due to the low number of male participants (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11), only females were included in the statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Intervention content</title><p>The training intervention was conducted between January 11 and March 31 in 2011. For both intervention groups, the intervention (training) activities were conducted outside working hours during two-three 1-h sessions per week for 40 weeks. External training facilities and instructors were arranged for both intervention groups.</p><p>The soccer group performed soccer sessions consisting of ordinary three-a-side or four-a-side matches in a traditional gymnastics hall (10&#x000d7;20 m) owned by the hospital, and/or five-a-side, six-a-side, seven-a-side matches in a municipal sports hall (20&#x000d7;40 m) located 3 km from the hospital. Each training session was initiated by a 5-min low intensity warm-up period and included a 5-min half-time break. The soccer-sessions were fully supervised by an instructor throughout the 12-week intervention period. Because only a few participants had previous experience with soccer, there was a 30-minutes introduction of basic technical exercises in the first training session.</p><p>The Zumba sessions were conducted at a fitness centre located 3 km from the hospital, and consisted of continuous dance-movements to Latin music with varying intensity level throughout the sessions. Each session was initiated with low-intensity movements for the first 5 min, followed by an increasing intensity throughout the workout. At the end of the training session, the intensity was gradually reduced. The Zumba sessions were supervised by 3 certified Zumba instructors, each responsible for regular sessions per week.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Prior experience and familiarity to the activities</title><p>In the soccer group, the participants reported to have little or no previous experience with soccer. In the Zumba group, three of the participants reported to have performed 2&#x02013;3 sessions of Zumba at a local Fitness Centre prior to the study. The other 36 participants reported no previous experience with Zumba.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Measurement procedures pre, during and post the intervention</title><p>All consenters were invited to several measurements at baseline (between January 3 and 7, 2011), after 12 (follow-up test 1, between April 4 and 15, 2011) and 40 weeks (follow-up test 2, between October 17 and 28, 2011). These measurements included anthropometric data, i.e. body weight (kg) and height (cm) from which the body mass index (BMI) was calculated. The measurements of health and capacity are described in details elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0115059-Barene1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and included e.g. maximal oxygen consumption test (incremental cycle ergometer test), body composition test (DXA-scan) and fasting blood sampling (e.g. plasma osteocalcin, leptin, glucose, cholesterol). The participants were requested not to perform any kind of exhaustive exercise the day before test. The group allocation was concealed for the test leader.</p><p>The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire <xref rid="pone.0115059-Kuorinka1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> was used to examine muscle pain intensity and duration in different body regions. Out of the total number of 107 female participants in the study, 103 completed the questionnaire. The questions &#x0201c;please indicate the pain intensity in the [body] region the past 7 days&#x0201d; with response categories on a Likert scale from 0 to 10 (0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;no pain, 10&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;maximal pain), and &#x0201c;please indicate the number of days with pain in the [body region] the past 3 months&#x0201d;. The body regions were the neck-shoulder and the lower back, respectively.</p><p>Work ability was measured by the single-item from the Work Ability Index (WAI) by Ilmarinen (2004). The questions were; &#x0201c;Please indicate your current work ability compared with lifetime best on a scale from 0 to 10&#x0201d; (0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;completely unable to work, 10&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;work ability at its best).</p><p>Borg&#x02019;s Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) during work was measured with the question; &#x0201c;Please indicate the level of perceived physical exertion during work on a 15 category scale from 6 to 20&#x0201d; (6&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;no exertion at all, 20&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;maximal exertion) <xref rid="pone.0115059-Borg1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Before initiation of the study, a power calculation was carried out for the primary outcome, VO<sub>2</sub>max. Power was set at 0.8 with a significant level of 0.05. Based on previous workplace studies aiming to increase VO<sub>2</sub>max using comparable physical exercise interventions, an average improvement of 5% with a standard deviation of 10 from baseline values was expected. Based on these assumptions, 32 participants were needed for comparison between each respective intervention group and the control group. Calculations of intra-cluster correlation coefficient were conducted on all outcome variables and revealed a modest within subject correlation with p ranging from 0.2 to 0.6. The model assumptions for applying analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) (i.e. normal distribution of outcome variables, correlations between covariates, homogeneity of regression and linearity) were evaluated before performing the statistical analyses. For evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention, ANCOVA analyses with adjustment for baseline values of BMI and cluster affiliation were performed in accordance to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, i.e. all randomized participants were included in the analyses, with missing values substituted using standard carry forward or backwards procedures <xref rid="pone.0115059-Antes1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. BMI was considered to be a potential confounder due to a modest difference in baseline BMI between one of the intervention groups and the control group, whereas cluster affiliation was used to limit any intra cluster correlation bias. To avoid false negative results, further explorative analyses were performed using the ANCOVA model with BMI as covariate including data from only the participants who completed both the pre and post-tests (defined as per protocol analyses). All results are given as contrast estimates between the intervention groups and the control group, respectively, together with an associated confidence interval and level of significance. <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 is defined as level of statistical significance, and is based on the estimated marginal means with BMI as covariate. The Bonferroni method correcting for multiple statistical tests was used for post hoc-analyses. IBM SPSS Statistics version 22 was used for all statistical analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline characteristics of the population</title><p>The average age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI) and work seniority were 45.8&#x000b1;9.3 yrs, 70.6&#x000b1;9.7 kg, 166.9&#x000b1;5.9 cm, 25.3&#x000b1;3.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and 78&#x000b1;64 months, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115059.s002">S1 Table</xref>).

The main findings were improvements in pain intensity and duration in the neck-shoulder region in both training groups compared to the control group. Furthermore, the Zumba group showed a tendency for improvement in work ability after 12 weeks compared to the control group. No intervention effects were observed in RPE during work.</p><p>In the present study, the soccer group significantly reduced pain intensity in the neck-shoulder region both after 12 weeks (&#x02212;69%) and 40 weeks (&#x02212;62%) weeks compared to the control group. These relatively considerable improvements were observed when including all participants in the soccer group (i.e. both those with and without pain at baseline) in an intention-to-treat analyses. This finding supports that soccer leads to reductions in pain intensity of the neck-shoulder region among female hospital employees. In the Zumba group, a similarly significant reduction in neck-shoulder pain intensity was observed after 12 weeks (&#x02212;62%), with no significant difference after 40 weeks (&#x02212;26%, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.13). These findings were supported by calculations of effect-sizes (beta squared values&#x0003e;0.09), which may indicate moderate clinical effects from both intervention groups after 12 weeks. Furthermore, the findings are in accordance with previous workplace health promotion studies observing positive effects on neck-shoulder pain intensity from strengthening and/or stretching exercises among different occupational groups <xref rid="pone.0115059-Pedersen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0115059-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>After 40 weeks, both intervention groups significantly decreased the number of days with neck-shoulder pain compared to the control group, i.e. &#x02212;16.4 (P&#x0003c;0.02) and &#x02212;16.6 (P&#x0003c;0.01) days in the soccer and the Zumba group respectively.

However, the explanation for the lack of effect on lower back pain is unknown.</p><p>After 12 weeks, the Zumba group showed a tendency for improvement in work ability compared to the control group (7%, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.14), with no such change in the soccer group (4%, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.84). Apart from a recent intervention study demonstrating that strength training may prevent deterioration of work ability <xref rid="pone.0115059-Sundstrup1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, no previous randomized controlled workplace physical training intervention study has observed improvements in work ability after 12 weeks. The present study did not reveal any intervention effects on work ability after 40 weeks. The improvement in work ability in the Zumba group after 12 weeks may be due the corresponding &#x0223c;7% improvement in aerobic capacity compared to the control group <xref rid="pone.0115059-Barene1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, as the latter study revealed a similar improvement in aerobic capacity in the soccer group, this may not be the only explanation to the improvement in work ability.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated a linear relationship between RPE and cardiovascular fitness <xref rid="pone.0115059-Borg2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0115059-Borg3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Furthermore, it is suggested that RPE provides information on the balance between work demands and the capacity to perform work, and that RPE therefore may be modulated both by lowering physical work demands and by increasing physical capacity <xref rid="pone.0115059-Andersen2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Neither of the intervention groups revealed significant changes in the RPE during work compared to the control group after 12 or 40 weeks. The explanation may be the relatively moderate RPE at work before the intervention (average score of 10 on a scale from 6 to 20). The lack of effect in RPE in the present study is in accordance to a previous workplace physical training intervention study, which also demonstrated improvement in aerobic capacity among construction workers <xref rid="pone.0115059-Gram1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Hence, apart from one previous workplace physical training intervention study showing improvement in RPE during work among female nurses after 12 month follow-up <xref rid="pone.0115059-Horneij1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, it may seem that workplace training intervention studies do not improve RPE at work, even in workgroups characterized by high physical work demands.</p><p>A strength of the present study was the cluster-randomized controlled design and intention-to-treat evaluation, which is considered to be the gold standard in evaluating interventions <xref rid="pone.0115059-Schulz1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. ITT-analyses were considered to be the most adequate statistical analyses method because missing values were not at random. Additional strengths were the high adherence to the training intervention during the first 12 weeks, as well as the relatively high response rates to the questionnaire at baseline (95%), after 12 (84%) and 40 (64%) weeks. These response rates were calculated on the basis of the number of participants who were randomized after the baseline test (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;107).</p><p>Limitations of the study are the relatively moderate adherence to training in both intervention groups between week 12 and 40. Despite of several significant results, the relatively high drop-out rate towards the 40 weeks may have influenced on the statistical power. Furthermore, because we only have information about 5 of the 553 female employees who did not participate in the study, we do not know if the participants are representative for all invited workers at the hospital. In this context, there are some uncertainties with regard to the generalizability. However, in general we consider the employees in the present Hospital to be representative to other Hospitals in Norway or abroad. Another possible bias is the lack of control for leisure time physical activities taking place outside the intervention. Seasonal variations in physical activity patterns due to climatic characteristics in areas north of the Arctic Circle may be a confounder to the study because it could lead to differences in physical activity pattern between the control group and the intervention groups. Moreover, self-reported data represents a potential bias in the present study. However, we have no reason to believe that the intervention groups respond different to the questions compared to the control group.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study indicates that workplace initiated twice-weekly soccer and Zumba training reduce pain intensity in the neck-shoulder region after only 12 weeks, whereas only the soccer group revealed improvement in pain intensity in the neck-shoulder region after 40 weeks.
