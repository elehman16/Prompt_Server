The children and adolescents aged from 10 to 17 years were selected by random sampling. The children/adolescents were randomized into one control and further divided into two groups. The National High Blood Pressure Education Program fourth report (2004) and anthropometric body mass index (BMI), food frequency questionnaire (PURE) were followed in the study.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Out of 3906 children, 2107 were girls and 1799 boys. On screening, we found 9.5% to be hypertensive with the prevalence rate of boys and girls 8% and 10.8%, respectively. Overall obesity was 2.7%, (boys 2%, girls 3.32%); hypertensives and normotensives were 8.4% and 2.1%, respectively. We found that overweight (odds ratio [OR]: 2.06 [1.40&#x02013;3.01] 95% confidence interval [CI]), obese children (OR: 1.21 [2.72&#x02013;6.48] 95% CI), and those with a family history of HT (OR: 1.66 [1.20&#x02013;2.30] 95% CI) had increased risk of hypertension. Females were 1.39 times (OR: 1.39 [1.11&#x02013;1.72] 95% CI) more at risk of getting HT.

A previous worldwide report records the prevalence of hypertension in children as ranging from 3% to 16.2%.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The diversity of the results in hypertension studies stems from the different criteria used, selection of the age group and study population (ethnic), study area (urban and rural), culture, as well as dietary habits (socioeconomic).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This study was to detect the prevalence and risk factors of hypertension in children/adolescents aged 10 to 17 years.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The objectives and the importance of the study were first explained to the teachers and parents. The children/adolescents aged 10&#x02013;17 years in each selected school in Chennai were examined. Two field survey teams, each comprising a medical officer and a social scientist were formed. The physician elicited medical history and carried out clinical examination including measurement of blood pressure (BP). The social scientist recorded the background information such as the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and anthropometric measurements. After getting the child to sit for five minutes, with the back supported and both feet on the floor, systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP) were measured on the right arm extended over a table at the level of heart with a calibrated standard sphygmomanometer. A set of different sized cuffs was used to circle the arm completely up to two-thirds of the upper arm without overlapping. Systolic pressure was recorded when the initial sound was heard (Phase I of the Korotkoff sound); diastolic pressure was recorded at the disappearance of the sound (Phase V of the Korotkoff sound). The cuff was deflated at a rate not &#x0003e;2 mmHg/s. BP was taken three times at 2&#x02013;3 min intervals. The arithmetic mean of these three sitting BP measurements was used as the mean sitting office BP (MSSBP). A cross check of 5&#x02013;7% of the hypertension subjects at different times by different teams was done for both accuracy and consistency. All BP measurements were recorded in the source documents. Every effort was made to avoid staff-child interaction, such as talking, in order to maximize reproducibility. Every effort was made to have the same staff member take the BP measurements of the same child, at the same time of day, using the same equipment.</p><p>Hypertension was defined as MSSBP above the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for age, gender, and height as per recommendation of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on high BP in children/adolescents (NHBPEP Fourth Report 2004).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The height and weight were measured with the child standing without shoes; body mass index (BMI) was calculated for all children/adolescents. They were categorized according to their BMI as obese (or) overweight. Information on risk factors for hypertension like family history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus were asked for their socioeconomic status was also assessed. Their reduced physical activities (arbitrarily children who engaged in a physical activity &#x0003c;30 min for 4 days per week) posed a high risk. Hours of watching television and their monthly consumption of oil were also noted as high risk factors. The fourth report on the diagnosis, evaluation and treatment of high BP in children and adolescents is an authentic source of childhood and adolescent hypertension (2004). In this report, BP is classified into three categories based on percentile values [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Definition and classification of hypertension in children/adolescents</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JFCM-23-38-g001"/></table-wrap><p>We followed the same FFQ-PURE study from the South India described earlier[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] for the study monthly per capital income was assessed by the children with a score of 16&#x02013;29, and above; modified Kuppusamy scale (2007) was assigned to the upper socioeconomic status and &#x0003c;15 lower socioeconomic status.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The factors found to be significant by univariate analysis, namely the family history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, high socioeconomic status, and female gender were included for multivariate analysis.

In both sexes, blood pressure increased progressively with age. The gradual increase in mean systolic and diastolic BP of boys and girls with age noted agrees with the findings in the task force committee report and other studies.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The mean SBP for boys in various age groups were higher than girls. The difference in diastolic pressure between boys and girls was negligible. The varying results may be due to varying age groups in the study, the different criteria adopted to define hypertension, and the basic differences between racial groups as relates to geographic, dietary, and cultural factors.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In this study, there were more hypertensive girls (10.8%) than boys (8.0%), results which do not correlate with those of other studies,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in which hypertensive boys were 11.9%; girls were 11.4%; prevalence of overweight (7.87%) and obesity (3.32%) in girls was higher than overweight (2.17%) and obesity (2%) in boys.</p><p>In our study, the prevalence of obesity was 2.7%, which is higher than that reported by another another study.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The reason for the increased prevalence could be the changing lifestyles. Positive family history of diabetes mellitus among hypertensives was 5.3% as against 3.6% in normotensives, which is similar to the study by Chanda <italic>et al</italic>., in which it was 5.4% in hypertensives and 3.1% in normotensives.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Hypertension in obese children/adolescents was 8.35%, which was twice what was observed by other study groups.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In this study, there was a positive family history of hypertension in 8.3%, which is less than what was observed by another Indian study.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Significant risk factors for hypertension in adolescents in our study by univariate analysis were obesity, overweight, and a positive family history of hypertension, which agreed with a previous study.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>There is an increasing trend toward a high prevalence of hypertension in children of school age as a result of obesity and positive family history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. High socioeconomic status, faulty lifestyle, dietary habits, and physical inactivity are key factors which must be dealt with immediately and aggressively. Based on our findings, hypertension is no more a disease that comes at a later stage in life. It has its roots in the young. It is crucial to advise obese children to modify their lifestyle with respect to diet, exercise, and salt intake to maintain a normal BP and avoid the childhood onset of adult hypertension.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We sincerely thank Director, (ICH and HC, Chennai) for support of this work.
