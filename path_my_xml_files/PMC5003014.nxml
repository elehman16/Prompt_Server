Students whose mental health deteriorates during this long period of study are less likely to become empathic and productive physicians. In addition to other specific stressors, academic examinations seem to further induce medical school-related stress and anxiety. Combined group and individual resource-oriented coaching early in medical education might reduce examination-related stress and anxiety and, consequently, enhance academic performance. Good quality evidence, however, remains scarce. In this study, therefore, we explored the question of whether coaching affects examination-related stress and health in medical students.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial. Students who registered for the first medical academic examination in August 2014 at the University of L&#x000fc;beck were recruited and randomized into three groups. The intervention groups 1 and 2 received a 1-hour psychoeducative seminar. Group 1 additionally received two 1-hour sessions of individual coaching during examination preparation. Group 3 served as a control group. We compared changes in self-rated general health (measured by a single item), anxiety and depression (measured by the hospital anxiety and depression scale), as well as medical school stress (measured by the perceived medical school stress instrument). In order to further investigate the influence of group allocation on perceived medical school stress, we conducted a linear regression analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We saw a significant deterioration of general health and an increase in anxiety and depression scores in medical students while preparing for an examination. We found a small, but statistically significant, effect of group allocation on the development of perceived medical school stress. However, we could not differentiate between the effects of group coaching only and group coaching in combination with two sessions of individual coaching.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The health of medical students deteriorated while preparing for an examination. Short-term resource-oriented coaching might be an effective means of reducing medical school stress in candidates preparing for an examination.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>education</kwd><kwd>medical</kwd><kwd>undergraduate</kwd><kwd>students</kwd><kwd>medical</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>psychological</kwd><kwd>health promotion</kwd><kwd>resilience</kwd><kwd>psychological</kwd><kwd>counseling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is ample evidence that the years spent in acquiring medical education is a stressful and difficult period in the life of many students.<xref rid="b1-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Starting at a good level,<xref rid="b2-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> the health and well-being of medical students seems to deteriorate throughout their education,<xref rid="b3-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> resulting in high rates of, for example, burnout and depression by the time of graduation<xref rid="b4-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and residency.<xref rid="b5-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Burnt out medical students and residents, however, seem less likely to be(come) empathetic and productive physicians.<xref rid="b7-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In addition to the individual burden, it is thus considered a systemic problem.<xref rid="b9-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Academic examinations seem to further provoke medical school-related stress and anxiety.<xref rid="b10-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Leading to a vicious circle, examination-related stress and anxiety may impair the academic performance of susceptible future doctors.<xref rid="b11-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> There is evidence that female medical students are more prone to examination-related stress and anxiety.<xref rid="b12-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Since in many countries, to date, the majority of medical students are females; this finding is particularly important.<xref rid="b14-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The large amount of content to be learnt for an examination, the self-expectation to perform well, concern about poor marks, the long duration of periods of assessment, and a lack of exercise are among other factors associated with examination-related stress and anxiety.<xref rid="b15-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>In her meta-analysis of the results of anxiety-reduction programs, Ergene<xref rid="b17-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> concluded that: &#x0201c;individually conducted programs, along with programs that combined individual and group counseling formats, produced the greatest changes&#x0201d;.

During this seminar, a psychologist addressed issues, such as emotional reactions toward stressors, unconscious persistence of unprocessed negative emotions, and the relationship of the procession of stressful events and sleep. At the end of the seminar, all participants were surveyed using a paper&#x02013;pencil questionnaire (t1).</p><p>Students in group 1 received two 1-hour sessions of manual-based individual coaching by trained psychologists and physicians within an interval of 2 weeks. The coaching was based on the so-called wingwave<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Besser Siegmund Institut, Hamburg, Germany) method. wingwave uses a finger-strength test derived from the Bi-Digital-O-Ring-Test for the determination of unconscious stressors following a standardized protocol.<xref rid="b22-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In order to process identified stressors, elements of eye movement desensitization and reprocession, and neurolinguistic programming techniques were applied.<xref rid="b22-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In several sessions ahead of the study period, four experienced wingwave coaches developed coaching techniques specifically for medical students in the examination preparation phase and wrote a standardized manual. As this coaching was not primarily designed to identify and treat deficits but to foster individual stress-management resources (&#x0201c;resilience&#x0201d; as defined by Zautra et al),<xref rid="b24-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> we labeled the intervention &#x0201c;resource-oriented coaching&#x0201d;.<xref rid="b25-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> During the first coaching session, students in group 1 received a universal serial bus memory stick containing hemisphere-stimulating music<xref rid="b26-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and were instructed on how to use it.</p><p>Following the psychoeducative seminar, students in group 2 received a universal serial bus memory stick containing hemisphere-stimulating music<xref rid="b26-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and an instruction sheet explaining how to use it.</p><p>Students in groups 1 and 2 were instructed to listen to the 20-minute piece of electronic music twice daily, before and during learning.</p><p>Students in group 3 served as control subjects and did not receive any intervention (&#x0201c;treatment as usual&#x0201d;).

By inviting those participants in the treatment group to participate in the psychoeducative seminar (described earlier), the students were immediately informed of their allocation to either control or treatment group. In a second step, the participants in the treatment group were randomly allocated to treatment groups 1 and 2 (randomization 2).

Data were missing from the responses of five students in the intervention group and seven in the control group, respectively.

Overall, 35 male and 70 female students (M =24.2 years, SD =2.6) with an age range between 19 and 32 years participated in this study (66% of the whole class).

We found a small, but statistically significant effect on the development of perceived medical school stress in the coaching group(s). However, due to the shortfall in the number of participants, we are not able to differentiate between the effects of group coaching only versus group coaching accompanied by two sessions of individual coaching.</p><p>To our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate not only the efficacy of resource-oriented coaching in the preparation phase before a medical academic examination, but also, at the same time, to take a closer look at the development of general and mental health while preparing for the examination.</p><p>For the whole study population, regardless of allocation to treatment or not, we saw a deterioration of general health and a rise of depression and anxiety levels during a relatively short time period of just over 3 weeks. Perceived medical school stress did not increase in the whole study population, which might have been caused by the identified effect of coaching on this variable, since it did increase in the control group (<italic>P</italic>=0.14, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-amep-7-497">Table 3</xref>). These observational findings show the significant level of stress induced by examination has a measurable negative impact on not only the mental, but also the general health of the medical students. Examination stress has been identified as an important reason for the deterioration of medical students&#x02019; health throughout their education.<xref rid="b10-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Reducing the number of examinations and enhancing their design in order to mainly test knowledge and not primarily induce stress might thus be a promising starting point for health promotion in medical school students.<xref rid="b40-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>When looking at the development of perceived medical school stress more closely, we saw a statistically significant difference between the t2&#x02212;t1 &#x00394; of the groups and a similar significant prediction of the PMSS t2-score by group allocation. Given the small effect size and absolute differences, we have to interpret this finding with caution. What we can say is that it might indicate the efficacy of a resource-oriented coaching program for candidates preparing for medical academic examination. This has been shown to be the case for other stress management techniques in a number of quantitative and qualitative studies.<xref rid="b41-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b43-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> However, it remains unclear whether the stress-reducing efficacy of the interventions employed in this and other studies stems from certain methodological components or it can merely be seen as an unspecific effect of support during the examination preparation phase.</p><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Unfortunately, due to a merging of the intended two coaching groups, we were not able to decide whether group coaching alone or group coaching combined with sessions of individual coaching is the more promising approach to reduce perceived medical school stress while preparing for examination. Also, as group allocation was not concealed; t1 measures were completed after randomization; and the students, coaches, and investigators were not blinded, the differences between the groups at both t1 and t2 might have been influenced by a certain amount of frustration in the control group in not having received coaching. The 1-hour psychoeducative seminar might also have had an influence on the intervention groups&#x02019; t1 score. However, we did not find any statistically significant differences between the groups at t1. Furthermore, it seems less likely that surveying the intervention group after the seminar led to an overestimation of the observed effect (or type I error) compared with an underestimation (or type II error). The randomized controlled design of our study can, nevertheless, be seen as a major strength when compared to other existing studies in this field, which are preponderantly nonrandomized and do not include control groups at all.<xref rid="b20-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b44-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The risk of selection bias can hence be estimated as low. Outcomes were determined in the same way in all groups bearing a low risk of social desirability by using a web survey completed at home.<xref rid="b45-amep-7-497" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> The low dropout rate makes attrition bias due to incomplete outcome data unlikely.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>Future studies in this setting have to be designed to anticipate a higher dropout rate in order to avoid any power problems. Avoiding potential frustration through not receiving an intervention might be possible by employing a waiting-list-control design. It might prove helpful to identify students &#x0201c;in need of coaching&#x0201d; and recruit them for future, similar studies in order to depict a more realistic scenario (as students without a subjective need are less likely to benefit from such an intervention). In order to identify method-specific effects, and especially effective components of stress management programs, comparative mixed methods studies employing different kinds of interventions are required.</p><p>Our results show an urgent need for accompanying health promoting measures during the medical academic examination preparation phase.
