Different Western countries have taken various approaches to its treatment, which includes conducting clinical studies of neoadjuvant chemotherapy without radiotherapy and following the &#x02018;watch and wait&#x02019; philosophy [<xref rid="MDW162C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], but the standard treatment for rectal cancer is to perform total mesorectal excision following preoperative radiation (or chemoradiation) therapy. In Japan, D3 dissection with autonomic nerve preservation, a technique in which the lateral lymph nodes are dissected while preserving the autonomic nerves of the pelvis without neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, is carried out to improve treatment outcomes for locally advanced rectal cancer [<xref rid="MDW162C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Preventing distant recurrence and achieving local control are important challenges that the East and West have in common, and use of adjuvant chemotherapy has been studied. Among the clinical trials comparing adjuvant chemotherapy regimens that have been conducted, only the ADORE randomized phase II study showed that adjuvant chemotherapy including oxaliplatin after preoperative chemoradiation therapy (CRT) is useful in treating rectal cancer [<xref rid="MDW162C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, no phase III study comparing adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for rectal cancer has demonstrated the superiority of a specific regimen.</p><p>Oral tegafur&#x02013;uracil (UFT) is a combination drug that contains tegafur, a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and uracil, an inhibitor of the 5-FU-degrading enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). A 1-year regimen of adjuvant chemotherapy with UFT following curative resection for stage III rectal cancer showed benefits compared with surgery alone in a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) [<xref rid="MDW162C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We believe these findings support that, even though 6 months of adjuvant treatment is the typical treatment for colon cancer in Japan, 1-year administration of UFT as adjuvant chemotherapy should be the standard treatment for curatively resected locally advanced rectal cancer.</p><p>S-1 combines tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium in a molar ratio of 1:0.4:1. Oteracil potassium inhibits the phosphorylation of 5-FU in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby reducing gastrointestinal toxicity. As gimeracil is an extremely strong inhibitor of DPD, &#x0223c;180 times stronger than uracil [<xref rid="MDW162C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The effectiveness of S-1 as adjuvant chemotherapy has been demonstrated in RCTs in patients with stage III colon cancer following curative resection [<xref rid="MDW162C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. S-1 has been studied in combination with oxaliplatin or irinotecan for metastatic colorectal cancer, and the noninferiority of regimens including S-1 to standard multidrug chemotherapy has been proved in phase III studies [<xref rid="MDW162C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="MDW162C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>We therefore conducted an open-label, multicenter, randomized, controlled study, JFMC35-C1 (ACTS-RC), to evaluate the superiority of S-1 to UFT in the adjuvant setting for stage II/III rectal cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="mdw162_s2"><title>patients and methods</title><sec id="mdw162_s2a"><title>patients</title><p>The inclusion criteria were histologically proven rectal adenocarcinoma, stage II or stage III rectal cancer (pathological T3-4, N0 or any T, N1-2) (TNM Classification, UICC 6th Edition, 2002), with (systematic) D2 or D3 lymph node dissection, curatively resected, age 20&#x02013;80 years, no prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy, ability to take oral drugs, and adequate organ function.

Stratification factors were institution, tumor location (above the peritoneal reflection versus below the peritoneal reflection and anal canal), depth of invasion (T1, T2 versus T3, T4), and lymph node metastasis (N0 versus N1, N2). Investigators and patients were not masked to treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="mdw162_s2c"><title>procedures</title><p>Patients were enrolled within 42 days after surgery and started study treatment within 7 days after enrollment. UFT was orally administered at one of two dosages according to body surface area (BSA) (500 mg/day for BSA &#x0003c;1.25 m<sup>2</sup>; 600 mg/day for BSA &#x02265;1.25 m<sup>2</sup>). The dosage was divided into two daily doses administered after meals for 5 consecutive days, followed by a 2-day rest period. Follow-up was conducted after 1 year of treatment with UFT. S-1 was orally administered at dosages according to BSA (80 mg/day for BSA &#x0003c;1.25 m<sup>2</sup>; 100 mg/day for BSA 1.25&#x02013;1.50 m<sup>2</sup>; 120 mg/day for BSA &#x02265;1.50 m<sup>2</sup>). The dosage was divided into two daily doses after meals for 28 consecutive days, followed by a 14-day rest period. Follow-up was conducted after 1 year of treatment with S-1. A complete blood count and liver and renal function tests were required before each cycle of treatment. The dose was reduced when criteria for dose reduction were met. Shortening of the cycle (e.g. to 14 days on and 7 days off) was considered for S-1 arm patients when gastrointestinal toxicities of grade 1 were judged to have occurred due to administration of S-1 for a consecutive period of 14 days or longer. Recurrence was assessed using computed tomography imaging, colonoscopy, and tumor markers. These tests were carried out every 4 months during the first 2 years after surgery and once every 6 months from the third year onward.</p></sec><sec id="mdw162_s2d"><title>statistical analysis</title><p>For this study, the primary end point was relapse-free survival (RFS) and the secondary end points were overall survival (OS) and adverse events. Assuming a 70% 5-year RFS rate for UFT in this study for stage II/III rectal cancer and a 0.70 hazard ratio (HR) of S-1 to UFT, the necessary enrollment number was calculated to be 762 using Schoenfeld and Richter's formula with an enrollment period of 3 years, a follow-up period of 5 years, <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 0.05 (two-sided), and statistical power of 80%. The target sample size of 800 was calculated assuming an ineligibility rate of &#x0223c;5%. The planned enrollment period was 3 years, but the target enrollment number of 800 patients was reached in 2 years and 6 months. Nevertheless, enrollment was continued for 3 years as planned because enrollment of 762&#x02013;987 patients was necessary to obtain statistical power of 80%&#x02013;89%. An interim efficacy analysis was carried out in this study. Although the level of significance for the entire study was <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 0.05, the final analysis was carried out at <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 0.049 because <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 0.001 was subtracted at the time of the interim analysis to adjust for multiplicity. RFS was defined as the length of time from the date of surgery until the diagnosis of recurrence or death from any cause, whichever came first. OS was defined as the length of time from the date of surgery until death from any cause. Stratified log-rank tests with all stratification factors except for institution were used to assess superiority in terms of RFS in all enrolled patients (two-sided tests with a significance level of 5%). The RFS and OS curves were estimated using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method. To estimate the cumulative recurrences by each location (local/distant), respective recurrences were considered as events; recurrences other than these and deaths were censored at the time of their occurrence. These were reported as cumulative recurrences using the reverse Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method. Distant recurrences were defined as hematogenous recurrences and lymphatic recurrences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdw162/-/DC1">supplementary Appendix S1, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>).

The reason that no difference in OS of both arms was found is probably that the unexpectedly favorable survival rate achieved through post-trial treatment of patients after recurrence in both arms caused the follow-up period of 5.5 years to be too short and the study to be underpowered.</p><p>Though the standard treatment in the West is to perform preoperative radiation (or chemoradiation) therapy, past trials have shown that radiation reduces the rate of local recurrence but does not improve prognosis [<xref rid="MDW162C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which is why CRT is not always performed all over the world. The standard treatment in Japan has traditionally been surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy, and the 5-year survival rate in this study (&#x02265;80% in both arms) appears comparable with the results of past studies of CRT in the West. It is surprising that such favorable outcomes were achieved just with surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy.</p><p>The results of the subgroup analysis of RFS showed a significant interaction between regimen and age (&#x0003c;70 versus &#x02265;70 years) and marginally significant interactions of regimen with sex (male/female) and with T factor (T1, 2/T3, 4). The higher incidence of adverse events of &#x02265;grade 3 observed in elderly patients aged &#x02265;70 years may be attributable to increased 5-FU blood levels caused by reduced excretion of gimeracil, a renally excreted ingredient of S-1, due to the decreased renal function of these patients. In addition, patients with advanced T-stage disease are thought to have more micrometastases, which means that intensive adjuvant therapy is more valuable for advanced-stage disease in the case of rectal cancer as well as colon cancer [<xref rid="MDW162C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, S-1 might have been more effective in these patients due to its greater anti-tumor activity. We cannot identify the reason for the interactions with sex.</p><p>Although adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy with or without oxaliplatin following preoperative CRT is recommended in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for adjuvant chemotherapy, its benefits remain controversial [<xref rid="MDW162C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The main phase III studies of adjuvant chemotherapy have discontinued enrollment due to poor accrual [<xref rid="MDW162C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and no large clinical trials have produced results. One reason why postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy has not been proven effective is poor compliance. In the EORTC 22 921 study, 27% of the eligible patients never started adjuvant chemotherapy [<xref rid="MDW162C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and the treatment completion rate was only 43% for patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy. As a result, the 5-year local recurrence rates for the CRT arm and the CRT plus adjuvant chemotherapy arm were 10.9% and 10.7%, respectively, and the 5-year distant recurrence rates were 32.1% and 29.8%, respectively [<xref rid="MDW162C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], indicating that adjuvant chemotherapy did not contribute to the prevention of recurrence. Preoperative CRT may have decreased compliance with adjuvant chemotherapy, thereby causing adjuvant chemotherapy to not produce the results that would otherwise be expected.</p><p>In the S-1 arm of this study, adjuvant chemotherapy was started in 470 patients after excluding 9 patients who discontinued before treatment. The completion rate at 6 months after treatment initiation was 76.2% and the completion rate for 1-year administration was 61.3%, indicating that compliance was favorable. S-1 was more effective in preventing both distant recurrence and local recurrence than UFT. The 5-year cumulative local recurrence rate for the S-1 arm was 9.8%, which is not inferior to results from Western studies that include preoperative therapies [<xref rid="MDW162C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="MDW162C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, the 5-year cumulative rate of distant recurrence for the S-1 arm was 24.7%, which seems to be superior to 5-year cumulative distant recurrence rates from Western studies [<xref rid="MDW162C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="MDW162C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Rectal cancer patients will greatly benefit from being able to undergo surgery without preoperative therapy and taking only oral drugs for adjuvant chemotherapy.</p><p>This study was the first randomized phase III trial to compare adjuvant chemotherapy regimens using two 5-FU derivatives in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer and without preoperative CRT, and it demonstrated the superiority of S-1 treatment over UFT treatment in terms of RFS. Future studies must evaluate whether 1-year adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 can also prevent distant metastases following preoperative CRT. Use of such relatively mild adjuvant chemotherapy with a single oral anticancer agent to prevent distant recurrence may improve compliance with adjuvant chemotherapy after preoperative CRT.</p><p>One potential limitation of our study is that we do not know whether our results can be directly extrapolated to patients of different ethnic origin because the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of S-1 might vary [<xref rid="MDW162C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="MDW162C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For instance, S-1 could potentially cause a high incidence of gastrointestinal toxicities in Caucasian patients if administered at the dose used in this study.</p><p>In conclusion, 1-year S-1 treatment has become a standard adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for stage II/III rectal cancer following curative resection. S-1 can be considered an important option, especially for patients who have not received preoperative CRT.</p></sec><sec id="mdw162_s5"><title>funding</title><p>This work was supported by JFMC with funding from <funding-source>Taiho Pharmaceutical Co.
