Despite provision of evidence-based treatments, including antidepressant medication and psychological treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy, a substantial amount of patients do not recover. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has been found to be effective in reducing relapse in recurrent depression, as well as lowering symptom levels in acute depression.

It has a large impact on individual&#x02019;s wellbeing and leads to high societal costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The duration of a depressive episode is highly variable. Whereas the majority of people in the general population with a major depressive episode recovers within several months, approximately 20&#x000a0;% of all depressed patients develop a chronic course of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The latter is associated with higher suicidality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], increased comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, and impaired physical and psychosocial functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. According to DSM-IV criteria, a depressive episode is defined as chronic if the depressive episode persists for at least two years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, results of a large prospective epidemiological study on the prevalence of major depression in the Dutch population show, that -even if treated in mental health care- the rate of recovery decreases after a few months. After one year, recovery rates virtually stagnate, meaning that if no recovery has taken place within 12&#x000a0;months the probability to develop a chronic course of depression- as defined in the DSM-IV- increases substantially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Not only a chronic course of symptoms but also several unsuccessful therapeutic interventions can be indicative of a severe depressive episode. Patients who do not respond to treatment are often described as &#x02018;treatment-resistant&#x02019;. However, up till now, an unified and clear definition of &#x02018;treatment-resistant depression&#x02019; is lacking. Definitions range from one single unsuccessful attempt at antidepressant medication (ADM) to several pharmacological interventions combined with electro-convulsive therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In most clinical studies, a depressive episode is regarded as treatment-resistant when successive treatment with two antidepressants has not led to a significant improvement of depressive symptoms. Interestingly, this definition does not take response to psychological treatment into account, while cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) are part of international treatment guidelines for recurrent and chronic depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Importantly, research has shown that even when psychological and pharmacological treatment options are combined, a substantial amount of patients fails to respond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This means that there is a dire need of new treatment options for chronic, treatment resistant depression.</p><p>In recent years, mindfulness based interventions have been developed as a treatment focused on distress caused by long-lasting somatic and psychological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Mindfulness is defined as non-judgmental awareness of the present moment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and was introduced by Kabat-Zinn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] as a treatment option for patients with chronic somatic conditions. Segal, Williams and Teasdale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] adapted the program for patients with recurrent depression, naming it &#x02018;Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy&#x02019; (MBCT). MBCT is a group intervention, consisting of eight weekly 2.5&#x000a0;h sessions and a silent day of 6&#x000a0;h. It involves meditation exercises as well as cognitive behavioral techniques. MBCT is designed to address processes that are associated with the onset, maintenance and recurrence of depression, such as maladaptive automatic cognitive and behavioral patterns in reaction to negative emotions or thoughts. In first instance participants are taught to allow and acknowledge negative emotions and thoughts as they are, without having judgments about them or reacting to them. In this way, they start recognizing their own maladaptive automatic patterns. By creating a greater awareness of habitual behavioral and cognitive patterns (e.g. avoidance or rumination) participants learn to deliberately disengage from them. Another important part of MBCT is to develop self-compassion. MBCT differs from CBT in the sense that the focus of cognitive therapy is more on the content of thoughts, while MBCT focuses on the process of thinking.</p><p>In chronic depression, maladaptive automatic cognitive and behavioral patterns often have become habitual. Patients often experienced several episodes of depression and an early onset of the disorder. To learn to react in a different way to these maladaptive automatic cognitive and behavioral patterns and to develop a non-judgmental awareness of depressive symptoms might be especially useful for this population. Therefore MBCT might be effective in lowering depressive symptoms in chronic, treatment resistant depression.</p><p>A recent meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] shows that MBCT is effective in preventing relapse in patients with recurrent depression. Additionally, there is evidence, that MBCT not only decreases chance of relapse of depression, but that it lowers levels of residual or current depressive symptoms. The first studies investigating the effect of MBCT on residual symptoms in remitted depressed patients found significant improvements of depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. More recently, a meta-analysis was conducted on the effects of MBCT in patients currently meeting diagnostic criteria for a major depressive disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The authors concluded that MBCT reduces depressive symptoms in currently depressed patients and might be as effective as CBT. One of the studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] included in the meta-analysis specifically investigated possible differences of the effectiveness of MBCT between remitted but still symptomatic and currently depressed patients. The results indicate that MBCT was effective for both remitted and currently depressed patients.</p><p>First results indicate that MBCT might also be a promising treatment option for chronic depression. Kenny and Williams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] reported a decrease in depressive symptoms in a sample of currently depressed patients who experienced symptoms for one year or longer, preceded by three or more previous episodes. In line with that, Eisendrath et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] found a significant decrease in depressive symptoms after MBCT in currently depressed patients who previously received at least two different antidepressants before starting the MBCT training. In addition to these non-randomized studies, two randomized-controlled pilot trials demonstrated a significant reduction of depressive symptoms in chronically depressed patients. Barnhofer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] found that after following MBCT less participants met full criteria for a major depressive episode compared to a control group. Another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] investigated the effectiveness of person-based cognitive therapy, a therapy combining mindfulness techniques and cognitive therapy, in chronic depression and found significant improvement of depressive symptoms and mindfulness skills in the therapy group compared to the control group. Importantly, all of these studies report a good acceptance of the MBCT training procedures by chronically depressed patients.</p><p>In sum, there is preliminary evidence that MBCT might be effective in reducing depressive symptoms in chronic, treatment-resistant patients. However well-powered randomized controlled trials are necessary to systematically examine the effectiveness of MBCT compared to treatment as usual in this severely affected patient group. With the current ongoing trial we will hopefully contribute to the knowledge about treatment options for patients with persistent depressive symptoms. Taking into account the high risk for chronic depression if symptoms persist for more than one year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] we will recruit patients experiencing a depressive episode for 12&#x000a0;months or longer who underwent previous pharmacological and psychological treatment.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of MBCT compared to treatment as usual (TAU) on depressive symptoms in patients with a current depressive episode persisting for at least 12&#x000a0;months, who previously received pharmacological treatment, as well as either CBT or IPT. We hypothesize that patients who receive MBCT in addition to TAU will report lower levels of depressive symptoms, higher quality of life, and less rumination, compared to TAU alone. In addition, we expect that mindfulness skills and self-compassion will improve in the MBCT condition. Possible effects of level of treatment-resistance and experience of childhood trauma on treatment effect will also be investigated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>This study is a multi-center open-labeled randomized controlled trial with two groups: MBCT+ TAU vs. TAU.

Written informed consent is obtained during this first appointment. To assess eligibility and to classify comorbid psychiatric disorders, participants are interviewed by a research psychologist or psychiatrists in training with the depression, anxiety, psychosis and addiction modules of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]). In addition, the following disorder-related characteristics are assessed: duration of current major depressive episode, number of psychological treatment sessions (i.e. CBT and/or IPT) during current major depressive episode, duration and doses of pharmacological treatments during the current depressive episode, number of depressive episodes during lifetime and age of onset. On the base of these details the research assistant fills out the Dutch Measure for quantification of Treatment Resistant Depression (DM-TRD, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]). After completion of the baseline questionnaires, a computer program is used to randomly allocate patients to either MBCT&#x02009;+&#x02009;TAU or TAU. A minimization strategy is used for severity of symptoms (IDS-SR &#x02265;21 and &#x02264;31 vs. &#x0003e; 31 and&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;39 vs. &#x0003e;&#x02009;39) and duration of major depressive episode (1&#x02013;2 years vs. &#x0003e; 2&#x000a0;years). If the period between randomization and start of the MBCT training exceeds four weeks in the MBCT&#x02009;+&#x02009;TAU condition, a repeated baseline assessment takes place.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Follow-up assessments</title><p>The first follow-up measure takes place after the MBCT training or the TAU-period. The MINI depression module is administered face-to-face or by phone and participants fill out the questionnaires either online or on paper. Participants are asked about changes in pharmacological or psychological treatment during the study period. Also participants deciding to discontinue MBCT are asked to participate in follow-up measures. In all MBCT completers (MBCT&#x02009;+&#x02009;TAU and participants of the TAU group who followed the MBCT after the TAU-period), the same follow-up measures are administered at three and six months after end of treatment. Due to logistic reasons it is not possible to keep assessors blind. To assess the inter-rater reliability of the MINI, all diagnostic interviews are audio taped and a randomly selected sample will be reassessed by an independent rater.

With the DM-TRD several dimensions of treatment-resistance are scored by the clinician (duration, symptom severity, functional impairment, comorbid anxiety symptoms, prosocial stressors, treatment failures of pharmacological and psychological treatment) which leads to a total score ranging from 2&#x02013;26.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Childhood trauma</title><p>To assess the experience of traumatic childhood events, participants fill out the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-SF; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]).

Paper-based data collection forms only contain participant numbers to maintain participant confidentiality and are stored in a locked cabinet in an area with limited access. Electronic data files are password protected. The list linking participant number and personal information is stored in a separated password protected file. Paper-based data entry will be double checked. Data will be stored for 15&#x000a0;years after the end of inclusion.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Van Aalderen and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] reported an effect size of 0.53 (Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>) in a sample of 69 currently depressed patients. Based on an alpha of 0.05 and power of 80&#x000a0;%, estimating the correlation between baseline and first follow-up measurements to be 0.5 and intending to use an ANCOVA controlling for baseline levels of depression, a needed sample size of 43 per condition was calculated. Expecting a drop-out of 8 patients, a total of 94 participants will be recruited.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Analyses plan</title><p>The MBCT&#x02009;+&#x02009;TAU and TAU conditions will be compared on baseline sample characteristics to ensure that all possible meaningful characteristics were evenly distributed across the conditions. To examine treatment outcome, we will use both intention-to-treat and per-protocol samples. Participants are considered completers of the MBCT if they attend at least four sessions of MBCT. To examine whether effects for participants experiencing a depressive episode for one to two years and participants meeting criteria for chronic depression according to the DSM-IV (&#x02265;2&#x000a0;years) are different, the primary and secondary analyses will be repeated in these subgroups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Primary analysis</title><p>The effect of condition (MBCT&#x02009;+&#x02009;TAU vs. TAU) on the primary outcome measure (depressive symptoms) will be examined using general linear models. Condition and baseline score of depressive symptoms will be included as independent variables, depressive symptoms at FU1 as the dependent variable. Because MBCT is delivered in mixed groups consisting of regular patients and a few study participants and previous studies did not yield an effect of therapy group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], we will not incorporate a random group effect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Secondary analyses</title><p>Effects on quality of life, rumination, mindfulness skills, and self-compassion will also be investigated using general linear models with the same independent variable as in the primary analysis. To investigate effects on remission rates a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test will be performed. Moderating effects of level of treatment-resistance and childhood trauma will be investigated by including an interaction effect (condition*moderator) in the models. Furthermore, exploratory analyses on rumination, mindfulness skills and self-compassion as possible underlying mechanisms of change will be conducted. Consolidation and moderation of treatment effect will be investigated in the whole sample of MBCT completers (MBCT&#x02009;+&#x02009;TAU and TAU) using end-of-treatment assessments and follow-up assessments at three and six months after end of treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite the range of currently available treatments options such as antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioral or interpersonal therapy, a substantial number of currently depressed patients do not recover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Chronic, treatment-resistant depression is associated with a high personal as well as societal burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Additional treatment options are required, to further reduce depressive symptoms and to improve quality of life in this population.</p><p>In previous pilot studies, MBCT appeared to be a promising treatment option for patients with chronic depression. Besides incorporating effective elements of cognitive behavioral therapy, MBCT focuses on acknowledging negative emotions and thoughts and disengaging from maladaptive automatic cognitive and behavioral patterns elicited by them. As chronic, treatment-resistant depression is characterized by perseverance of symptoms and a long treatment history, maladaptive automatic thinking patterns are likely to have become habitual. Therefore MBCT might be a very valuable additional treatment for this group. In the current study we will build upon the previous pilot findings by studying the effect of MBCT on depressive symptoms in a large chronic, treatment-resistant sample in a randomized controlled trial.</p><p>Strauss and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] argue that MBCT might be as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy in reducing depressive symptoms in currently depressed patients. The results of the current study will provide an indication of the effectiveness of MBCT over and above available pharmacological and psychological treatments such as CBT and IPT, in patients who previously received these types of psychological treatment.</p><p>In addition to the effects of MBCT on depressive symptoms, we will investigate if MBCT leads to less rumination and higher quality of life in this patient population. Moreover, this trial will inform clinicians and researchers if chronic, treatment-resistant depressed patients are able to learn mindfulness skills and to develop more self-compassion by following a standard MBCT training. This large trial will also give more detailed information about the acceptability and effect sizes of MBCT in this target group.</p><p>The ecological validity of the study will be high, as participants will be enrolled in standard Dutch MBCT courses offered at mental health care institutions. If the conclusion will be that MBCT is effective in reducing depressive symptoms in chronic, treatment-resistant depression, this study could make a significant impact on treatment options for this severely depressed target group.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADM</term><def><p>Antidepressant medication</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTQ-SF</term><def><p>Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-short form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DM-TRD</term><def><p>Dutch measure of treatment resistant depression</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSM-IV</term><def><p>Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders- 4<sup>th</sup> edition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFMQ</term><def><p>Five facet mindfulness questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IDS-SR</term><def><p>Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology- Self Report</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPT</term><def><p>Interpersonal therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBCT</term><def><p>Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MINI</term><def><p>Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RRS-EXT</term><def><p>Ruminative response scale extended version</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCS</term><def><p>Self compassion scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TAU</term><def><p>Treatment as usual</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHOQoL-BREF</term><def><p>World health organization quality of life&#x000a0;scale </p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>All authors contributed to the design of the study.
