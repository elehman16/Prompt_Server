Numerous studies have been carried out, which have helped to increase our knowledge of dental caries and reduce the prevalence of dental caries. However, according to The World Oral Health Report, dental caries still remains a major dental disease.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The caries process is well understood as a process of alternating demineralization and remineralization of tooth mineral (Featherstone 1999). The major shortcoming of currently available anti-caries products is the fact that their ability to remineralize enamel is limited by the low concentration of calcium and phosphate ions available in saliva.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] This has led to the research of many new materials that can provide essential elements for remineralization. Some of them are bioactive glass (BAG), casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP).</p><p>BAG is an unique material has numerous novel features; the most important feature is its ability to act as a biomimetic mineralizer, matching the body's own mineralizing traits.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>CPP-ACP is also one of the novel calcium phosphate remineralization technology, that shows to promote remineralization of enamel subsurface lesions in various <italic>in-vitro</italic> and <italic>in-vivo</italic> studies.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p><italic>In-vitro</italic> pH-cycling technique was introduced, over 20 year ago, to study the effect of caries-preventive regimens and treatments.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Many of the researchers have utilized and modified this pH-cycling model to suit their own studies to test different caries-preventive agents.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Hence the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the remineralization potential of BAG and CPP-ACP on early enamel carious lesion. The null hypothesis for the present study was that there is no significant difference in the mean microhardness values of the two groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 30 healthy human premolars, which were extracted for orthodontic purposes, were collected. The teeth were cleaned thoroughly to remove any deposits with scaler. Teeth were sectioned 1 mm below the cemento-enamel junction with a slow speed diamond disc. The roots were discarded and the crowns were used for the study. To remove variability in samples, 200 &#x003bc;m of surface enamel was removed from the buccal surface of all teeth with help of 600 grit abrasive paper and confirmed with digital caliper.</p><p>A 4 mm &#x000d7; 4 mm working window was marked on the buccal surfaces of all the samples. Samples were then randomly distributed into two groups (<italic>n</italic> = 15). Group A: BAG containing dentifrice (SHY-NM; Group Pharmaceuticals; India) and Group B: CPP-ACP (GC tooth mousse; Recaldent; GCcorp; Japan) containing dentifrice. The area of the crown other than the working window was covered with nail varnish.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Baseline SMH (B-SMH) measuring</title><p>B-SMH was checked with Vicker's microhardness testing machine (VMT) for all the tooth samples in the area of the working window. The indentations were made with VMT at the rate of 25 gram load for 5 seconds.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The average microhardness of the specimen was determined from 3 indentations to avoid any discrepancy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Preparation of demineralizing and remineralizing solutions</title><p>The buffered de-/re-mineralizing solutions were prepared using analytical grade chemicals and deionized water. The demineralizing solution contained 2.2 mM calcium chloride, 2.2 mM sodium phosphate, and 0.05 M acetic acid; the pH was adjusted with 1 M potassium hydroxide to 4.4. The remineralizing solution, which contained 1.5 mM calcium chloride, 0.9 mM sodium phosphate, and 0.15 M potassium chloride, had a pH of 7.0.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Preparation of artificial carious lesion</title><p>Samples were kept in demineralizing solution for 96 h to produce the artificial carious lesion in the enamel.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>After 96 h of initial demineralization SMH (D-SMH) measuring</title><p>D-SMH was checked with VMT, similarly as done for B-SMH.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Toothpaste preparation</title><p>Dentifrice supernatants were prepared by suspending 12 g of the respective dentifrice in 36-mL deionized water to create a 1:3 dilution. The suspensions were thoroughly stirred with a stirring rod and mechanically agitated by means of a vortex mixer for 1 min. The suspensions were then centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 20 min at room temperature, once daily before starting the pH-cycling.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>The pH-cycling model</title><p>The specimens were placed in the pH-cycling system on a cylindrical beaker for 10 days.

A 1-min treatment with a toothpaste solution of 3:1 deionized water to toothpaste, after centrifugation (5 mL/section), was given before the first demineralizing cycle and both before and after the second demineralizing cycle and sections were placed in a remineralizing solution overnight.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>pH-cycling regime</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCD-17-3-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>After remineralization SMH (R-SMH) measuring</title><p>R-SMH was checked with VMT, similarly as done for B-SMH.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis of data were conducted using ANOVA and multiple comparisons within groups was done using Bonferroni method (<italic>post-hoc</italic> tests)</p><p>The decision criterion was to reject the null hypothesis if the <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05.

However caries process is now well-understood; much of it has been described extensively in the dental literature.</p><p>Early Enamel CARIOUS lesion appears white because the normal translucency of the enamel is lost. Even though initial enamel lesions have intact surfaces, they have a low mineral content at the surface layer when compared to sound enamel; thus showing a lower hardness value at the surface than for sound enamel tissue.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>When there is acid attack on the tooth surface, the acids lowers the surface pH and diffuse through the plaque, which causes loss of minerals from the enamel and dentine. This mineral loss compromises the mechanical structure of the tooth and lead to cavitation over a long period of time. The subsequent re-mineralization process is nearly the reverse. When oral pH returns to near neutral, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3&#x02212;</sup> ions in saliva incorporate themselves into the depleted mineral layers of enamel as new apatite. The demineralized zones in the crystal lattice act as nucleation sites for new mineral deposition.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>This cycle is fundamentally dependent upon enamel solubility and ion gradients. Essentially, the sudden drop in pH following meals produces an under saturation of those essential ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3&#x02212;</sup>) in the plaque fluid with respect to tooth mineral. This promotes the dissolution of the enamel. At elevated pH, the ionic super-saturation of plaque shifts the equilibrium the other way, causing a mineral deposition in the tooth. Over the course of human life, enamel and dentin undergo unlimited cycles of de-mineralization and re-mineralization.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>For many years, fluorides have been used as the agent for countering carious tooth process. However recent reviews have concluded that the decline in caries may be at an end or even in reversal, with levels increasing in some areas.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Thus, there is a need for developing new biomaterials which can act as an adjunct to the existing fluorides or can individually act as an agent for arresting the carious lesion and their remineralization.</p><p>In the present study, we have compared the remineralization potential of two different dentifrices, which are not normally the key active ingredients in the dentifrices largely used.</p><p>Considering the importance of the surface layer in caries progression, the evaluation of changes in this region is relevant, thus SMH measurement is a suitable technique for studying de-remineralization process. Micro hardness measurement is appropriate for a material having fine microstructure, non-homogenous or prone to cracking like enamel. SMH indentations provide a relatively simple, non-destructive and rapid method in demineralization and remineralization studies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Rather than using the traditional pH-cycling method, a modified version[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] was utilized in our study, in an attempt to simulate the real-life situation. This included a 3 h demineralizing cycle twice a day, with one 2 h and one intervening overnight remineralizing cycle, respectively. And to replicate early morning, midday and before bed-time tooth brushing, toothpaste was applied thrice daily. The remineralizing solutions used in the study were created to replicate supersaturation by apatite minerals found in saliva and were similar to those previously utilized by ten Cate and Duijsters.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Even though all the specimens were sectioned from different teeth, the variations among them did not yield any major effect on the progression of demineralization. This was confirmed by the P-value obtained for all the hardness measurements (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) before the <italic>in-vitro</italic> pH cycling commenced. It was therefore reasonable to disregard such variations when analyzing the data after pH cycling.</p><p>After the treatment regime with the respective dentifrices, increase in mean microhardness was observed in both groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]; this is in accordance with various previous studies carried out for determining the remineralization potential of BAG,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] CPP-ACP,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and when compared Group A and Group B showed statistically significant values after pH-cycling regimen [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><p>BAG is a ceramic material consisting of amorphous sodium-calcium-phosphosilicate which is highly reactive in water and as a fine particle size powder can physically occlude dentinal tubules.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In the aqueous environment around the tooth, i.e., saliva in the oral cavity, sodium ions from the BAG particles rapidly exchange with hydrogen cations (in the form of H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>) and this brings about the release of calcium and phosphate (PO4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) ions from the glass.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] A localized, transient increase in pH occurs during the initial exposure of the material to water due to the release of sodium. This increase in pH helps to precipitate the extra calcium and phosphate ions provided by the BAG to form a calcium phosphate layer. As these reactions continue, this layer crystallizes into hydroxycarbonate apatite (HCA).[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Unlike other calcium phosphate technologies, the ions that BAG release form HCA-(a mineral that is chemically similar to natural tooth mineral) directly, without the intermediate ACP phase. These particles also attach to the tooth surface and continue to release ions and re-mineralize the tooth surface after the initial application. The deposits are firmly attached and are not removed by thorough washing and brushing. These particles have been shown, in <italic>in-vitro</italic> studies, to release ions and transform into HCA for up to 2 weeks.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>A study was carried out to determine the remineralizing effects of BAG on bleached enamel. It concluded that BAG deposits were found on the enamel surface of all the specimens, suggesting that they may act as a reservoir of ions available for remineralization at sites of possible demineralization.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] This may explain the higher hardness values of BAG dentifrice after remineralization.</p><p>The present study also revealed that CPP-ACP remineralized enamel lesion in human enamel <italic>in-vitro</italic>. CPP-ACP is calcium phosphate-based delivery systems containing high concentrations of calcium phosphate.</p><p>The roles of CPP-ACP has been described as - localization of the ACP on the tooth surface and buffer the free calcium and phosphate ion activity, thereby helping in maintaining the role of super saturation. The CPP stabilizes the calcium and phosphate in a metastable solution facilitating high concentration of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO4<sup>3&#x02212;</sup> which diffuses in the enamel lesion when CPP-ACP comes in contact with the lesion.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>However the lower hardness values for CPP-ACP may be due to its amorphous nature; which does not adhere to the enamel surface, unlike BAG gets attached to tooth, hence not remineralizing the tooth surface for a longer period of time to enhance its hardness.</p><p>A study investigated the enamel remineralization potential of CPP-ACP and BAG, showed that, after scanning electron microscope analysis it was clearly seen that although both group samples had plugs that sealed the fissures formed by demineralization, BAG plug appeared to be more compact and intimately attached to the enamel surface. The deposits formed by CPP-ACP were smaller and amorphous, while BAG created larger, more angular deposit.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This may also explain the high values of hardness for BAG as compared to CPP-ACP in the current study; as BAG attaches more intimately and compactly to the tooth surface.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"
