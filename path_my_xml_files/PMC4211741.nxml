This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled comparison of oral TDF (300 mg), rectally-applied TFV 1% gel (each dose of gel contained 40 mg of TFV), and the HEC placebo gel. Randomization was carried out by the study pharmacist and was a two-part process. Following enrollment, participants were randomized (2&#x02236;1) to receive TFV 1% gel (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12) or HEC placebo gel (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6). A separate randomization was used to assign subjects, for safety reasons, into one of two post-exposure biopsy sampling arms (A or B) after each single exposure stage. Group A subjects were biopsied on Days 1&#x02013;3 and 7&#x02013;9 and Group B subjects were biopsied on Days 4&#x02013;6 and 10&#x02013;12. Each two week period of biopsy sampling was followed by a two week washout period between stages (&#x02018;rest&#x02019;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111507-g002">Figure 2</xref>). At visit 3 (V3 N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;18; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111507-g002">Figure 2</xref>), all participants received a single oral dose of TDF administered by a clinical team; this was followed 4-weeks later (V7) by a single dose of rectally applied product administered by the clinical team.

The pharmacodynamic endpoint of p24 suppression following HIV-1<sub>BaL</sub> infection of freshly-acquired human tissue biopsies has yet to be validated as a bio-indicator of HIV prevention in a large scale human efficacy trial but does present the closest surrogate currently available. This paper demonstrated that tissue HIV infectibility (cumulative p24) was inversely correlated with <italic>in vivo</italic> concentrations of both TFV and TFVdp. Statistically significant, non-linear dose-response relationships with reduced tissue infectibility were found for one TFV compartment and four TFVdp compartments; the dose-response relationships were highly significant for TFVdp in whole rectal tissue, CD4<sup>+</sup>
<sub>MMC</sub>, CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>
<sub>MMC</sub> and Total<sub>MMC</sub> compartments. The finding that TFVdp, the active metabolite of TFV, was more predictive of <italic>ex vivo</italic> virus inhibition than TFV demonstrates the utility of measuring TFVdp in cellular spaces. Isolation of cells for the measurement of TFVdp may not be necessary as TFVdp in whole rectal tissue was found to be as predictive of a pharmacologic response as TFVdp in isolated cell populations. These findings support the measurement of TFVdp from whole tissue homogenates in clinical trials, as isolation of cells from tissue may not be necessary to obtain a measure of TFVdp that is related to activity. The ability to describe a concentration-response relationship allowed identification of target concentrations of TFVdp in specific compartments so providing a means to ensure that different dosing strategies result in adequate <italic>in vivo</italic> TFVdp ranges for <italic>ex vivo</italic> HIV inhibition.</p><p>Robust dose-response correlates predicting the <italic>in vivo</italic> CCs in tissue, blood, rectal/vaginal fluid compartments needed for <italic>ex vivo</italic> suppression of HIV (i.e. EC<sub>50,90,95</sub>) were found using logistic regression analyses. In demonstrating these correlations, this intensive Phase 1 trial design, involving the measurement of multiple PK endpoints in multiple tissue/fluid compartments and the PD <italic>ex vivo</italic> assay endpoint, predicted CCs necessary for <italic>ex vivo</italic> suppression and, by inference, <italic>in vivo</italic> dosing. The <italic>ex vivo</italic> biopsy assay for HIV infectibility uses intact, freshly-acquired, tissue samples, providing one of the closest pre-clinical surrogates to a human efficacy clinical trial. Phase 1 rectal microbicide study designs that integrate safety, acceptability, and PK/PD measurements have the potential to provide early indications of harm and/or potential efficacy of candidate products prior to embarking on larger, longer and more expensive Phase 2B/3 trials.</p><p>When drug concentrations are independently varied, correlations between dose, <italic>in vivo</italic> drug concentration and infectibility can be used to predict the drug concentration needed to effectively suppress HIV infection, <italic>ex vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0111507-RichardsonHarman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The single doses of oral and topical drugs used here did not allow for correlations to be made with initial doses but a wide range in <italic>in vivo</italic> drug concentrations were found following the various treatment regimens tested. The <italic>in vivo</italic> drug concentrations following the 7-daily topical TFV gel treatment were quantifiable at the EC<sub>90</sub> level in various compartments, and were within the range found 30 minutes post product use. The single oral TDF dose did not provide a high enough <italic>in vivo</italic> drug concentration for even a 50% probability of <italic>ex vivo</italic> suppression. The single topical TFV gel treatment provided evidence of partial suppression in some compartments but did not reach the 95% probability of suppression in any of the compartments tested.</p><p>The statistical methodology used here, and in the previous UC781 biopsy challenge trial <xref rid="pone.0111507-RichardsonHarman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, can inform on the design of future trials to reduce the number of biopsy samples required, increase power and provide relevant information from these small, early stage clinical studies. Placebo and baseline infectibility data are generally associated with high p24 variability and low statistical power <xref rid="pone.0111507-RichardsonHarman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Baseline and placebo data were not used (nor needed) here as the intent was to study the compartmental concentration-response relationship only following active dose(s) of the drug. Although the dose-response models found were consistent with drug-mediated virus suppression, there was only the merest indication of a lower asymptote, where suppression of HIV reached the lower limit of p24 quantification and increased drug would lead to diminished effect. Dose-ranging biopsy challenge studies are needed to provide a range of drug mediated HIV suppression in order to populate both upper and lower asymptotes of the dose-response curve. A clearly defined lower asymptote, where tissue/blood drug concentrations were correlated with p24 suppression in the explant assay, following <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure to a product, would provide the range of <italic>in vivo</italic> drug that would reliably suppress HIV in this model. Ideally, this range that would be representative of the range in <italic>in vivo</italic> compartmental drug concentrations found amongst users of the product.</p><p>The dose-response relationships reported here are specific to the TDF 300 mg tablet, the TFV 1% gel study product and the dosing regimens used. The EC<sub>50,90,95</sub> levels calculated cannot be easily extrapolated to other doses, drugs and treatment regimens but do provide an efficacy endpoint, expressed in units of <italic>in vivo</italic> PK parameters, that could be comparable between studies. In the CHARM-01 study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01575405) the correlations found in the RMP-02/MTN-006 study described in this paper will be reassessed for three different formulations of TFV 1% gel to evaluate whether re-formulation impacts the clear dose-response relationships found with the formulation of TFV 1% gel used in the RMP-02/MTN-006 study. For example, while compartment concentrations of TFVdp in CD4<sup>+</sup>
<sub>PBMC</sub> and CD4<sub>Total</sub> were non-detectable at the time points where blood levels were paired with p24 biopsy measurements (the only time points reported here), there were detectable blood levels at sampling periods post exposure that were not paired with biopsy sampling. These are reported in our concurrently submitted manuscript comparing timing of drug detection in multiple compartments from the same Phase 1 trial <xref rid="pone.0111507-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Although these derivations apply only to TFV and the particular formulations and delivery methods tested, the analytical framework can be applied to many promising candidate microbicides.</p><p>The high titer of HIV infection used here (HIV<sub>1BaL</sub>; 10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>), far in excess of the titer found in semen <xref rid="pone.0111507-Tebit1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, was previously found to reduce inter- and intra- subject variability in this tissue assay compared to a lower 10<sup>2</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> titer <xref rid="pone.0111507-RichardsonHarman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The risk of transmission during anal intercourse has been estimated at 0.65&#x02013;1.7% <xref rid="pone.0111507-Tebit1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, so perhaps it is not surprising that the use of higher titer inoculants than those found <italic>in vivo</italic> result in higher infectibility rates <italic>ex vivo</italic> (&#x0223c;60% of explants HIV<sub>1BaL</sub>10<sup>2</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>
<xref rid="pone.0111507-Anton2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>) in this model system. Drug treatments that reliably suppress such high HIV titers <italic>ex vivo</italic> set a high bar for drug mediated efficacy assays, and may overestimate the drug dose needed <italic>in vivo</italic> to prevent acquisition of HIV infection. The choice of isolate could increase the power of these analysis methods if a primary or mucosal-derived virus isolate was found to reliably infect mucosal tissue at lower, more virologically relevant infectious titers. Dose-ranging, use of sampling time points that reflect the known pharmacokinetic profile in each compartment, and use of more virulent HIV isolates may provide more reliable and valid dose-response analytics and derived results.</p><p>In summary, the TFVdp MMC compartment (CD4+, CD4&#x02212; and Total) provided the best surrogates for biopsy infectibility and the 7-daily topical TFV gel treatment provided the strongest PK profile for HIV suppression. Although the sample size here was relatively small (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;18, where only N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12 received the microbicide gel formulation), the dose-response models reached statistical significance showing that meaningful, informative findings can result from this type of small, intensive PK/PD study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0111507.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p>
