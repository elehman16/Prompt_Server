The most prevalent symptoms among peri- and postmenopausal women are hot flushes and night sweats, known as vasomotor menopausal symptoms. In the 2005 European Menopause Survey, 82% of postmenopausal women in the UK reported vasomotor symptoms over the past five years [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and evidence suggests that 87% of these women experience symptoms on a daily basis, with 33% having more than ten episodes a day [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The adverse impact of these symptoms on health and wellbeing is well established [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Hormone therapy, with estrogen alone or in combination with progestogen, is considered to be the most effective treatment option for vasomotor menopausal symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, evidence linking hormone therapy with increased risk of breast cancer, stroke, coronary heart disease, and thromboembolic disease [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], coupled with adverse side-effects and extensive negative media reports, have led women seeking alternative treatment options [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the quest for alternative therapies, exercise has been commonly advocated. There are biological, psychological, and psychosocial explanations of why exercise may potentially be an effective treatment option for vasomotor symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and some supporting evidence for a positive impact on many symptoms and health conditions typically associated with menopausal transition exists [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For example, exercise may help to stabilise the thermoregulatory centre of the brain through beta-endorphin production and contribute towards the improvement of mental wellbeing, sense of achievement and self-esteem.</p><p>The Scientific Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the UK and their Patient Information Committee advise that regular sustained aerobic exercise may ameliorate vasomotor menopausal symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0184328.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the latest Cochrane review [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], concluded that there is lack of evidence showing that exercise is an effective treatment for these symptoms and called for further research. Since then, findings from a randomised controlled trial concluded that 3 months of moderate exercise does not alleviate vasomotor symptoms, but leads to statistically significant improvements in depressive symptoms, sleep quality and insomnia [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The Active Women trial assessed the effectiveness of a 6-month exercise intervention, with a further 6-month follow-up, and concluded that exercise reduces the frequency of vasomotor symptoms per week relative to a control group but the reduction is not statistically significant [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. At the end of the trial, improvements were observed in a number of secondary outcomes, such as depressive symptoms and anxiety, sleep quality and sexual behaviour, but these improvements were also not significantly different between the exercise groups and the control group, but in some instances they were clinically meaningful.</p><p>Despite this debate on the clinical effectiveness of exercise, limited attention has been paid to the issue of cost-effectiveness. Economic evidence is commonly used in the United Kingdom and beyond to inform decision makers about the best use of scarce resources within the health care context. For women with vasomotor menopausal symptoms, the first economic evaluation was published in August 2015 and concluded that physical activity is cost-effective at 6 months follow-up, as the benefits of exercise were obtained at a very low cost [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This economic evaluation was published 3 years after the primary clinical study [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Another economic evaluation focusing on perimenopausal women is currently in progress [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and more studies assessing the cost-effectiveness of exercise in the management of vasomotor symptoms are needed.</p><p>The lack of economic analyses in this context is perhaps attributed to the lack of comprehensive clinical evidence demonstrating a significant effect of exercise on the frequency or severity of vasomotor symptoms. In order to inform resource allocation decisions, in a comparative way across a range of health care interventions, economic analyses are not restricted to one clinical outcome only, such as the absolute reduction in the frequency of vasomotor symptoms, but aim to capture a wide set of outcomes through their impact on preference-based health-related quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Evidence that menopause impacts on health-related quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and that exercise improves quality of life in menopausal women [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0184328.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], even in women with vasomotor menopausal symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0184328.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0184328.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], exists. Improvements in the frequency or severity of vasomotor symptoms, and equally improvements in depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep quality and sexual behaviour, even though they may not always be found to be statistically significant in absolute terms, they may have a valuable net effect on a woman&#x02019;s quality of life. It is these benefits and the opportunity cost associated with those benefits that matters in health care resource allocation decisions. This study aims to evaluate the cost-utility of an individual and a social version of an exercise intervention relative to a control group based on data from the Active Women trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Trial design and participants</title><p>Favourable ethical opinion for this study was granted by the West Midlands Research Ethics Committee in March 2010 (ref: 10/H1208/3).This is UK National Research Ethics Service (NRES) ethical approval, sought as required by the University of Birmingham.</p><p>The study presents cost-utility data from the Active Women&#x02019;s trial. Information about the trial design and participants can be found in the published trial protocol [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and the accompanying clinical paper [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In brief, women aged 48&#x02013;57 years were contacted from 23 general practices across the West Midlands in the UK between April 2011 and September 2014. To be included in the trial, women had to be peri- or postmenopausal, experience &#x02265; 5 episodes of hot flushes and/or night sweats daily of any severity, and had not used hormone therapy in the past 3 months. To be eligible, women also had to be inactive according to the UK&#x02019;s public health guidelines for physical activity, namely achieve less than 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise, like brisk walking and cycling, on at least 5 days per week [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and in a position to provide written informed consent and to communicate in English. Women were subsequently randomised to one of two 6-month exercise interventions or a control group on a 1:1:1 ratio, and were followed-up at 6 and 12 months post-randomisation. Information on the use of hormone therapy or other complementary and alternative medicine was recorded at baseline and follow-up periods.</p><p>The two exercise interventions aimed at achieving 30 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise on at least 3 days a week during the first 3 months of the trial, and on 3&#x02013;5 days a week during the following 3 months. Both interventions involved two 40&#x02013;60 minute one-to-one consultations with a physical activity facilitator at a participant&#x02019;s home. In one exercise intervention women were sent a purpose-designed DVD, a booklet, and five study leaflets, which were expected to act as regular reminders that would prompt exercise. This intervention will be referred to as <italic>&#x0201c;Exercise-DVD&#x0201d;</italic>. In the other intervention, women were invited to three exercise social support groups in their community lasting 75&#x02013;90 minutes. These were aimed to act as social nudges by bringing women together to share experiences and support. This intervention will be referred to as <italic>&#x0201c;Exercise-Social support&#x0201d;</italic>. The control group involved the opportunity of an exercise consultation and women in this group were given a pedometer at the end of their involvement in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Resource use and costs</title><p>Resource use information was collected prospectively using self-completed postal questionnaires at 6 and 12 months post-randomisation. Resource use information was collected from both a National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective (NHS/PSS) and a societal perspective. The NHS/PSS perspective included resource use relevant to contacts for vasomotor menopausal symptoms with general practitioners and practice nurses (at the surgery or out-of-hours telephone consultations), gynaecologists or other hospital doctors, and counsellors or psychologists. Information on relevant repeat prescriptions and free prescriptions was also recorded. The societal perspective additionally included resource use related to contacts with private therapists for any complementary and alternative medicines for vasomotor menopausal symptoms, time off work and other activities due to the menopausal symptoms, and out-of-pocket payments for relevant prescription and non-prescription medicines. Information on hospital admissions was captured in the questionnaire, but these were not related to vasomotor menopausal symptoms, and thus were excluded from the two costing perspectives.</p><p>Unit costs for public health and community services were obtained from national sources [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0184328.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0184328.t001">Table 1</xref>. Mean medication costs for vasomotor menopausal symptoms&#x02019; were estimated based on specific dosage regimens for the ten most commonly prescribed medicines, and unit costs were obtained from the <italic>British National Formulary</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Costs related to the development and delivery of the exercise interventions were calculated using a standard micro-costing approach [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Productivity costs associated with paid and unpaid work were calculated using the human capital approach, based on average age- and gender-specific wage rates, and the proxy good approach respectively [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These costs were obtained from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

The complete-case analysis led to very similar cost-effectiveness point-estimates.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study assessed the cost-utility of <italic>Exercise-Social support</italic> and <italic>Exercise-DVD</italic> interventions relative to a control group for women with vasomotor menopausal symptoms. During the 12 months of the trial, <italic>Exercise-Social support</italic> led to a small gain in health-related quality of life compared with the control group in the context of many other broader wellbeing benefits of exercise that may not be captured by a health measure like the SF-12. Such examples are sleep quality and family participation in aerobic exercise, that were evident in the trial [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], or general self-esteem, sense of achievement, and life satisfaction that are commonly linked with physical activity in postmenopausal women and general adult or older population [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Given the small incremental costs involved, it is very likely that <italic>Exercise-Social support</italic> is a cost-effective intervention. This is supported by the bootstrapping results, which showed that at the end of the trial&#x02019;s period, <italic>Exercise-Social support</italic> was found to be the optimal intervention with 86% (NHS/PSS perspective) and 90% (Societal perspective) probability of being cost-effective at current acceptable thresholds of willingness-to-pay per additional QALY in the UK. This may reflect the findings of the clinical study [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which showed that the <italic>Exercise-Social support</italic> group had significantly lower somatic symptoms and sleep problems, as well as lower anxiety and depression scores, which were clinically meaningful, compared with the control group.</p><p>However, the <italic>Exercise-DVD</italic> intervention did not lead to better health and economic benefits compared with the control group, despite that both <italic>Exercise-Social support</italic> and <italic>Exercise-DVD</italic> groups reported participating in more vigorous intensity exercise [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This may indicate that exercise per se does not directly impact on vasomotor menopausal symptoms. A possible explanation is that the social component of the <italic>Exercise-Social support</italic> therapy drives its cost-effectiveness. Social influences have been shown to act as powerful nudges through information sharing and peer pressure [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0184328.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Evidence on the impact of social support on health and wellbeing are available in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], and these can even reach the more disadvantaged population groups [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Social influences were inherent to the <italic>Exercise-Social support</italic> therapy, and may in turn have provided quality of life gains at a very low cost.</p><p>While this study concludes that only social versions of exercise interventions are likely to be cost-effective in the management of vasomotor menopausal symptoms, this finding may not be fully in line with the evidence provided from the only other economic evaluation of exercise in this context. That study used a 6 month time horizon and concluded that four unsupervised sessions of physical activity per week, with each lasting more than 50 minutes, is a cost-effective intervention [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although it is not possible to assess how the unsupervised sessions were carried out, any potential difference in the conclusions may be attributed to the fact that the study was based on a sample of women with relatively low frequency of vasomotor symptoms whereas Active Women trial recruited women experiencing a substantial number of vasomotor menopausal symptoms. Nevertheless, given the small costs associated with exercise interventions, evidence suggests that these are commonly found to be cost-effective across different population groups [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].</p><p>Our study benefited from data from one of the largest randomised controlled trials to date on the clinical effectiveness of exercise in this population group [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], with women being recruited from 23 general practices across West Midlands in the UK. The cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out in line with the recommended practices for economic evaluation and utilised appropriate statistical techniques [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. National sources were used for costing purposes, and outcome data were obtained from a widely applied preference-based health-related quality of life measure. These, in addition to the fact that cost-effectiveness was explored from both a NHS/PSS and a societal perspective and for both 6 and 12 months follow-up, is likely to have extended the transferability of the study&#x02019;s findings beyond the UK setting.</p><p>The study, however, has limitations. First, there is a potential self-selection bias of people in exercise interventions, which often reduces the difference in the overall benefits observed because non-intervention groups are also undertaking healthy behaviours. Second, women in the study were asked to recall resource use over the past six months, which, despite being an efficient approach, is likely to have introduced a recall bias into the study. Third, vasomotor menopausal symptoms commonly impact on broader aspects of wellbeing than health status [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0184328.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. It is, therefore, likely that the broader benefits of exercise on women&#x02019;s wellbeing may have been inadequately captured. Outcome measures of broader wellbeing, such as the ICECAP-A [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], which has been found to have good psychometric properties in the contexts of women&#x02019;s health and mental health [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0184328.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], may have been more appropriate in the cost-effectiveness assessment of exercise for vasomotor menopausal symptoms. Fourth, the human capital approach tends to overestimate productivity losses [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0184328.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Nevertheless, the cost-effectiveness estimates produced from the two perspectives of analysis were very similar. Fifth, multiple imputation relies on the assumption that missing data are independent of unobserved variables, and therefore, are missing at random. This was perceived as a fair assumption, and it is unlikely that there is a systematic bias between trial-arms, which further supports the validity of the study&#x02019;s results. Finally, the trial&#x02019;s period allowed only the short-term impacts of exercise to be seen. Considering the additional long-term health benefits associated with exercise [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0184328.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], in an ageing population, <italic>Exercise-Social support</italic> therapy may offer even greater value for the increasingly limited public health care resources in a longer time horizon.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Currently, although the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the UK and their Patient Information Committee favour sustained aerobic exercise for vasomotor menopausal symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0184328.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0184328.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], evidence for its clinical effectiveness is lacking. This study is the first to bring the cost-effectiveness argument into the policy and clinical debate. The study explored the cost-effectiveness of an individual and social support-based exercise interventions for women with vasomotor menopausal symptoms, and the findings indicated that exercise is very likely to offer value for money when it is accompanied by exercise social support groups in the local community. Although the direct benefit of this intervention on health-related quality of life was found to be small, the marginal additional costs involved in a context where there are broader wellbeing and long-terms health benefits associated with exercise and social participation, suggests that social versions of exercise interventions should be further explored in the management of vasomotor menopausal symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184328.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Mean per-woman resource use by intervention arm during the trial period.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184328.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184328.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Disaggregated mean per-woman costs at 6 months follow-up (&#x000a3;, 2013/14 prices).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184328.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184328.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Disaggregated mean per-woman costs at 12 months follow-up (&#x000a3;, 2013/14 prices).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184328.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184328.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Mean per-woman total costs and outcomes&#x02014;Complete-case analysis (&#x000a3;, 2013/14 prices).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184328.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184328.s005"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier (CEAF) showing the probability of the optimal intervention being cost-effective at 6 months from a societal perspective across different willingness-to-pay values per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184328.s005.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184328.s006"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier (CEAF) showing the probability of the optimal intervention being cost-effective at 12 months from a societal perspective across different willingness-to-pay values per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184328.s006.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank patients and staff who participated in the study.
