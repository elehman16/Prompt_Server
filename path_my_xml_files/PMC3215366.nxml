These factors are mentioned as risk factors for osteoarthritis in the texts and same has been found in the present study. High prevalence of female in osteoarthritis is known. Psychological stress has relation with the severity of the disease. Stress aggravates the pain and other symptoms and may also cause more joint damage. Obesity gives over burden to the joint and causes joint damage. Repetitive stress and trauma directly damages the joint. Heredity plays a role for the production of osteoarthritis especially involvement of interphalangeal joint (heberden's node).
