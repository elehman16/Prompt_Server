A diuretic dose adjustment algorithm developed in the United States (Diuretic Treatment Algorithm, DTA) and later validated for use in Brazil (as the Algoritmo de Ajuste de Diur&#x000e9;tico, AAD) has proved feasible and readily applicable, but its effect on clinical outcomes has yet to be assessed.

Adult patients with a diagnosis of reduced ejection fraction HF, who are being treated at a specialized HF clinic are being recruited. Those with indications for loop diuretic dose adjustment during routine clinic visits will be randomized to take part in the trial. Participants in the intervention group (IG) shall have their diuretic doses adjusted in accordance with the AAD and receive four telephone calls (one per week) over 30 days to reinforce guidance on nonpharmacological management (fluid and sodium restriction). Participants in the control group (CG) shall have their diuretic doses adjusted by a physician during the first trial visit and shall not receive any telephone calls. Patients in both groups shall return at 1 month for face-to-face reassessment. The study endpoints shall comprise readmission and/or emergency department visits due to HF decompensation within 90 days and clinical instability. All participants shall be required to have a scale at home (or easy access to one), a telephone number, agree to telephone-based follow-up, and be available to return for a 1-month trial visit.

In the United States alone, more than 5 million people have HF and more than 550,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Complex issues involving physiological, psychological, social, and medical care make management of HF a challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Over the last years, the annual number of hospitalizations with HF as a primary cause increased from 800,000 to over 1 million, and that of hospitalizations with HF as a secondary diagnosis, from 2.4 million to 3.6 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Approximately 50% of these patients are readmitted to hospital within 6 months of discharge, and 70% of these readmissions are associated with deterioration of HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The prevention of HF-related readmission has been the focus of several studies, and efforts are being made to reduce this rate to the 20% range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>There is a consensus in the literature that HF-related readmissions are prompted mainly by clinical decompensation due to congestive processes. The main manifestations of this decompensation are dyspnea, fatigue, lower extremity edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, and jugular venous distension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These signs and symptoms of decompensation are readily recognizable in a variety of settings, which enables rapid intervention by healthcare professionals. Several different care processes have the potential to reduce HF-related readmission rates, including comprehensive educational intervention during hospital admissions, medication reconciliation, support from the nursing team after hospital discharge, disease management, and improvement of communication between patients and providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. One strategy that has been used as an adjuvant to conventional treatment is telemonitoring. This strategy, which has proven cost-effectiveness and can be implemented in different settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], enables early identification of clinical deterioration and prompt intervention, and has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for decompensated HF and reduce all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Within this context, United States (U.S.) researchers developed an algorithm for over-the-phone adjustment of diuretic doses, with a focus on pharmacological and nonpharmacological assessment and home-based management of patients with HF. The Diuretic Treatment Algorithm (DTA) was demonstrated to be effective in preventing HF decompensation, significantly reducing 30-day readmission rates and decreasing HF-related hospitalizations by 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The DTA was later translated and adapted for use in Brazil as the Algoritmo de Ajuste de Diur&#x000e9;tico (Diuretic Adjustment Algorithm, AAD) and validated in an outpatient sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The results of that study demonstrated the feasibility and applicability of the AAD in the Brazilian healthcare reality. However, the effects of use of this algorithm on clinical outcomes have yet to be tested.</p><p>The present report aims to describe a randomized clinical trial (RCT) protocol designed to assess the effectiveness of the AAD and of nonpharmacologic management in improving clinical stability and reducing the 90-day readmission rate in patients with HF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>A PROBE (prospective randomized open blinded endpoint) parallel-group design shall be employed, with patients recruited from the specialty HF clinic of Hospital de Cl&#x000ed;nicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), a university-affiliated hospital in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Clinical assessment shall take place at the HCPA Clinical Research Center.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Adult patients with a diagnosis of reduced ejection fraction HF who are being treated at a specialized HF clinic are being selected. The diagnosis of HF is established by clinical history (signs and symptoms), echocardiographic findings (left ventricular ejection fraction &#x0003c;45%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and medical records confirming management at the HF clinic. Patients are required to have a medical indication for adjustment of loop diuretic (furosemide) dose during a clinic visit, have a scale at home or ready access to one, have a telephone number for follow-up contact, agree to receive such follow-up and be available to return to the hospital for a 1-month reassessment visit. The exclusion criteria are communication barriers or physical impairments that preclude body weight monitoring, degenerative neurological conditions, waitlist status for cardiac transplantation, scheduled surgery and chronic kidney disease requiring renal replacement therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>All participants will read and sign an informed consent form before entering the study. The study protocol was approved by the HCPA Institutional Review Board (protocol number 10-0376) and will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with the Brazilian legal and regulatory framework for research involving human subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Heart Failure Clinic and team approach</title><p>The trial HF clinic is staffed by a multidisciplinary team of cardiologists, nurses, and dietitians. On average, 200 patients per month are seen at the clinic, with a focus on promoting adherence to optimized pharmacological and nonpharmacological management. During each visit, patients undergo a clinical assessment that includes use of the Clinical Congestion Score (CCS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. All interventions seek to improve the health education process and enable implementation of self-care interventions with family support.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Sample size</title><p>Sample size was estimated in the WinPepi 11.1 software suite, using readmission or emergency department visit within 90 days of randomization as the endpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Considering a 20% relative reduction in readmissions or emergency department visits in the intervention group, a significance level of 0.05, a statistical power of 80%, and an attrition rate of 20%, the sample size was set at 270 patients (135 in each group).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study protocol</title><p>Participants randomized to the CG shall have their diuretic dose adjusted at the physician&#x02019;s discretion. These patients will not receive telemonitoring, but will return for 30-day clinical reassessment.</p><p>Participants randomized to the IG shall receive telemonitoring with the AAD for dose adjustment and CCS for assessment of signs and symptoms of decompensation and body weight fluctuations. Telephone calls shall take place once weekly for a total of four calls during the 1-month intervention period. First, the calling nurse shall enquire as to the presence of signs and symptoms of deterioration (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue during activities of daily living (for functional class assessment), lower extremity edema, vomiting or diarrhea, dizziness or syncope, and body weight fluctuations) during the preceding week. Depending on the signs and symptoms reported, the patient shall receive guidance according to one of the following algorithm pathways: weight remained within the expected range (change in body weight &#x0003c;1 kg), weight loss was greater than expected (weight loss &#x02265;1 kg), or weight gain was greater than expected (weight gain &#x02265;1 kg). Guidance shall be provided in accordance with the patient&#x02019;s individual needs regarding adherence to pharmacological and nonpharmacological management. A face-to-face reassessment shall be conducted at 30 days by a nurse blinded to group allocation. At each telephone contact/reassessment, the AAD shall be administered again to guide diuretic dose adjustment.</p><p>Data on clinical and sociodemographic parameters shall be collected from all participants in both groups, with the CCS used to assess clinical condition.</p><p>During clinic visits, all patients are provided routine guidance on HF, including information on pharmacological management (regular use of prescribed medications and their effects) and nonpharmacological management (weight management, fluid and sodium restriction, physical activity), and any questions they may have are answered.</p><p>At the 30-day visit, all patients shall undergo reassessment by means of the CCS and recollection of data on all variables of interest.</p><p>At 90 days, the study endpoint (readmission or emergency department visit, change in CCS, deterioration in NYHA functional class, and HF-related mortality) shall be assessed by means of a chart review, consisting of an analysis of patients&#x02019; records. Patients who sought care at an outside facility shall be asked to provide their progress notes or discharge summary.
