systematic reviews, experimental trials, and observational research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Missing data are ubiquitous throughout various medical research
designs, even randomized controlled trials (RCT) that are considered the gold
standard for evaluating a direct causal link between an intervention and outcome
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. The randomized
assignment protects against selection bias by equalizing known and unknown
characteristics between intervention groups. Nevertheless, randomization alone is
not sufficient to provide an unbiased intervention comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Two additional requirements for an
unbiased study are: 1) missing data from randomized patients do not bias the
comparison of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] and 2) outcome assessments are
obtained in a similar and unbiased manner for all patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. For the latter, standardized participant assessments and
blinding of the intervention are commonly employed to assure this balance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] but are outside the
scope of this review.</p><p>Despite efforts to minimize missing data through design, it is likely to occur in the
majority of RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p><p>The intent-to-treat principle (ITT) requires the complete inclusion of all data from
all randomized patients in the analysis and is considered the most appropriate
criteria for assessment of the utility of a new therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. In an ITT analysis, all randomized
participants have outcomes assessed and are analyzed in the group in which they were
randomized (regardless of the actual intervention received). When participants drop
out or miss visits, thus producing missing data, the ability to conduct an
intent-to-treat analysis and draw conclusions about a causal link is compromised
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p><p>For nearly a century, scientists have been dealing with missing data by deleting or
arbitrarily filling in missing cases post-hoc. These techniques are prone to bias to
the extent the study results are meaningless [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], yet they
continue to be utilized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Over the past 2 1/2 decades, great
strides have been made in the development of analytic techniques to estimate causal
effects in the presence of missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. The increased utilization of methods such as inverse
probability weighting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>],
multiple imputation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], and
likelihood-based analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] vastly improved rigor over the ad-hoc methods (e.g., last
observation carried forward, complete case analysis) that previously dominated the
RCT landscape. Still, it is important to understand that these methods are tools
rather than solutions. When data are missing, the result of any statistical analysis
relies on the unverifiable assumptions concerning the relation between the
unobserved data and the reasons they are missing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. In other words, conclusions drawn from clinical
trials with missing data can vary depending on the assumptions made and the analytic
method chosen.</p><p>Given there is no universal method to analyze missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], the National Research Council
(NRC) released guidelines on the Handling of Missing Data in Clinical Trials
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. They advocate a
more principled approach to design and analysis focusing on two critical elements:
1) careful design and conduct to limit the amount of missing data and 2) analysis
that makes full use of information on all randomized participants and is based on
careful attention to the assumptions about the nature of the missing data underlying
estimates of treatment effects.</p><p>As guidance for researchers interested in performing clinical trials, this review is
a non-technical overview of the consequences of missing data and a prescription for
its treatment extending beyond the typically used analytic strategies to the entire
research process including the stages of design, planning, and conduct. We provide
an example-driven demonstration of the potential bias from incorrectly analyzing
data with missing observations and explain the advantages/disadvantages of available
analytic strategies. Most notably, we discuss the need for a paradigm shift in the
way trials are managed, focusing on the prevention of missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Many of the recommendations are
applicable to research studies beyond the RCT.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Types of Missing Data and Analytic Examples</title><p>When planning a study, conducting an analysis or critically reviewing trial results,
it is necessary to contemplate how the missing data are generated. <italic>Are
certain groups more likely to having missing data? Are certain responses more
likely to be missing?</italic> To assist in our approach to designing and
analyzing studies in the presence of missing data, Little and Rubin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>] have identified three categories
for classifying how missing data are generated: Missing Completely at Random (MCAR),
Missing at Random (MAR), and Missing Not at Random (MNAR). Common examples of these
missing data mechanisms are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Missing Completely at Random</title><p>The definition of MCAR is that the likelihood of missing data is unrelated to any
observed or unobserved variables. That is, the chance of missing data is the
same for individuals in different treatment groups and those who have
differential disease severity or treatment response. For example, a dropped test
tube in a lab or an equipment failure may lead to missing data. As this is
equally likely to occur in any subject in the study (i.e., regardless of
treatment received, disease severity, etc.), it represents a completely random
process. Subsequently, the average effect of the treatment will be the same in
those with and without missing data. Other examples include missing data due to
administrative censoring or migration. To illustrate, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2a</xref> presents results for a hypothetical weight loss
trial comparing the effect of two treatments (A and B) on the outcome,
<italic>improvement in body fat</italic>, which is categorized as either yes
or no. A common measure of the relative effect of two treatments is the risk
ratio (RR; the proportion of those in treatment A with an improvement divided by
the proportion in treatment B with an improvement). In the study population,
improvement in body fat was 1.5 times more likely for treatment A compared to B
(i.e., RR = 1.5). The 95 percent confidence interval (1.05, 2.15) and the
p-value (0.02) generated from the chi-square test show a statistically
significant difference indicating that treatment A is superior to B.</p><p>To illustrate the MCAR mechanism, suppose that during the study the bioimpedence
scale used to measure body fat was unreliable and failed in 30 percent of the
participants. We also assume that this failure rate was not related to their
treatment or whether or not they had an improvement in body fat (i.e., an MCAR
mechanism). <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2b</xref> shows the results of
the study in those without missing data (i.e., completers). The risk ratio in
the completers remains unchanged at 1.5. Thus, the estimate of the treatment
effect was not biased by MCAR missing data. However, because of the reduced
sample size due to missing data, the standard error is larger, resulting in a
wider confidence interval (0.98, 2.30) that includes the null value of 1.0 and a
chi-square statistic that is no longer significant at the 0.05 threshold (p =
0.053). This example illustrates that complete case analysis does not result in
a biased estimate of the treatment difference in the absence of data arising
from an MCAR mechanism; however, there is a loss of precision in the estimation
of the treatment difference (i.e., larger standard errors and wider confidence
limits), as well as a loss of power in the test of significance (i.e., more
conservative test statistics yielding higher p-values).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Missing at Random</title><p>When the likelihood of missing data is related to observed variables but not to
unobserved variables, the missing data mechanism is referred to as missing at
random (MAR). If in a clinical trial dropout is more likely for men compared to
women, but all men have the same chance of dropout and all women have the same
chance of dropout, the missing data mechanism is MAR. Other examples of the MAR
mechanism are missing data caused by features of the study design (e.g.,
providing rescue therapy when conditions are not sufficiently controlled
according to protocol criteria), dropout based on recorded side effects or lack
of efficacy, or dropouts based on known baseline characteristics.</p><p>To illustrate MAR, the results of another hypothetical weight loss trial are
shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3a</xref>. Although the overall
likelihood of improvement was higher in men (62.5 percent = 375/600) than in
women (25 percent = 150/600), risk ratios were identical (RR = 1.5). Pooling of
the gender specific data also results in the same crude and gender adjusted risk
ratio (i.e., Mantel Haenszel RR = 1.5, 95 percent CI = 1.33, 1.70). Suppose the
likelihood of having missing data was dependent on the combination of the
treatment and gender (i.e., an MAR mechanism). For example, at the end of the
study, 20 percent of men in treatment A, 20 percent of men in treatment B, 10
percent of women in treatment A, and 55 percent of women in treatment B had
missing data. Note that the missing rates are dependent on the observed data but
not on the unobserved outcome. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3b</xref>
demonstrates the cross tabulations with the missing data rates applied to the
whole study population. Despite the differential missing data, gender specific
risk ratios remain the same, 1.5. However, crude pooling of the gender specific
completers data results in a risk ratio of 1.31 (95 percent CI = 1.12, 1.52)
that is smaller than the true risk ratio of 1.5. After adjustment for gender
using the Mantel-Haenszel method, the true risk ratio of 1.5 is recovered in the
completers, albeit with reduced precision and slightly larger confidence limits
(1.30, 1.73) compared to the whole study population.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Missing Not at Random</title><p>When the likelihood of missing data depends on the unobserved data, the missing
data is termed missing not at random (MNAR). For example, in substance abuse
trials with abstinence as an outcome, it is usual that dropout is higher for
those who have relapsed. The problem is in those who drop out, relapse status is
not typically obtained. In this case, the probability of having missing data is
dependent on their unobserved data &#x02015; relapse status. In another example,
consider a study evaluating treatments to reduce cocaine use in which the
outcome is drug level from a urine drug test measured every Monday morning.
Participants who use cocaine over the weekend and do not show up for their urine
test would be expected to have higher levels of cocaine metabolites. Thus, the
likelihood of the data being missing is directly related to the unobserved
cocaine level.</p><p>Continuing with our hypothetical clinical trial evaluating the effect of
treatment on improvement in body fat, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table
4</xref> demonstrates the consequences of missing data arising from a MNAR
mechanism. The proportion of missing data was set at 40 percent in those who
received treatment A and had an improvement in body fat and 40 percent in those
who received treatment B and did not have any improvement. Therefore, missing
data were related to the unobserved outcome (i.e., MNAR). The net result was a
complete reversal of the risk ratio when examining the whole study population
(<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4a</xref>, RR = 1.5) compared to the
completers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4b</xref>, RR = 0.84), both
reaching statistical significance. If the complete case analysis was used,
conclusions would have been the opposite from the true effect.</p><p>An alternative taxonomy refers to missing data arising from an MNAR mechanism as
<italic>non-ignorable</italic> because ignoring the process that leads to
the missing data will lead to biased results. In contrast, the probability of
missing data for ignorable missingness (MCAR or MAR) on a particular variable
does not depend on the values of that variable given other observed variables.
Such data may still produce unbiased estimates without the need for a model to
explain the missing mechanism. To obtain unbiased treatment differences when
missing data are MNAR requires modeling the relation between the outcome of
interest and the probability of non-response. Determining this relation is a
difficult task that highlights the importance of obtaining outcome data on every
randomized patient and collecting auxiliary data that may be predictive of
dropout.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Analytic Approaches to Missing Data: Effective Treatment, But Not the
Cure</title><p>As demonstrated above, failure to appropriately account for the missing data
mechanism during analysis can lead to erroneous conclusions. The problem that exists
at the end of a study is that there is no definitive way to demonstrate which
mechanism has led to the missing data. Addressing missing data during the analysis
is not an acceptable comprehensive approach to managing missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p><p>Statistical tests are available to demonstrate that missing data are not MCAR
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. However, exclusion
of MCAR is insufficient to ensure validity of a particular analysis. For instance,
in a study evaluating two interventions on smoking cessation, exploration might
uncover that baseline level of smoking was associated with dropout. While this
observation precludes the validity of an analysis that excluded those with missing
data (i.e., analysis that assumes MCAR) and suggest the need for an analytic method
that is valid under an MAR mechanism, it would not rule out an MNAR mechanism. That
is, unless the missing data occur as a function of the study design, such as
administrative censoring, a single technique for analysis does not exist. Rather a
series of missing data analytic techniques are necessary to examine missing data
bias. The following is an overview of analytic approaches, their assumptions about
the missing data mechanisms, and their advantages and disadvantages. The approaches
fall under four general strategies for coping with missing data: 1) use only data
from participants completing the trial with no missing data; 2) use all available
data; 3) impute (either single or multiple) values for missing data and analyze with
complete case methods; or 4) develop a model for the data that includes a model for
the missing data process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. The utility of each method under the different missing data
mechanisms is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Predefining Approach: During the Design of the Study</title><p>It is important to note the need to specify the plan to address the inevitable
missing data during the study design phase. Pre-specification of the statistical
analysis plan is important to avoid data-driven selection of results.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Common Approaches: Computationally Simple, but Rarely Acceptable</title><p><italic>Complete Case Analysis</italic> is performed on only those subjects with
a complete set of outcome data observed. Subjects with any missing data are
excluded from analysis and typical statistical methods are used (e.g.,
chi-square analysis, t-tests, ANOVA, regression) on the reduced set of
observations. For complete case analysis to provide an unbiased assessment of
the intervention effect, the assumption that completers are a random sample of
the full study sample (i.e., MCAR) is required. In addition to its computational
simplicity whereby common statistical tests are conducted, an advantage of this
method is that estimates of treatment differences are unbiased when missing data
are MCAR. Disadvantages include loss of power and precision in the estimation of
the treatment effect from the reduced sample size and the reliance on the strong
MCAR assumption. When missing data are not MCAR, the estimate of the
intervention effect will be biased.</p><p><italic>Single Imputation</italic> creates a complete set of data for all
randomized subjects by using a rule to set missing responses to a value. These
approaches are computationally simple. Once created, simple statistical methods
are used on the full set of data. There are many forms of single imputation,
including last observation carried forward (LOCF), worst observation carried
forward, and simple and conditional mean (or regression) imputation.</p><p>Due to its simplicity and its perceived (but often not true) tendency to provide
conservative estimates of the treatment effect, LOCF has been a popular
imputation technique. In LOCF, missing data for a subject is replaced with the
last observed value for that subject. This analysis is not valid under MCAR but
rather under the very specific and unrealistic assumption that the missing
outcomes are equal to the last observed response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. The argument that LOCF provides a conservative
estimate of an intervention is not universally true. Take, for example, a trial
comparing two interventions for maintaining cognitive function in patients with
Alzheimer&#x02019;s. The typical downward trajectory for these patients may lead to an
upwardly biased estimate of function in those who drop out. A higher proportion
of dropouts in one of the intervention groups would favorably bias that
intervention in an LOCF analysis. Imputing identical values for an individual
can also lead to underestimation of variability and a low p-value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].</p><p>Two other single imputation approaches are simple and conditional mean (or
regression) imputation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. In simple mean imputation, missing values are replaced by
the mean for that variable. This approach ignores information from other
variables that may be relevant if the data are MAR. While it can lead to valid
estimates of treatment differences under MCAR, it will result in an
underestimation of variability from the unseen data because a constant is
imputed for all missing data regardless of differing participant
characteristics. In contrast, conditional mean imputation accommodates
associations with other observed variables by regressing the outcome on other
observed variables in the completers. The missing outcomes are imputed using the
regression equation that includes a random error component. Given the use of the
observed data in the imputation and provided all covariates that sufficiently
explain the missing data are included, valid estimates of treatment differences
can be achieved under MAR. Nevertheless, the use of a single value to replace
missing data does not fully capture the uncertainty that this value is correct.
As with other single imputation procedures, underestimates in the variability of
treatment effects will lead to inappropriately low p-values.</p><p>The NRC guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]
for missing data state that single imputation methods like &#x0201c;last observation
carried forward&#x0201d; should not be used as the primary analytic approach unless the
assumptions that underlie these methods are scientifically justified.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Acceptable Approaches Under MAR</title><p><bold>Inverse Probability Weighting.</bold> This method has its origins in sample
survey research in which responses by survey participants are weighted to
accommodate unequal probabilities of selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. The survey weight for each participant is the
inverse of their probability of selection, and, thus, those with lower
probabilities of selection have a greater weight in the analysis. In missing
data, probabilities of being observed are estimated and analyses are weighted by
their inverse. Consequently, those with a low probability of observation will be
weighted more highly in the analysis. Weights may be obtained from a model such
as a logistic regression that includes intervention group, previous values of
the outcome of interest, and other covariates that may be predictive of being
observed.</p><p>Inverse probability weighting is a natural extension of a familiar technique that
provides unbiased estimates of the treatment difference under the MAR
assumption. Unlike the methods described below, it does not directly make use of
all available data as only subjects with complete data are included in the final
weighted model. Thus, power may be attenuated. Furthermore, to obtain valid
standard errors and confidence intervals, specialized software is required to
appropriately accommodate the weighted analysis. Packages such as SUDAAN, SAS,
and STATA are equipped to do this.</p><p><bold>Multiple Imputation (MI).</bold> While conditional mean imputation produces
unbiased estimates of the treatment effect, it consistently underestimates the
variability of this effect (i.e., artificially lowering p-values). This
underestimation results from treating the observed and imputed values the same
despite uncertainty in the imputed values. The method of multiple imputation
corrects for this by generating m completed data sets (typically m ranges from
5-20), each with the observed values and different plausible values imputed for
the missing observations. After creating the m complete data sets, each is
analyzed using usual methods (e.g., ANCOVA, regression), and the results are
then combined across the analyses. It is important to note that imputations are
not meant to be actual observations for that individual, but rather a
statistically plausible set of values based on other information for that
individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Thus,
analysis from &#x0201c;filled-in&#x0201d; data sets provide statistically plausible results that
would have been obtained if there were no missing data. Refer to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] for examples of trials using MI.</p><p>Under the MAR assumption, MI produces unbiased estimates of the intervention
effect and correct p-values. Other advantages of MI include the ability to
handle not only missing outcome but missing covariate information, its
relatively easy implementation, and the flexibility it provides by separating
the imputation from the analytic model. The latter allows for increased
complexity of the imputation model to make the MAR assumption more plausible. It
also provides a simple and attractive framework for exploring sensitivity to
non-random missing data. Drawbacks to MI include the inability to produce a
unique estimate of the treatment effect (provides a different result each time
you use MI) and the requirement for compatibility between the imputation and
analysis models (e.g., the analysis model cannot contain variables,
non-linearities or interactions that are not in the imputation model)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. The imputation model can be more complex than
the analysis model, but the latter cannot contain variables that are not in the
imputation model.</p><p><bold>Likelihood-based Analysis.</bold> Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a
common estimation method in statistics contingent upon finding estimates of the
treatment differences that maximize the probability of the observed data. To
illustrate the MLE approach, suppose we do an experiment in N people where the
probability of a success for an individual is p and the probability of a failure
is 1-p. If n people succeed and N-n people fail, the likelihood is proportional
to the product of the probabilities of successes and failures or p<sup>n</sup>
(1-p)<sup>N-n</sup>. The value of p that maximizes the likelihood is n/N or
the overall proportion of success. In the weight loss trial with no missing
data, maximum likelihood will produce the best estimate of the difference in
body fat between intervention groups that maximizes the probability of observing
the data. The problem when missing data occur is that we only observe a subset
of the data yet we would like to draw conclusions based on the full data. Under
MAR, the likelihood-based analysis allows us to accomplish this by averaging out
the missing data from the joint likelihood of the observed and missing data.
This is possible under MAR, because the future statistical behavior for a
subject, conditional upon observed data, is the same whether or not that subject
drops out. See [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>] for examples of trials using
MLE.</p><p>Under the MAR assumption, MLE produces unbiased estimates of the intervention
effect and correct p-values and software is readily available in statistical
packages (SAS, STATA, SPSS) for both continuous and discrete outcomes. Unlike
MI, MLE provides a unique estimate of the treatment difference. MLE also
requires fewer decisions than MI and is not reliant on compatibility of the
imputation (as there is no imputation in MLE) and analysis model. Disadvantages
of MLE include its reliance on parametric assumptions (e.g., normality) and that
it is only appropriate for missing outcome data (i.e., it is unable to
accommodate missing covariate data).</p><p><bold>ITT or Per Protocol.</bold> ITT analyses determine the effect of
intervention assignment (i.e., intention to give treatment) on the outcome
regardless of the actual intervention received. It evaluates the random
assignment. Per-protocol analyses evaluate the effect of the intervention for
participants who adhered to the protocol. IPW, MI, and MLE methods are
consistent with the ITT principle in that they do not exclude data from
participants with incomplete responses and participants are analyzed within the
group to which they were randomized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. However, in that they assume people with missing data
would have had the same outcome experience if they had completed the study as
similar people without missing data (i.e., those who adhered to the protocol)
the MAR methods deviate from the ITT toward the per-protocol analysis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Nevertheless,
when data are missing, there is no unequivocal ITT analysis. As such, the MAR
methods often provide a sensible approach for the primary analysis, but
sensitivity analyses are recommended to understand the robustness to departures
from the MAR assumption.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Acceptable Approaches Under MNAR</title><p>The basic approach to handling ignorable missing data (i.e., from an MCAR or MAR
mechanism) is to adjust for all observable differences between missing and
non-missing cases and assume that all remaining differences are unsystematic
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], thereby
ignoring the process by which missing data happen. When missing data occur from
an MNAR process, appropriate analysis requires the joint modeling of the outcome
along with the missing data mechanism. This can be very complicated, given that
under MNAR the model thereby the missing data process is rarely known for
creating unverifiable assumptions for the analysis. For instance, we suspect
relapse to lead to missing data in a study of treatment for substance abuse, but
it is unlikely that all missing data is the result of relapse. To conduct an
MNAR analysis, it is necessary to specify the strength of this relation, i.e.,
<italic>what&#x02019;s the probability of having missing data given relapse</italic>
or similarly (but not equal) <italic>what&#x02019;s the probability of relapse in those
with missing data?</italic></p><p>Paralleling these related questions are two approaches to analysis under MNAR,
selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], and
pattern-mixture models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Selection models require the specification of the relation
between the outcome and the probability of being missing. For instance, in our
weight loss study, the probability of a non-missing observation might be lower
in those who have a recent unobserved increase in body fat. On the other hand,
pattern-mixture models specify the outcome distribution across the observed
missing data patterns. For the weight loss example, this could correspond to
indicating the probability of various weight loss profiles for those who drop
out after their first visit compared to those who drop out after their second
visit or those who don&#x02019;t ever drop out. While arbitrary, the chosen weight loss
profiles could be further informed by recorded data such as the reason for
dropout, where different profiles could be adopted for those dropping out
because of migration compared to lack of efficacy.</p><p>While we can conceive of an endless number of MNAR analyses, in practice, a few
reasonable scenarios are chosen in sensitivity analyses. Mallinckrodt et al.
discuss a structure for conducting MNAR sensitivity analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Ranges of likely values for
the non-ignorable missing data can be solicited from experts (see Jackson et al.
for examples of this process) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. The robustness of the conclusion with regard to the
treatment difference is evaluated across these scenarios. For example, in the
pattern mixture model described above, a range of weight loss profiles could be
examined for their impact on study conclusions. See Hedeker et al. for an
applied example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Exploring Missing Data Patterns</title><p>In the presence of missing data, it is important to understand how much is missing
and in what patterns. Exploratory analyses include examining proportions and time to
drop out, differential reasons for dropout, and characteristics of those who do and
do not drop out. Kaplan Meier curves are helpful to compare time to dropout between
intervention groups or other important study variables. Similar rates and reasons
for dropouts between intervention groups increase the confidence in validity of an
ignorable analysis. Plots of outcomes at each time point for those who do and do not
drop out at the next visit determine whether dropout is conditional on observed
outcomes. Logistic regression can identify factors most strongly associated with
dropout. While a hypothesis test is available for MCAR, its use is limited as it
only provides evidence that data are not MCAR and cannot be used as confirmation
that data are MCAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. No
test can provide definitive proof of the mechanism that produced missing data.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>How Much Missing Data is Too Much?</title><p>The proportion of missing data alone is not sufficient to indicate study validity,
but studies with minimal missing data are more likely to produce valid conclusions.
Schulz and Grimes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]
suggest that losses to follow-up less than 5 percent usually have little impact
whereas losses greater than 20 percent raise serious flags about study validity.
In-between levels lead to problems somewhere in the middle. To support this,
Kristman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]
demonstrated through simulation that substantial bias in the estimation of odds
ratios under MNAR conditions may arise in cohort studies with loss to follow-up of
20 percent. However, the 5-20 general rule of thumb has no statistical justification
and oversimplifies the problem as the bias resulting from missing data also depends
on the missing data mechanism and the analytic method. It is certainly possible that
the use of a complete case analysis when 5-20 percent of the data are missing from
an MAR mechanism can lead to a biased treatment effect.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Practical Approaches to Minimize Missing Data</title><p>Given the uncertainties involved with the identification of the missing data
mechanism and thus conclusions from analyses that rely on this identification, the
best method for dealing with missing data is to prevent it. O&#x02019;Neill described the
need for a cultural shift, focusing on strategies to prevent missing data during the
conduct and management of clinical trials rather than relying on imperfect analytic
methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>].</p><p>The National Research Council (NRC) has provided recent guidance, listing several
recommendations to prevent missing data during the design and conduct of clinical
trials. Interpretations of these guidelines and additional approaches (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>) to prevent missing data have been
described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] as well as the potential dynamic
between statisticians and clinical investigators to achieve them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. The overarching goal is the
creation of procedures and a climate and culture that will maximize the collection
of complete data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].
Collaboration with a data coordinating center with a history of conducting clinical
trials is strongly encouraged to improve implementation.</p><sec id="s6a"><title>Approaches in Study Design</title><p>While it won&#x02019;t necessarily attenuate missing data, <italic>predicting the
expected proportions of missing data</italic> is recommended during the
design phase as it 1) can impact the variability and estimate of the effect size
thus influencing the required sample size and 2) be helpful in directing the
range of sensitivity analyses required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. Of note, <italic>inflation of the sample size estimate
for dropouts</italic> helps to preserve power, but it is not a comprehensive
strategy for dealing with missing data as it does not preclude the opportunity
for missing data-related bias.</p><p>Other design techniques are aimed at reducing the number of participants with a
missing primary outcome, usually from dropout. Although collecting an abundance
of data to answer secondary, tertiary, and exploratory questions is tempting,
the focus of a trial is to answer a primary question. Therefore, the benefits of
collection of data beyond what is required to answer the primary question and
crucial supportive evidence for it must be carefully weighed against the threat
of missing data. <italic>Limiting participant burden</italic> by reducing the
number of visits and the amount of data collected at each visit are universally
applicable study design approaches.</p><p>The applicability of <italic>other design strategies</italic> is study-specific.
Run-in periods are beneficial to minimize missing data even though the original
intent was to maximize adherence and exclude those intolerant to treatment.
Addressing target populations with incentive to remain in the study, using
flexible treatment regimens that increase adherence, using outcomes that can be
ascertained in a high proportion of participants, and shortening the follow-up
period for the primary outcome also are design approaches to minimize missing
data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26,</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>].</p><p>The randomized withdrawal design was initially proposed to evaluate long-term
effectiveness. Participants deemed &#x0201c;responders&#x0201d; to a treatment are randomized to
either maintain their current treatment group or receive placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. For example, to minimize the
long-term impact of a weight loss therapy, a short-term endpoint (e.g., 3
months), where the propensity for missing data is low, could be used to define
those responding to the treatment. Responders could then be randomized to
continue or receive standard care and then be evaluated at 12 months to examine
maintenance of effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="s6b"><title>Approaches in Study Planning and Conduct</title><p>Several common-sense opportunities should be considered during the planning and
conduct of a study to minimize missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>].
Approaches are directed at the participant, the data collection process, and the
study team.</p><p>In addition to limiting participant burden, <italic>enhancing participant
engagement</italic> is an effective approach to promote study completion.
Updating contact information regularly and providing incentives for
participation decrease the likelihood of dropout. Monetary incentives can be
increased for subsequent visits beyond the index visit to encourage study
completion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>].
<italic>Informed consent procedures should clearly distinguish between
discontinuation of study treatment and discontinuation of follow-up</italic>
so participants are clearly aware of their ability to complete the study despite
non-adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>].
Feelings of investment and appreciation for participation may be reinforced
through newsletters, study websites and social networking, access to study
findings, and frequent expressions of gratitude from the study team. It&#x02019;s
particularly important to <italic>engage participants at the greatest risk of
dropout</italic>. Those at highest risk may be identified by asking at each
visit about their likelihood for attendance at the next visit. If the chances of
attending are low, reasons or barriers along with potential solutions can be
explored.</p><p>When a participant drops out, it&#x02019;s helpful to <italic>determine the reason for
withdrawal</italic> as well as ancillary factors that may have been
associated with their decision. This information can be utilized to meet the MAR
assumption (e.g., by including them as adjustment covariates in the analysis) or
to inform sensitivity analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].</p><p>In addition to participant cooperation, complete data collection is contingent
upon adequate study documentation, appropriate training of study personnel, a
robust clinical management procedure, and a structure for efficient
communication among the study team. <italic>A manual of operations
(MOP)</italic> provides documentation to guide the conduct of the study
including timing windows for assessments, instructions for data collection, and
training requirements. Many NIH institutes such as the National Institute on
Aging offer online guidelines and templates for the MOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Prior to enrollment,
<italic>training and certification of study personnel</italic> is essential
for proper execution of the protocol. Highlighting the need for complete data
collection regardless of participant treatment adherence is a key component of
this training. Pilot testing the protocol can identify possible sources of
missing data. Development of participant calendars for visit reminders and
automated participant contact can be made possible by an <italic>electronic
clinical data management system</italic>. Visual data completeness checks
may be performed prior to the participant leaving or electronic data capture
systems programmed to require data completeness.</p><p>Constant exchange of information among the study team is essential so a
<italic>structure for efficient communication</italic> is required. The
process for dissemination of revised operations must be delineated. Regular
study team meetings (phone or face to face) or web-based discussion boards
permit the identification and an opportunity to resolve potential missing data
issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p><p>Finally, data completeness should be evaluated through <italic>regular monitoring
reports</italic> made available to the entire study team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. These reports require the
<italic>automization of data collection or entry of data in a timely
manner</italic> (i.e., as close to real-time as possible) in order to be
utilized to improve study conduct. The reports should include site-specific
summaries of subject retention and data completeness, particularly for the
essential study outcomes. <italic>A priori</italic> targets for unacceptable
rates of missing data will aid in interpretation and possible remediation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. Underperforming sites can undergo additional
training or be closed. To avoid this, the <italic>track record of the site with
regard to enrolling, following and collecting complete data should be an
important criterion for study-site selection</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Missing data are common in clinical trials. Given that no single analysis will be
definitive in the presence of missing data, limiting missing data through the
creation of a climate and culture that maximizes the collection of complete data is
necessary. Our proposed recommendations operationalize this by providing specific
guidance for each stage of the trial. In the design stage, researchers should
anticipate missing data patterns and causes and consider methods/designs that
encourage participant retention. Developing detailed study documentation, training
study personnel and testing operational aspects of the trial are important during
the planning stage. Regular monitoring of missing data and enhanced participant
contact is recommended for the conduct stage. While easy to implement, ad hoc
methods such as complete case analysis and last observation carried forward are not
advocated as primary analytic strategies. As a primary strategy, the use of all
available data is recommended through methods such as multiple imputation and
likelihood-based analysis. Sensitivity analyses under MNAR are appropriate to
evaluate robustness of conclusions to a range of sensible conditions.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomized clinical trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCAR</term><def><p>missing completely at random</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAR</term><def><p>missing at random</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MNAR</term><def><p>missing not at random</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LOCF</term><def><p>last observation carried forward</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRC</term><def><p>National Research Council</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>intent-to-treat principle</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MOP</term><def><p>manual of operations</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><ref id="R1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" publication-format="print"><name><surname>Dreyer</surname><given-names>NA</given-names></name><name><surname>Tunis</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ollendorf</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Mattox</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Gliklich</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><article-title>Why observational studies should be among the tools used in
