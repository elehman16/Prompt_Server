Following oral administration, LCZ696 provides systemic exposure to the pro-drug sacubitril (also known as AHU377, which is further metabolized to the active neprilysin inhibitor LBQ657) and valsartan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The mechanism of the beneficial effects of LCZ696 in HF are believed to be due to the enhancement of protective endogenous neurohormonal systems, such as the natriuretic peptide (NP) system, in the presence of simultaneous inhibition of the deleterious effects related to sustained renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation.</p><p>Drug-induced delayed cardiac repolarization, as reflected by a prolongation of the rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) is an important cardiac safety finding leading to the withdrawal of numerous drugs from the market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Drugs that have potential to block the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium channel (I<sub>KR</sub>) coded by human Ether-&#x000e0;-go-go related gene (hERG) can prolong QTc, which may lead to increased susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias, notably Torsades de Pointes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, rigorous characterization of novel pharmaceutical agents for their potential to prolong the QTc interval is warranted as part of their cardiac safety assessment.</p><p>Clinical and experimental evidence corroborate the beneficial effects of chronic treatment with RAAS inhibitors on the duration of QT interval in patients with hypertension and HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. While this may reflect the end result of several indirect factors, the impact of RAAS inhibitors on the electrophysiological mechanisms altered by angiotensin II might be a possible reason [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Angiotensin II probably prolongs the action potential by inhibiting the rapidly activating components of I<sub>KR</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The beneficial effect of valsartan in HF is clinically evident, while sacubitril showed no relevant effect on the hERG/I<sub>KR</sub> channel current even at the highest LCZ696 concentration tested (3000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M; &#x0003c;50&#x000a0;% inhibition) in vitro (data on file). Although in vitro ion-channel assessment of LBQ657 was not performed, QT prolongation was not documented during systematic in vivo exposure in primates (LCZ696) and dogs (sacubitril). This study therefore provided a dedicated assessment of effects of single oral therapeutic (400&#x000a0;mg) and supratherapeutic (1200&#x000a0;mg) doses of LCZ696 on cardiac repolarization to support the use in patients with HF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Healthy male subjects 18&#x02013;45&#x000a0;years of age with a body weight &#x02265;60&#x000a0;kg, a body mass index (BMI) of 18&#x02013;28&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and normal ECG, vital signs, and laboratory tests were enrolled in the study.

They are also at significantly increased risk for malignant ventricular death and sudden death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>LCZ696 is a novel drug approved for the treatment of HFrEF. According to ICH E14 guidelines, a thorough assessment of its effects on cardiac repolarization is required. Whereas the autonomic and neurohormonal milieu present in patients with HF differs substantially from healthy subjects, the TQT study environment provides the optimally standardized environment required to identify modest underlying changes in cardiac repolarization, and studies in healthy subjects are generally considered acceptable to inform drug-related repolarization liability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>This study evaluated the effect of LCZ696 400&#x000a0;mg, representing the total daily dose of the highest approved clinical dose and regimen (200&#x000a0;mg twice daily), and 1200&#x000a0;mg, representing a 6-fold multitude of any given single dose and 3-fold multiple of the standard total daily dose. Plasma concentrations observed in the present QTc study exceeded observed steady-state plasma concentration in healthy subjects and patients with heart failure. Furthermore, all LCZ696 analytes have a short half-life, high-plasma protein binding and were fully characterized regarding their effect on the QTc interval, thereby justifying a single-dose study design and the selected doses.</p><p>The results indicate no relevant impact on cardiac repolarization with LCZ696 at either doses as evidenced by a mean &#x02206;&#x02206;QTcF &#x0003c;5&#x000a0;ms with an upper bound &#x0003c;10&#x000a0;ms, in contrast to the positive comparator, moxifloxacin. LCZ696 administration in healthy subjects was associated with transient asymptomatic increase in HR. Changes in HR have the potential to impact the performance of rate-corrected QT values. Published literature indicates that the Fridericia formula performs better under conditions of alterations in HR, particularly when it is decreased; therefore, a formal adequacy assessment was performed to confirm the superior QT correction method for the study population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The lack of a relevant effect of LCZ696 on cardiac repolarization is evidenced both by the absence of a relevant mean change in &#x02206;&#x02206;QTcF, and the absence of outlier values during categorical change analyses. In addition, central tendency and categorical analyses of the prespecified ECG-derived PR interval and QRS duration did not show any clinically relevant treatment-related changes. The increased mean HR observed at 8&#x000a0;h following treatment with LCZ696 400 and 1200&#x000a0;mg compared with placebo or moxifloxacin was not dose related and was not temporally related to the maximum drug exposure. It may possibly be related to activity, as the earlier HR measurements on the assessment days were made during bed rest, while later measurements such as at 8&#x000a0;h post-dose were collected while the subjects were ambulant.</p><p>The PK analyses of LCZ696 revealed a dose proportional increase in the exposure of LBQ657 (the active metabolite of sacubitril), whereas the increase in the valsartan exposure was less than dose proportional, similar to the observations reported by Gu J et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The observed mean C<sub>max</sub> for all three LCZ696 analytes (sacubitril, 7780&#x000a0;ng/mL; LBQ657, 40700&#x000a0;ng/mL; and valsartan, 9360&#x000a0;ng/mL) following the administration of a supratherapeutic dose of LCZ696 (1200&#x000a0;mg) in this study exceeded the highest exposures of LCZ696 analytes observed to date at steady state in subjects with severe renal impairment receiving LCZ696 400&#x000a0;mg once daily for 5&#x000a0;days (sacubitril, 4960&#x000a0;ng/mL; LBQ657, 30650&#x000a0;ng/mL; and valsartan, 5852&#x000a0;ng/mL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The mean maximum QTcF was noted at 1&#x000a0;h post-dose for both 400 and 1200&#x000a0;mg dose levels, similar to the median T<sub>max</sub> for sacubitril of 30&#x000a0;min for the 400&#x000a0;mg dose and 1&#x000a0;h for the 1200&#x000a0;mg dose. In contrast, the T<sub>max</sub> for LBQ657 and valsartan occurred at 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;h post-dose.</p><p>The upper bound of the two-sided 90&#x000a0;% CI of the model-predicted regression lines for the relationship between &#x02206;&#x02206;QTcF and concentration of LCZ696 analytes at the supratherapeutic dose were below 10&#x000a0;ms, except for sacubitril, at concentrations &#x0003e;15000&#x000a0;ng/mL. However, the observed mean &#x02206;&#x02206;QTcF values, corresponding to sacubitril concentrations &#x0003e;15000&#x000a0;ng/mL, remained below 10&#x000a0;ms. Sacubitril concentrations are not expected to exceed 15000&#x000a0;ng/mL upon the administration of single or multiple doses of LCZ696 400&#x000a0;mg (therapeutic dose). Even in subjects with severe renal impairment, the mean peak plasma concentration of sacubitril after multiple doses of LCZ696 400&#x000a0;mg once daily for 5&#x000a0;days was 4960&#x000a0;ng/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], 3-fold lower than the highest individual C<sub>max</sub> of sacubitril following LCZ696 1200&#x000a0;mg administration in this study. Therefore, the model-predicted values for high exposures to sacubitril are not considered to be of clinical relevance.</p><p>LCZ696 (400&#x000a0;mg and 1200&#x000a0;mg) and moxifloxacin (400&#x000a0;mg) single doses were generally safe and well tolerated.</p><p>The overall safety profile in this study in healthy subjects was similar to the known safety profile of LCZ696 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. There were no repolarization changes on the ECGs and no AE reports that could suggest a potential for a pro-arrhythmic effect of LCZ696.</p><p>The major limitation of the present study is that the information was collected in healthy subjects and not in patients with HF, and that the supratherapeutic dose provides modest safety margins of 2.4-fold, 2.9-fold, and 2.0-fold, respectively, for the C<sub>max</sub> of sacubitril, LBQ657, and valsartan compared with patients with severe renal impairment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Single therapeutic and supratherapeutic oral doses of LCZ696 (400 and 1200&#x000a0;mg) did not affect cardiac repolarization, as evidenced by the lack of effect on QTc interval. Moxifloxacin was associated with the expected prolongation of the QT interval, thereby demonstrating assay sensitivity. LCZ696 at 400 and 1200&#x000a0;mg doses was generally safe and well tolerated in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="228_2016_2062_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><label>ESM 1</label><caption><p>(DOCX 23&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2"><media xlink:href="228_2016_2062_MOESM2_ESM.pdf"><label>Fig. S1</label><caption><p>(PDF 778&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM3"><media xlink:href="228_2016_2062_MOESM3_ESM.pdf"><label>Fig. S2</label><caption><p>(PDF 403&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Sreedevi Boggarapu, Novartis Healthcare Pvt.
