The patients were divided into two groups. In group 1, pars plana vitrectomy with removal of the posterior hyaloid was performed, and at the end of the procedure, IVTA 0.1 mL (40 mg/mL) and bevacizumab 1.25 mg were injected. In group 2, macular grid laser photocoagulation was performed 2 weeks after the same intravitreal injection combination as used in group 1. The main outcome measures were best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central foveal thickness, which were measured using optical coherence tomography at 3, 6, and 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Changes in BCVA and central foveal thickness at 3, 6, and 12 months from baseline were highly statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Mean BCVA was better in group 1 at 3 months, nearly equal at 6 months, and less at 12 months. Mean central foveal thickness was more improved in group 1 than in group 2 at 3 months, and was better in group 2 at subsequent measurement points. The major adverse events were development of cataract (more common in group 1) and elevation of intraocular pressure (more common in group 2).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The combined therapy described here could represent a solution for the treatment of intractable diabetic macular edema, and could have a favorable long-term outcome. Combined treatment of IVTA and bevacizumab plus grid laser resulted in a more favorable reduction in central foveal thickness and improvement in BCVA at 12 months than vitrectomy combined with the same injections. This small study favors the safer, cheaper, and more available line of treatment.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>intractable diffuse diabetic macular edema</kwd><kwd>intravitreal triamcinolone</kwd><kwd>bevacizumab injection</kwd><kwd>macular grid laser photocoagulation</kwd><kwd>central foveal thickness</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>An estimated 346 million people were affected by diabetes worldwide in 2011, and the number of people with the disease is expected to double from 2005 to 2030.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-opth-7-283">1</xref> Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of loss of vision in adults of working age,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-opth-7-283">2</xref> and diabetic macular edema is the most frequent cause of vision loss related to diabetes, especially in patients with a long duration of disease.</p><p>Argon laser photocoagulation has been the mainstay of treatment for macular edema since publication of the results of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (EDRTS).

Evaluation was done preoperatively and up to 12 months postoperatively. The study included 34 eyes from 34 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (17 males and 17 females). Four patients (two in each group) were excluded from the study because they missed two postoperative visits. Informed consent was obtained from all patients enrolled in the study after the nature and possible consequences of the procedures had been explained. Only one eye per participant could be enrolled. All patients had been diagnosed with intractable diffuse diabetic macular edema, which was defined as biomicroscopically, angiographically, and tomographically confirmed diffuse diabetic macular edema which did not respond to or recurred after IVTA and/or macular focal laser photocoagulation. Central foveal thickness had to be greater than 300 &#x003bc;m.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included the presence of vitreomacular traction, active neovascularization of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, an enlarged foveal avascular zone on fluorescein angiography, neurosensory detachment on optical coherence tomography, treatment for diabetic macular edema within the previous 3 months, previous vitreoretinal surgery, other major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, scleral buckle, or other intraocular surgery) within the previous 6 months, YAG capsulotomy performed within the 2 months prior to enrollment, other macular pathology (eg, age-related macular degeneration, retinal vascular occlusive diseases, combined optic neuropathy, glaucoma including neovascular glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage), refusal to provide written informed consent, or missing two follow-up visits.</p><p>Baseline evaluation included measurement of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using the ETDRS chart and reported as EDRTS acuity log score, intraocular pressure using applanation tonometry, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, dilated fundus examination, fundus fluorescein angiography using a Visucam Lite device (AG 07740, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany), and optical coherence tomography (Cirrus HD-OCT 4000, Carl Zeiss Meditec). Central foveal thickness was defined as the distance between the inner retinal surface and the retinal pigment epithelium at the central fovea. Systemic hypertension, mean glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) levels, hemoglobin, lipid profile, and prothrombin time and concentration were controlled at baseline.</p><p>The 30 patients (15 males and 15 females) were randomly divided into two groups. In group 1 (n = 15), pars plana vitrectomy with removal of the posterior hyaloid was performed, and at the end of the procedure, IVTA 0.1 mL (40 mg/mL) and bevacizumab 1.25 mg were injected. In group 2 (n = 15), macular grid laser photocoagulation was performed 2 weeks after the same combination of intravitreal injection as used in group 1. There were no statistically significant differences between the study groups with regard to age, gender, stage of diabetic retinopathy, previous treatment of diabetic macular edema, lens status, intraocular pressure values, or medical conditions (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-opth-7-283">Table 1</xref>). Systemic hypertension, controlled with oral hypotensive medications, was reported for 21/30 patients (10 and 11 patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively). Mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels were 7.95 and 8.13 in groups 1 and 2, respectively, and 25/30 were on insulin therapy (12 and 13 patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively).</p><sec><title>Intervention</title><sec><title>Group 1</title><p>All patients were given preoperative topical atropine sulfate 1% and antibiotic-steroid drops (Dexaflox<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Jamjoom Pharma, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia) three times daily. Surgeries were performed under local peribulbar anesthesia by the same surgeon (AMS). A standard 20 gauge pars plana vitrectomy was performed, ie, three sclerotomies, removal of the vitreous gel with the vitrectomy probe of a machine from DORC (a collaboration between Zuidland, The Netherlands, and Synergetics Inc, St Charles, MO, USA) at a cutting rate of 1200 cuts per minute, and a vacuum of 150 mmHg in the region of the central portion of the vitreous gel. Diluted triamcinolone acetonide powder was injected into the mid vitreous cavity to stain the cortical vitreous and assist in its complete removal, which involved peeling the posterior hyaloid by applying gentle vacuum with the probe or suction by the flute needle close to the optic nerve head till engagement, then pulling upwards. The internal limiting membrane was intentionally left. The vitreous base was removed as far as possible with a lower vacuum of 100 mmHg and a higher cutting rate of 1600 cuts per minute. The lens was spared in all phakic patients, with peeling of any peripheral epiretinal membranes which could potentially be a threat to vision. The peripheral retina was examined, and any detected tear was surrounded by two rows of endolaser photocoagulation spots. Next, closure of the sclerotomies and conjunctiva was performed using 7/0 Vicryl<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> sutures (polyglactin 910; Ethicon Inc, Johnson and Johnson, Somerville, NJ, USA). At the end of the procedure, IVTA 0.1 mL (40 mg/mL of Kenacort-A<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, GlaxoSmithKline, Philadelphia, PA, USA) and bevacizumab (1.25 mg, Avastin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) were injected. Postoperatively, prednisolone acetate 1% and gatifloxacin 0.3% (Optipred<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Tymer<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, respectively, Jamjoom Pharma, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia) eye drops were administered five times daily for 3 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Group 2</title><p>The same injections of IVTA 0.1 mL (40 mg/mL) and bevacizumab 1.25 mg were given at two separate injection sites under completely sterile conditions in the operating room under microscopic visualization at distances of 4 mm and 3.5 mm from the limbus in phakic and pseudophakic patients, respectively. Paracentesis was done first to soften the eye. Next, gatifloxacin 0.3% eye drops were prescribed four times daily for one week. Argon laser photocoagulation was applied 2 weeks following the injections using an Ellex Integre device (Ellex Medical Pty Ltd, Adelaide, Australia). Grid laser (532 nm) to areas of thickened retina showing diffuse fluorescein leakage or capillary dropout. Burns (100&#x02013;200) of light intensity were placed 100&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;m apart in this area using 100 &#x003bc;m spots 0.1&#x02013;0.05 seconds in duration. Grid treatment was not applied within 500 &#x003bc;m of the center of the macula or within 500 &#x003bc;m of the disk margin. If present, any focal leaks within the zone of grid treatment were treated focally by a 100&#x02013;150 &#x003bc;m spot applied for 0.l second in duration to treat all lesions that leaked fluorescein.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study visits</title><p>Group 1 made study visits at one week, and one, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, and group 2 study visits were in the same sequence following application of grid laser.

Elevation of intraocular pressure was reported in two eyes (13.3%) and seven eyes (46.6%) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Elevated intraocular pressure was recorded after IVTA injection within a variable time period (range 4 days to 3 weeks). Intraocular pressure was controlled medically in all cases (nine eyes) with topical antiglaucoma drops, ie, timolol maleate 0.5% (Egyptian International Pharmaceutical Industries Company, Cairo, Egypt), dorzolamide HCl 2% (Trusopt, Merck and Co, Inc, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA), and brimonidine tartrate 0.2% (Alphagan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Allergan Inc, Irvine, CA, USA). Two cases were controlled by one drug, four cases by two drugs, and three cases by three drugs.

The vitreous has been implicated as a cause of diabetic macular edema via several mechanical and physiologic mechanisms, all of which lead to increased vascular permeability. Suggested mechanisms include destabilization of the vitreous by abnormal glycation and crosslinking of vitreal collagen leading to traction on the macula, accumulation and concentration of factors causing vasopermeability in the premacular vitreous gel, and accumulation of chemoattractant factors in the vitreous, leading to migration of cells to the posterior hyaloid, contraction, and macular traction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-opth-7-283">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-opth-7-283">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-opth-7-283">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-opth-7-283">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-opth-7-283">22</xref> The spectrum of indications for vitrectomy has been extended to include diabetic macular edema with or without taut posterior hyaloid.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-opth-7-283">23</xref> Various studies suggest that the presence of tangential vitreomacular tractional forces combined with local presence of a number of cytokines (eg, interleukin-6) and growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factor and angiotensin) contribute to the development of diabetic macular edema, and their removal benefits macular edema and helps to delay its progression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-opth-7-283">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-opth-7-283">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-opth-7-283">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-opth-7-283">26</xref> Ikeda et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-opth-7-283">8</xref> suggested that removal of the barrier between the vitreous cavity and retina by pars plana vitrectomy might lead to improved diffusion of fluid from the retinal tissue.

Removal of this membrane may have the additional benefit of preventing later epiretinal membrane formation by removing the scaffold for proliferating cells. However, in this trial, it was decided not to peel the internal limiting membrane for eyes with chronic diffuse diabetic macular edema, because of concerns about further photoreceptor damage in an already damaged macula by removing the membrane, possible indocyanine green dye toxicity during staining of the internal limiting membrane, and potential alteration in M&#x000fc;ller cell physiology after its removal, which may explain the lack of significant improvement in vision despite a marked resolution of macular edema.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-opth-7-283">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-opth-7-283">31</xref> Some reports have shown that removal of the internal limiting membrane has better anatomic as well as functional results,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-opth-7-283">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-opth-7-283">32</xref> while others have reported the opposite.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-opth-7-283">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-opth-7-283">34</xref></p><p>The results of this clinical trial show a highly statistically significant increase in BCVA at all postoperative study visits when compared with baseline values in both groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). These visual results were better than expected from the photoreceptor damage caused by chronic macular edema, underlying diabetic retinopathy changes, and prior macular laser photocoagulation treatment which was an inclusion criterion for this study. However, this marked visual improvement might also reflect the cases of diabetic macular edema that were excluded from this trial, such as those with ischemic maculopathy, neurosensory detachment, and active proliferative diabetic retinopathy, which are the most common causes of lack of visual improvement in diabetic macular edema. However, the aforementioned factors still had their impact on the functional results, which were less beneficial when compared with the more promising anatomic findings. Moreover, the limited functional results in this study may have been attributable to the included cases of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (five and four cases in groups 1 and 2, respectively), and the influence of elevated HbA1c levels and poor blood pressure control.</p><p>When comparing BCVA at 12 months with baseline values, it was found that it improved by more than two lines in 10 eyes (66.6%) in each group. These results are consistent with those reported by Song et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-opth-7-283">34</xref> who achieved a BCVA improvement of more than two lines in 49% of eyes following pars plana vitrectomy for persistent diabetic macular edema, and the good results in the current study could be due to the additive effect of IVTA and bevacizumab injection used in combination. Group 1 had one case of BCVA being decreased by two lines, which could be related to the effects of the vitrectomy procedure on the macula as mentioned before, proliferative diabetic retinopathy changes in this patient, high blood glucose (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e; 9.8%), and poor blood pressure control (&#x0003e;150/105 mmHg).</p><p>In this trial, there was a highly statistically significant decrease in central foveal thickness at all postoperative study visits when compared with baseline values in both groups. This result in the vitrectomy group suggests that the presence of vitreomacular traction (which was an exclusion criterion in this trial) did not affect the surgical results of pars plana vitrectomy in intractable diffuse diabetic macular edema; this was also reported by Song et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-opth-7-283">34</xref> who recommended early surgical intervention for eyes with intractable diffuse diabetic macular edema. Others have reported that for eyes without taut posterior hyaloid and in eyes with posterior vitreous detachment, the efficacy of pars plana vitrectomy is controversial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-opth-7-283">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-opth-7-283">35</xref> However, it is worth mentioning that identification of the posterior hyaloid by biomicroscopy is notoriously difficult, and even optical coherence tomography can visualize the vitreoretinal interface only when it is partially detached or when the posterior vitreous detachment is located within a few micrometers from the retinal surface. Even during surgery, it may be hard to distinguish a posterior vitreous detachment from vitreoschisis, especially in patients with longstanding diabetic retinopathy. Also, eyes in group 2 showed a highly statistically significant decrease in central foveal thickness at all postoperative study visits when compared with baseline values, and the results were comparable with those in group 1, with no statistically significant difference found at any study visit. This suggests that macular grid laser following combined IVTA and bevacizumab injection seems to be as effective as or even better than pars plana vitrectomy with the same injections. This could be explained by the vitrectomy procedure with posterior hyaloid detachment that might result in relatively more damage to the foveal photoreceptors than with macular grid laser application.</p><p>Another important issue is the timing of intervention in relation to the severity of diabetic macular edema; in other words, grid laser was applied 2 weeks following the combined injection when the beneficial pharmacologic effects of the drugs had occurred and the diabetic macular edema had subsided. However, in group 1, vitrectomy with detachment of the posterior hyaloid was performed while the diabetic macular edema was maximum, resulting in more potential risk of damage.</p><p>When comparing the main outcome measurements in this trial, mean BCVA and central foveal thickness improvement were better in group 1 (ie, the vitrectomy group) at 3 months, with no further improvement seen at subsequent study visits. This could be explained by the nature of the procedure used, in that laser takes time to exert its effect on the retinal pigment epithelium and vitrectomy has an immediate effect on elimination of the inflammatory and growth factors as well as the potential mechanical effect of the posterior hyaloid and improvement in retinal oxygenation. Another explanation could be the enhanced pharmacologic effect of better solubility and diffusion of the drugs injected into the retinal tissues of vitrectomized eyes, realizing the potential benefits earlier.</p><p>It was also observed that the mean central foveal thickness in each group showed maximum improvement at 3 months, with a subsequent small gradual increase in central foveal thickness at 6 and 12 months; however, this was still markedly less than baseline values. This is because the effect of the injected drug combination lasts for a short duration and the requirement for multiple reinjections are the major drawback of the presently available drugs. Also, further deterioration is very likely if macular edema redevelops.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-opth-7-283">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-opth-7-283">38</xref></p><p>There was no difference recorded in mean central foveal thickness between eyes that had been treated with macular argon laser before the study (10 eyes, 66% in each group) and eyes that had received previous IVTA injection when comparing the 12-month results with baseline values in either group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). This result is supported by the work of Kumar et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-opth-7-283">39</xref> who observed no significant improvement in functional results in patients with diffuse diabetic macular edema when comparing vitrectomy with removal of the internal limiting membrane and grid laser photocoagulation.</p><p>When comparing the main outcome measurements in this trial (BCVA and central foveal thickness), it was found that group 2 achieved better results than group 1 by the end of the study period, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Although there has been a considerable number of studies indicating an important role of the posterior hyaloid in the pathogenesis of diabetic macular edema,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-opth-7-283">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-opth-7-283">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-opth-7-283">26</xref> we did not find any additional effect of posterior hyaloid detachment over macular grid laser in this study. One possible cause for this discrepancy is the chronic nature of diabetic macular edema and longstanding intraretinal diabetic changes with irreversible photoreceptor damage, and the selection of patients with type 2 diabetic mellitus, which may have had a negative impact on photoreceptor recovery in this elderly study population. The patients selected for this trial represent the typical situation in most elderly patients with type 2 diabetes where no clinically visible vitreomacular traction is present.</p><p>Other important points to account for the issue of why patients in group 2 showed a good response to the combined injection and subsequent grid laser although they had received combined IVTA injection and focal macular laser before are: first, the additive effect of bevacizumab and IVTA in reducing diffuse diabetic macular edema<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-opth-7-283">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-opth-7-283">43</xref> in terms of reduction in central foveal thickness (providing better results of subsequent laser application) and improvement in BCVA; second, grid laser applied (with the previously mentioned parameters) 2 weeks post-injection could have had a more beneficial effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-opth-7-283">44</xref> than any other previous laser technique or timing; and third, only four eyes in group 2 had received combined IVTA injection and macular laser before inclusion in this trial, so the response of the group (15 eyes) was expected to be better when all patients received the triple approach.</p><p>The major adverse events were development of cataract (six cases in group 1 and three cases in group 2) and elevation of intraocular pressure (two cases in group 1 and seven cases in group 2). Cataract occurs as an unavoidable complication of pars plana vitrectomy (occurring in 66% of phakic patients in group 1), is a common complication of IVTA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-opth-7-283">45</xref> and bevacizumab injection (recorded in 33% of phakic patients in group 2), and also arises as a complication of diabetes itself. None of our cases showed a significant variation in BCVA or central foveal thickness, or a change in the nature of their macular edema following the successful phacoemulsification procedure. This may be an advantage of the perioperative topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drops used and the absence of any surgical complications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-opth-7-283">46</xref></p><p>Elevation of intraocular pressure was reported in two eyes (13.3%) and seven eyes (46.6%) in groups 1 and 2, respectively, which could be due to steroid responsiveness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-opth-7-283">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-opth-7-283">47</xref> or decompensated trabecular dysfunction following the injection. More cases of elevated intraocular pressure were recorded in group 2 than in group 1, and this may be due to the easier washout of the IVTA in vitrectomized eyes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-opth-7-283">48</xref></p><p>No other major complications, eg, endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, significant vitreous hemorrhage, choroidal hemorrhage, or atrophia bulbi, were recorded in this study, which of course enhanced the functional and anatomical results. The complication rate was comparable with that reported by other studies of macular surgery with posterior hyaloid detachment.</p><p>The limitations of this study include its relatively small study population, that may have influenced the statistical results, and the lack of a control group. Further, the study design did not allow for assessment of the efficacy of the procedures in altering the natural course of diabetic macular edema, and also included a short observation time.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study underlines the efficacy of both pars plana vitrectomy (with posterior hyaloid removal and without additional internal limiting membrane peeling) and macular grid laser, each combined with IVTA and bevacizumab injection, with regard to resorption of intractable diffuse diabetic macular edema (persistent or recurrent diabetic macular edema after laser photocoagulation or IVTA) even in eyes without vitreomacular traction. This combined therapy could represent a solution for the treatment of intractable diabetic macular edema, with a favorable long-term outcome. Both procedures seemed to improve BCVA and central foveal thickness, so this treatment option might be considered in the earlier stages of the disease to preserve vision. Combined treatment of IVTA and bevacizumab plus grid laser resulted in a more favorable functional and anatomic outcome because it provided a more durable improvement in BCVA and reduction in central foveal thickness at 12 months than vitrectomy combined with the same injections, and with relatively fewer complications. This small study favors the safer, cheaper, and more available line of treatment. Further studies of larger numbers of eyes and with a longer follow-up period are needed. The additive effect of triple therapy (pars plana vitrectomy, IVTA and bevacizumab injection, and postoperative grid laser) also needs to be evaluated.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
