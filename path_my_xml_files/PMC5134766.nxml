As reported by a survey in Canada, 87% of poststroke patients were willing to be given acupuncture treatment, and 98% were willing to learn more regarding acupuncture as a treatment on stroke rehabilitation.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> However, the benefit of acupuncture for stroke is still controversial.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Previous studies investigating efficacy of acupuncture treatment on stroke patients have presented varied results,<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> even though many acupuncturists and patients believe in the efficacy of acupuncture on stroke. Heterogeneity of patients recruited is one of the important reasons for these discrepant results. Most of the previous studies recruited both cerebral hemorrhage and ischemia patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> This probably is due to the difficulty to recruited enough patients with the same type of stroke, especially the hemorrhagic stroke. In a previous study investigating efficacy of scalp and penetration acupuncture for stroke, Jungchul Seo thought that the negative results in their study may be changed if hemorrhagic stroke patients were targeted.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Our study focused on the cerebral hemorrhage patients, which may partly reduce the heterogeneity of subjects, despite it took a long time to recruit all the patients.</p><p>In Traditional Chinese Medicine, penetration acupuncture on head is a special acupuncture skill by penetrating the needle at 1 acupoint toward another acupoint and is frequently employed to treat ischemic stroke patients. It can help patients obtain the needling sensation &#x0201c;De qi&#x0201d; easily and achieve a good effect by employing few points. Based on modern findings regarding the plastic changes occurring immediately after brain damage, rehabilitation treatment should be more effective if started soon after onset.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> However, due to the rapid onset, high mortality and unstable condition of hemorrhagic stroke, some academics were negative or skeptical about acupuncture on head for acute ICH. The main concern was that external stimulus might influence the stability of hematoma and increase the risks of expansion of edema and hematoma.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> The present study found no aggravation of cerebral hematoma in patients with penetration acupuncture treatment on head. In fact, significantly more patients among TG got a substantial and part absorption of hematoma, compared with CG. In addition, vital signs in patients with acupuncture treatment were stable or improved during the treatment. The result of acupuncture lowering heart rate and blood pressure is consistent with a previous study investigating acupuncture effects on hypertension patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> Penetration acupuncture on head appeared to be safe for the treatment of acute ICH. Previous experimental studies demonstrated that acupuncture could inhibit the expression of endogenous MMP-9, AQP-4, and PAR-1, which may build the material basis of cerebral edema or play important roles in progression of edema.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> This may be a potential explanation for our outcomes. Acupuncture has also been found to significantly increase the regional cerebral blood flow, which is the foundation for hematoma absorption, edema elimination, thereby intracranial pressure reduction, providing further support for the hematoma absorption effects attributable to acupuncture stimulation.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup></p><p>It is generally believed that the recurrence rate of ICH among patients with first occurrence is higher than the first incidence among ordinary people, about 2% versus 0.3% to 0.53% each year.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> In this study, only 1 patient from the CG was excluded due to the recurrence of cerebral infarction at day 50 in follow-up, accounting for the total recurrence rate of less than 1%. This may be due to the few cases included and short follow-up time.</p><p>CNFDS is a wildly used instrument in China for evaluating neurologic impairment of poststroke patients. It was developed based on the SSS with some modification to satisfy the neurologists in daily usage. It explicitly quantificats the extremity strength by the angle between the extremity and the trunk, instead of some vague description such as &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;weakened&#x0201d;. In 20 years usage, it has been testified to be a reliable and valid scale to evaluate the prognosis and severity of acute stroke patients and proved to be significantly correlated with the Canadian Neurological Scale and the NIH Stroke Scale.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> It excluded some items specified to vertebral basilar artery territory stroke thus suitable for the carotid artery territory stroke. The patients recruited in the present study were all with carotid artery stroke. In addition, due to the unstable condition of patients in the acute phase of ICH, complex and various evaluation measurements were not feasible. Therefore, we used CNFDS and BI during this period, both of which were practicable and time saving.</p><p>One key point necessary to discuss is the conflicting results between the CNFDS and the BI. Mechanisms that may physiologically underpin effects of acupuncture for ICH have been specifically investigated by recent work. A number of animal studies demonstrated that acupuncture can affect a variety of factors potentially related with ICH, such as reducing the expression of cytochrome C and p53 protein to decrease neuronal apoptosis, upregulating the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor to improve nerve regeneration, downregulating neuron-specific enolase expression to keep neuronal cell membrane integrity.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup></p><p>If the mechanism of acupuncture effect for ICH is connected to factors that affect neural plasticity, measures used for acupuncture effect should be more intimately related to neurorecovery. In view of this, our results indicate that CNFDS might be a more responsive instrument that can detect the neurorecovery effect of acupuncture. As CNFDS is a specific assessment focusing on neurological function deficits resulting from the stroke, whereas BI is a globe instrument measuring ADL according to the degree of stroke and covering a wide range of performances, thus insufficient to detect changes in neurological function after stroke and not rationally related with the mechanisms that might account for effectiveness of acupuncture. Due to compensation of the unaffected limb,<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> patients who had poor neurological function may perform well in BI test. As such, there may be subtle improvements detected in the CNFDS that may not be presented in the BI. At this point, this pilot study is consistent with previous studies that have examined acupuncture treatment effects for ischemic stroke, which demonstrated similar result: When global measures are employed, no effects of acupuncture are detected. Conversely, when more sensitive measures are used, effects of acupuncture are obvious.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Therefore, we suggest that outcome instruments used in future studies assessing acupuncture effects on stroke should be valid, reliable, and sensitive enough to detect changes following stroke.</p><p>Some limitations of this study should be discussed. Although the evaluators in our study were blinded to the allocation of the patients, the patients were not. Using sham acupuncture was not regarded as a suitable control for our study, because it was hard to apply sham acupuncture. The majority of the patients or their families were acquainted with acupuncture; thus, they would easily notice the differences if given sham acupuncture and difficult to get the real feeling. For that reason, we adopted the conventional treatment as the control intervention. The sample size was calculated based on primary outcomes, so it was potentially underpowered for the second outcomes, which are used for safety evaluation. Due to the rigorous inclusion criteria and our choice not to include ischemic stroke patients or patients with previous strokes, we were not able to include enough patients for all the outcomes in a limited time. Therefore, clinical interpretations based on these results should be treated with caution.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrated a significantly greater hematoma absorption and improvement in CNFDS after penetration acupuncture treatment on head combined with conventional treatment compared with conventional treatment alone, whereas no significantly difference was found in BI. Penetration acupuncture treatment on head appeared to be safe over the course of treatment on acute ICH. However, due to the restriction of sample size, a larger trial incorporating a multicenter should be carried out before promoting this treatment widely. Furthermore, longer follow-up time in future work is also needed to assess the long-term effect, mortality and recurrence rate of this treatment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: BI = Barthel Index, CG = control group, CNFDS = Clinical Neurological Function Deficit Scale, HAR = hematoma absorption ratio, ICH = intracerebral hemorrhage, TG = treatment group.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding/support: The study was supported by scientific research project of Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, China.
