This study was designed to test whether or not within-subject changes of activity correlations (i) track the clinical progression of dementia, (ii) reflect the alterations of depression symptoms in patients with dementia, and (iii) can be manipulated by clinical interventions aimed at stabilizing circadian rhythmicity and improving sleep in dementia, namely timed bright light therapy and melatonin supplementation. We examined 144 patients with dementia (70&#x02013;96 years old) who were assigned to daily treatment with bright light, bedtime melatonin, both or placebos only in a 3.5-year double-blinded randomized clinical trial. We found that activity correlations at temporal scales &#x0003c;~2&#x02009;hours significantly decreased over time and that light treatment attenuated the decrease by ~73%. Moreover, the decrease of temporal activity correlations positively correlated with the degrees of cognitive decline and worsening of mood though the associations were relatively weak. These results suggest a mechanistic link between multiscale activity regulation and circadian/sleep function in dementia patients. Whether temporal activity patterns allow unobtrusive, long-term monitoring of dementia progression and mood changes is worth further investigation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Dementia and Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) have become increasingly prevalent as the population aged 65 and older continues to increase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.

However, these findings are exclusively based on cross-sectional studies. The clinical relevance of temporal activity regulation in dementia awaits evidence from longitudinal studies that examine within-subject changes during the progression of dementia and the potential association with mood changes.</p><p>One possible common pathological pathway for the observed altered multiscale activity regulation in dementia and depression is disrupted function of the sleep/circadian control system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. There are several lines of studies supporting this hypothesis. (1) Cumulative evidence suggests a mechanistic role of sleep/circadian control in the development and progression of dementia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. For instance, disturbances in sleep and circadian rhythms are common in older persons and more pronounced in patients with dementia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.

(2) Circadian/sleep dysfunction is also associated with mood disturbances. Patients with depression often have abnormal sleep-wake cycles and reduced circadian amplitudes in daily activity and other physiological functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>; and treatment of depression with antidepressants helps to restore disrupted sleep and daily/circadian rhythms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. (3) Timed bright light therapy that can improve sleep and SCN functioning is also beneficial for mood and cognition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. (4) Most related to multiscale activity regulation, functional changes in the circadian pacemaker (suprachiasmatic nucleus; SCN) are accompanied by not only perturbed activity rhythms at ~24&#x02009;hours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> but also degraded temporal activity correlations at multiple time scales<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Despite the evidence, it is unknown whether degraded activity regulation in dementia patients can be attenuated/reversed by manipulation of sleep/circadian regulation.</p><p>To better understand the clinical relevance of multiscale activity regulation and the underlying mechanisms, we examined data collected longitudinally to test four hypotheses: (1) temporal activity correlations decrease gradually over time in dementia patients; (2) long-term bright light with melatonin therapy attenuates the degradation in temporal activity correlations over time; (3) the degree of the decline in activity correlations positively correlates with the worsening of depression symptoms in patients/individuals with dementia; and (4) the degree of the decline in activity correlations positively correlates with cognitive declines. To test these hypotheses, we examined motor activity regulation of 165 patients (70&#x02013;96 years old) with mid- to late-stage dementia from an existing database for a double-blind randomized clinical trial (controlled-trials.com/isrctn Identifier: ISRCTN93133646; Registered on December 09, 2005)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. These patients were assessed at baseline and every 6 months thereafter for up to 3.5 years. In this clinical trial, 45 patients received daily treatment with bright light, 39 took bedtime melatonin each day, 44 received both the bright-light and melatonin treatments, and 37 received placebos only. To estimate temporal correlations in the activity fluctuations at time scales from ~0.1 up to 12&#x02009;hours, we performed the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) that has been widely used in physiological data analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. We determined the within-subject changes in multiscale activity correlations over time and related the results to the changes in mood and cognition of the same subjects.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Temporal Correlations of Activity Fluctuations in Dementia at Baseline</title><p>At baseline (i.e., prior to any intervention) activity fluctuations in these dementia patients had positive correlations at all tested time scales (as indicated by DFA exponent &#x0003e;0.5) but the temporal correlations were much weaker (i.e., more random fluctuations) at time scales &#x0003e;2&#x02009;hours as compared to that at smaller time scales (DFA exponents: &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.72&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01 [SE] at&#x02009;&#x0003e;2&#x02009;hours; &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.97&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01 at&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1.5&#x02009;hours; &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> &#x02212; &#x003b1;<sub>2&#x02009;=&#x02009;</sub>0.25&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02; Paired t-test, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>).

The current study provides the first analysis of within-subject changes of the temporal organization over time, the relevance of such changes to functional declines, and the effect of clinical interventions in people with dementia. Our results show that the temporal activity correlations at &#x0003c;~2&#x02009;hours gradually decline over the years in patients with dementia and that this decline is associated with declines in mood and cognitive function. More importantly, we discovered that bright light treatment attenuated the progressive reduction in activity correlations by ~73%, suggesting for the first time that it is possible to manipulate human multiscale activity regulation with an intervention. The beneficial effect of the light treatment on multiscale activity regulation is consistent with its effects on cognition and depression symptoms. Using the same database, we previously reported that the light treatment attenuated cognitive deterioration by 5% on the MMSE and depression symptoms by 19% on the CSDD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Since it is believed that the positive health impacts of bright light treatment are via its influences on SCN functioning and sleep-wake cycles, our findings support the notion that circadian regulation plays an important role in the temporal organization of activity fluctuations at multiple time scales<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Together these findings provide evidence that temporal activity regulation may be clinically relevant.</p><p>Frequent assessments of cognitive function and behavior are required to monitor improvement, stabilization or worsening of the disease-related symptoms in dementia patients and to better follow the progression of the disease. Regular assessments are also encouraged even in older persons without previously diagnosed dementia so that appropriate actions can be taken to prevent or delay the onset of dementia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Our results suggest that the dynamic measure of activity fluctuations may serve as a promising tool for a routine assessment of cognition and behavior in older individuals. As compared to traditional clinical methods, this approach has a number of advantages in terms of cost efficiency and flexibility. For instance, the measure can enable a continuous assessment when subjects undergo their normal daily activities without the necessity of scheduling a visit with a doctor, physician, or other health care professional. With technical advance in data transmission and storage, collected activity data and results can be reviewed instantaneously or retrospectively to identify dynamic changes in patients&#x02019; conditions from day to day and even at different times of day. In addition, the tested activity measure (i.e., temporal correlations) is resilient to external influences of scheduled behavior and environmental conditions (e.g., daily schedule of interactions between dementia patient and caregivers in a nursing home)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. For instance, we have found that alterations in temporal activity correlations can better reflect intrinsic SCN neurodegeneration in dementia when compared to traditional circadian measures such as the amplitude of core body temperature (CBT) rhythm, the amplitude of motor activity rhythm, and intraday variability in motor activity &#x02014; a measure characterizing fragmentation of the activity rhythm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Thus, the application of this nonlinear measure to the clinic may potentially simplify monitoring of dementia progression and provide valuable data for a better physiological understanding of the disease and its impact on daily life.</p><p>How activity correlations at small time scales (&#x0003c;~1&#x02013;2&#x02009;hours) are altered in mood disorders is still unclear. Three recent studies provided seemingly discrepant results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The study of Krane-Gartiser <italic>et al</italic>. reported more random activity fluctuations in acutely admitted inpatients with bipolar disorder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Though based on different analytical tools to examine activity fluctuation (i.e., autocorrelation with lag&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), the finding is consistent with our finding that the reduction of activity correlations at &#x0003c;2&#x02009;hours was associated with more depression symptoms and more impaired cognition in patients/individuals with dementia. However, the two other studies suggested that mood disorders lead to increased temporal correlations in activity fluctuations at small time scales. Aybey <italic>et al</italic>. showed an increased DFA exponent in patients with major depression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and Sano <italic>et al</italic>. reported persistence of resting and active periods in Schizophrenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The diversity of the deviations from normal is reminiscent of how correlations in heartbeat fluctuations are altered differently under different pathological conditions, i.e., heartbeat correlations at &#x0003e;~30 beats are reduced in arterial fibrillation but are increased in congestive heart failure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. It is possible that varied disorders or different stages of a disease may have differing influences on temporal activity correlations. Thus, further studies are required to clarify the changes of the activity correlations at small time scales for specific phases of specific diseases.</p><p>A similar concern applies to activity correlations at larger time scales. We previously found that activity correlations at time scales &#x0003e;~2&#x02009;hours are reduced with aging and in dementia and that the reduction is related to the perturbed circadian regulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Since light and melatonin treatments are believed to be beneficial for circadian regulation in dementia patients, it would be expected that these treatments may also improve activity correlations at large time scales, but we did not observe such an effect in the current study. We note that most of our participants in this study were in the middle to late stages of AD/dementia (e.g., 88.5% of participants had MMSE &#x02264;20 and only 19 participants had MMSE &#x0003e;20) and that the baseline activity correlations of the participants at large time scales were already significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>) when compared to healthy young subjects and were similar to those of late-stage AD patients previously reported (&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.94&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03; &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.69&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03; both p values&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.1 [t-test])<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Thus, perhaps activity correlations at large time scales already had maximally degraded during earlier stages of dementia and AD due to dysfunction of the circadian pacemaker<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Alternatively, perhaps the follow-up duration was too short (only 83 individuals remained in the study after 12 months). We favor the first hypothesis because, while activity correlations at small time scales progressively decreased over the follow-up periods, those at large time scales remained stable regardless of treatment. To definitively distinguish these two possible mechanisms, studies of older people at the early or preclinical stage of the diseases as well as a longer follow-up period are warranted.</p><p>As a first pilot investigation of within-subject changes in multiscale activity regulation, there are many notable limitations in the current study. One major potential concern is regarding the observed association between changes of activity correlations and cognition (MMSE). Since depression impairs both cognition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and motor activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, is it possible that the association was a simple indirect influence of worsening of depression with progression of dementia in our study? We have performed two additional statistical analyses to examine (1) the effect of changes in activity correlations on MMSE changes after controlling the effect of changes in Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD); and (2) the effect of changes in activity correlations on CSDD after controlling the effect of changes in MMSE, respectively. We found that the association between changes in activity correlations and MMSE became not significant (p&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.1) while the association between changes in activity correlations and CSDD became less but still significant (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.13; t ratio&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;2.91, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0039; before accounting for the effect of MMSE: r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.19, t ratio&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;4.31, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). These results suggest that the observed association between degraded activity correlations and cognitive decline might be due to the influences of depression on cognition and temporal activity regulation. However, due to the high correlation between the changes of MMSE and CSDD over time (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.80, t ratio&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;5.67; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) in the studied sample, the datasets are not ideal to tease out the complex causal links between depression, cognition, and multiscale activity regulation. In addition to depression, other neuropsychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations/delusions are also prevalent in dementia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. How these different symptoms contribute to perturbed temporal activity patterns was not examined in the current study and is worth further investigation. Moreover, many other pathological factors (different from cognition and mood) such as physical disabilities, cardiac disorders, and metabolic diseases may affect mobility and, thus, can have independent influences on activity correlations. We could not examine the potential role of these factors in degradation of activity regulation and its association with cognition in this study because no in-depth formal health examination/evaluation was made during the assessments that occurred every six months.</p><p>The other concern is that temporal activity correlations could only account for low percentages of variations in cognition and depression symptoms in patients/individuals with dementia, i.e., weak associations. Data integrity and study design might contribute to the weak associations. For instance, the activity recordings and the clinical measures were not collected simultaneously; and cognition and mood may vary significantly from time to time (e.g., time of day, and time of year) while these outcome measures were not obtained at the same time for each assessment during the longitudinal study. Though activity correlations appear to be independent of the mean activity levels in healthy young individuals (e.g., correlations remain the same at home at different days and in the laboratory with restricted daily schedule and physical activity)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, no studies have formally tested the effects of daily schedule and home environments in older adults, especially in dementia patients whose daily activities rely much on their caregivers. In addition, multiscale activity regulation may also be temporarily altered by certain conditions such as shift work via their influences on circadian control<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. In this study, we calculated the correlations for each subject during each assessment using the whole recording while ignoring the potential variations in the correlations within the period of 1&#x02013;2 weeks. Thus, the combination of non-simultaneous assessments and variations in activity control and clinical outcomes and might contribute to their weak associations.</p><p>Furthermore, the current study is focused on patients with dementia. Many neurodegenerative disorders can contribute to dementia such as AD, frontotemporal disorders, and Lewy body dementia. The progression of dementia and its impacts on behavior may differ for different types of dementia. The current study reveals the longitudinal changes of temporal structure in daily activity patterns in a heterogeneous population without distinguishing specific types of dementia. Future studies are warranted to examine whether within-subject changes of temporal activity correlations, their associations with cognition and mood, and their response to light are different in different types of dementia. In addition, within-subject changes of activity regulation in older persons without dementia are yet to be determined.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Subjects</title><p>To test our hypotheses, we analyzed activity recordings collected from an existing database of 189 residents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. These residents (170 women and 19 men; 70&#x02013;96 years old; mean [SD] age: 85.7 [5.6] years) were living in assisted care facilities located in 12 different Dutch homes for the older individuals. The lowest age was data-driven rather than based on any cut-off exclusion criterion. These residents had their own apartment where they slept and retreated, but spent most of the daytime in a common living room supervised by caregivers. Among the 189 residents, there were 121 with probable AD based on the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, 20 with probable vascular dementia and 24 with probable other types of dementia, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) criteria for dementia and dementia subtypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, 17 without dementia, and 7 without sufficient information for reliable clinical diagnosis.

Thus, there are four groups: <italic><underline>Group 1</underline></italic>: 49 subjects assigned to active light and a placebo tablet; <italic><underline>Group 2</underline></italic>: 46 to inactive light and melatonin; <italic><underline>Group 3</underline></italic>: 49 to both active light and melatonin, and <italic><underline>Group 4</underline></italic>: 45 to inactive light and a placebo tablet. In this double blind randomized controlled trial, the four groups had no significant differences in age, sex, use of medication at inclusion and at any follow-up, and vision complications such as lens opacity and glaucoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The goal of this study is to determine the changes in temporal activity regulation and the clinical relevance in dementia patients. Thus, we studied all patients with confirmed dementia in the database (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;165; 70&#x02013;96 years old), including 45 patients in Group 1, 39 in Group 2, took bedtime melatonin each day, 44 in Group 3, and 37 in Group 4. These patients were diagnosed with dementia primarily, not with Major Depressive Disorder although some were treated because of mood symptoms. The 4 groups did not differ with respect to the proportion of participants receiving psychotropic medication including antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics and hypnotics at the onset of their participation (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-tests, all p&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.32). Logistic mixed-effect regression analysis showed that the use of prescription drugs did not change after treatment onset compared with prescription use prior to treatment onset (all p&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.80).

Illumination levels were obtained at intervals throughout one day at each assessment using a lux meter held at eye level in the direction of gaze, which was usually slightly downward or at best representing light falling on the vertical plane. A total of 3017 assessments were made. Average light exposure measured at eye level in the gaze direction was increased to ~1000 lux between 10 AM and 6 PM at the facilities randomized to the active light condition (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 for all hourly comparisons between 10 AM and 6 PM of the active condition versus baseline except between 3 and 4 PM).

A power-law form of F(n) indicates self-similarity (scale-invariance) in the fluctuations, yielding F(n)~n<sup>&#x003b1;</sup>.

We made the decision for a number of reasons. (1) Scheduled 24-hour events, as likely occurred in assisted care facilities, can significantly affect activity fluctuations at time scales close to 24&#x02009;hours (i.e., a masking effect)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. As previously reported, activity correlation and its changes with aging and in dementia can be properly identified using only daytime data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. (2) During the scheduled sleep episodes, activity of participants was somehow &#x02018;restricted&#x02019; because they stayed in their own apartment without access to other facilities. To avoid the potential effects of imposed daily scheduled events, data during the individually assessed scheduled bedtimes (nurse informants) were excluded for analysis. Consequently, the derived activity measures reflect activity regulation that is more independent of sleep dynamics. Previous cross-sectional studies suggested that scale-invariant correlations are disrupted with aging and in dementia, leading to distinct correlations over two time scale regions with the boundary at ~1.5&#x02013;2&#x02009;hours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Thus, for each activity recording in this study, we calculated the scaling exponent in two regions, separately, i.e. &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> at &#x0003c;90&#x02009;minutes and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> at &#x0003e;2&#x02009;hours, omitting the variable transitional region of time scales between 1.5&#x02013;2&#x02009;hours.</p><p>Activity recordings of 21 dementia patients were either missing or were too short to be used for the correlation analysis.
