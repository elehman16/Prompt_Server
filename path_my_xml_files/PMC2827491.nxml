The risk of experiencing a severe event is usually highest in early pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>The risk factors that predict severe hypoglycemic episodes during pregnancy include duration of diabetes, a history of previous severe episodes (recurrent events), hypoglycemic unawareness, a change in insulin treatment (such as regimen or dosing) or a high insulin dose, and A1C &#x0003c;6.5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). However, because normoglycemia is universally recommended in diabetic pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), with A1C levels between 4.0 and 6.0% advocated to optimize pregnancy outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), minimizing the risk of severe hypoglycemia is a major challenge to those caring for pregnant women with type 1 diabetes.</p><p>Preconception care programs are associated with both reduced malformations and fewer early fetal losses in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), perhaps due to improved glycemic control in the first stages of pregnancy. It is possible that working with women to improve metabolic control and optimize their insulin regimen before pregnancy might also help to reduce the high rate of severe episodes of hypoglycemia postconception, but this has yet to be demonstrated.</p><p>We recently completed a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multinational, multicenter study investigating maternal and fetal outcomes in 322 women with type 1 diabetes treated with either prandial insulin aspart (IAsp) or human insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). IAsp injected immediately before eating was as effective and well tolerated as human insulin administered 30 min before eating. Although the study was somewhat underpowered, there were strong trends toward improved postprandial glucose control and prevention of severe hypoglycemia in the IAsp group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). This study supports the conclusions of trials in nonpregnant individuals with type 1 diabetes, which suggest that the advantages of rapid-acting insulin analogs are most likely to be seen in those with tight control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this exploratory analysis was to compare the incidence of severe hypoglycemia during pregnancy between women enrolled into the trial either preconception or early in the first trimester. Finally, we also compared the effects of the different insulins on rates of severe hypoglycemia according to the time of enrollment of (pregnant) women into the study.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 322 women with type 1 diabetes participated in this open-label, randomized, parallel-group, multinational, multicenter study conducted at 63 sites in 18 countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the respective ethics committees and health authorities according to local regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from subjects before commencement of the study. Eligible subjects were aged &#x02265;18 years, had insulin-treated type 1 diabetes for &#x02265;12 months, and were either planning to become pregnant or were already pregnant with a singleton pregnancy (gestational age &#x02264;10 weeks). A1C was &#x02264;8% at confirmation of pregnancy. Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to mealtime IAsp (NovoRapid 100 IU/ml Penfill; Novo Nordisk) injected immediately before each meal or human insulin (human soluble insulin, Actrapid 100 IU/ml, 3 ml Penfill; Novo Nordisk) injected 30 min before each meal, in combination with NPH insulin (human isophane insulin, 100 IU/ml, 3 ml Penfill; Novo Nordisk) one to four times per day.</p><p>In this exploratory analysis, the intent-to-treat pregnant population included all randomly assigned subjects who were exposed to the trial drug and in whom pregnancy was confirmed at some point during the trial. This population consisted of 99 subjects randomly assigned before known pregnancy (44 to IAsp and 55 to human insulin) and 223 subjects randomly assigned in early pregnancy (113 to IAsp and 110 to human insulin).</p><p>Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event requiring third-party assistance associated with plasma glucose &#x0003c;3.1 mmol/l and/or reversal of symptoms after food, glucagon, or intravenous glucose. Nocturnal hypoglycemia was defined as episodes occurring between midnight and 0600 h. Hypoglycemia was recorded prospectively preconception (where possible), during the first half of pregnancy (&#x0003c;20 weeks' gestation), during the second half of pregnancy (&#x02265;20 weeks' gestation), and postpartum. Subjects were followed throughout pregnancy with one visit per trimester and at 6 weeks postpartum. Hypoglycemic coma, glycemic control, duration of diabetes, and pretrial insulin regimen (use of analogs) were also recorded. Between study visits, the women received routine diabetes and obstetric care according to local practice.</p><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The primary end point in this study was severe hypoglycemia. Assuming an incidence of one severe hypoglycemic episode during pregnancy with 7 months of insulin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), 305 subjects were required to complete the trial to detect a treatment difference of 40% with a power of 80% (5% significance level). Assuming a dropout rate of &#x0223c;20%, 380 subjects were to be randomly assigned.</p><p>In this analysis, rates of severe hypoglycemia were compared between those women randomly assigned preconception with those randomly assigned in early pregnancy and between treatment groups. Relative risk (RR) of severe hypoglycemia was estimated using a gamma frailty model with treatment as a factor. For women already pregnant at screening, delayed entry was used to account for the different observation periods. A Cox regression model accounted for recurrent aspects of episodes. Incidence of nocturnal severe hypoglycemia is presented here using descriptive statistics, as there were too few events for formal analysis. The observed rate is defined as number of episodes per patient per year. The relationship between history of severe hypoglycemia and episodes during pregnancy is based on subjects who had at least 30 days' preconception exposure to the trial drug, i.e., only those enrolled before pregnancy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Baseline patient demographics</title><p>The study includes the 99 of the 189 subjects making up the preconception group who became pregnant during the 12 months specified in the original protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).

Despite the limitations imposed by the observational design, we believe that exploring the influence of the timing of entry into the trial on risk of hypoglycemia is clinically relevant. The data suggest that women enrolled in a clinical trial preconception experience fewer hypoglycemic episodes than those enrolled postconception. Although the RRs in women randomly assigned preconception are not statistically significant because of a lack of power, the marked trend to lower rates in this group is of interest.</p><p>It is well known that severe hypoglycemia is common during pregnancy and is most likely to occur during the first trimester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). One observation from our data is that the incidence of severe hypoglycemia does not peak in early pregnancy in women who were enrolled preconception. This group had a low rate of severe hypoglycemic episodes comparable to the 1.3 events per patient per year seen in the nonpregnant background population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that patients who entered the trial preconception were more motivated and experienced in diabetes self-management than those enrolling postconception, as represented by tighter control and less hypoglycemia. However, glycemic control (A1C and plasma glucose) was similar between those randomly assigned in early pregnancy and those randomly assigned preconception. An alternative explanation is that the extra professional input in the preconception period led to optimized insulin therapy and a lower risk of hypoglycemia. Although preconception counseling is associated with a reduced malformation rate in the offspring of women with type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), we are unaware of previous studies exploring the impact of preconception input on severe hypoglycemia during the ensuing pregnancy.</p><p>It is conceivable that subjects who changed their insulin regimen may have had higher rates of hypoglycemia than those who did not change their insulin regimen; however, the numbers of those taking the same insulin in the trial were too small to undertake formal comparisons. Nevertheless, switching to IAsp after human insulin treatment during pregnancy did not seem to worsen the risk of hypoglycemia, confirming the results of a smaller earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>Our data show an apparent rise in hypoglycemia in the weeks immediately before birth. This finding might relate to a fall in insulin requirements in the immediate predelivery period. A further intriguing finding was that the benefit of a rapid-acting insulin analog (IAsp) associated with a lower risk of severe hypoglycemia than that with human insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) tended to be most pronounced in women who were randomly assigned preconception. This result may be related to their experience with the use of insulin IAsp before the influence of the metabolic changes of pregnancy. The rate of severe hypoglycemia immediately postpartum was considerably higher than that in the last half of pregnancy and was also higher than that seen in observational data in nonpregnant diabetic populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), suggesting that women should focus on reducing their postpartum insulin dose and returning to preconception glycemic control goals.</p><p>This analysis suggests that the initiation of insulin analog treatment preconception as opposed to during early pregnancy results in a lower risk of severe hypoglycemia in women with type 1 diabetes. The reasons for this finding remain unclear but might include the influence of preconception planning. Although the limitations of exploratory analyses prevent any firm conclusions, these data suggest another potential advantage of prenatal care that is worthy of further investigation. The observation should also be taken into account in future clinical trials during pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.
