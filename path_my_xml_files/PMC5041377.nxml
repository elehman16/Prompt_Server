The study comprised two cohorts: 2012/2013 students, who were offered large group teaching (LGT) sessions (control group), and 2013/2014 students, who received the intervention in small group learning problem-based learning (PBL) sessions (experimental group).

In addition, students&#x02019; overall satisfaction of the ultrasound module was shown to be higher for the PBL compared to the LGT groups. Small groups in an interactive and PBL setting along with opportunities for hands-on practice and simultaneous visualization of findings on a high definition screen should enhance preclinical student learning of the basics of ultrasound. Despite the potential of ultrasound as a clinical, teaching and learning tool for students in the preclinical years, standardized recommendations have yet to be created regarding its integration into the curricula within academic institutions and clinical medicine. The interactive and PBL is here to stay at the college of medicine. Further research would be carried out to see if this trend persists in the upcoming vertical system-based curriculum of the college of medicine.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Diagnostic radiology</kwd><kwd>education and administration</kwd><kwd>problem-based learning</kwd><kwd>ultrasound teaching</kwd><kwd>undergraduate medical program</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p><graphic xlink:href="JCIS-6-38-g001.jpg" position="float"/></p><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Internationally, there is heightened interest in integrating ultrasonography into medical education in the preclinical years, with a particular focus on training standards, knowledge, and experience.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, its place in the preclinical curriculum is currently very diverse.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] For example, the University of Ottawa began exploring ways to integrate ultrasound into its undergraduate medical program.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Further, the First World Congress on ultrasound in medical education hosted by the University of South Carolina,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] recommended the integration of ultrasound into the core undergraduate medical school curriculum. Accordingly, the Alliance of Medical Students Educators in Radiology (AMSER) has outlined goals and objectives for both preclinical and clinical years.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Joining this trend, in winter 2012, the College of Medicine offered an introduction to ultrasound module in its introduction to the clinical medicine-2 course, which is taught in the second semester of the 1<sup>st</sup> year. This course was first offered as a large group teaching (LGT) event, then a student-centered, problem-based, small group learning approach was introduced in fall 2013.</p><p>The aim of the current study, conducted between fall 2012 and winter 2014, was to help medical students of a modified problem-based learning (PBL) system develop basic ultrasound image interpretation skills for abdomen and cardiac regions with a focus on basic principles, terminology, and clinical applications. PBL can be defined best &#x0201c;as the learning that results from the process of working toward the understanding or resolution of a problem. The problem is encountered <italic>first</italic> in the learning process&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,p.1]. Furthermore &#x0201c; In PBL, students work in small collaborative groups and learn what they need to know in order to solve a problem&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,p.235]. Indeed &#x0201c;PBL is intended to equip students with hands-on learning strategies to help them meet their future responsibilities&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,p.1].</p><p>Few studies have assessed the impact of a preclinical integrated ultrasound teaching in PBL on the acquisition of basic ultrasound knowledge by undergraduate medical students. The research question guiding this study was: Are students in smaller groups with access to a combination of lectures and hands-on patient contact most likely to have better ultrasound image interpretation skills, than students in larger groups with only interactive didactic lectures?</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODOLOGY</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethics</title><p>The Research Council of the college of medicine approved the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study setting and population</title><p>Participants were students from the college of medicine who enrolled in the introduction to clinical medicine-2 course during the study [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

It was the authors&#x02019; expectation that, at the start of this study, the students would relate their ultrasound experience to their prior knowledge of the imaging techniques listed above, so as to enhance and accelerate their understanding of the ultrasound module.</p><p>To assist students in determining where to start for the upcoming session the following resources were suggested:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Ultrasound anatomy &#x02013; an imaging resource published by the first author for medical students in their journey throughout the medical foundations. This brochure introduces the students to the basics of ultrasound, physics and device, how to use a portable equipment to acquire basic anatomy, demonstration of abdominal, pelvic and vascular anatomy and small parts, along with images of normal and pathologies specific to structures and vascular flow as well as to the Focused Assessment with Ultrasound in Trauma (FAST)</p></list-item><list-item><p>An accompanying PowerPoint presentation on introductory ultrasound, which was prepared by the first author (with integrated interactive elements). Furthermore, PowerPoint included the learning objectives of the ultrasound module [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p></list-item></list>
</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Ultrasound Module Sessions: Goals and Objectives</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCIS-6-38-g003"/></table-wrap><p>The overall goals and objectives are consistent with the AMSER National Medical Student Curriculum in Radiology for preclinical years.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>One radiologist-educator &#x02013; the first author with ultrasound teaching as his area of subspecialty interest and with prior PBL involvement served as the single instructor and lecturer for all the large group and small group sessions. Branstetter et al.,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Tshibwabwa et al.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] have demonstrated in earlier studies involving undergraduate medical students that one radiologist suffices for conducting these types of ultrasound sessions. Therefore, one radiologist educator was felt adequate for initiating the ultrasound module.</p><p>Students in all large groups were constantly challenged with relevant questions so as to support learning, and provide equal opportunity to all for enhancing their understanding of the core material. Each group participated in 2 &#x000d7; 2-h interactive sessions on separate days within the setting of LGT.</p><p>Whenever the students were presented with a probable or desirable variety of pathologies [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>], they would take advantage of this opportunity to make links with their knowledge of normal, for example, different echogenicities in the identification of abnormal aspects, thickened gallbladder wall in cholecystitis, renal stones, corticomedullary differentiation, and splenomegaly. During LGT the faculty used PowerPoint presentation to demonstrate normal ultrasound anatomy of specific abdominal structures as a stimulus for discussion and demonstration and discussion of some important clinical diagnoses frequently investigated with ultrasound.</p><p>The session-relevant learning materials were disseminated through the school's learning management system (blackboard: elearning.auamed.net). In preparation for interactive sessions, the students were advised to review the learning materials on introduction to ultrasound, ahead of the LGT.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>The experimental group</title><p>It consisted of students taking the course when the ultrasound module was first integrated into a PBL setting, 194 (101 males and 93 females) and 184 (81 males and 103 females) in the 2013 fall and 2014 winter semesters, respectively. Unlike the students in the control group, the students in the intervention group were split up into smaller groups of size 6 or 7.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Intervention</title><p>The PBL students had access to the same preparatory materials as the control group.</p><p>Furthermore, the local objectives for hands-on were also consistent with the overall learning objectives for the introductory ultrasound module, i.e., identification of organ structures and insights into the normal appearances of kidneys, liver, spleen, gallbladder, aorta, and inferior vena cava as well as identification of blood flow in aorta, renal vessels. Allowing the students in these PBL to work along the same overall learning objectives for ultrasound module [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>] enabled consistency and comparison of the groups.</p><p>Moreover, for the PBL, each 2-h session was divided into:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Ten minutes for the case presentation</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sixty minutes of hands-on ultrasound examination of a normal subject</p></list-item><list-item><p>Fifty minutes for review of the PowerPoint presentation and discussion.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Therefore with the facilitation of the faculty, each student in the small groups was expected to scan the abdomen focusing on the renal, liver, gallbladder, spleen, subcostal regions plus major abdominal vessels, and pattern of blood flow. In addition, the student scanned the cardiac region noting chamber and valvular morphology and activity as per ultrasound module [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><p>Due to the absence of healthy volunteers, students scanned each other, and this pattern would continue for 1 h with every student scanning a live model and peers participating in the discussion. The ultrasound machine was located in a smaller classroom, and images obtained were shown on the ultrasound's unit monitor and also on a large high-definition television display. The classroom was adequately lighted. Displaying on a high definition screen allowed for all students in the group to view the ultrasound images obtained by their peers, and to effectively participate in the discussion. An ideal subject, i.e., a student with a slim body habitus, could at times replace a student with a larger habitus. To maintain consistency of the anatomic structures on displayed images, each participant had to scan specific focused abdominal and cardiac regions (upper right quadrant, right and left flanks, subcostal, apical for the demonstration of structures of interest).</p><p>The duration to impart theoretical knowledge for both groups was identical, i.e., the experimental and control group had two theory sessions, each session lasting for 2 h. The experimental group had two additional hands-on sessions, each session lasting 50 min.</p><p>The ultrasound unit used was the Sonosite Micromaxx portable ultrasound (SonoSite, Inc. 21919 30<sup>th</sup> Drive SE, Bothell, WA 98021, USA) that was provided with a 13&#x02013;6 MHz linear array transducer for musculoskeletal scans, a C60e curved transducer for abdominal scans, and a P17 transducer for cardiac scans [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Ultrasound room conditions during small group teaching.

Sample questions are provided in <xref ref-type="app" rid="App1">Appendix 1</xref>. At the beginning of each session, a pretest including 10 identical multiple-choice questions was done to ascertain a baseline knowledge level of the participating students for both the LGT and PBL. The questions were identical for both groups, (even if the order of the topics varied). They were logically arranged with ascending complexity to test cumulative knowledge of the students in the following key areas of introductory ultrasound:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Orientation of the ultrasound probe with regard to the monitor of the ultrasound machine (two questions)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Scanning planes (two questions)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ultrasound terminology (two questions)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Identification of organ structures and blood flow (two questions)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Clinical applications (two questions).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>At the conclusion of LGT and PBL, a posttest study including again 10 different questions, identical for all large and small groups (with the varied order of topics) was performed to test the students in the same key areas of the module, i.e., principles, terminology, anatomy, clinical application. Students&#x02019; answers were scored for a maximum total of 10 points. Evaluation of the differences between pre- and post-test students&#x02019; scores/results was made with a paired <italic>t</italic>-test.</p><p>The validity of tests item was referenced to the goals and objectives of the ultrasound module with items referring to similar areas as in cases and clinical vignettes used for LGT, PBL and PowerPoint presentation. All multiple choice questions for the formative and summative assessment were set by the first author and were similar in scope, and complexity for all the topics within the introduction to clinical medicine-2 block. The multiple choice questions aimed at testing students&#x02019; knowledge of ultrasound basics.</p><p>The practical aspects of ultrasound of the abdominal and/or cardiac regions were still tested on a 5-point Likert scale (5 = excellent; 4 = very good; 3 = good; 2 = fair; and 1 = poor), even though these had been taught for a short duration. Here again, pre- and post-test were done.</p><p>Regarding the objective criteria for excellent scanning, etc., students were evaluated by following assessments: Be able to:</p><p>

The room conditions are well detailed, and images obtained during hands-on performed by one student on another are displayed simultaneously on the small screen and a larger television [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Such room environment might allow for PBL to take its course as all the students in the PBL could view the findings at the same time and discuss them to facilitate student learning and enhance their own and group's understanding of the concepts at hand.</p><p>Integration of the ultrasound module into an introduction to clinical medicine-2 course reinforced the students&#x02019; understanding of case-based PBL in an innovative and active way. Dreher et al., found that students&#x02019; &#x0201c;interest and self-perceived experience, comfort, and confidence in ultrasound skills significantly increased (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) as a result of this early introduction to ultrasonography.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,p. 231] From this study, it becomes clear that LGT in the second semester requires a commitment from one full-time radiologist faculty-the introduction to clinical medicine radiology theme coordinator of about 4&#x02013;5 h for preparation of the educational material, i.e. lectures and questions for knowledge evaluation and exactly 2 h &#x000d7; 2 for the scheduled lectures; high definition digital displays in the classroom are necessary. However, PBL requires additional resource. For preclinical schools with annual students intake in the range of the semester 2 intake (i.e., approximately 200 students at the college of medicine) and interest in the integration of ultrasound into their program, more teaching radiologists, i.e., 3 or 4 will be needed to sustain a more vertically oriented ultrasound curriculum to guide simultaneously more small groups of students during hands-on training and confirm images interpretation sessions. To limit faculty involvement, sonographers, and local part-time radiologists along with ongoing workshops for faculty and groups of preclinical students with an interest in Radiology or Emergency Medicine and Obstetrics will reduce the time commitment of an individual teaching radiologist faculty. If additional teaching radiologists are available, the training of motivated faculty by the teaching radiologist or a visiting radiologist would be seen crucial to the sustainability of the project. Furthermore refurbished compact ultrasound units with 1-year warranty or the less expensive first generation of compact units are commercially available and shown to be reliable alternative to the new units.</p><p>With regard to limitations of this study, statistical analysis was restricted to a descriptive exploration. Furthermore, the survey results cannot be generalized because they were heavily based on the current curriculum at the college of medicine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>From the present study, we conclude that posttest knowledge of the basics of ultrasound improved significantly over the pretest in the experimental group. In addition, students&#x02019; overall satisfaction of the ultrasound module was shown to be higher for the PBL compared to the LGT groups. Further research would be carried out to see if this trend persists in the upcoming vertical system-based curriculum of the college of medicine.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Declaration of patient consent</title><p>The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.
