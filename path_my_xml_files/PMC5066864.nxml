This is in extension of, and contrast to, previous studies on Asian populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm clinical study was performed to evaluate nattokinase (NSK-SD), a fermented soy extract natt&#x0014d; from which vitamin K2 has been removed. Based on the results from previous studies on Asian populations, 79 subjects were enrolled upon screening for elevated blood pressure (BP; systolic BP &#x02265;130 or diastolic BP &#x02265;90 mmHg) who consumed placebo or 100 mg nattokinase/d for the 8-week study duration. Blood collections were performed at baseline and 8 weeks for testing plasma renin activity, von Willebrand factor (vWF), and platelet factor-4. Seventy-four people completed the study with good compliance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Consumption of nattokinase was associated with a reduction in both systolic and diastolic BP. The reduction in systolic BP was seen for both sexes but was more robust in males consuming nattokinase. The average reduction in diastolic BP in the nattokinase group from 87 mmHg to 84 mmHg was statistically significant when compared to that in the group consuming placebo, where the average diastolic BP remained constant at 87 mmHg (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), and reached a high level of significance for males consuming nattokinase, where the average diastolic BP dropped from 86 mmHg to 81 mmHg (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.006). A decrease in vWF was seen in the female population consuming nattokinase (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.1). In the subpopulation with low plasma renin activity levels at baseline (&#x0003c;0.29 ng/mL/h), an increase was seen for 66% of the people after 8-week consumption of nattokinase (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.1), in contrast to only 8% in the placebo group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The data suggest that nattokinase consumption in a North American population is associated with beneficial changes to BP in a hypertensive population, indicating sex-specific mechanisms of action of nattokinase&#x02019;s effect on vWF and hypertension.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Video abstract</title><p>

Subjects from the databases at the two study sites, representing people who have previously indicated interest in participating in clinical studies, were approached, and if interested in being considered for the present study, they were invited for screening. Two hundred and twenty-one people went through screening for hypertension, and 79 qualified for enrollment in the 8-week study upon signing written informed consent, as approved by the institutional review board of Sky Lakes Medical Center (FWA 2603; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ibpc-9-095">Figure 1</xref>). The subjects were randomized to receive either product or placebo for the 8-week study. The study was carried out during 2012&#x02013;2013 at the following two centers: 1) 54 subjects were enrolled through NIS Labs in southern OR, USA, where study subjects live and work at an elevation of 1,200&#x02013;1,500 m above sea level and 2) 25 subjects were enrolled through KGK Synergize, ON, Canada, where study subjects live and work at an elevation of 200&#x02013;300 m above sea level.</p><p>The prescreening involved an interview to document sex, age, body mass index (BMI), medical/surgical history, diet/lifestyle, current health issues, medication, and supplement use.

All subjects adhered to the requirements of abstinence from exercise and nicotine and caffeine use for 1 hour prior to a study visit. Screening for hypertension was performed over three separate days. The last (third) screening BP reading became the baseline data for that subject. The BP reading at study exit was performed at the 8-week follow-up visit and involved a minimum of two readings, with a third reading if the initial two systolic readings were not within 5 mmHg of each other. Subjects were asked not to smoke, eat, or exercise, 1 hour before their appointment. At each study visit, BP was measured two to three times at a sitting position, where the first measurement was performed after 5 minutes rest, and with at least 3 minutes interval between each measurement.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood collection</title><p>On each of the two study visits (baseline and 8 weeks), a blood sample was drawn. The blood collection was performed after the person had been sitting for at least 15 minutes. Blood was drawn into EDTA, the vial was spun, and the plasma was harvested and banked at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. After the end of the clinical phase of the study, the plasma samples were tested for plasma renin activity (PRA) at Machaon Diagnostics, Inc. (Oakland CA, USA). Additional blood was drawn into serum separator vials and allowed to coagulate for a minimum of 30 minutes before centrifugation and serum harvesting. Serum samples were banked at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C and used for testing for von Willebrand factor (vWF) and platelet factor-4 (PF4).</p></sec><sec><title>Plasma renin activity</title><p>Plasma samples were tested for PRA at Machaon Diagnostics, Inc..

However, this is due to the observation that the effects were dependent on whether subjects started the study with low or high PRA. Consumption of nattokinase was associated with beneficial changes in PRA. Twenty-two people (30% of the study population) started the study with baseline PRA levels &#x0003c;0.29 ng/mL/h used in this analysis to differentiate between relatively low, normal, and elevated levels. The data showed that 66% of the study subjects in the nattokinase group who started the study with PRA levels below the normal range showed improvement to normal levels during the 8 weeks. This is in contrast to only one person (8%) of the study subjects in the placebo group who started the study with PRA below normal range and normalized during the 8-week study.</p><p>The association between nattokinase consumption and normalization of PRA was seen for both male and female study subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ibpc-9-095">Figure 4</xref>).

Beneficial changes were seen on systolic and diastolic BP in the group consuming nattokinase, when compared to placebo. In the study reported here, the reduction in both systolic and diastolic BP was most robust in the male population. A reduction in systolic BP was also observed for males in the placebo group but this did not reach statistical significance. An important factor in controlling the relationship between BP and sodium levels is the renin&#x02013;angiotensin system. It has been suggested that androgens may increase BP via the renin&#x02013;angiotensin system, possibly also associated with production of vasoconstrictor substances and reduction in nitric oxide availability.<xref rid="b37-ibpc-9-095" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> This may be a contributing factor to help explain why males and postmenopausal females are at relative higher risk for cardiovascular disease.</p><p>PRA measures the ability of plasma renin to generate Ang-I in a temperature-dependent manner. The renin&#x02013;angiotensin system plays a role in the regulation of BP, and elevated levels of PRA have been associated with essential hypertension.<xref rid="b38-ibpc-9-095" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> However, some people with essential hypertension have abnormally low PRA, and this has been associated with elevated calcitriol and parathyroid hormone levels.<xref rid="b39-ibpc-9-095" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Favorable changes in PRA levels were seen in the group consuming nattokinase. This improvement was seen for both sexes. The changes in PRA associated with nattokinase consumption in a North American hypertensive population did not reach statistical significance, in contrast to the previous study performed in South Korea and published by Kim et al.<xref rid="b33-ibpc-9-095" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In the North American study population reported here, 30% of the study subjects had low PRA levels at baseline. This is in contrast to the PRA reported in the previous Korean study, where the average PRA at baseline was higher than the average PRA at baseline for the North American study.</p><p>The observed sex differences in BP normalization by nattokinase, where females showed a moderate change in BP while consuming nattokinase, are likely related to the complex effects of estrogen on BP in the female population. The sex differences were not reported or discussed in the previous study; and therefore, it is not known whether similar sex differences were observed in the study reported by Kim et al.<xref rid="b33-ibpc-9-095" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>Renin&#x02013;angiotensin and nitric oxide are the two main counter-regulators modulating BP as well as sodium reabsorption and excretion.<xref rid="b40-ibpc-9-095" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="b41-ibpc-9-095" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Estrogen is known to affect the renin&#x02013;angiotensin system in complex manners, depending on whether the source of estrogen is endogenous or from an external source. External sources include hormonal birth control (oral, transdermal, and other), perimenopausal hormone replacement therapy, dietary plant-based phytoestrogens, and exposure to environmental xenoestrogenic pollutants such as organochlorines.</p><p>vWF is a mediator of platelet adhesion and is released by damaged endothelium and increases risk of thrombus formation. The sex-specific decrease in vWF seen in the female subgroup consuming nattokinase is of interest, in light of the known association between elevated vWF and the risk for ischemic stroke.<xref rid="b42-ibpc-9-095" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="b43-ibpc-9-095" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> This suggests that health improvements in females consuming nattokinase potentially involve different mechanisms than those in males. Also, the known relationship between vWF and the ABO blood type<xref rid="b44-ibpc-9-095" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> could potentially help explain differences between study results in different ethnic groups, as vWF is higher in subjects with a blood type different from type O, and blood type should be tracked in future studies on nattokinase and hypertension.</p><p>The coagulation and inflammation systems are interlinked, and fibrin degradation products (when fibrin is cleaved by plasmin) elicit a number of well-defined proinflammatory effects.<xref rid="b45-ibpc-9-095" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The lowering of diastolic BP in males generated the most statistically significant and clinically important results in this study. The overall data suggest that the oral consumption of nattokinase supports healthy BP in both sexes, in a non-Asian population. In addition, the reduction in elevated vWF in the female subgroup suggests a possible reduction of risk for stroke. This is important, since previous studies were conducted in Asia where different genetic, dietary, and lifestyle factors contribute to hypertension and potentially affect which treatment strategies may help reduce hypertension and associated biomarkers. Limitations of the current study included the small number of subjects, as well as the broad age and BMI range, menstrual status at study visits, menopausal status for inclusion in study, and types of birth control in the female population. Future work should include studies on female populations to evaluate age-related and hormonal differences in the impact of nattokinase consumption, such as comparison of premenopausal and postmenopausal females, with and without hormone replacement therapy. Studies should also include populations with metabolic dysfunction such as diabetes and should also extend to include evaluation of cardiovascular risk factors in the morbidly obese of both sexes, and populations consuming a high level of saturated fat, with an in-depth testing of correlations between blood glucose, insulin, lipids, and kidney function.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The study was conducted at NIS Labs, an independent contract research laboratory specializing in natural products research, with a second site at KGK Synergize, London, ON, Canada.
