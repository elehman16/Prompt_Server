COPD is often underdiagnosed, while at the same time the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against spirometric screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults. Use of a symptom-based questionnaire and subsequent handheld spirometric device depending on the answers to the questionnaire is a promising approach to identify patients at risk for COPD. Screening, Evaluating and Assessing Rate CHanges of diagnosing respiratory conditions in primary care 1 (SEARCH I) was a prospective cluster-randomized study in 168 US primary care practices evaluating the effect of the COPD-Population Screener (COPD-PS&#x02122;) questionnaire. The effect of this questionnaire alone or sequentially with the handheld copd-6<sup>TM</sup> device was evaluated on new diagnoses of COPD and on respiratory diagnostic practice patterns (including referrals for pulmonary function testing, referrals to pulmonologists, new diagnoses of COPD, and new respiratory medication prescriptions). Participating practices entered a total of 9704 consecutive consenting subjects aged &#x02265; 40 years attending primary care clinics. Study arm results were compared for new COPD diagnosis rates between usual care and (1) COPD-PS plus copd-6 and (2) COPD-PS alone. A cluster-randomization design allowed comparison of the intervention effects at the practice level instead of individuals being the subjects of the intervention. Regional principal investigators controlled the flow of study information to sub-investigators at participating practices to reduce observation bias (Hawthorne effect). The results of SEARCH I, to be published subsequently, will provide insight into the real world utility of the COPD-PS as well as two-stage COPD case finding with COPD-PS and copd-6.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COPD Population Screener</kwd><kwd>COPD-PS&#x02122;</kwd><kwd>copd-6&#x02122;</kwd><kwd>spirometry</kwd><kwd>screening</kwd><kwd>case finding</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>COPD confers significant burdens of mortality, disability, health care utilization, and costs upon individuals and society.

Undiagnosed and unmanaged but progressing COPD may manifest in an acute exacerbation requiring emergency care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-copd-7-437">6</xref> Additionally, COPD and lung cancer are closely associated beyond a simple smoking-related link<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-copd-7-437">7</xref> and the incidence of lung cancer is even higher in patients with mild-to-moderate COPD than in those with more severe COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-copd-7-437">8</xref> Thus, appropriately diagnosing COPD earlier becomes even more important.</p><p>Primary care physicians (PCPs) play an important role in the initial recognition and diagnosis of COPD, as for other chronic conditions. Dyspnea, chronic cough, sputum production, and/or history of risk-factor exposure characterize patients at risk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-copd-7-437">9</xref> Multiple professional societies&#x02019; guidelines,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-copd-7-437">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-copd-7-437">11</xref> including the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-copd-7-437">9</xref> and American College of Physicians (ACP)/American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP)/American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) 2011<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-copd-7-437">10</xref> emphasize use of spirometry to diagnose COPD. Unlike hypertension and dyslipidemia, for which PCPs and specialists alike use criterion-standard diagnostic methods (blood pressure and blood lipid measurement), a diagnostic gap exists for COPD between pulmonologists&#x02019; standard (spirometry) and PCPs&#x02019; frequent reliance on symptoms and clinical observations alone.</p><p>A further gap is found between respiratory societies&#x02019; requirement for spirometry to diagnose COPD and the US Preventive Services Task Force&#x02019;s discouragement of spirometry for asymptomatic screening for COPD (despite its recognition that COPD is underdiagnosed).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-copd-7-437">12</xref> Similarly, ACP/ACCP/ATS/ERS 2011<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-copd-7-437">10</xref> states that there is &#x0201c;no evidence of benefit of using spirometry to screen adults who have no respiratory symptoms.&#x0201d; However, spirometry is warranted in patients with wheezing, shortness of breath, or exertional limitations of respiratory origin and who are symptomatic. Unfortunately, patients may deny exertional limitation because they have reduced their activity to avoid dyspnea, thus limiting their reporting of symptoms to their clinician.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-copd-7-437">10</xref> Very inactive patients with unrecognized COPD may become overtly symptomatic when attempting activities normal for their age and health.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-copd-7-437">10</xref> Thus, methods are needed to assess patients&#x02019; respiratory symptoms more realistically and to identify patients at risk for COPD for targeted spirometry. Studies have shown the feasibility of methods for identifying COPD patients among general or high-risk populations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-copd-7-437">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-copd-7-437">15</xref> The use of symptom-based questionnaires to identify patients at risk and conducting spirometry depending on patients&#x02019; responses may be an appropriate and cost-effective approach.</p><p>Many questionnaires have been investigated for COPD risk identification, although their real-world PCP application has lagged behind tool development and validation. Readers are referred to a recent comparative review by Duvall and Frank<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-copd-7-437">16</xref> for more details on specific questionnaires. Calverley and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-copd-7-437">17</xref> developed one of the first COPD questionnaires, which was validated retrospectively against the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III database. Price and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-copd-7-437">18</xref> prospectively developed a questionnaire to identify COPD risk in smokers not previously diagnosed with respiratory diseases; a subsequent Dutch study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-copd-7-437">19</xref> used the Price questionnaire by telephone to stratify smokers by COPD risk and invite those at medium or high risk for case-finding spirometry. Hanania et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-copd-7-437">20</xref> developed and validated the Lung Function Questionnaire. When tested in primary care practices, this questionnaire had a sensitivity of 82.6% and specificity of 47.8%, with 54.3% correctly classified as with or without COPD based on pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry and the then-current GOLD criteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-copd-7-437">20</xref> The Clinical COPD Questionnaire<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-copd-7-437">21</xref> is designed primarily to measure symptoms, function, and clinical control in patients already diagnosed with COPD; however, it was used as an initial questionnaire together with the Medical Research Council dyspnea scale in a Swedish primary care COPD screening study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-copd-7-437">22</xref> Other COPD patient identification tools include the COPD Assessment Questionnaire<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-copd-7-437">23</xref> and the COPD Population Screener (COPD-PS&#x02122;, a trademark of Quality Metric Incorporated).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-copd-7-437">24</xref></p><p>The COPD-PS assesses dyspnea, phlegm, reduced activity because of breathing problems, smoking (&#x02265;100 cigarettes lifelong), and age group.

Thus, the copd-6 was considered more suitable for the primary care setting and was selected for the current study.

Because the direct objects of intervention were not patients but individual participating primary care practices (sites), these were the units of randomization, irrespective of the number of PCPs at a site. However, the number of enrolled patients per site was limited to avoid bias from any one particular site contributing a large share of the study patients. Since the practice sites were the object of the intervention, the study process utilized regional investigators who implemented the study at the primary care sites to reduce observational bias. The practice sites thus were not specifically informed about the study interventions ( particularly about those of the other two arms) or the effects being studied. Also, no additional education on COPD management was provided to participating clinics. The protocol and informed consent materials received approval from central and local institutional review boards. The visit flow chart is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-copd-7-437">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>Each site screened and entered consecutive eligible patients who presented themselves for scheduled primary care visits. Eligible patients were consenting men and women &#x02265; 40 years of age, literate in English or Spanish. Patients who, in the judgment of site investigators, could not perform arm-specific study procedures were excluded. Enrollment was planned to enter 55 patients per site (across 171 sites) for a total of 9405 patients. Site limitations on enrollment were intended to minimize recruitment bias from disproportionate contributions of any one specific site to the sample. Ultimately, enrollment was expanded to enter 55 patients per site who were not previously diagnosed with COPD according to the site investigator.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>The study interventions consisted only of practice use of the COPD-PS with or without the copd-6. The participating sites were aware that the study was investigating the diagnosis of respiratory conditions in primary care and that there were three arms in the study but were not informed of details of the other two arms in which they were not participating. Restricting the practices&#x02019; awareness of other study arms&#x02019; interventions was important to reduce a nonspecific influence of study participation on their usual care patterns (Hawthorne effect). Also, sites did not receive any specific additional education about COPD or training on the diagnosis of COPD, as this would have introduced an additional variable and would have interfered with the real-life approach of the study. Post-randomization, sub-investigators at the sites received an arm-specific study description following the concepts of the protocol that provided the background/objective for the study. Regionally located principal investigators had knowledge of all arms of the study protocol and interfaced in a consistent manner with the sub-investigators and their staffs.

Diagnostic yield was determined for each site as the proportion of patients with a new clinical diagnosis of COPD out of those patients without a prior diagnosis of COPD.</p><p>Documentation of the clinical diagnosis of COPD in study subjects within 8 weeks of Visit 1, ascertained by review of the medical chart of the subject at the primary care site, was the measure to determine the primary endpoint of diagnostic yield.

Planning of sample size and analysis procedures took into account the correlations among observations within sites expected with cluster randomization. The intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC; &#x003c1;) captured the proportion of the total (between + within) variability attributable to primary care sites (clusters). This coefficient, along with the cluster size, determined the design effect. The number of subjects evaluated at each PCP site (cluster) represented the cluster size (m): design effect = [1 + (m &#x02212; 1) &#x000d7; &#x003c1;]. The ICC value for this study was estimated at 0.0185, which was the median ICC value of all variables studied in a similarly designed cluster-randomized diabetes study of Vermont primary care practices,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-copd-7-437">44</xref> yielding an assumed cluster design effect of 1.999.</p><p>Diagnostic yield of COPD in primary care practices is not known and may show geographic or other variability. In a National Committee for Quality Assurance survey of new COPD diagnoses in adults over 40 across five diverse health insurers,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-copd-7-437">45</xref> diagnostic yield found an average of 0.3% with a range from 0.25% to 1.57%. Based on this data, a diagnostic yield of 1.5% was assumed for the usual care intervention arm (Arm 3). Assuming that intervention with the COPD-PS and COPD 6 (Arm 1) will result in an increased diagnostic yield of COPD compared with intervention with COPD-PS alone (Arm 2), sample size was calculated for adequate power to detect a difference when comparing Arm 2 and Arm 3, which also assures adequate power for comparing Arm 1 and Arm 3. Since the COPD-PS has a positive-predictive value of about 56%, and assuming COPD prevalence is 5.5%, the use of the COPD-PS alone could result in a diagnostic yield of 3%, translating into a 1.5% difference in diagnostic yield compared with the assumption of 1.5% diagnostic yield in the usual care arm (Arm 3). <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-copd-7-437">Table 2</xref> shows the sample size calculations resulting from the assumptions discussed.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Study demographics and reasons for index visits</title><sec><title>Demographics and prior diagnoses of COPD</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-copd-7-437">Table 3</xref> shows the entered practices and subjects by region.

Because the evaluations of interest were changes in diagnostic rates and practice patterns, SEARCH I used a cluster design in which the PCP practice, not the subject, was the unit of randomization. To represent general practice patient populations, SEARCH I consecutively enrolled consenting consecutive patients aged &#x02265; 40 years presenting for primary care appointments. A total of 9704 subjects from 168 practices participated, with considerable geographic diversity across the USA. The last subject&#x02019;s entry to SEARCH I occurred on August 5, 2011, chart abstracting was completed on October 28, 2011, and database lock occurred on December 2, 2011. Results will be presented at congresses in 2012/13 and published in a primary paper.</p><p>Spirometric screening of all asymptomatic adults for COPD is expensive and is discouraged by the US Preventive Services Task Force<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-copd-7-437">12</xref> and the 2011 ACP/ACCP/ATS/ERS guidelines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-copd-7-437">10</xref> Conversely, focusing on specific subsets of patients (eg, current smokers or elderly smokers) may miss other patients with unrecognized COPD in the general population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-copd-7-437">46</xref> Two-stage screening using a symptomatic questionnaire and an inexpensive handheld device is expected to reduce costs of case finding (the cost of the copd-6 device is about one-tenth that of an office spirometer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-copd-7-437">47</xref>). Two-stage screening identifies candidates for full spirometry who have a high pre-test probability of having COPD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-copd-7-437">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-copd-7-437">49</xref> and can be implemented with a follow-up visit for diagnosis and management plan for COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-copd-7-437">9</xref> Thus, SEARCH I employed the COPD-PS symptom-based questionnaire for initial identification of subjects at risk for COPD, either on its own or followed by copd-6 handheld spirometry in a twostage screening protocol to identify candidates for a clinical diagnosis of COPD that should be followed by a spirometric diagnosis. SEARCH I assessed effects of these COPD screening tools in day-to-day practice within a real-world primary care patient population.</p><p>SEARCH I was designed to answer two questions: (1) How does use of COPD-PS followed by copd-6 or use of COPD-PS alone, as compared with usual care, affect diagnostic yield of COPD in consecutive unselected primary care subjects with no prior diagnosis of COPD and &#x02265;40 years of age? (2) What actions (assigning a clinical COPD diagnosis at the same visit, referring subjects for pulmonary function testing and/or to pulmonologists, or prescribing respiratory medications) do clinicians engage in after using COPD-PS with or without subsequent copd-6 as compared with usual care?</p><p>Each aspect of the study design was intended to preempt a potential difficulty. The study structure built around regional principal investigators was intended to reduce the Hawthorne effect and guard against observation bias. Regional investigators controlled the protocol information available to participating practices; each practice knew generally that this was a study of respiratory diagnosis practice patterns but was not aware of the practice interventions applied in study arms other than its own. To minimize interference with the real-life approach of the study, participating primary care sites did not receive any specific additional education about COPD and training on the diagnosis of COPD. New clinical diagnoses of COPD were ascertained by medical record abstraction (the RAND Corporation criterion standard method). The 8-week time frame, including the day of the patient visit for chart review, was based on a consensus of the time required for practice-based interventions to show an effect. Participants determined to have a prior diagnosis of COPD according to the site investigator were excluded from the denominator when proportions of newly SEARCH I-diagnosed subjects were computed. The secondary endpoint of diagnostic practice pattern comprised multiple surrogates for a clinical diagnosis of COPD &#x02013; not only diagnosis itself at the initial visit but also referrals to pulmonary function testing or pulmonologist visits as well as new prescriptions of respiratory medications within 8 weeks following Visit 1.</p><p>Potential limitations of SEARCH I include the lack of protocol-mandated follow-up spirometry for subjects receiving new clinical diagnoses of COPD. It can be expected that from one-third to possibly one-half of the subjects with a clinical diagnosis of COPD will receive spirometry.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-copd-7-437">50</xref> However, mandatory follow-up spirometry would have multiplied logistical challenges &#x02013; for example, maintaining subjects&#x02019; participation beyond the 8 weeks until medical records had been abstracted &#x02013; as opposed to conducting subjects&#x02019; study procedures only at Visit 1. The choice of an 8-week window from Visit 1 to the follow-up medical record abstraction to identify a new clinical diagnosis assumed that 8 weeks would suffice for subjects to attend an appointment for spirometry and the primary care provider to receive and chart the results. A longer time window would have allowed for longer delays in referral appointments. Finally, no prior-year historic data have been collected from participating sites, so any potential changes of practice in the usual care comparison arm could not have been detected.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>COPD is frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-copd-7-437">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-copd-7-437">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53-copd-7-437">53</xref> A simple, self-administered, self-scored, validated tool in the form of a questionnaire to identify individuals at risk for COPD can increase awareness and earlier symptom recognition by patients and physicians. The subsequent use of a handheld spirometer in those patients identified as at risk for COPD could be a feasible and effective way to detect patients with airway obstruction, facilitating definitive spirometric diagnosis and addressing the gap in primary care in the diagnostic approach to undetected COPD. Implementation of such a two-stage screening process in the primary care community would assist physicians in identifying individuals at risk for COPD who should be considered for a clinical diagnosis of COPD and would need a diagnostic spirometry follow-up assessment. PCPs have an opportunity to initiate recognition and proactive management of COPD, striving for earlier smoking cessation, reduced exacerbations, and improved outcomes. Results from SEARCH I will provide data on the real-world impact of the COPD-PS and copd-6 screening tools on COPD diagnosis and management in 168 primary care practices in multiple US regions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study is supported by Boehringer Ingelheim and Pfizer.
