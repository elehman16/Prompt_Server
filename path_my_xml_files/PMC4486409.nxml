Further, worldwide obesity rates have more than doubled in the past 3 decades, such that excess weight is now the fifth leading risk for global deaths, accounting for roughly 2.8 million deaths each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the health effects, obesity imposes significant external costs on society. For example, in the United States (US) alone, annual medical expenditures for treating obesity-related health conditions now exceed $147 billion per year, with roughly half of this total directly financed by Medicare and Medicaid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Other research shows that an obese worker has annual direct and indirect costs that are between $1,143 (class I obese male) and $6,694 (class II obese female) greater than costs for their normal-weight counterparts, depending on gender and degree of excess weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, the indirect costs of obesity, which result from workloss due to absenteeism and presenteeism, exceed the direct medical costs.</p><p>Due to these impacts of obesity on society, there are significant health and economic benefits that could be accrued to individuals, governments, insurers, and employers through successful weight-loss initiatives. Typically, the first line of treatment for excess weight is lifestyle modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, on average, lifestyle interventions generate only modest weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and this weight loss is rarely maintained long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Bariatric (weight loss) surgery is an effective treatment for severe obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but due to its high cost (at least $20&#x000a0;K for the surgery alone) and invasive nature, few obese individuals have opted for this strategy. Roughly 113,000 weight-loss surgeries are performed yearly in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and yet this number is dwarfed by the obese population&#x02014;estimated to be over 80 million adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Until recently, pharmacologic interventions for addressing chronic weight management have been limited. The drug combination fenfluramine/phentermine, referred to as fen-phen, was the first commercially successful weight loss drug. Although it was highly effective, it was later shown to have potentially fatal side effects, which led to its withdrawal from the market in 1997 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Over the next 15&#x000a0;years, only two weight-loss prescription medications were widely available on the US market, sibutramine (Meridia) and orlistat (Xenical). Sibutramine was subsequently pulled from the market due to increased risk of cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Until 2012, only orlistat was available for chronic use, but the weight loss observed in clinical trials was only a few percentage points greater than that seen with a placebo, and is associated with gastrointestinal side effects that limit its appeal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>However, in 2012, the US FDA approved two new therapies for chronic weight management: Belviq (lorcaserin) and Qsymia (phentermine plus topiramate extended-release), to be used in combination with diet and exercise. In a 1-year clinical trial, Qsymia phentermine 7.5 and topiramate 46&#x000a0;mg (recommended dose per label) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], in conjunction with diet and exercise, generated a clinically significant weight loss of 6.6&#x000a0;% of body weight relative to diet and exercise plus placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Statistically significant improvements with the Qsymia recommended dose compared with placebo were also noted in blood pressure, waist circumference, lipids, glycemic parameters, and inflammatory biomarkers. Moreover, rates of discontinuation with Qsymia were lower than with placebo, suggesting Qsymia has a tolerable side-effect profile. A follow-up study showed that weight loss was maintained after 2&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>These results suggest that Qsymia is effective at inducing weight loss and improving risk factors associated with comorbidities. However, the incremental cost-effectiveness of Qsymia compared to diet and exercise alone remains unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of the recommended dose of Qsymia from the payer perspective. Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has maintained a policy of not considering cost-effectiveness in national coverage decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], private insurers and large employers do not face such a restriction and have relied on cost-effectiveness analyses to inform decision making. For example, UnitedHealth Group now provides coverage for health coaches at YMCAs to work with overweight patients at high risk for type 2 diabetes based on research showing that this approach is likely to be cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Because of pressure to provide pharmacologic treatments for obesity as a covered benefit, some insurers/employers will be interested to know whether long-term treatment on Qsymia is likely to be cost-effective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Description</title><p>This study utilized the effectiveness results from the CONQUER randomized controlled trial. A complete description of the trial is available elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In brief, CONQUER was a 56-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 93 health centers in the USA to determine the effectiveness of Qsymia for weight loss and weight-related comorbidities. The trial was undertaken between November 1, 2007 and June 30, 2009. Adult participants were eligible if they were overweight or obese with a body-mass index (BMI) between 27 and 45&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and at least two obesity related co-morbidities, including increased waist circumference, elevated blood pressure, elevated cholesterol or type 2 diabetes managed with lifestyle modification or metformin. For those with type 2 diabetes, no lower BMI limit was applicable. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria were previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Eligible participants were stratified by gender and diabetes status and then randomly assigned in a 2:1:2 ratio to the placebo arm, the phentermine 7.5&#x000a0;mg plus topiramate extended-release 46&#x000a0;mg arm (Qsymia recommended dose), and the phentermine 15&#x000a0;mg plus topiramate extended-release 92&#x000a0;mg arm (Qsymia top dose) for 56&#x000a0;weeks. All participants received recommended counseling for diet and lifestyle modification. Study visits occurred at baseline and weeks 2 and 4 during drug titration, and every 4&#x000a0;weeks thereafter.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Effectiveness</title><p>Prior analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] focused on quantifying the efficacy and safety of Qsymia doses. Co-primary end-points were mean weight loss from baseline and the percentage who achieved clinically significant weight loss, defined as 5&#x000a0;% or greater from baseline. We extended that analysis by computing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the recommended dose of Qsymia relative to placebo in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. We focused on the incremental cost-effectiveness of the recommended dose as it is the most commonly prescribed dose of Qsymia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>This analysis was conducted from the payer perspective, which included the direct cost of Qsymia (assuming no rebates, co-payments or deductibles) less cost offsets from reductions in concomitant medications. The primary cost-effectiveness analysis was based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) sample, which consisted of all participants who completed baseline measurements and surveys, were randomly assigned, took at least one dose of the study drug or placebo, and had one post-baseline bodyweight measurement. Completers included a subset of these individuals who completed the trial on the study drug or placebo and for whom the final end-point measurement was obtained within 7&#x000a0;days of the last dose (see the Electronic supplementary material, ESM).</p><p>The primary measure of effectiveness was an imputed health-related quality of life (QoL) score which was derived from the Short Form-12 version 2 (SF-12v2) survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The SF-12v2 survey is a validated questionnaire used to assess participant physical and mental health. We calculated changes in the physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scales based on the SF-12v2 survey. We used the Brazier and Roberts algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] to convert the SF-12v2 survey into a health-related QoL metric for each participant at baseline and at 7 and 12&#x000a0;months (where 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;dead and 1.0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;best imaginable health state). This algorithm is widely used in cost-effectiveness analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We then estimated the change in this metric over the trial duration, with the last observation carried forward (LOCF) for those with missing data. We employed a linear regression model with change in QoL as the dependent variable and treatment arm as the key outcome variable; sex and mean-centered baseline QoL were included as potential confounders. Analogous regressions were run for physical and mental health summary scores. All regression analyses were conducted using Stata 13.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>As it is not known when the QoL benefits accrued during the trial, we assumed that 50&#x000a0;% of the full benefits accrue in the first year (i.e., they received 6&#x000a0;months of the benefit). We further assumed that the benefits linearly decayed after the medication was ceased. Our base case assumed that individuals were on Qsymia for 1&#x000a0;year, with benefits linearly decaying to zero 2&#x000a0;years post-drug cessation. In one-way sensitivity analyses, we assumed linear decays of 0, 1, and 3&#x000a0;years. We also modeled an additional scenario whereby patients remain on Qsymia for 2&#x000a0;years, with 50&#x000a0;% of the benefits in the first year and full benefits in the second year, which then linearly decline to zero in years three and four. The assumption of full benefits through year two is supported by a follow-up study of Qsymia which found that individuals who remained on Qsymia for 2&#x000a0;years maintained the weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Costs</title><p>Costs and potential cost offsets for this analysis were limited to direct costs of Qsymia, physician appointments, and any potential cost offsets from reducing medications for concomitant medications. Based on market prices (September 2013), the direct cost of the recommended dose of Qsymia is $5.12 per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Noting that a large percentage stopped taking their medication mid-trial (31&#x000a0;% in the Qsymia recommended dose compared to 43&#x000a0;% in placebo), costs were allocated to participants according to how long each remained on the medication during the first 52&#x000a0;weeks of the 56-week trial period. We then included costs for two physician visits that would be expected to occur in the first year that someone starts a prescription weight loss drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Medication Cost Offsets</title><p>We focused on cost offsets for medications used to treat dyslipidemia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, as these medications are likely to be influenced by successful weight loss and were tracked as part of the CONQUER trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Participants reported daily prescription medication use (dosage and name of drug) at baseline and study conclusion. Using this information, daily medication costs were quantified by multiplying the usage data by unit costs for each of the reported medications. Unit costs were obtained from Medi-Span&#x02019;s PriceRx database in January 2013. The wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) was used for branded medications, while the average WAC (AWAC) was used for unbranded generics. Participants with no utilization at baseline and 56&#x000a0;weeks were allocated a cost of zero dollars. Baseline carried forward was used for those missing costs at 56&#x000a0;weeks. We then computed the change in daily medication costs for each class of drug and for the three combined from baseline to 56&#x000a0;weeks. To identify the impact of Qsymia on daily medication costs, we ran the same regression as for QoL, using an ITT approach. Similar to QoL, we did not know the exact date that changes in medication occurred; therefore, we assumed that daily medication savings began at month six. In future years we assumed that all savings in concomitant medications accrue for the entire year if participants remained on Qsymia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Incremental Cost-Effectiveness (ICER) Ratios</title><p>We calculated incremental cost effectiveness ratios by dividing the incremental costs of the intervention by the incremental benefits (QALYs). As noted above, our base case assumed individuals remained on the medication for 1&#x000a0;year and accrued benefits through year three. We also considered 2&#x000a0;years on Qsymia, with residual benefits accruing from years three through four. We applied a discount rate of 3.5&#x000a0;% for all out-year estimates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sensitivity Analysis</title><p>Several sensitivity analyses were carried out. In one-way sensitivity analyses, key inputs were varied one at a time to simulate the impact on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Specifically, we assessed the impact of:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Changing the duration of benefit decay post drug cessation from 2&#x000a0;years in the base case to either 0 (worst case), 1, or 3&#x000a0;years (best case),</p></list-item><list-item><p>Two years on Qsymia, with 50&#x000a0;% of benefits in the first year and full benefits in the second year, linearly declining to zero in years three and four,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Using the lower and upper 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals of effectiveness as estimated using converted SF-12v2 data from the trial (results available in Table&#x000a0;1 of the ESM),</p></list-item><list-item><p>Varying prescription costs for Qsymia by &#x000b1;25&#x000a0;%,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Excluding the medication offset,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Changing the discount rate from 3.5 to 1&#x000a0;% and 5&#x000a0;%, and</p></list-item><list-item><p>Assuming no residual benefits (or costs) beyond the trial period.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Subsequently, we employed probabilistic sensitivity analyses on the base-case model and ran the model 1,000 times to assess the effect of uncertainty regarding the input parameters (input values and a description of the calculations performed are available in the ESM). We assumed a normal distribution for medication costs and for effectiveness, using the estimated mean and standard deviations from the trial data. Based on the results, we report the percentage of iterations that fall below the $50,000 per QALY threshold and the cost per QALY value which 95&#x000a0;% of the observations fall below.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study Sample</title><p>Participant demographics are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

Detailed results for completers are available in the ESM.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper presented the incremental cost-effectiveness (cost per quality-adjusted life year gained) of the recommended dose of Qsymia plus diet and exercise relative to diet and exercise alone (plus placebo). While there is no explicit threshold for what is cost-effective in the US, there are several thresholds frequently cited as indicative of good value for money. The most frequently cited threshold in the US is $50,000 per QALY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. NICE, the agency that makes coverage recommendations for the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, accepts as cost-effective those interventions with an ICER below &#x000a3;20,000 (US$32,000) per QALY, or &#x000a3;30,000 (US$48,000) per QALY with strong reasons (&#x000a3;1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;USD$1.61 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>Our base case, which assumes individuals remain on the drug for 1&#x000a0;year and that benefits linearly decay to zero in the 2&#x000a0;years following drug cessation, produced an ICER for the Qsymia recommended dose of $48,340, with probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealing that 54&#x000a0;% of our base-case simulations were below $50,000. Assuming a post benefit decay of only 1&#x000a0;year increased the ICER to $74,480 per QALY gained. These results suggest that the Qsymia recommended dose plus diet and exercise may be cost-effective, depending on the time on Qsymia medication and whether QoL benefits persist 2&#x000a0;years beyond medication cessation.</p><p>This analysis is based solely on the extrapolation of within-trial results and an assumption as to how long QoL benefits would be sustained post treatment. Because the duration that QoL benefits persist beyond the cessation of Qsymia is currently unknown, we modeled sensitivity analyses ranging from no residual benefits to benefits linearly decaying to zero 3&#x000a0;years beyond medication cessation. Future research should explore the average time on Qsymia and the duration that weight loss and QoL benefits persist post Qsymia cessation using real-world data.</p><p>This analysis has several limitations. First, because we do not employ a disease progression model, we cannot model potential longer-term savings in QoL or mortality that may result from a lower likelihood of disease progression. Second, because the Qsymia trial did not collect data on healthcare utilization, aside from select medications, our cost offset analysis is limited to reductions in the usage and cost of these medications. Further, there was no significant difference in daily medication costs between the placebo group and Qsymia recommended dose at trial cessation. Given the lower medication cost at baseline for the placebo arm, it is possible that the comparative reduction in medication costs for Qsymia may reflect a regression to the mean. However, it is also possible that incorporating additional longer-term benefits and/or cost offsets would suggest even greater cost-effectiveness results than those reported here. Third, due to the trial design, we were limited to modeling one dosage for the entire trial period, as opposed to following clinician guidelines for dose titration and stoppage rules. The FDA recommends that patients should start on Qsymia 3.75&#x000a0;mg/23&#x000a0;mg daily for 14&#x000a0;days, then increase to Qsymia 7.5&#x000a0;mg/46&#x000a0;mg daily (recommended dose) for 12&#x000a0;weeks. If 3&#x000a0;% weight loss is not achieved after 12&#x000a0;weeks on Qsymia 7.5&#x000a0;mg/46&#x000a0;mg dose, then it should be discontinued or escalated to Qsymia 11.25/69 for 14&#x000a0;days and then Qsymia 15/92 for 12&#x000a0;weeks. If 5&#x000a0;% weight loss is not achieved after 12&#x000a0;weeks on the Qsymia 15/92 dose, therapy should be discontinued as described in the label [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Whether or not this recommendation is followed is unclear, but the 2013 data indicate that roughly 35&#x000a0;% of the volume of Qsymia is from the Qsymia 3.75/23 dose, 56&#x000a0;% from the Qsymia 7.5/46 dose, and only 9&#x000a0;% from the Qsymia 11.25/69 and Qsymia 15/92 doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Due to the trial design, it is not possible to analyze the effects of titration. We chose to conduct the cost-effectiveness analysis focusing on the Qsymia 7.5/46 daily dosage, herein described as the recommended dose, because in practice few patients titrate to a higher dose after the run-in period. Finally, although our base-case results are based on LOCF, subsequent analyses using baseline carry forward and multiple imputation (MI) had almost no impact on the results; QoL estimates were identical to the fourth decimal in each case.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Given the health and cost consequences of obesity, payers are looking to identify cost-effective treatments. These results reveal that Qsymia may be cost-effective for overweight and obese individuals with two or more co-morbidities if individuals remain on the drug for extended periods and if QoL benefits are maintained post medication cessation. Quantifying these outcomes using real-world data should be an area of future research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec20"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="40273_2014_182_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (DOCX 46&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Will Liu, Michael Schwiers, and Vincent Wu provided data assistance.</p><sec id="d30e1202"><title>Funding</title><p>VIVUS, Inc.</p></sec><sec id="d30e1207"><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>This study was conducted under contract between VIVUS, Inc. and Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore.
