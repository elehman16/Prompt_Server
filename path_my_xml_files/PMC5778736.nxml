Prevalence rates estimate up to 20% of women will experience clinically significant symptoms of anxiety or depression during this time, with symptoms often co-occurring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Yet fewer than half of these women will seek help or receive evidence-based treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Women face many structural and attitudinal barriers to accessing and engaging with treatment including lack of time, cost, geographical distance to services, transport issues, and practical difficulties with childcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Women are also often unwilling to disclose problems associated with motherhood to partners, family and health professionals due to perceived social stigma (e.g. pressure to minimise emotional difficulties as a mother) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">In the absence of routine screening in community-based and hospital-based settings, clinically significant symptoms of perinatal anxiety and depression remain under-detected and undertreated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This is a significant problem given anxiety and depression are associated with short-term and long-term adverse outcomes for the mother and infant (e.g. increased risk of obstetrical complications, poor birth outcomes and child developmental problems; detrimental to the mother&#x02013;infant relationship) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. If left untreated, perinatal anxiety and depression can also lead to a chronic or recurring course of symptoms throughout the mother&#x02019;s life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Developing evidence-based treatments that are acceptable and easily accessible for perinatal women (e.g. no referral required; minimal logistical issues) is an important area of focus that warrants attention.</p><p id="Par22">One approach to help increase access to treatment is through the use of Internet-delivered psychological interventions, particularly cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). In comparison to face-to face treatment, Internet-delivered CBT (iCBT) is scalable (e.g. does not rely on clinician time and resources in order to be disseminated at a population level), available at a reduced cost, more accessible especially for rural and remote patients, and can be completed at home offering increased convenience to the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Preliminary research suggests that iCBT is efficacious for women with depression in the perinatal period. One randomised controlled trial (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] evaluated a therapist-assisted six-session iCBT intervention, <italic>MumMoodBooster</italic>, for women with a clinical diagnosis of postpartum depression. This multimedia intervention included weekly therapist coaching via telephone. Post treatment, depression symptom severity scores were significantly lower for the intervention group compared to the treatment as usual (TAU) control condition (Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.83), with 79% of women in the intervention group no longer meeting diagnostic criteria for depression at 12&#x000a0;weeks, compared to 18% in the TAU control condition. Adherence and patient satisfaction with the program was also high. Pugh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] conducted an RCT to evaluate a seven-session iCBT intervention, <italic>Maternal Depression Online</italic>, for women with symptoms of subthreshold and clinical postpartum depression. This multimedia intervention included weekly therapist support and encouragement via email. For those in the iCBT group, symptoms of postpartum depression were significantly reduced from pre to post treatment and maintained at four-week follow-up compared to those participants in the waitlist control condition. Acceptability of the program and therapeutic alliance was reported as high.</p><p id="Par24">Only one RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] has evaluated an antenatal iCBT intervention for women with a clinical diagnosis of depression during pregnancy. The ten-week guided intervention, delivered as an adjunct intervention in addition to usual antenatal care, was supported by a CBT-trained therapist who provided regular feedback and encouragement. Compared to the TAU control group, depression scores significantly reduced from pre to post treatment for the iCBT group, with a large between-groups effect (Hedge&#x02019;s <italic>g</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.21). Treatment credibility and satisfaction with the intervention was high.</p><p id="Par25">As this area of research is still in its early stages, there are significant gaps in the literature that need to be addressed. Although perinatal anxiety is reported to have similar prevalence rates to perinatal depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and the two disorders are often highly co-morbid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], no Internet-delivered interventions have targeted the reduction of maternal anxiety symptoms alone or anxiety symptoms co-morbid with depression. Given that anxiety and depression are thought to share similar aetiological and maintenance processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], transdiagnostic iCBT, which targets these shared factors, is a promising avenue for the treatment of anxiety or depression in perinatal women. Transdiagnostic iCBT interventions have the potential to teach treatment principles that can be generalised across anxiety and depressive diagnoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], as well as educate women about symptoms of both anxiety and depression regardless of whether they meet clinical levels. It has also demonstrated efficacy in treating primary and co-morbid anxiety and depression in the general adult population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">ICBT for women in the antenatal period has also received limited attention, with only one study having evaluated an iCBT intervention for antenatal depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This is surprising given that antenatal anxiety and depression are two of the strongest predictors of postpartum depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition, research to date has focused only on the evaluation of six- to seven-session &#x02018;guided&#x02019; interventions for perinatal depression which are supported by trained therapists. No studies have evaluated brief (i.e. &#x0003c;&#x02009;6 sessions) or &#x02018;unguided&#x02019; (i.e. no therapist assistance) interventions for anxiety and/or depression in either the antenatal or postpartum period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par27">The primary aim of the proposed studies is to test the acceptability and the efficacy of the iCBT <italic>MUMentum</italic> programs&#x02014;<italic>MUMentum Pregnancy</italic> (study 1) and <italic>MUMentum Postnatal</italic> (study 2)&#x02014;in reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression and overall psychological distress compared to usual care in the perinatal period. We hypothesise that the two iCBT interventions will significantly reduce symptoms of distress, anxiety and depression and will be significantly more effective than usual care. The secondary aim is to explore the effects of the iCBT programs on mother&#x02013;infant bonding, parenting confidence and maternal quality of life. We hypothesise that the iCBT programs will lead to significant improvements in these three factors compared with usual care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p id="Par28">Both studies are parallel group, CONSORT-revised 2010 compliant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] superiority RCTs of iCBT program vs TAU control.

However, both courses differ in the context in which CBT skills are learned. The pregnancy course (<italic>MUMentum Pregnancy</italic>) is specifically tailored to women in the antenatal period and focuses on learning CBT skills in the context of character experiences, challenges and symptoms common during pregnancy (e.g. difficulties conceiving; increased anxiety surrounding the impending birth and health of the baby).

If proven efficacious and acceptable, the <italic>MUMentum</italic> programs will provide women in Australia with an evidence-based, easily accessible, psychoeducational CBT intervention in which to manage symptoms of perinatal anxiety, depression and distress. Results from the proposed RCTs will also contribute to the growing area of perinatal e-health interventions and aim to address several limitations in the literature.</p><p id="Par63">Specifically, the <italic>MUMentum</italic> programs will be the first Internet-delivered interventions targeted at symptoms of perinatal anxiety. Perinatal anxiety is a common and disabling condition in women during the perinatal period, is highly co-morbid with depression, yet is often underdiagnosed and undertreated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. To date, no Internet-delivered interventions have targeted symptoms of anxiety (with or without depressive symptoms) during the perinatal period.</p><p id="Par64">Treatment for depression during the antenatal period has also received limited attention in comparison to postpartum depression. The <italic>MUMentum Pregnancy</italic> program will be the second iCBT intervention developed specifically for women in the antenatal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Given that antenatal depression and anxiety are robust predictors of postpartum depression, our evaluation of the impact of these programs on mother and infant outcomes (e.g. mother&#x02013;infant bonding; parenting confidence; quality of life) will contribute to our understanding of how iCBT can be tailored to maximise the benefit to both mothers and infants.</p><p id="Par65">In comparison to the therapist-guided interventions that have recently been evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the <italic>MUMentum</italic> programs will be the first brief (i.e. three sessions) unguided iCBT interventions for perinatal women that do not require clinician support or coaching.

Future research should aim to investigate the cost-effectiveness of such interventions in primary care and the impact of varying levels of clinician guidance and coaching on patient outcomes.</p><p id="Par66">While the current RCTs aim to address gaps in the perinatal e-health literature, the following potential limitations are noted. First, the control group in the current RCTs are TAU control, rather than an active control condition. It is thus difficult to control for usual antenatal and postpartum care that participants receive throughout the trial. It is also not possible to compare the efficacy of a perinatal-specific iCBT intervention to a general iCBT intervention that is not specifically developed for women in the perinatal period (e.g. general depression program), other treatment approach or modality (e.g. face-to-face) as an active control condition was not included. Future research should investigate the efficacy of online-delivered interventions in comparison to active control conditions and face-to-face psychological therapy. It is also important to determine what treatment factors are most effective for which patients and whether the presence of anxiety or depressive disorders, or the severity of anxiety or depressive symptoms, influences treatment response in addition to potential side effects of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p><p id="Par67">Second, the follow-up period for this study was limited to four weeks post treatment. Previous research in this area that has employed longer follow-up periods (e.g. three months) have reported high attrition (i.e. dropout) (e.g. O&#x02019;Mahen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]). We therefore aimed to keep the follow-up period as short as possible, particularly for study 1 in which we aimed to evaluate follow-up treatment outcomes while women were still pregnant. Future research evaluating antenatal interventions would benefit from inclusion of a postpartum follow-up, given antenatal anxiety and depression are strong predictors of postpartum depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It is necessary for future research to examine long-term outcomes to determine whether positive outcomes are sustained over a longer duration beyond completion of treatment, particularly from pregnancy through to postpartum. This information would inform how antenatal treatment interventions can be tailored most effectively to prevent postpartum anxiety and depression.</p><p id="Par68">Third, both RCTs will recruit women who meet the required threshold to be considered experiencing &#x02018;clinically elevated&#x02019; anxiety and/or depression on self-report measures, rather than a formally assessed sample who meet criteria for a diagnosis of an anxiety or depressive disorder. It will therefore be difficult to generalise findings from this study due to the small sample size and reliance on self-report data only. Future research would benefit from investigating treatment interventions in larger randomised controlled studies utilising both self-report symptom measures and clinician-administered diagnostic measures. However, it is important to note that while clinical diagnostic interviews are the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; of measuring mental health problems, research suggests that diagnostic criteria may not account for all perinatal-specific problems or difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. As a substantial proportion of perinatal women will not fulfil all diagnostic criteria yet will experience similar levels of distress and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], we aimed to develop the <italic>MUMentum</italic> programs for women experiencing clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and/or depression and evaluate the programs&#x02019; efficacy in this target sample. While this study aims to establish the efficacy of the programs in reducing symptom severity in a clinical sample, future research would benefit from investigating the effectiveness of the <italic>MUMentum</italic> programs in the &#x02018;end users&#x02019; of the program (i.e. those screening positive for anxiety, depression or distress) in primary care effectiveness trials.</p><p id="Par69">Given the prevalence of perinatal anxiety and depression and the negative outcomes for both the mother and child, the development of evidence-based accessible treatments that target both anxiety and depressive symptoms, and overall psychological distress is imperative.
