Individuals with such disorders may experience abnormal mood swings, from depression to happiness.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> World Health Organization (WHO) has described mood disorders as the major health issues of the 21st century.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Bipolar Mood Disorder (BMD) is a chronic disease, with acute attacks, and has a lifetime prevalence of almost 2% to 4%.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Such disorder, which is associated with various disabilities, can be detected in the people of every social class and race. BMD is the sixth leading cause of disability worldwide.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In recent years, more attention has been paid to the diagnosis of BMD in children and adolescents and the rate of diagnosis in such age group has been increased. Moreover, the number of children diagnosed with such disease has doubled in recent 10 years.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> 13% to 28% of the patients with BMD have disease onset before the age of 13 years and 50% to 66% before the age of 18 years.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Miklowitz et al. have conducted several studies focusing on adolescents suffering from such disease and their family since 2001.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Research has shown that having a family member with a mood disorder affects the whole family and leads to loss of their abilities and adaptability. Such deficiencies, not only cause stress in the family members during the acute attacks, but they also affect the course of the disease.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In the literature review conducted by Steele et al. (2010), the rate of depression and anxiety in the family members who take care of BMD sufferers has been reported 40% to 55%.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>The family members of such patients experience many difficulties and pressures during the periods of treatment, rehabilitation and recovery. Furthermore, their quality of life (QOL) is threatened and, in some cases, they feel depressed and anxious as well. Hence, managing the disease demands a direct interaction between the patients&#x02019; family members and mental health professionals.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Families of adolescents with BMD, who take care of the patients, often feel isolated in their struggle to cope with the disease and seek help for their children. Therefore, focusing on the patients&#x02019; family is considered as a logical starting point since the adolescents live with their primary family who are responsible for taking care of them.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Accordingly, family-focused education is a psycho-educational method and a skills training approach for the families with patients suffering from BMD.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Family psycho-educational intervention could significantly decrease psychological problems of family caregivers if it is combined with common mental health care.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Family-focused psycho-education is an effective treatment strategy as its positive effects on children and adolescents with BMD have been proven in the review studies. Family-focused psycho-education is a new approach developed for the families of children with such mood disorder to help them cope with the disease. Research has revealed that not only this type of education has been effective for adults with BMD, but it also could decrease the severity of the disease, improve relationships and increase problem solving skills and adaptability in the families.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>Another study demonstrated that such an intervention could enhance the knowledge and information about the disease in BMD sufferers and their families. During their one-year follow-ups, the researchers observed a decrease in the psychological problems caused by care-giving and high emotional expression.<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>Currently, QOL is one of the issues of interest to international communities and researchers. WHO has also paid special attention to the development of health care assessment, beyond its traditional criteria such as mortality and morbidity, to evaluate the influential power of physical and psychological diseases on the ability of performing daily activities.<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The researchers believe that physical health is influenced by psychological growth and mental health promotion is based on the prevention and treatment of emotional stresses. Functioning in other domains of QOL is threatened as the level of mental health decreases.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Therefore, performing interventions on such patients assists inimproving QOL, accelerating recovery, reducing length of hospital stay and eventually health care costs. Otherwise, reduced mental health can negatively affect QOL and it leads to job loss, family disruption, impaired interpersonal communication, and inability to perform personal, family and social responsibilities.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>Hence, assessing QOL in medical environment can be valuable due to some reasons. The techniques and measurement tools used to assess QOL could provide information which has been neglected or not achieved by traditional analysis of treatment outcomes. Assessing QOL as one part of treatment outcomes helps the clinicians and therapists to realize the slight differences that exist in individuals&#x02019; responses to treatment.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Several studies have also confirmed the effectiveness of community-based interventions, home follow-ups, the role of supportive services, rehabilitation and clinical interventions in the improvement of QOL in the patients.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> So far, a few studies have been done on the adolescents with BMD and their families especially in Iran while no study in Iran has focused on the families of the patients with such disorder. Therefore, considering the importance and early onset of BMD and the fact that adolescence is a sensitive period, we aimed to evaluate the effect of family-centered education on mental health and QOL of families with adolescents suffering from BMD referred to medical centers affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants and Procedures</title><p>This intervention was performed on 40 families (38 mothers and 2 fathers) of the adolescents with BMD which referred to the psychiatric clinics affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences during 2012-13. Significant results after the comparison between and within groups shows an adequate sample size (post power analysis &#x0003e;75%). They were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups using block randomization method (block size: 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Design and protocol of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJCBNM-4-229-g001"/></fig><p>Inclusion criteria were having an adolescent aged 12-18 with confirmed diagnosis of BMD by a child and adolescent psychiatrist and lack of any other mental disorders such as mental retardation, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and drug abuse. However, exclusion criteria were unwillingness to participate in the study and absence more than two sessions in the educational program.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Measures</title><p>Data were collected using General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), Quality of Life Assessment Questionnaire (Short Form-36) and demographic questionnaire. Demographic data included age, sex and educational level of the adolescent and his/her parents, a history of physical or psychological diseases in the family as well as the number of siblings and birth order. The questionnaires were completed by all participants three times: before, immediately after and one month after the intervention.</p><p>The 28-Item version of GHQ (GHQ-28) was developed by Goldberg in 1978. It is a 28-item self-report questionnaire which contains 4 subscales measuring somatic symptoms: anxiety, sleep disorder, social dysfunction, and depression. Each sub-scale contains 7 items and each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale. The score for each subscale ranges from 0 to 21. The total score, which is obtained by summing up the scores of all subscales, ranges from 0 to 84 with lower scores indicating higher general health status. The reliability and validity of the questionnaire have been assessed in various studies and also estimated and confirmed in Iran. By conducting a pilot study, Yaghoubi estimated the sensitivity and specificity of the questionnaire as 86.5% and 82%, respectively and the cut-off score as 23 based on a Likert-scale scoring. The reliability coefficient of the questionnaire was estimated 88% using test-retest and Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha. We used the Persian version of CHQ-28, which was translated by Yaghoubi and Palahang (1995), under the supervision of Dr. Barahani, to measure the mental health status in the participants.<sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>Short form of QOL questionnaire (SF-36) is a 36-item self-report instrument designed to measure health-related QOL across eight dimensions of physical functioning, role limitations caused by physical and emotional problems, bodily pain, general health, mental health, social functioning, emotional problems, energy/fatigue, and health changes. The scores on each dimension range from 0 to 100 with higher scores reflecting higher quality in that dimension. The questionnaire has been extensively used and its validity and reliability were estimated in various studies. Furthermore, internal consistency of the questionnaire was estimated by calculating Cronbach&#x02019;s Alpha coefficient which was reported between 0.72 and 0.94.<sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> In Iran, its reliability has been confirmed by Motamed et al. (2001) for Iranian population and Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha was calculated as 0.87.<sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Intervention</title><p>This study was approved by Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (No CT-92-6718). The research was conducted for two groups (Intervention &#x00026; Control). All the families in the intervention group participated in a family-centered educational program consisting of six 90-minute sessions per week for 6 weeks. 20 participants in the intervention group were divided into groups of 4 and all of them attended the workshops and received the same content. The educational workshops were directed by a psychiatric nurse and a child and adolescent psychiatry specialist. To provide the intervention protocol, we used Fristad&#x02019;s educational package (2003) and family educational package on BMD in children and adolescents prepared by Mahmoudi-Gharaei et al. Family educational package included information about the nature and symptoms of mood disorders, therapeutic methods, complications and their course, appropriate interactions with patients, the effect of disease on the family, family&#x02019;s reactions to the disease, compatibility with the disease, common problems in the family with a patient suffering from mood disorder and problem-solving techniques.<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>During the sessions, visual aids equipment was used in order to attract and preserve the attention of the participants. The contents were explained to them using PowerPoint slides, graphs and images related to BMD sufferers. The educational workshops included lectures, presentations and interactive discussions as well as questions and answers. The first 15 minutes of each session was devoted to presenting a summary of the previous session and continued by presenting new contents, the mothers&#x02019; questions and their talks about the situations they encountered in this regard. At the end of each session, a training booklet containing the presented contents in that session, and after the end of the 6th session, a booklet containing the key points presented during the whole sessions were given to the participants who attended the educational workshops. The participants of the control group received no intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>The collected data were analyzed using SPSS software, version 16.

Although the patients may experience recovery phases, the caregivers and family members are constantly concerned about suicidal thoughts and disease recurrence in the patients and changes in the nature of their disease (59%).<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>All studies have reported family dysfunction, despair and helplessness in the families living with such patients. In a review article, more than 24 articles about caregivers of the patients with BMD were analyzed, in which 21 articles reported psychiatric distress in the caregivers. Their findings also showed that 46% of caregivers experienced depression.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Taking care of the patients with such disorder in the family requires appropriate planning. The family members must be qualified enough and have sufficient competencies to handle such task. To achieve this goal, the families need to receive the required trainings on strategies of interacting with the patient, methods of medication use and dealing with the symptoms of the disease and the resulting behaviors.<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>Likewise, training the families helps to reduce disease recurrence rate and provide a relaxed and convenient environment for the patients and their family members.<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Our finding also showed that family-centered psycho-education is essential and effective in this regard. The result of another study revealed that family psycho-education could significantly decrease the &#x0201c;sense of pressure&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;family burden&#x0201d; immediately after and one year after the intervention. They also found that depression scores significantly decreased in the patients&#x02019; families and relatives who received such intervention.<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>Furthermore, we observed a significant difference in the intervention group in terms of the family&#x02019;s psycho-education before, immediately after and one month after the intervention. QOL is one of the most important areas in the life of the families with psychiatric patients, especially those with BMD, being vulnerable to negative effects. Actually, QOL is characterized as an individual&#x02019;s specific perception of life satisfaction, physical health, social and family health, hope, etiquette and mental health. In the case of depressive disorders and BMD like other diseases, improving the QOL of the patients and their families is the primary goal of care.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>Another study applied an intervention which included combinations of education about the illness, family support, crisis intervention and problem solving skills training. The results showed that family intervention could improve psychological welfare of the family members. Since life satisfaction and psychological welfare are measures of QOL, these types of interventions could improve QOL in the participants. Dixon&#x02019;s finding was consistent with ours. In the present study, family-centered education was used in relation with the disease, family support, crisis intervention, interaction with the patient, reaction to the symptoms of the disease and problem solving skills training. Accordingly, QOL improved in our participants in the intervention group immediately after and one month after the intervention. In the control group, however, no significant difference was observed.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>Another study showed that family interventions could improve psychological well-being and comfort, symptoms of the disease, interaction with the patient and family members and eventually QOL since the mentioned factors are all subscales of QOL.<sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Researchers believe that physical health can be influenced by psychological growth and mental health promotion is based on prevention and treatment of emotional stress. Functioning in other domains of QOL is threatened as the level of mental health decreases.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Research findings suggest that children suffering from behavioral disorders and psychiatric diseases can negatively affect their parents. A study on mental health status in family caregivers of the patients with psychiatric disorders revealed that 35% of the respondents reported some sorts of mental health problems.<sup><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Accordingly, in the present study, family-centered education was used to promote mental health in the families of the adolescents with BMD. We observed a statistically significant difference in the intervention group in this regard immediately after and one month after the intervention.</p><p>The family caregivers, who take care of a family member with psychiatric disorders, have several needs and nurses can help them meet their needs by proper planning and applying nursing procedures after identifying and prioritizing the needs. All members of the caregiving team are responsible for supporting the families with the patients suffering from psychiatric diseases and satisfying their needs; however, nurses are in a special position and have a key role in this regard since they are the main support of family members in hospitals.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>One of the limitations of our study could be small sample size. The number of the recruited participants was few due to less referral of adolescents with BMD and late diagnosis of their disease. Further research with larger sample size could be effective in confirming the results of the present study and making changes in the mean scores of QOL and mental health. A follow-up period of more than one month which is repeated over time is recommended to confirm our results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>The study findings confirmed the effectiveness of family-centered psycho-education program on Mental Health and Quality of life of the families of adolescents with bipolar mood disorder.
