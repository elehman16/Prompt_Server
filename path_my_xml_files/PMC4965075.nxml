To accomplish this goal, 13 international swimmers (8 women, 5 men) were allocated to both the control (Sea Level Training, SLT) and experimental conditions (AT, 2320 m above sea level) that were separated by a one year period. All tests (15 m freestyle swimming start and loaded squat jumps with additional loads of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of swimmers&#x02019; body weight) were performed before and after a concurrent 3-week strength and endurance training program prescribed by the national coach. Following the SLT camp, significant impairments in swimming start times to 10 (+3.1%) and 15 m (+4.0%) were observed (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), whereas no significant changes for the same distances were detected following the AT camp (-0.89%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Trivial changes in peak velocity were obtained during the loaded squat jump after both training periods (effect sizes: &#x0003c; 0.20). Based on these results we can conclude that a traditional training high&#x02014;living high strategy concurrent training of 3 weeks does not adversely affect swimming start time and loaded squat jump performance in high level swimmers, but further studies are necessary to assess the effectiveness of power-oriented resistance training in the development of explosive actions.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation</institution></funding-source><award-id>DEP2012-35774</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport</institution></funding-source><award-id>FPU12/00360</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0608-8755</contrib-id><name><surname>Garc&#x000ed;a-Ramos</surname><given-names>Amador</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Ferrovial S.

Proof of this is that, worldwide, there are at least 22 altitude training centres located between 1000 and 3000 m above sea level (asl). Swimmers are amongst those athletes who use altitude training most often [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The High Performance Centre of Sierra Nevada is a popular centre for swimmers because of its location (2320 m asl; an optimal altitude according to Bonetti and Hopkins [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and Wilber et al. [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]) and because it is one of the few altitude training centres in the world (the only one in Europe) with a 50-m pool. More than 300 swimmers of 12 different nationalities participated during 2015 in training camps at Sierra Nevada (usually 2&#x02013;4 weeks duration) with the expectation of improving sea level performance.</p><p>In altitude training research using swimmers or other kinds of athletes as participants, most of the attention has been focused on endurance performance and related parameters (e.g., maximum oxygen consumption, total haemoglobin mass, etc.) [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The effectiveness of altitude training strategies in the development of endurance performance is generally accepted [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. On the contrary, prolonged exposure to high altitude (&#x0003e; 5000 m asl) has been associated with a deterioration in lean mass [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and its functional capacity [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, there are no controlled studies examining the effect of typical altitude training routines, which are predominantly composed by endurance workouts, on the performance of explosive actions when the training is conducted at moderate altitude.</p><p>After an acute ascent to moderate altitude, previous studies have documented an increase in the velocity at which a determined absolute load can be lifted during resistance training exercises such as the bench press [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and the loaded squat jump (LSJ) [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. An increased activity of type II muscles fibers [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or an increased excitability of the nervous system [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] could partially explain these results. However, the reduction in air resistance in hypobaric conditions has also been pointed out as a non-physiological mechanism [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Indeed, the air density affects performance of high velocity movement [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and even though the speeds reached during the resistance training exercises is low (&#x0003c; 3 m&#x02219;s<sup>-1</sup>), reduced air density might also improve the performance of these movements [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], probably caused by its interaction with other factors such as the described above. Whilst doubts remain as to the principal mechanisms involved, it is possible that performing resistance training at altitude may offer benefits in the development of muscle power and the performance of explosive actions. In this regard, Garc&#x000ed;a-Ramos et al. [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] revealed significant increments in vertical jump height (&#x02248; 7.2%) as well as in undulatory swimming start performance (&#x02248; 2.8%) following a 2-week altitude training camp, but unfortunately this study did not include a control group (training at sea level).</p><p>Swimming start performance, commonly assessed as the time to 15 m [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], may be the specific swimming task most influenced by explosive force and muscular power [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The time to 15 m has been typically identified as a good predictor of overall race time in the four swimming strokes [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, several studies have also evaluated start times to shorter distances (e.g., 5 and 10 m) to differentiate the variables that affect swimming start performance (block, flight, entry, glide and underwater propulsion phases) [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Developing a high horizontal impulse during the block phase in order to achieve the maximum possible horizontal take-off velocity is also a key factor in improving swimming start time [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Given the strong relationship between start time and overall race performance, and the clear influence of horizontal take-off velocity on swimming start performance, it seems appropriate to examine the effect of altitude training on these variables. Therefore, the main objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of an altitude training camp on swimming start times and LSJ performance in high level swimmers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design</title><p>A controlled trial was designed to assess the effects of a 3-week training camp held at moderate altitude on swimming start time and LSJ performance.

Swimmers waited on the starting block and when they were ready, a tester gave the command &#x02018;&#x02018;take your mark&#x0201d;, before a sound was made by shutting a clapperboard to signal the start of the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160401.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0160401.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0160401.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Swimmer ready to perform the freestyle track start.</title><p>Note: The individual in this picture has given written informed consent (as outlined in PLOS consent form) to publish this photograph.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0160401.g001"/></fig><p>Two underwater cameras (GoPro Hero 3, 100 fps) (GoPro,Inc. San Mateo, California, USA) and an overwater camera (Casio Exilim Pro EX-FX1, 300 fps) (CASIO Computer CO., Ltd.

The shutting of the clapperboard, in addition to emitting the acoustic starting signal, synchronously activated a light system that was extended from the beginning to the end of the swimming pool at 1 metre depth. Each camera was positioned to record at least one of the LEDs. When processing the data, the first frame in which the LEDs were switched on was used to determine the zero time of the video recordings. A 2D reference system was built with non-elastic lead ropes hooked onto the roof of the swimming pool at the distances analyzed (5, 10, and 15 m).

The analysis was done by the Ultimate Pen Software (St Paul, Minnesota, USA) which allowed us to play the video image as well as to plot the spatial references determined from the 2D reference system. The implementation of a routine (Script) in the Filemaker Pro v.12 software (Santa Clara, California, USA) enabled the time code of the video image to run with QuickTime Player v7 (Cupertino, California, USA) and set this time in its specific database field for further processing. The start with the lowest time to 15 m was selected for subsequent analysis.</p><p>To measure ground reaction force during the start, a portable force plate (Kistler 9253A11, Winterthur, Switzerland) was put on a custom-made stand with an angle of 7&#x000b0; to the horizontal and a custom-made steel starting block (identical to OSB11) was mounted on top of the force plate. Horizontal and vertical forces were collected with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz using custom&#x02013;programmed data collection software, and were used to determine the horizontal take-off velocity following standard procedures of calculation [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

Thereafter, an incremental loading test using the SJ exercise with additional loads of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of swimmers&#x02019; body weight was conducted with a Smith machine.

The intervention period comprised a mesocycle of 3 weeks during the general preparation phase. Accordingly, it was a condition of participation that the relative training load would not substantially change during the 3-week study phase between years to allow the full assessment of the training intervention without such a confounding factor. To minimize the influence of fatigue, coaches were asked to reduce the training load the day before to the assessment days.</p><p>Individualized training plans were developed by the swimmers&#x02019; coaches, each very experienced in AT. They implemented the training program according to their own experience, swimmer&#x02019;s fitness level, and individual response to altitude. Typically, training schedules included two pool sessions and a dry-land workout six days per week. Throughout the entire duration of the training period, the main coach of the national team (for pool training sessions) and the fitness coach (for dry-land training sessions) were responsible for filling in the training diary of each swimmer. Pool training was described in terms of time and distance swum. Dry-land sessions were described by reporting the main purpose and the content of training. The main purpose was expressed by the selection of a code: 1 for sessions oriented to developing maximum strength; 2 for explosive strength; 3 for endurance strength; 4 for conditioning; 5 for cardiovascular activities; and 6 for range of motion and flexibility. For codes 4 to 6, a brief description of the content was also incorporated. For codes 1 to 3, additional information, such as the number and description of exercises, sets, repetitions per set, load, rest between sets, and speed of the movement, was also detailed. Maximum strength training sessions involved 6&#x02013;8 exercises in which 3&#x02013;4 sets of 6&#x02013;12 repetitions at 70&#x02013;85% of the 1-repetition maximum (1RM) were performed, with 2&#x02013;5 min of rest. During endurance strength training sessions, sets of 20 repetitions or maximum repetitions in 20-40s sets were performed using a load of 30&#x02013;50% of 1RM, followed by &#x0003c; 1 min of rest. Different variants of the squat (front squat, deep back squat, Bulgarian split squat, etc.), deadlift, leg flexion and extension, and hip thrust were the most common lower limb exercises employed by the swimmers.</p><p>Additionally, within 30 min after each training pool or dry-land session, a category scale (0&#x02013;10) of ratings of perceived exertion (C-RPE10) [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] was undertaken to assess training intensity.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data are presented as means and standard deviations (SD). Reliability of the measurements was calculated by determining the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the 90% confidence interval (90% CI) using a custom spreadsheet [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A two-way (training condition [SLT and AT] x test [pretest and postest]) repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine the differences at baseline between both training periods and the training-related effects for each dependent variable analyzed. When significant F values were obtained, pairwise differences between means were identified using Bonferroni post hoc procedures.

The percentage changes after each training period were used to compare training-related effects between SLT and AT through paired samples t-tests. Significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05. The criteria to interpret the magnitude of the ES were as follows: &#x0003c;0.2 = trivial, 0.2&#x02013;0.6 = small, 0.6&#x02013;1.2 = moderate, 1.2&#x02013;2.0 = large, and &#x0003e;2 = very large [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

Nevertheless, the results of the present study suggest that a training high&#x02014;living high strategy of 3 weeks at 2320 m asl does not have adverse effects on muscular function, even if swimmers do not focus their training solely on improving force and power.</p><p>Traditionally, prolonged exposure to altitude has been associated with a deterioration in lean mass [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and its functional capacity [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Different factors such as an insufficient energy intake [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], a reduced training stimulus [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], or even the negative effect of hypoxia itself on protein metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] have been proposed as being responsible of these impairments. However, it should be considered that the vast majority of adverse effects of chronic hypoxia effecting muscle size and strength/power adaptations have been documented at an altitude above 5000 m asl; far higher than the 2000&#x02013;2500 m generally recommended and where the present study was conducted [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>This is one of the first studies evaluating the performance of explosive actions (swimming start time and LSJ) after an altitude training camp held at terrestrial moderate altitude (2320 m asl). Both training periods promoted similar changes in the analyzed variables. These results have important applications in the field of altitude training as they indicate that 3-weeks of a training high&#x02014;living high strategy does not constitute a negative stimulus on muscular function. Therefore, it would seem unnecessary for swimmers to be concerned about the loss of lean mass and its functional capacity when living and training at moderate altitude.</p><p>The changes in swimming start time to 5 and 10 m observed after the AT camp represented a little but significant improvement over the SLT period. However, rather than attributing this to the effect of the AT training camp, we should acknowledge that this result was mainly caused by the significant impairment in swimming start time observed after the SLT period. The time to 5 m, in concordance with the results obtained for the horizontal take-off velocity and LSJ performance, did not differ between measurements. These results suggest that the differences between the training periods were caused by the swimming part of the start, which mainly depends on the efficiency of underwater legs kicking and maintaining the optimal hydrodynamic body position.</p><p>The training regime followed by the swimmers was excessively oriented towards the improvement of endurance capacity which could explain the results of the present study since it is known that concurrent endurance training attenuates strength training responses [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In this regard, H&#x000e4;kkinen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] reported that concurrent strength and endurance training leads to interference in explosive strength development. Therefore, since explosive strength is paramount for the actions analyzed in the present study (LSJ and swimming start) [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], it is logical that the improvements recorded in LSJ performance were not very pronounced. Similar weak enhancements in LSJ were produced after each training period (SLT and AT). These results confirm that a typical 3-week concurrent strength and endurance training program performed at terrestrial altitude does not have adverse effects on vertical jump performance in high level swimmers.</p><p>While the majority of studies carried out with swimmers at altitude have been focused on parameters related to aerobic metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0160401.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], this is the first study examining the effect of a traditional AT camp on the performance of explosive actions. The main conclusion of the present study is to report that the performance of explosive actions is not impaired after a stay of 3 weeks at terrestrial altitude even if swimmers do not change their strength training routine in an attempt to improve these functions. However, it would be necessary for future studies to carry out resistance training programs exclusively designed to develop maximum and explosive strength to further explore the applications of AT in the field of strength and conditioning. Due to logistical constraints it was not feasible to split the national team in 2 groups to counterbalance the order of the training interventions. To minimize the impact of this potential limitation only the swimmers older than 16 years at the beginning of the first phase of the study were included in the analysis. The younger swimmers were excluded because the accentuated year-to-year variability in the biological maturation generally observed at these ages could have a major effect in our results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A traditional 3-week concurrent strength and endurance training program performed at terrestrial altitude does not adversely affect swimming start time and LSJ performance in high level swimmers. These results confirm that swimmers should not be excessively concerned about the deterioration of muscular function when they take part in AT camps at moderate altitude. Power-oriented resistance training must be performed at terrestrial altitude to examine further whether altitude training has an additional benefit on the development of explosive actions when compared to training at sea level.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the swimmers and coaches for their collaboration and commitment to this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0160401.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Bonetti</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hopkins</surname><given-names>WG</given-names></name>. <article-title>Sea-level exercise performance following adaptation to hypoxia: a meta-analysis</article-title>. <source>Sports Med</source>. <year>2009</year>; <volume>39</volume>: <fpage>107</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>127</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2165/00007256-200939020-00002">10.2165/00007256-200939020-00002</ext-link></comment>
