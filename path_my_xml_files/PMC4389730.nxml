More than 50% of patients with OSA are considered to have positional OSA (POSA), a condition in which the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) is at least twice as high in the supine position compared with non-supine positions [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2,3</xref>]. In approximately 80% of all patients with OSA the AHI is higher in the supine position compared with the non-supine positions [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2,3</xref>].</p><p>Many patients with OSA cannot tolerate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or they use it incidentally [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4,5</xref>]. Many patients with OSA have contraindications for using oral devices [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Previous positional therapies for patients with OSA have focused primarily on avoiding the supine position and/or sleeping in the lateral position [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3,7,8</xref>].</p><p>One of the first described therapies to reduce snoring and to improve OSA was the so-called &#x02018;tennis ball technique&#x02019;. A tennis ball is sewn into the pyjamas or fastened by a belt to the back of the patient to reduce the time spent in the supine position [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This treatment has been shown to reduce the supine time and to improve AHI in patients with POSA [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9,10</xref>]. Due to the limited compliance with all the variations of the tennis ball technique, several newer positional methods have been developed primarily to reduce the time spent in the supine position [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7,11,12</xref>].</p><p>There is limited experience regarding the effect of the prone position on severity of OSA [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In a previous study from our research group [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the effect of prone positioning of the body and the head was evaluated in patients with OSA. The mean AHI and ODI were significantly improved in the prone position, with higher efficiency observed in patients with POSA. The long-term efficiency and the compliance of prone positioning were not assessed.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the prone body and head sleep position on severity of disease in patients with OSA after 4 weeks of adaptation to a mattress and pillow facilitating prone positioning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study design and subjects</title><p>The patients included were referred to the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden, due to sleep-disordered breathing.

A mattress with a height of 12 cm, width of 80 cm and length of 120 cm was provided to ensure a comfortable and stable prone body position during sleep. At the upper end the mattress had excavations of the sides for positioning of the arms and anatomical angles in the shoulders and elbows. The support of the chin on the mattress was optional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The MPP could be placed upon a normal mattress and hence would be compatible with the existing bed at home. The main purpose of the MPP was to provide a comfortable prone sleep position. After lying on the MPP, the temperature-sensitive visco-elastic material moulded to the body shape, which helped the subject maintain the prone position during the night.

The sleep studies included registration of breathing efforts by chest and abdominal movements, airflow and snoring by oronasal flowmetry and thermistor, and body position by a position sensor that could differentiate between upright, supine, left, right and prone positions. Heart rate and oxygen saturation were registered by a finger pulse-oximeter. Electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring (sensors C3-A2, O1-A2, O2-A1, C4-A1 derivations), electro-oculogram (left and right) and submental electromyogram (EMG) were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Data interpretation</title><p>The sleep studies were analyzed and scored by an independent technician blinded to the assignment of the patients.

The oxygen desaturation index (ODI) was calculated in the same manner based on the total number of desaturations divided by the sleep time.
