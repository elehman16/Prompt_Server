An open trial was conducted to determine the efficacy of once daily administration of risperidone as compared to twice daily administration. Assessment were done on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale Eighty two percent of the once daily patients and 79% of the twice daily patients showed a significant treatment response. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in response pattern and adverse effects at the end point. Risperidone given once daily was as effective as twice daily administration.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Risperidone</kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>dose-frequency</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
