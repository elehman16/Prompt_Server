LY3045697 inhibits human AS (in vitro CYP11B2 IC<sub>50</sub>=4.5 nM) with a 39-fold selectivity over cortisol synthase (in vitro CYP11B1 IC<sub>50</sub>=176 nM). Two clinical studies that evaluate LY3045697 in healthy subjects have recently completed. The goal of these studies was to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of LY3045697. The pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints of interest included the effects of LY3045697 on aldosterone and cortisol synthesis and on K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis after single and multiple doses. A novel selective, potent ASi may have therapeutic utility in patients suffering from CKD, diabetic nephropathy (DN), hypertension (HT: salt sensitive, resistant, isolated systolic), primary hyperaldosteronism or cardiac arrhythmias.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section6-1470320317717883"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="section7-1470320317717883"><title>Study designs</title><p>Two randomized, placebo-controlled, incomplete crossover design studies were conducted in healthy volunteers using similar enrollment criteria and study endpoints. Subjects remained confined to the Clinical Research Unit during all dosing and evaluation periods in both studies, except for the follow-up visits, which were ambulatory. The first study, ASEA, was a first-in-human single ascending dose study investigating doses across a range of 0.1&#x02013;300 mg. The second study, ASEB, assessed doses across a range of 0.1&#x02013;100 mg administered once-daily for eight days. Subjects were randomized to an LY3045697 dose, placebo or 25 mg spironolactone that was included as a positive comparator to benchmark LY3045697-related effects on K<sup>+</sup>. The studies underwent institutional review board (IRB) approval and subjects signed an informed consent prior to starting any study procedures. In both studies, dosing was conducted after a standardized breakfast, as in vitro testing suggested potentially LY3045697 better bioavailability in the fed state. In study ASEB, subjects consumed a controlled metabolic diet on Days 1&#x02013;8 in each dosing period. This diet consisted of moderately restricted Na<sup>+</sup> (125 mEq/day) and slightly higher than normal K<sup>+</sup> (125 mEq/day).</p><p>Subjects in the ASEB study underwent a 40 mEq oral K<sup>+</sup> challenge 3 h after dosing on Day 7. Dietary K<sup>+</sup> content was reduced by 40 mEq on Day 7 to maintain the total daily K<sup>+</sup> intake of 125 mEq. The premise of the oral K<sup>+</sup> challenge is that, relative to normal conditions, antagonizing the action of aldosterone in the distal nephron of healthy kidneys should delay the urine excretion of an oral K<sup>+</sup> load and produce a transient further rise in serum K<sup>+</sup>. Application of this challenge in the ASEB study enabled evaluation of the kinetics of serum and urine K<sup>+</sup> in the presence or absence of test article or the MR antagonist, spironolactone.</p><p>Also in the ASEB study, an intravenous (IV) adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge was performed 1 h after dosing on Day 8. The IV ACTH challenge test is a standard protocol to assess cortisol secretion in humans. In this test, IV administration of ACTH causes a rapid and transient increase in plasma cortisol and aldosterone.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1470320317717883" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Application of the IV ACTH challenge in the ASEB study enabled additional assessment of the selectivity of LY3045697 on AS, including any effect on the precursors of aldosterone and cortisol (11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, and 11-deoxycortisol, respectively).</p><p>In both studies, LY3045697 or placebo was administered as an oral solution in degassed Sprite. To maintain the blind, a double-dummy design was implemented in the ASEB study in which all subjects received either LY3045697 or placebo oral solution and either spironolactone or placebo capsule on each dosing day.</p><p>Evaluations in both studies included clinical safety and tolerability, vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1470320317717883">Supplementary Material</ext-link> for calculation)), pharmacokinetics and exploratory pharmacodynamics, including Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> renal excretion and plasma concentrations of aldosterone (PACs) and cortisol, and their steroidogenic precursors (11-deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone; and 11-deoxycortisol respectively) in both stimulated (post intravenous ACTH challenge in study ASEB) and unstimulated (basal; studies ASEA and ASEB) states. Blood pressure was assessed as part of safety evaluations, as well as multiple times over each of Day 3 and 7 in the ASEB study, from which mean arterial pressure was calculated. Pooled urine was collected from 4-24 h after dosing in the ASEA study and used to quantify the amount of excreted aldosterone as a measure of target engagement (reduction of aldosterone synthesis). In the ASEB study, urine was collected and pooled over 24 h on Days 3 (from pre-dose day 3 to pre-dose day 4) and 7 (from pre-dose Day 7 to pre-dose Day 8) and evaluated for the amount of urine aldosterone excreted.

It offers the potential for added efficacy through reduction of non-MR related aldosterone effects, and can circumvent anti-androgenic selectivity issues associated with current MR antagonists. However, this mode also comes with its own challenges, including selectivity for CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthesis route) relative to CYP11B1 (cortisol synthesis route), and uncertainty regarding the magnitude of hyperkalemic effect. The studies discussed herein comprehensively probed the pharmacology of the potent AS inhibitor LY3045697, its selectivity for CYP11B2 relative to CYP11B1, and its impact on serum and urine K<sup>+</sup>, uncovering interesting facets of the dynamics of AS inhibition.</p><p>LY3045697 is a potent and highly effective AS inhibitor, as evident by suppression of PAC to below the limit of quantitation in both ACTH-stimulated and unstimulated states at doses as low as 0.1 mg. These results confirm that AS is the primary, if not the only, de novo synthesis route of circulating aldosterone.</p><p>Selectivity of AS (CYP11B2) inhibitors against the highly homologous CYP11B1 enzyme is of key importance to therapeutic utility, due to the detrimental effect on the body&#x02019;s natural response to stress via inhibition of cortisol synthesis. By design, LY3045697 is a potent inhibitor of AS with 39-fold less in vitro potency for CYP11B1 (data on file at Lilly). The results from these studies clearly demonstrate selectivity for AS in humans, as LY3045697 resulted in some blunting of cortisol response to ACTH challenge at doses that are 2&#x02013;3 orders of magnitude higher than those demonstrating significant aldosterone blunting. Since the inhibition of cortisol production did not reach a maximum, precise estimation of the IC<sub>50</sub> for CYP11B1 is not possible from these data. Therefore, the relative in vivo selectivity (i.e. IC<sub>50</sub> ratio) cannot be estimated. Nonetheless, it is clear that LY3045697 demonstrates a CYP11B2/CYP11B1 selectivity in vivo that is consistent with the in vitro data. Thus, a wide range of LY3045697 doses with high AS inhibition can be administered with little risk of blunting cortisol production.</p><p>This level of selectivity far exceeds that of LCI699. In Na<sup>+</sup>-depleted healthy volunteers, LCI699 decreased both plasma and 24-h urinary aldosterone in a dose-dependent manner. In these subjects, the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-challenge test inhibited ACTH-stimulated aldosterone elevation at all three doses (0.5, 1 and 3 mg) of LCI699. However, the compound also significantly inhibited ACTH-stimulated cortisol production and induced accumulation of the cortisol precursor, 11-deoxycortisol, at the higher dose of 3 mg.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1470320317717883" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In a study of patients with primary hypertension, LCI699 was dosed for eight weeks at 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, and 1 mg once daily, as well as 0.5 mg twice daily (BID).

In this population, we found no evidence of reduction in blood pressure by LY3045697 relative to placebo, which is likely due to the fact that blood pressure is normal to begin with. Spironolactone also failed to show a reduction.</p><p>LY3045697 actions result in perturbation in the K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis, likely secondary to its aldosterone reducing effect. LY3045697 increases basal K<sup>+</sup> in a time and dose/concentration dependent manner, with a negligible effect after the first dose, reaching up to a maximum of 5.3 mmol/l after seven days of treatment at the top dose of 100 mg. Upon repeat dosing, the magnitude (E<sub>max</sub>) of K<sup>+</sup> rise increases. The PK/PD model predicts a maximum drug effect of 0.8 mmol/l increase in basal K<sup>+</sup> on Day 8, and an LY3045697 EC<sub>50</sub> (achieving half maximum response) of 4.3 ng/ml. The steady state for serum K<sup>+</sup> effect of LY3045697 cannot be deduced due to relatively short treatment duration of the ASEB study. Average K<sup>+</sup> levels after the oral K<sup>+</sup> challenge (Day 7) were also higher for LY3045697-treated subjects in a dose and concentration-dependent fashion. The maximum magnitude of difference from placebo was estimated to be 0.58 mmol/l, which is similar to the magnitude of the increase in basal K<sup>+</sup> predicted by the model (0.7 mmol/l). The potency (EC<sub>50</sub>) by which LY3045697 increases basal and post- challenge serum K<sup>+</sup> is also similar. Collectively, this suggests that LY3045697 increases basal K<sup>+</sup> while having a negligible effect on the acute response to K<sup>+</sup> ingestion. This effect of LY3045697 on K<sup>+</sup> is to be expected given the normal inter-regulatory relationship between aldosterone and K<sup>+</sup>. An LY3045697 dose of 1 mg is roughly equipotent to 25 mg of spironolactone with respect to the effect on K<sup>+</sup> after the oral K<sup>+</sup> challenge, which was administered close to the expected peak levels of both drugs. In contrast, 50 mg spironolactone showed a marginal effect on basal (unstimulated) K<sup>+</sup> measured at trough drug levels prior to dosing. Of note, the 25 mg dose of spironolactone is considered low, as doses as high as 200 mg or more are used in practice. A comparison of LY3045697 effect on K<sup>+</sup> relative to LCI699 cannot be made, due to the different populations and experimental conditions of the studies in which this has been assessed for the two compounds.</p><p>The dynamics of aldosterone reduction in single vs repeated dosing and in the presence and absence of ACTH stimulation provides interesting insights into the regulatory interrelationship between aldosterone and K<sup>+</sup>. The reduction in unstimulated PAC was rapid and observed at the first post-dose time point (4 h). The relationship between LY3045697 and PAC showed no clear evidence of hysteresis, indicating a nearly direct PK/PD relationship. The within-day time course of PAC was not measured with great frequency, hindering the ability to discern a rapid hysteresis. However, if a hysteresis exists, its magnitude is minor. In a system where drug effect is on the input rate of aldosterone production, a near direct PK/PD relationship is consistent with rapid equilibration of PAC upon inhibition of production, which suggests a rather fast aldosterone clearance rate, consistent with previously reported rapid disappearance half-life of radiolabeled aldosterone of only 35 min.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1470320317717883" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>The analyses provided herein uncovers an interesting phenomenon, where the concentration of LY3045697 needed to reduce PAC in the unstimulated state are much smaller after first LY3045697 administration compared to repetitive daily dosing, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1470320317717883">Figure 7</xref>.

Thus, our expectation was that corticosterone levels would drop as a result of LY3045697 inhibition of AS (and CYP11B1 at much higher concentrations). However, the opposite was inexplicably observed.</p><p>The phenomenon of time-dependent potency reduction (IC<sub>50</sub> increase) may be explained by the fact that serum K<sup>+</sup> levels slowly increased upon daily dosing. Potassium is a known potent stimulator of aldosterone production, independent of its effects on the renin-angiotensin system.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1470320317717883" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-1470320317717883" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> An increase in the amount of active AS or its substrate would naturally require a higher LY3045697 concentration to inhibit aldosterone production. We observed a few-fold increase in the aldosterone precursors, corticosterone and 11-deoxycortecosterone on Day 7 just prior to LY3045697 dosing, as would be expected from the inhibition of their conversion to aldosterone by AS, but only at the 10 and 100 mg doses. However, the increase would not seem adequate to explain the drop in potency also observed at lower doses of LY3045697 where precursor levels were not elevated. Therefore, it is more likely that a significant increase in AS enzyme activity occurs over days of dosing with the AS inhibitor LY3045697.</p><p>Of note, the studies and conclusions reported herein are limited by two factors. First, the studies are conducted in healthy volunteers, and the translation of the conclusion to therapeutic contexts in patient populations should be made with caution. Second, the studies were small in size, typical of phase one studies.</p><p>In summary, LY3045697 demonstrated potent inhibition of AS at doses that are highly selective relative to activity toward CYP11B1 and, therefore, LY3045697 is a cortisol sparing AS inhibitor. Doses of LY3045697 in the 0.1&#x02013;1 mg range would be expected to provide complete blunting of the aldosterone response with a K<sup>+</sup> elevation response significantly lower than that of low dose spironolactone. This relationship between the effects on aldosterone and K<sup>+</sup> is likely inherent to the AS inhibition regardless of the inhibitor, as the K<sup>+</sup> response is secondary to changes in aldosterone levels. In contrast to spironolactone, LY3045697 has potential to potently reduce both MR-mediated and non-MR mediated aldosterone effects, without anti-androgenic adverse effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supplementary_Material.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1833" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1470320317717883"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
