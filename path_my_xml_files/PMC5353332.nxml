However, only a small percentage of eligible patients are recruited to clinical trials in many institutions that promote clinical trial participation.</p><p>A significant proportion of non-trial participation is explained by patient refusal.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Reasons for trial refusal by eligible patients include concerns regarding experimentation and uncertainty and loss of control over treatment decisions. Even when patients agree to participate, they frequently do not understand basic components of the trial that they have consented to enter.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In the UK Jenkins <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> audiotaped discussions between oncologists and patients during which consent was being obtained for a randomised clinical trial. In most, the concept of the trial was introduced by describing uncertainty about treatment decisions. The word randomisation was mentioned in 51 consultations (62.2%). The median duration of &#x02018;consent&#x02019; interviews was &#x0003c;15&#x02005;min and most patients signed the consent document at the first consultation at which the clinical trial was discussed.</p><p>Brehaut <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> argue that the existing approach to obtaining informed consent for clinical research may be improved by using decision aids. Juraskova <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> reported successful piloting of a decision aid to assist women considering participation in a breast cancer prevention trial. Spiegle <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> performed a systematic review to identify alternative types of decision support interventions (DSIs) for cancer treatment and a meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of DSIs compared with patient decision aids. The study showed that the effectiveness of other DSIs, including question prompt list (QPLs) and audio recordings of the consultation, is similar to patient decision aids. This finding is important because less complex DSIs such as a targeted QPL may be all that is necessary to achieve similar outcomes as patient decision aids for cancer treatment. QPLs have been shown to increase question asking in patients with cancer.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>The Quality of Informed Consent questionnaire (QuIC) was designed to measure participants' actual (objective) and perceived (subjective) understanding of cancer clinical trials. Joffe <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> derived 13 independent domains of informed consent and wrote one or more questions to measure participants' objective and subjective understanding of their clinical trials. After feedback from pilot testing and input from expert panels, the QuIC was sent to adult patients with cancer enrolled in phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials. Test&#x02013;retest reliability was good, as was face and content validity. The QuIC took an average of 7.2&#x02005;min to complete.</p><p>Joffe <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> reported the use of the QuIC to measure the quality of understanding among 207 cancer clinical trial participants in Boston who had signed a clinical trial consent form a median of 16&#x02005;days earlier. Almost half of the consent discussions had lasted 1&#x02005;hour. The consent form was signed a median of 6&#x02005;days after the initial discussions about the trial and a quarter signed during the first consultation. There was considerable variation in the proportion of correct answers across individual questions in the QuIC.</p><p>Bergenmar <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> used the QuIC to survey 282 patients who had been informed in Swedish about a phase 2 or phase 3 trial and had signed a consent form. The patients were asked about the duration of the consent discussion. Thirty-nine patients (14%) reported the duration of the consent discussion was &#x0003c;15&#x02005;min, 139 patients (50%) responded between 15 and 30&#x02005;min, and 50 patients (11%) between 45 and 60&#x02005;min. The proportion of correct responses to the 16 items applicable to all patients, irrespective of trial phase was presented. High levels of knowledge (&#x0003e;80%) were found for seven items, and five items were responded to correctly by 50&#x02013;80% of the patients. In total, &#x0003c;50% responded correctly to four items, namely risks related to the trial, the unproven nature of the trial and issues about insurances in connection to participating in the trial.</p><p>We used the QuIC to survey patients with cancer in Sydney and Melbourne who had been approached to participate in a clinical trial. The mean score on part A of the QuIC among 100 patients studied in Sydney was 76.8.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In 72 patients with cancer studied in Melbourne, the median objective knowledge score was 77.6/100, and perceived (subjective) understanding (QuIC part B) score was 91.5.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Some questions were answered particularly poorly. Higher knowledge score (QuIC part A) was associated with English as a first language. Calculation of the summary score questions included is presented in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/93/2/139.full">http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/93/2/139.full</ext-link>. This also shows the questions that are not scored for particular phase trials.</p><p>We developed a targeted QPL for clinical trials in order to identify questions which might facilitate patient participation in clinical trial discussions with their oncologist and clinical trial nurse.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> We conducted a series of focus groups with patients with cancer and their carers. The focus groups were audio-taped and transcribed. The transcripts were analysed using rigorous qualitative methodology. The final draft of the QPL was pilot tested to evaluate content validity, and acceptability and perceived efficacy in satisfying information needs about clinical trials needs and achieving involvement preference using a sample of 10 patients with cancer considering participation in a phase 3 clinical trial at each of the participating institutions. The clinicians, oncologists and clinical research nurses were encouraged to endorse and refer to the QPL during their discussion. Feedback from these patient/clinician cohorts informed the final version of the clinical trial QPL. The final version of the clinical trial QPL used in the randomised trial includes 51 questions grouped under 10 headings is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016012666F1">figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016012666F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Questions you may wish to ask your doctor about clinical trials.

Patients were randomised by opening a numbered blank envelope containing the treatment group allocation: to receive or not receive the clinical trial QPL. Patients in the control group continued their discussion with the oncologist/research nurse about the clinical treatment trial. Patients randomised to receive the clinical trial QPL had at least a few minutes to review it before continuing discussion with their oncologist and/or clinical research nurse about the cancer trial proposed. During this latter discussion the clinicians specifically referred to the QPL and encouraged patients to review the list of questions. Thus participants were not blinded to intervention assignment; however, data entry personnel were blinded. There was no control of QPL exposure time nor was the time documented. There was no researcher control of items in the QPL raised by the patient or clinician.</p><p>After the decision about cancer treatment clinical trial participation, and within 3&#x02005;weeks, patients were asked to complete the QuIC<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and questionnaires measuring anxiety,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> their satisfaction with the consent discussion and decision making<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and achievement of their information and involvement preferences.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Clinician satisfaction with the informed consent process was measured using an adapted form of an existing seven-item scale measuring physician satisfaction with the decision-making process<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>

measured by the QuIC. The percentage of patients in the control arm completing the QuIC was significantly reduced compared with the intervention group (p=0.02). There was a trend towards lower knowledge scores (QuIC part A) in the intervention group compared with control (p=0.08). The reason for this is unknown. Patients in the control group who actually completed the assessment achieved favourable results. We hypothesise that those in the control group who comprised 28 of 43 patients in the control arm constituted a self-selected cohort of patients who were more engaged in the clinical trial process.</p><p>We have no information about the duration of the consent interviews in our trial, but it is likely that use of the clinical trial QPL extended the consent interview by a few minutes. Patients only had the QPL for a few minutes before continuing with the clinical trial consent discussion so the &#x02018;dose&#x02019; of the QPL may be low, and therefore not effective. Physician endorsement of QPL use by the patient in other contexts has been an important contributor to the efficacy of QPLs.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> As QPLs have previously demonstrated benefit, it may have been these exposure and endorsement factors that prevented efficacy of the clinical trial QPL in this instance.</p><p>The patients in our trial all consented to participate in the informed consent trial at the first consultation when trial participation was sought. This finding differs from the experience reported by Joffe <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> where the consent form for the treatment trial was signed a median of 6&#x02005;days after the initial discussion about the trial, and only 28% consented at the first consultation. There is great variation in the interval from considering participation in a clinical trial to consenting to enrol in the trial. We do not know when patients consented to participate in the cancer treatment trial but patients were asked to complete the QuIC within 3&#x02005;weeks after the decision about cancer trial participation had been made.</p><p>Stryker <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> studied the factors associated with informed consent, patient satisfaction, and decisional regret in 87 patients who were eligible to participate in 12 selected phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials. They found that patients who enrolled in clinical trials quickly, may not believe they fully understand the implications of trial participation and ultimately regret their decision to participate. However, there was no relationship between timing of consent and decisional regret.</p><p>Limitations of the study include the low accrual rate, the imbalance in completion of the QuIC in the randomised groups and the brief exposure to the clinical trial QPL. Future studies of clinical trial question prompt lists should document the duration of the consent interview, the time taken for consent to be given, and consideration of when is the optimal time for patient understanding of their clinical trial to be sought.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Professor Martin Stockler and Professor Val Gebski who were members of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MHNT substantially contributed to the conception and design of the work and contributed in drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content, and approved the final version published; the agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.
