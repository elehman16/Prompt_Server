However, the risk of major stroke is very high for only the first few days after TIA and minor ischaemic stroke, and observational studies show substantially greater benefits of early medical treatment in the acute phase than do longer-term trials. We hypothesised that the short-term benefits of early aspirin have been underestimated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Pooling the individual patient data from all randomised trials of aspirin versus control in secondary prevention after TIA or ischaemic stroke, we studied the effects of aspirin on the risk and severity of recurrent stroke, stratified by the following time periods: less than 6 weeks, 6&#x02013;12 weeks, and more than 12 weeks after randomisation. We compared the severity of early recurrent strokes between treatment groups with shift analysis of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. To understand possible mechanisms of action, we also studied the time course of the interaction between effects of aspirin and dipyridamole in secondary prevention of stroke. In a further analysis we pooled data from trials of aspirin versus control in which patients were randomised less than 48 h after major acute stroke, stratified by severity of baseline neurological deficit, to establish the very early time course of the effect of aspirin on risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke and how this differs by severity at baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>We pooled data for 15&#x02008;778 participants from 12 trials of aspirin versus control in secondary prevention. Aspirin reduced the 6 week risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke by about 60% (84 of 8452 participants in the aspirin group had an ischaemic stroke <italic>vs</italic> 175 of 7326; hazard ratio [HR] 0&#x000b7;42, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;32&#x02013;0&#x000b7;55, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001) and disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke by about 70% (36 of 8452 <italic>vs</italic> 110 of 7326; 0&#x000b7;29, 0&#x000b7;20&#x02013;0&#x000b7;42, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001), with greatest benefit noted in patients presenting with TIA or minor stroke (at 0&#x02013;2 weeks, two of 6691 participants in the aspirin group with TIA or minor stroke had a disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke <italic>vs</italic> 23 of 5726 in the control group, HR 0&#x000b7;07, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;02&#x02013;0&#x000b7;31, p=0&#x000b7;0004; at 0&#x02013;6 weeks, 14 <italic>vs</italic> 60 participants, 0&#x000b7;19, 0&#x000b7;11&#x02013;0&#x000b7;34, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001). The effect of aspirin on early recurrent ischaemic stroke was due partly to a substantial reduction in severity (mRS shift analysis odds ratio [OR] 0&#x000b7;42, 0&#x000b7;26&#x02013;0&#x000b7;70, p=0&#x000b7;0007). These effects were independent of dose, patient characteristics, or aetiology of TIA or stroke. Some further reduction in risk of ischaemic stroke accrued for aspirin only versus control from 6&#x02013;12 weeks, but there was no benefit after 12 weeks (stroke risk OR 0&#x000b7;97, 0&#x000b7;84&#x02013;1&#x000b7;12, p=0&#x000b7;67; severity mRS shift OR 1&#x000b7;00, 0&#x000b7;77&#x02013;1&#x000b7;29, p=0&#x000b7;97). By contrast, dipyridamole plus aspirin versus aspirin alone had no effect on risk or severity of recurrent ischaemic stroke within 12 weeks (OR 0&#x000b7;90, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;65&#x02013;1&#x000b7;25, p=0&#x000b7;53; mRS shift OR 0&#x000b7;90, 0&#x000b7;37&#x02013;1&#x000b7;72, p=0&#x000b7;99), but dipyridamole did reduce risk thereafter (0&#x000b7;76, 0&#x000b7;63&#x02013;0&#x000b7;92, p=0&#x000b7;005), particularly of disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke (0&#x000b7;64, 0&#x000b7;49&#x02013;0&#x000b7;84, p=0&#x000b7;0010). We pooled data for 40&#x02008;531 participants from three trials of aspirin versus control in major acute stroke. The reduction in risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke at 14 days was most evident in patients with less severe baseline deficits, and was substantial by the second day after starting treatment (2&#x02013;3 day HR 0&#x000b7;37, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;25&#x02013;0&#x000b7;57, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Our findings confirm that medical treatment substantially reduces the risk of early recurrent stroke after TIA and minor stroke and identify aspirin as the key intervention. The considerable early benefit from aspirin warrants public education about self-administration after possible TIA. The previously unrecognised effect of aspirin on severity of early recurrent stroke, the diminishing benefit with longer-term use, and the contrasting time course of effects of dipyridamole have implications for understanding mechanisms of action.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Wellcome Trust, the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p>The risk of recurrent stroke is up to 10% in the week after a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Urgent medical treatment seems to reduce that risk by as much as 80%,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> but many patients delay seeking medical attention, often for several days or weeks, even when they make a correct self-diagnosis.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Public education campaigns, such as the FAST test television campaign, have decreased delays to presentation after major stroke,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> but there has been little improvement in presentation rates after TIA or minor stroke (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 1</xref>).<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> In a recent population-based study in the UK, half of recurrent strokes in the days after a TIA occurred prior to medical attention being sought for the initial event,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and the situation is likely to be worse in many parts of the developing world in which access to emergency services is poor.</p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p>Previous systematic reviews of randomised trials of aspirin versus placebo in secondary prevention after transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or ischaemic stroke reported only a 13% relative reduction in risk of recurrent stroke. Systematic reviews of trials of aspirin in treatment of hospitalised patients with acute stroke also reported a 13% reduction in the short-term risk of recurrent stroke or intracerebral haemorrhage. Yet, observational studies have suggested much more substantial benefits of urgent medical treatment after TIA or minor stroke, with the early risk of recurrent stroke reduced by as much as 80%, and a possible reduction in severity of stroke. The time course of benefit of aspirin had not been studied in randomised trials or in any subsequent systematic reviews. Therefore, we did a pooled analysis of individual patient data from all available trials of aspirin versus control after TIA or ischaemic stroke.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>Our analyses of data from trials of aspirin in secondary prevention after TIA and ischaemic stroke show that the effect of aspirin on risk of early recurrent events has been underestimated. We show substantial reductions in the early risk of all stroke, ischaemic stroke, and acute myocardial infarction. We also found that a major part of the early benefit of aspirin was due to a previously unrecognised reduction in severity of early recurrent ischaemic stroke, resulting in 80&#x02013;90% reductions in the early risk of disabling or fatal recurrent ischaemic stroke after TIA and minor stroke. Although these trials recruited few patients in first few days after TIA or stroke, we found similar reductions in risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke with aspirin in trials of acute ischaemic stroke.</p><p><bold>Interpretation of all available evidence</bold></p><p>Urgent medical treatment substantially reduces the risk of early recurrent stroke after TIA and minor stroke and early use of aspirin is the key intervention.

To inform on possible mechanisms of action, we also aimed to study the time course of the interaction between effects of aspirin and dipyridamole in secondary prevention of stroke. Aiming to more reliably estimate the very early time course of onset of effects of aspirin, we also studied risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke in trials of aspirin in treatment of acute stroke, stratified by severity of the pre-randomisation neurological deficit.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Data selection and extraction</title><p>Trials were eligible if they randomised the following: patients with TIA or ischaemic stroke to regular aspirin (any dose; in the presence or absence of another antiplatelet drug) versus no antiplatelet or anticoagulant in the secondary prevention of stroke and other vascular events; patients with acute ischaemic stroke to regular aspirin (any dose) versus no aspirin, in the presence or absence of another antithrombotic treatment, for acute treatment and prevention of early recurrence; or patients with TIA or ischaemic stroke to regular dipyridamole (any dose) versus no dipyridamole (in the presence or absence of another antiplatelet drug) in the secondary prevention of stroke and other vascular events. With searches done up to Jan 31, 2016, PMR identified trials through searches of the Antithrombotic Trialists' (ATT) Collaboration,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> subsequent systematic reviews, and the Cochrane Collaboration.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In view of the historical nature of the trials, no additional searches were made for ongoing trials or abstracts presented at meetings.</p><p>For all eligible trials of aspirin or dipyridamole in secondary prevention after TIA or stroke, we sought to obtain individual patient data. If these were not available, published data on vascular events were extracted from trial reports. Data were obtained on the following baseline variables: randomised treatment allocation, age, sex, prior diabetes, current smoking, history of hypertension, blood pressure at entry, time from most recent cerebrovascular event to randomisation, nature of the most recent cerebrovascular event prior to randomisation (TIA; &#x0201c;minor&#x0201d; or non-disabling stroke; &#x0201c;major&#x0201d; or disabling stroke), and premorbid disability (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score). Data were also obtained on the nature and timing of the following outcome variables: any recurrent stroke, recurrent ischaemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, intracerebral haemorrhage, fatal extracranial bleeding, and cause of any other deaths. If available, from either electronic or paper records, data were obtained on the severity and outcome of all recurrent strokes (mRS score). There were minor differences in definition of recurrent stroke between trials, but designations made in the original trials were not changed.</p><p>For trials of aspirin in treatment of major acute stroke, we also sought to obtain individual patient data on the severity of stroke at entry (eg, a severity score or other measure of the extent on the baseline neurological deficit) and on time to first recurrent ischaemic stroke during the trial period. In one small trial,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> only data for progression of stroke were collected (defined as a worsening of at least 2 points on the Scandanavian Stroke Progression Scale<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref>). In the absence of any other data, this outcome was included for completeness.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All analyses were by intention to treat based on the randomised treatment allocation. In the secondary prevention trials, we calculated the effects of aspirin versus control and dipyridamole versus control, with stratification by time from randomisation (0&#x02013;6 weeks, 6&#x02013;12 weeks, and &#x0003e;12 weeks), for the following outcomes: recurrent ischaemic stroke, disabling or fatal recurrent ischaemic stroke, any recurrent stroke, any fatal stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and acute myocardial infarction. For each outcome, we calculated odds ratios (OR) for each trial and pooled estimates by fixed-effects meta-analysis (Mantel-Haenszel-Peto method) if there was no significant heterogeneity (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test) between trials. In the absence of significant heterogeneity, we pooled individual patient data and generated Kaplan-Meier curves (1&#x02013;proportion free of event) for time to first event. Statistical significance of any effect of randomised treatment allocation was determined using the log-rank test stratified by trial and hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were generated for events up to 12 weeks follow-up using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by trial (the assumption of proportional hazards was violated if events after 12 weeks were included). We compared the severity of early recurrent strokes between treatment groups based on mRS scores with ordinal regression (mRS shift) analysis. The assumption of proportional odds was assessed with the score test and was valid (p&#x0003e;0&#x000b7;3) for all analyses. However, we also calculated ORs for the traditional single cutoff point of an mRS score of higher than 2. Stratified analyses of the preventive effect of treatment on recurrent ischaemic stroke and on disabling or fatal recurrent ischaemic stroke were also done for the following potential effect modifiers: dose of aspirin (&#x0003c;100 mg [low] <italic>vs</italic> &#x02265;300 mg [high]), TIA or minor stroke only versus major stroke (usually defined as the presence of residual neurological signs) at baseline; time from last TIA or minor stroke to randomisation (&#x02264;14 days <italic>vs</italic> &#x0003e;14 days), age (&#x0003c;65 years <italic>vs</italic> 65&#x02013;74 years <italic>vs</italic> &#x02265;75 years), sex, diabetes, current smoking, and hypertension (prior diagnosis or blood pressure &#x02265;160/90 mm Hg at baseline assessment <italic>vs</italic> none).</p><p>In trials of aspirin for acute stroke, we determined the effect of aspirin versus control on risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke. Trials differed in duration of randomised treatment allocation (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 3</xref>). To maximise comparativeness between the trials, we first determined the effect of aspirin up to day 14 after randomisation, stratified by the severity of the stroke at the baseline assessment. In the two largest trials, data for the extent of baseline neurological deficit had been collected in the same way, with documentation of the presence or absence of neurological deficits of the following types: face, arm or hand, leg or foot, dysphasia, visuospatial, brainstem or cerebellar, hemianopia, and other. We quantified the severity of stroke as follows: mild (&#x02264;2 deficits), moderately severe (3&#x02013;4 deficits), and severe (&#x02265;5 deficits). A third smaller trial had quantified baseline severity of stroke using approximate quartile categories of the Scandinavian Stroke Progression Scale<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> score (&#x0003c;9, 10&#x02013;11, 12&#x02013;13, and 14&#x02013;25). The distribution of severity that most closely matched that in the other two trials was: mild (&#x0003c;9), moderately severe (10&#x02013;14), or severe (14&#x02013;25). We calculated ORs for the effect of aspirin on the 14 day risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke for each trial, with stratification by severity of initial stroke. Pooled estimates were obtained by fixed-effects meta-analysis (Mantel-Haenszel-Peto method) if there was no significant heterogeneity (p&#x0003e;0&#x000b7;05 on &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test) between trials, or otherwise by random-effects meta-analysis. To determine the time course of onset of effect of aspirin in the acute phase, we did a pooled analysis, stratified by time from randomisation to recurrent ischaemic stroke (days 0&#x02013;1, 2&#x02013;3, 4&#x02013;6, 7&#x02013;14, and &#x02265;15).

Three trials with comparisons of aspirin plus dipyidamole versus no antiplatelet were included in the any aspirin versus control analyses described above.

Data for recurrent vascular events within 12 weeks of randomisation were obtained for all of these trials. Adding dipyridamole to aspirin had no effect on the 12 week risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke (OR 0&#x000b7;90, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;65&#x02013;1&#x000b7;25, p=0&#x000b7;53; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 11</xref>), with no heterogeneity between trials (p<sub>het</sub>=0&#x000b7;31), and had no effect on severity of recurrent ischaemic stroke within 12 weeks of randomisation (mRS shift analysis OR 0&#x000b7;90, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;37&#x02013;1&#x000b7;72, p=0&#x000b7;99). However, adding dipyridamole to aspirin did reduce the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke after 12 weeks (OR 0&#x000b7;76, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;63&#x02013;0&#x000b7;92, p=0&#x000b7;005), particularly the risks of disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke (0&#x000b7;64, 0&#x000b7;49&#x02013;0&#x000b7;84, p=0&#x000b7;0010) and any disabling or fatal stroke (0&#x000b7;65, 0&#x000b7;51&#x02013;0&#x000b7;84, p=0&#x000b7;0008). Dipyridamole versus control also had no effect on severity of 12 week recurrent ischaemic stroke in the ESPS-2 trial (mRS shift analysis for any dipyridamole <italic>vs</italic> control OR 0&#x000b7;98, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;58&#x02013;1&#x000b7;66, p=0&#x000b7;95; dipyridamole only <italic>vs</italic> control OR 1&#x000b7;11, 0&#x000b7;59&#x02013;2&#x000b7;09, p=0&#x000b7;74).</p><p>Given the small numbers of patients randomised within 7 days of their last event in the trials of aspirin in secondary prevention after TIA or stroke, we studied the time course of risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke in trials of aspirin in treatment of acute stroke, in which all patients were randomised within 48 h of stroke onset. Among three eligible trials (40&#x02008;531 participants, <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 8</xref>), individual patient data were available from the two largest (40&#x02008;090 participants) and tabular data from the smaller trial (441 participants). The effect of aspirin versus control on the 14 day risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke differed in relation to the severity of stroke (p<sub>het</sub>=0&#x000b7;014), as indicated by the extent of the baseline neurological deficit (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 9</xref>). Aspirin reduced the 14 day risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke in participants with mild neurological deficits at baseline, with a consistent effect across the trials, but had no effect in those with severe deficits at baseline (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 9</xref>). In participants with moderately severe deficits, there was a significant overall reduction in risk, but there was heterogeneity between trials (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 9</xref>). There was no interaction (p=0&#x000b7;92) between the effect of aspirin on recurrent ischaemic stroke and randomisation between heparin and no heparin in the IST (data not shown). On pooled analysis of recurrent ischaemic stroke in patients with mild and moderately severe initial deficits, no effect of aspirin was found within the first 24 h (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>) after randomisation, but risk was reduced by day 2 (HR 0&#x000b7;44, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;25&#x02013;0&#x000b7;76, p=0&#x000b7;0034) and day 3 (0&#x000b7;31, 0&#x000b7;16&#x02013;0&#x000b7;58, p=0&#x000b7;0003), with further reductions during days 4&#x02013;6 (0&#x000b7;45, 0&#x000b7;31&#x02013;0&#x000b7;67, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001) and days 7&#x02013;14 (0&#x000b7;64, 0&#x000b7;45&#x02013;0&#x000b7;91, p=0&#x000b7;0121), but not after 14 days (0&#x000b7;86, 0&#x000b7;58&#x02013;1&#x000b7;27, p=0&#x000b7;45; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>). Results were similar after inclusion of 3292 (21%) participants in IST who had received aspirin during the days before randomisation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>). Of note, allocation to continued aspirin in this group did reduce the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke in the first 24 h (HR 0&#x000b7;31, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;11&#x02013;0&#x000b7;85, p=0&#x000b7;020).</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our analyses of trials of aspirin in secondary prevention after TIA and ischaemic stroke show that the effect of aspirin on early recurrent events has been underestimated. We identified substantial reductions in the early risks of all stroke, ischaemic stroke, and acute myocardial infarction with aspirin, with effect sizes greater than those previously reported after unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> We also found that a major part of the early benefit of aspirin was due to an hitherto unrecognised reduction in severity of early recurrent ischaemic stroke, resulting in up to a 90% reduction in early risk of disabling or fatal recurrent ischaemic stroke after TIA and minor stroke.</p><p>However, trials of aspirin for secondary prevention recruited few patients in the acute phase after TIA or stroke. We found no significant diminution of the effect in patients randomised early, but acute effects might differ. For example, aspirin had no effect on death for the first 3 days after acute myocardial infarction in the ISIS-2 trial.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> We therefore studied trials of aspirin in treatment of acute stroke, aiming simply to estimate the time course of onset of effect of aspirin on risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke, with the overall balance of risk and benefit having been documented elsewhere.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> With use of stratification by severity of the baseline neurological deficit, we showed that in patients with less severe stroke the relative reduction in risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke on aspirin was similar to that in the secondary prevention trials and was evident by the second full day of treatment. Aspirin could also have reduced further thrombosis, or related processes, in patients with more major stroke, but such effects would probably be less clinically evident in the territory of an already large cerebral infarct.</p><p>Our results have implications for acute treatment after TIA and minor stroke. First, they confirm findings from previous non-randomised studies for the impact of urgent treatment on the early risk of recurrent stroke,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> supporting recommendations for urgent assessment of patients. Second, they suggest that most of the benefit of urgent treatment in these previous multi-intervention studies was simply due to aspirin. Therefore, it is essential that patients with TIA or minor stroke are not sent home from the emergency department with advice to add aspirin to their next prescription; they should be treated acutely. Similarly, patients who telephone their family doctor or advice lines should be told to take aspirin immediately if TIA is suspected, in addition to obtaining medical attention. Aspirin could also be given by paramedics when they assess patients at home. Third, we showed that aspirin reduced early recurrent stroke in non-anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation at baseline.</p><p>Our findings also have implications for the choice of antithrombotic treatment early after TIA or ischaemic stroke. Most guidelines do not distinguish between the early and later phases of secondary prevention and several recommend clopidogrel monotherapy or other drugs as equal alternatives to aspirin.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Our findings suggest that treatment in the first few days and weeks should include aspirin unless some other antithrombotic agent is shown to be superior. We found that dipyridamole monotherapy was inferior to aspirin in prevention of early recurrent stroke, and that addition of dipyridamole to aspirin did not enhance the effects of aspirin on risk or severity of early recurrent ischaemic stroke. Clopidogrel plus aspirin does appear to be more effective than aspirin alone in prevention of early recurrent stroke after TIA and minor ischaemic stroke,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> but has no effect on severity of stroke,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> and the only trial of clopidogrel monotherapy versus aspirin plus dipyridamole in this patient group reported data that, in light of our findings, suggest increased severity of early recurrent stroke in the clopidogrel group.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Indeed, although the PROFESS trial showed no difference in overall severity of recurrent stroke on aspirin plus dipyridamole versus clopidogrel in secondary prevention after TIA and ischaemic stroke,<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> our findings suggest that risk and severity of early recurrent stroke might have been reduced by aspirin plus dipyridamole in patients who were randomised soon after their initial TIA or stroke, such that the early effects of aspirin would not already be lost after prolonged pre-randomisation use. Diminishing benefit of aspirin with longer pre-randomisation use would also explain why the advantage of aspirin plus clopidogrel compared with clopidogrel alone in the MATCH trial was only seen in patients randomised early after their TIA or stroke,<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> and possibly why previous observational studies of severity of ischaemic stroke in relation to previous aspirin use have yielded conflicting results. Similar considerations will apply to trials of cilostazol, ticagrelor, and future novel anticoagulants in secondary prevention of stroke. In fact, survival curves in trials of aspirin versus cilostazol suggest that aspirin is superior for the first 3 months, but cilostazol is more effective thereafter.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Future trials of new antiplatelet or antithrombotic drugs in prevention of early recurrent stroke should report data for severity of stroke and should avoid mixing patients taking aspirin with those taking other antiplatelet drugs in the comparator arm.</p><p>Our findings also have implications for public education. First, confirmation that urgent treatment after TIA and minor ischaemic stroke reduces the early risk of disabling or fatal stroke by about 80% highlights the need to reduce delays in patients seeking medical attention. Second, since aspirin is available in many households, consideration should be given to promoting self-administration immediately after transient stroke-like neurological symptoms, as is recommended for people who have acute chest pain.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Intracranial haemorrhage is rare in patients with TIA symptoms and accounts for less than 5% of minor strokes.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Moreover, randomised trials of antithrombotic drugs that have included patients with acute intracranial haemorrhage have not shown any increase in risk of death or of recurrent haemorrhage.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> Similarly, there is no evidence that prior aspirin would worsen outcome in the small proportion of patients who still subsequently progressed to have a major stroke and required thrombolysis or thrombectomy.<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Indeed, given the substantial reductions in progression to disabling or fatal early recurrent ischaemic stroke that we noted with aspirin, prevention of the need for thrombolysis or thrombectomy will be the main benefit. Public education should continue to persuade people with transient unfamiliar neurological symptoms to seek medical attention immediately, where this is possible, but self-administration of aspirin would also be prudent, particularly in rural settings or in less developed countries where access to emergency services might be delayed. Some individuals would take an aspirin or two unnecessarily, as is the case with non-cardiac chest pain, but others would benefit.</p><p>For longer-term secondary prevention after TIA and ischaemic stroke, aspirin had no significant effect on risk or severity of recurrent ischaemic stroke after 12 weeks. However, early benefit of aspirin was maintained on longer-term follow-up, even though no additional benefit accrued. More detailed analyses of trials in a broader range of secondary prevention settings, and including all relevant outcomes, are underway to establish the longer-term balance of risk and benefit (Rothwell PM, unpublished), and new trials should determine the risk and benefits of stopping aspirin. The absence of additional benefit after 12 weeks does, however, necessitate re-interpretation of trials of long-term secondary prevention of stroke with other antithrombotic drugs versus aspirin that have shown either no benefit of the other drug<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> or only a small benefit.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> The interpretation that these drugs are as effective as aspirin is less positive if aspirin is ineffective.</p><p>We found no evidence that adding dipyridamole to aspirin reduced the risk or severity of early recurrent ischaemic stroke. However, dipyridamole plus aspirin versus aspirin alone did reduce the risk of later recurrent ischaemic stroke and this effect was particularly marked for disabling or fatal events. Further work is required to fully understand the nature of this late effect in the trials that we studied here and in the PROFESS trial.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref></p><p>Our results do have limitations. First, the trials of aspirin in secondary prevention were done in the 1980s and 1990s. Medical care has since changed, with more detailed investigations and more intensive lowering of blood pressure and lipids. However, the effect of urgent treatment after TIA and minor stroke that was observed in more recent observational studies<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> is very similar to that in the previous trials (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 2</xref>). Changes in medical care would also impact less on the effectiveness of prehospital self-administration. Second, most patients in the secondary prevention trials were already beyond the very early high risk period after their initial TIA or minor stroke when recruited.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> However, delayed inclusion is likely to have underestimated the absolute reduction in risk of early recurrent stroke, as might the absence of a loading dose in the trials of low-dose aspirin, but relative risk reductions are likely to be generalisable to the acute phase. The absolute reduction in risk of ischaemic stroke in the EXPRESS study in which patients were treated more acutely was about 8% (number needed to treat 12; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 2</xref>).<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> We did not find a reduction in recurrent ischaemic stroke during the first 24 h in trials of aspirin in the acute treatment of major stroke (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>), but early deterioration after major stroke is multifactorial and recurrent stroke is difficult to distinguish from progression of existing pathological processes. There was no evidence of a delay in onset of benefit of acute treatment after TIA and minor stroke in observational studies in the acute phase.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Third, some patients in the trials of aspirin in secondary prevention were treated with aspirin or other antithrombotic drugs for a short time after their initial TIA or stroke, prior to inclusion. However, we found no evidence that such treatment influenced the effect of subsequent randomised treatment, either in the SALT trial (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 5</xref>), which had a short on-treatment run-in, or in the other secondary prevention trials (data not shown). However, prior aspirin use was associated with benefit within the first 24 h in the IST trial (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>). Finally, we did not report data on whether non-compliance with trial treatment might explain the diminishing longer-term benefit of aspirin. However, preliminary analyses show little evidence of this (Rothwell PM, unpublished) and compliance was clearly sufficient to show the late benefits of dipyridamole plus aspirin versus aspirin alone.</p><p>Our findings raise questions about the mechanisms by which aspirin reduces the risk and severity of early recurrent ischaemic stroke and by which effectiveness diminishes with longer-term use. It is unusual for preventive treatments to reduce the risk of disabling stroke more than non-disabling stroke, which might suggest a neuroprotective effect of aspirin, possibly due to prostaglandin-mediated effects on the microvasculature.<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> However, the similarly large reduction in the early risk of myocardial infarction suggests reversal of short-term systemic platelet activation. The loss of benefit of aspirin in longer-term use is at odds with the maintenance of platelet COX-1 inhibition,<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> although time-course data on bleeding time are less clear-cut.<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> It is possible that aspirin is only clinically effective during periods when platelets are activated, or that platelets adapt to aspirin via upregulation of non-COX-mediated pathways, or that gradual acetylation of other proteins affects other important pathways.<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref></p><p>In conclusion, we show the validity of previous non-randomised studies that reported the considerable impact that medical treatment has on the early risk of recurrent stroke after TIA and minor ischaemic stroke and we have identified aspirin as the key component. It is essential that aspirin is given to patients with suspected TIA or minor stroke immediately. Indeed, a case can be made for public education about self-administration after transient unfamiliar neurological symptoms. The previously unrecognised reduction in severity of early recurrent ischaemic stroke by aspirin has important implications for clinical guidelines, interpretation of previous and future trials, and for understanding mechanism of action. More generally, our findings highlight the fact that to understand the effects of newer drugs in comparison to, or in combination with, older drugs, it is first necessary to fully understand the effects of the older drug.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group
