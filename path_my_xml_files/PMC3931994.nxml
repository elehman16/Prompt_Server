Although the majority of patients with COPD are in the early stages, little attention has been paid to them, in particular regarding to early intervention. Tiotropium bromide can significantly relieve symptoms and reduce the incidence of acute exacerbations of COPD. Therefore, we hypothesise that therapy with tiotropium bromide will benefit patients with COPD with early-stage disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Method/analysis</title><p>A randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre clinical trial (Tiotropium In Early COPD study, Tie-COPD study) is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term intervention with tiotropium in patients with COPD with early-stage disease. A total of 839 patients with COPD who satisfied the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a once daily inhaled capsule of either tiotropium bromide (18&#x02005;&#x003bc;g) or matching placebo for 2&#x02005;years. Measurements will include forced expiratory volume in 1&#x02005;s, health-related quality of life, grade degree of breathlessness related to activities, COPD exacerbations and pharmacoeconomic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics/dissemination</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University.

Using the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) standard, the prevalence of COPD may be as high as 4&#x02013;10% worldwide in adults 40&#x02005;years and older.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Worldwide, there has been increasing morbidity and mortality associated with COPD over the past few decades, and COPD is predicted to rise from the sixth leading cause of death in 1990 to the third in 2020 and to rank as the fifth largest economic burden among diseases in 2020.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Better medications and more aggressive intervention strategies have been used to manage COPD, but patients at later stages of the disease have shown poor responses to such treatments, associated with high mortality, incidence of rehospitalisation and disability, which causes a burden both for the families of patients and society.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Currently, data show that the annual rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in 1&#x02005;s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) in patients with COPD with GOLD stages I&#x02013;II is more rapid than those with GOLD stages III&#x02013;IV.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> The DIMCA study showed that early intervention with fluticasone in participants with objective signs of obstructive airway disease resulted in significant health gains at relatively low financial cost.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Therefore, we hypothesise that there may be more beneficial effects if the patients receive routine treatment at an earlier stage of the disease.</p><p>Tiotropium bromide is the first once daily long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator with selective action against M<sub>3</sub> receptors on bronchial smooth muscle cells.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> It has a good safety profile and most of its undesirable effects can be assigned to its anticholinergic properties.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Previous studies indicate that tiotropium significantly relieves air flow restrictions in patients with COPD and results in improvements in spirometry, dyspnoea, exercise tolerance and health-related quality of life.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Subgroup analyses of UPLIFT indicate that tiotropium was able to reduce the annual decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> among patients with GOLD stage II and patients who had not received any maintenance medication for COPD before enrolling in UPLFT.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Therefore, it would be of great significance for COPD treatment if we could demonstrate that tiotropium improves lung function, decreases lung function decline and reverses disease progression in patients with early-stage COPD after long-term intervention with maintenance treatment. However, there is no large-scale clinical trial on long-term intervention with tiotropium bromide in patients with early-stage COPD (ie, GOLD stages I&#x02013;II COPD).</p><p>On this basis, we designed a trial entitled &#x02018;Tiotropium in Early Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients in China (Tie-COPD)&#x02019;. It is a 2-year randomised, double-blinded, placebo controlled, parallel, multicentre clinical trial in China to study early intervention with tiotropium.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a 2-year, multicentre, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial of maintenance treatment with once daily tiotropium for patients with early-stage COPD. Screening (visit 0) was undertaken within 7&#x02005;days before randomisation (visit 1) to assess eligibility and collect baseline data. Patients who satisfied the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive tiotropium bromide (18&#x02005;&#x003bc;g once daily inhaled) or placebo. Patients have an appointment 1&#x02005;month after randomisation (visit 2), at 3&#x02005;months (visit 3) and then every 3&#x02005;months until study drug termination (2&#x02005;years). After that, a 1-month follow-up period is scheduled. The data collected at each visit will include a patient diary, a symptom score assessment (modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC)), an assessment of quality of life (COPD assessment test (CAT) and COPD clinical questionnaire (CCQ)), results of a physical examination, documentation of adverse events, a record of medication administration, exacerbation, smoking status, documentation of medical expenses and so on. Self-reported smoking status is recorded at each visit too. Pulmonary function tests will be conducted at the first monthly visit and then every 6&#x02005;months thereafter. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013003991F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> is a trial procedures flow chart.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2013003991F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Clinical trial design.

The majority of them are symptom-free or have very slight symptoms. Most of them were recruited from the community through a population survey for COPD. Before recruitment, active smokers were advised to discontinue smoking and were offered a smoking cessation programme as counselling sessions, patient education and supportive literature in the survey. After the survey, usually 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;months, patients with COPD at GOLD stages I and II were recruited, informed about the study and the benefit of smoking cessation again. After obtaining written informed consent, screening (visit 0) was undertaken.</p><p>The inclusion criteria include a clinical diagnosis of COPD, presence or absence of respiratory symptoms, age between 40 and 85&#x02005;years, with or without smoking history, a maximal postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC&#x0003c;70% and FEV<sub>1</sub>&#x02265;50% predicted and the ability to participate in study-related auxiliary examinations.</p><p>Patients will be excluded if they have had a respiratory infection or an exacerbation in the 4&#x02005;weeks prior to screening, frequent use of glucocorticosteroids orally or intravenously (prednisone &#x0003e;10&#x02005;mg/day). Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, active pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonectomy or those who have a blood eosinophil count &#x02265;600/mm<sup>3</sup> will also be excluded.

The department of labelling and packaging will execute the allocation concealment according to a blind code provided by the statistical participants while the investigators enter the patients and allocate the number in increasing order. The block randomisation method will be applied in this trial and the blind code will be generated by a statistician from Rundo International Pharmaceuticals Research &#x00026; Development Co, Ltd. with SAS V.9.2.2. According to the blind code provided by the statistician, the allocation concealment will be completed at the labelling place. Emergency envelopes for accidents will be prepared for emergency unblinding and will be retained by investigational sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Concomitant medication and treatment</title><p>Because the majority of participants enrolled are symptom-free or have very slight symptoms, in principle, the long-term concomitant application of bronchodilators and other COPD medications with the exception of the drugs under investigation should be avoided during the screening phase and the treatment phase of the study. Long-term concomitant medication except for the investigational drugs could be allowed as prescribed if it is clinically necessary or if it has been initiated before the recruitment of the patient in question. For COPD exacerbations, an ipratropium bromide metered-dose inhaler could be applied if needed, or medical intervention could be applied according to the GOLD guideline for no longer than 2&#x02005;weeks (see online supplementary table S1; concomitant medication and treatment).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Measures</title><p>Regular follow-ups with physical examination and symptom score documentation will be conducted after the first month and then once every 3&#x02005;months thereafter.

A patient diary will be dispensed at every visit and retrieved at the next visit. The diary should be reviewed by the investigator together with the patient. In case any adverse event or exacerbation is defined by the investigator, relevant documentation should be made in the case report form. The patient diary should cover daily used investigational drugs, medication prescribed for COPD exacerbation (rescue drugs, antitussives, expectorants, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and antibiotics), contacting healthcare providers, duration of illness and lost working days (see online supplementary table S2; flow chart).</p><sec id="s2e1"><title>Spirometry</title><p>Pulmonary function testing will be conducted at the flow-up visit in the first month and then every 6&#x02005;months.

Pulmonary function parameters will include FEV<sub>1</sub>, FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC. Manoeuvres are performed in triplicate, although up to five forced expiratory manoeuvres are obtained in an effort to achieve three acceptable efforts. The highest acceptable FEV<sub>1</sub> and the highest FVC each obtained on any of three blows meeting the ATS/ERS criteria constitute the data for that test set.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e2"><title>Exacerbations of COPD</title><p>Information on exacerbations of COPD will be recorded in the patient diary and collected at all visits.

The duration of hospitalisation is defined as the days from admission to discharge from the hospital. The interval between COPD exacerbations is defined as the days between the previous exacerbation event and the next event.</p><p>Severity of COPD exacerbations are categorised as mild, moderate and severe according to the following definitions: mild: adding other commonly used COPD medications at home without making outpatient hospital visits or being hospitalised; moderate: resulting in outpatient visits or emergency room visits and modification of a regimen which may include the use of antibiotics and/or systemic glucocorticosteroids; and severe: resulting in hospitalisation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e3"><title>Quality of life</title><p>Quality of life will be assessed at all visits by patients at outpatient visits with designated patient record questionnaires, the CAT and the CCQ.

The investigator/institution will permit trial-related monitoring, auditing, IRB/IEC review and regulatory inspection and will be providing relevant inspectors with direct access to all related source data/documents. The principal investigator should ensure that adequate training and updated information or notifications have been delivered to study-relevant personnel, including physicians and nurses. Data from the study will be documented in CRFs at the termination of the study and then entered into the database with blinded design for data checking and reviewing. All of the documents relevant to patient information should be kept in the database and kept confidential according to the relevant laws and regulations. The quantity of the retrieved investigational drug (capsules) should be recorded in the case report form. Administration of 80&#x02013;120% of the predicted use of the investigational drug will be considered to be good compliance.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The sample size has been calculated with regard to the primary endpoint. Patients with mild-to-moderate COPD (GOLD stages I&#x02013;II) will form the relevant patient group for this study. From the UPLIFT mega trial, it is known that patients with COPD with GOLD stage II had an estimated difference of 100&#x02005;mL in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> after 2&#x02005;years (SD 350&#x02005;mL) between the tiotropium and control group.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Assuming a significance level of 5% and a power of 90% to detect a difference in trough FEV<sub>1</sub>, approximately 260 patients per treatment group will be required. Assuming a 35% patient dropout rate of patients, then 400 patients will need to be randomised to each group.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Therefore, the overall sample size required for the study is 800 patients.</p><p>Only the primary endpoint will be tested in a confirmatory way. All secondary endpoint analyses will be exploratory and the results will have to be interpreted in a descriptive manner. The difference between the two treatment groups in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> and peak FEV<sub>1</sub> at 1, 6, 12 and 18&#x02005;months will be compared using an analysis of variance with repeated measurements. The comparison of annual decline rates in FEV<sub>1</sub>, FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC between groups will be analysed using a random coefficient regression model based on the presumption that efficacy changes linearly with time. The annual rate of decline will be expressed using the regression coefficient of the model. The mMRC data will be described and compared by transfer form both before and after treatment. Repeated measures analysis of variance will be used in the CCQ and CAT data assessment. The time to first COPD exacerbation will be assessed by comparison of curves from different treatment groups via Log rank test. Group description will be applied in the assessment of interval, duration and severity of COPD exacerbations. The application of rescue medication will be analysed with Fisher's exact test, while further describing the relief-related information such as frequency of drug use. The number of acute exacerbations and severe acute exacerbations will be compared between the two groups with the use of Poisson regression with correction for treatment exposure and overdispersion. Time and cost of hospitalisation due to COPD will be described by grouping, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be applied for intergroup comparison when necessary. The analysis plan will be specified in detail in a separately prepared Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) prior to database lock.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Recruitment into the Tie-COPD trial started in November 2011 and ended in October 2013, with 839 patients (104% of target enrolment) randomised, one-third of whom are patients with GOLD stage I.

This study will be the first large-scale long-term intervention in patients with early COPD, in particular the symptom-free patients with COPD, aimed at exploring an efficient and safe approach to attenuate or even reverse the progression of COPD.</p><p>Currently, there is no precise definition of early-stage COPD. Previous studies have included patients with stage 0 COPD, categorising them as those who need earlier medical intervention. However, this strategy has not as yet been supported by concrete evidence. It has been recognised that GOLD stage 0 is not equivalent to early-stage COPD.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Based on currently available clinical evidence, we define the early-stage COPD as GOLD stages I&#x02013;II.</p><p>As reported in China, the proportion of patients with GOLD stages I and II (mild and moderate) COPD is 70.7% of the patient population and most of them are undertreated.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Although most of these patients, especially those with stage I, have few symptoms and nearly normal spirometry (ie, a relatively preserved FEV<sub>1</sub>), it has been found that active small-airway inflammation and significant V<sub>A</sub>/Q abnormalities existed in these patients.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref> It has also been confirmed that patients with COPD with GOLD stage I have a remarkable loss of small conducting airways when compared with healthy controls, which may increase peripheral airways resistance.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Furthermore, the rate of decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> is more greatly accelerated in the early stages (stages I&#x02013;II) of COPD than the more severe stages (stages III&#x02013;IV), which has been validated in the TORCH and the UPLIFT studies.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> That is to say that patients with the lowest FEV<sub>1</sub> had the lowest rate of decline, and vice versa. The research of Scanlon showed a similar result.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Therefore, if the decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> is faster in the early-stage disease, then early intervention may be necessary and reasonable in the prevention of progressive pulmonary function decline.</p><p>Traditionally, smoking cessation was thought to be the only therapy that could influence mortality and the progression of the disease by reducing the rate of decline of FEV<sub>1</sub>.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> As pharmacotherapy for COPD has developed in the last decade, outcomes of patients with COPD have improved substantially with the availability of long-acting agonists (LABAs), fixed-dose combinations of ICS and LABAs, and long-acting muscarinic antagonists. The traditional concept on the basis of ICS research that pharmacotherapy does not affect the progression of COPD<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;28</xref> had been challenged by observations from some large clinical trials. As exacerbations are considered to influence the decline in FEV<sub>1</sub>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> some large-scale studies such as TORCH and UPLIFT strongly supported the contention that these pharmaceuticals could affect the progression of COPD by reducing the exacerbation rate. Reduction of the annual rate of decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> was discovered in a post hoc analysis of the TORCH study.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The annual rate of decline of FEV<sub>1</sub> in the three groups, LABAs, ICS and the fixed combination of these drugs, decreased by 13, 13 and 16&#x02005;mL, respectively, when compared with controls.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In the UPLIFT study, treatment with tiotropium also hinted at how to slow the decline rate of FEV<sub>1</sub> in patients who did not take concomitant medication.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Although the TORCH and UPLIFT studies focused on more severe patients with COPD, because of the relatively large numbers of patients with GOLD stage II, they had sufficient power to allow subgroup analysis that supported the efficacy of early intervention. In the TORCH study, it was discovered that the improvement in postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>, reduction in the annual rate of decline of FEV<sub>1</sub> and exacerbation rate of patients with GOLD stage II treated with the fixed combination product were slightly but significantly higher than in the case of patients in severe stages of disease.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Some subgroup analyses from the UPLIFT study also support these concepts. One analysis by Decramer <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> showed that in patients with GOLD stage II, tiotropium not only increased prebronchodilator (100&#x02013;118&#x02005;mL) and postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> (52&#x02013;81&#x02005;mL), but also reduced the rate of decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> compared with controls. Another analysis of the UPLIFT study also suggested that in patients who had not taken any maintenance medication before, treatment with tiotropium not only increased prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> and improved the health-related quality of life, but also reduced the rate of decline of FEV<sub>1</sub> and that approximately 60% of the patients in that subgroup analysis were patients with GOLD stage II disease.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A prospective study showing that treatment with 18&#x02005;&#x003bc;g of tiotropium once daily for 12&#x02005;weeks improved FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC in patients with mild-to-moderate COPD, when compared with placebo, also supported the concept.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> This evidence implies that treatment with tiotropium may slow the progression of COPD in its early stages. Tiotropium is most likely beneficial to patients with COPD in early stages, as well as to those with disease in the more severe stages.</p><p>However, most of these encouraging data have come from subgroup analyses of large long-term studies, and the outcomes of the subgroup analysis were not the primary outcomes in these studies. Furthermore, most of the patients in the aforementioned studies were symptomatic patients. As many patients with COPD in early stages are asymptomatic, they could not be representative of the average patients with early-stage disease encountered in general practice. And for long-term treatment of early-stage COPD, the cost effectiveness of treatment is also an important issue, which was not addressed in these studies. Therefore, further longitudinal studies are required to confirm the clinical relevance of these discoveries.</p><p>The Tie-COPD study has been designed for this reason. In long-term clinical trials, the most critical methodological challenge is to determine the primary outcome variable. Although there are many disadvantages to using FEV<sub>1</sub>, as it is non-invasive, repeatable and accessible, it has been chosen as the primary outcome variable in the Tie-COPD trial. Premature patient withdrawals must also be considered in trial design and analysis. The discontinuation rate generally increases with the study duration in long-term trials. Discontinuations are usually higher in the placebo group. The placebo group discontinuation rate in ISOLDE, EUROSCOP and UPLIFT ranged from 30% to 53%.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> As with the protocol of UPLIFT, we have estimated a 35% discontinuation rate in our study to ensure that it will be adequately powered to enable evaluation of the primary outcome.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In order to reduce the dropout rate, we will conduct scheduled health education for patients, including smoking cessation, benefit of early intervention and health consultation, etc. Meanwhile, we will establish a good relationship with the participants, and supervise them through unscheduled telephone follow-up.</p><p>The majority of participants enrolled are symptom-free or have very slight symptoms, and the mere presence of respiratory symptoms or a gradually reduced lung function is insufficient reason for patients to seek medical help.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> So most of the patients came from population screening for COPD in the community. In the population survey, we had suggested to active smokers to discontinue smoking and offered them a smoking cessation programme. After the survey, patients who satisfied the eligibility criteria were recruited. They will be advised to quit smoking at each visit. However, in order to avoid the confounding effects of smoking cessation, we will not provide special smoking cessation intervention. According to Hurst <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> up to 22% of patients in GOLD stage II can be considered frequent exacerbations. So there were still some moderate patients with COPD with a history of exacerbations from hospital enrolled in the study. They may not at present be identified for interventions to reduce exacerbations and may get more benefit from the intervention.</p><p>In summary, the Tie-COPD trial will provide an opportunity to explore the effect of once daily inhaled tiotropium in patients with COPD in early-stage disease. The data gathered may not only shed new light on the long-term intervention with long-acting bronchodilators such as tiotropium in early-stage patients with COPD, but may also provide a basis for early detection of patients with COPD. At present, recruitment of patients has been completed. Results are anticipated in 2016.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e149" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003991.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e150" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003991.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The Tiotropium in Early Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (Tie-COPD) trial would like to thank Paul Chen (Medical advisor, respiratory Medical affairs manager of Boehringer Ingelheim Int'l Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd) and Tong Ming (Clinical Research Manager of Rundo International Pharmaceuticals Research &#x00026; Development Co., Ltd) for their time and input.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> NZ, PR and YZ conceived the original idea for the study.
