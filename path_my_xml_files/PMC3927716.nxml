This study is the first randomised placebo-controlled trial undertaken to investigate the effect of regular daily paracetamol on asthma severity in adult patients with asthma. It was powered to detect a one doubling dose change in PC<sub>20</sub> methacholine bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR). Markers of airways inflammation and systemic immunological responses were monitored to provide insight into possible mechanisms of action. The hypothesis was that regular paracetamol use would result in a worsening in BHR and asthma control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study design was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial based in Wellington, New Zealand.

The paracetamol and placebo tablets were supplied by Aspen Asia Pacific Ltd, Sydney, Australia. All participants were instructed to avoid taking other forms of paracetamol (including over-the-counter remedies containing paracetamol) or NSAIDs for the duration of the study.

A screening visit (visit 1) was held approximately 1&#x02005;week prior to baseline and consisted of a medical history and brief physical examination, pregnancy test where applicable, bronchodilator reversibility testing, liver function screen and allergy skin prick tests (see online supplementary for details). A diary was used to record morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF) values (prior to asthma medication use) for 1&#x02005;week prior to the second visit.

Baseline assessments of FEV<sub>1</sub> were undertaken using a micro medical microlab spirometer (Micro Medical, Kent, UK) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) was assessed using a NiOX Flex chemiluminescence analyser (Aerocrine AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Methacholine (Methapharm, Ontario, Canada) challenge testing was undertaken via the 2&#x02005;min tidal breathing dosing protocol recommended by the ATS,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> as outlined in the online supplementary. Participants who met all the eligibility criteria were then dispensed a 6-week supply of randomised medication, a medication diary to record administered doses and a prescription for codeine phosphate for emergency pain relief during the trial period. These participants then underwent blood tests including full blood count (eosinophils), total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) and serum cytokine levels (interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3;, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13; see online supplementary for details).</p><p>At visits 3 and 4, 6 and 12&#x02005;weeks after baseline, FEV<sub>1</sub>, ACQ, FeNO and blood tests were repeated and medication compliance checked via pill count and medication diary check (see online supplementary for details). At the third visit, participants were given a further 6-week supply of study medication, a second medication diary and a diary to record morning and evening PEF values in the final intervention week. At the fourth and final visit, BHR testing was repeated.

Blood eosinophil, serum IgE and serum cytokine (IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13) levels were measured at 6 and 12&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The primary analysis method was analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The logarithm base two PC<sub>20</sub> for methacholine at 12&#x02005;weeks was the primary response variable, with the baseline logarithm base two PC<sub>20</sub> as a covariate and a categorical variable for the paracetamol group. The difference in logarithm base two PC<sub>20</sub> was the doubling dose difference between the two randomised groups. Secondary outcome variables, including FEV<sub>1</sub>, FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted, ACQ score, FeNO, mean morning peak flow and PEF<sub>var</sub> were also analysed by ANCOVA. The distribution of FeNO, serum IgE and eosinophil count was skewed and normality assumptions for these variables were best met on the natural logarithm scale.</p><p>The proportion of participants with at least one asthma exacerbation was compared as an absolute risk difference, with an appropriate CI, because in the event there were no asthma exacerbations in one of the randomised groups, and as a result a relative risk could not be calculated. Simple t tests were used to compare mean values for ALT by randomised group. FeNO, eosinophil count and IgE were logarithm transformed because of skewed distributions, and the difference in logarithms was compared by a t test. For those three variables with a logarithm transformation, the exponent of the difference in logarithms is interpreted as the ratio of mean values.</p><p>The analysis was by intention to treat randomised participants who passed the final eligibility screening and as a result received randomised treatment. Randomised participants who failed the final eligibility screen did not receive randomised treatment or undergo any outcome assessments. For each individual analysis, a two-sided p value of 0.05 was used, with 95% CIs for each estimate.

However, the results did not rule out a clinically significant effect, with the 95% CI containing the prespecified difference of one doubling dose reduction in PC<sub>20</sub>. There were no significant differences observed in any of the prespecified secondary outcome variables of asthma control, inflammatory or immunological markers.</p><p>This is the first reported randomised placebo-controlled trial of the effects of the use of daily paracetamol in stable adult asthma. The only other published randomised controlled trial of paracetamol and asthma was the Boston University Fever Study.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Children randomised to the ibuprofen group had a reduced risk of having an outpatient visit for asthma during the 4-week study period (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.95) compared with children in the paracetamol group. Because the study did not include a placebo treatment, it was not possible to determine whether the observed difference in morbidity according to treatment group was attributable to an increased risk with paracetamol or a decreased risk with ibuprofen.</p><p>There are several methodological issues relevant to the interpretation of our study findings. First, as enshrined in the Declaration of Helsinki<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> there is a requirement to study the least vulnerable populations wherever applicable. Most, but not all, of the putative adverse effects of paracetamol on asthma have been shown in observational studies of children and suggest that paracetamol may increase the risk of developing asthma.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, as there is some data to suggest that regular paracetamol use may lead to a deterioration in asthma control in adults,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> we opted to first examine the effects of paracetamol in adults with stable asthma.</p><p>Second, this trial was powered to determine whether there was an effect on BHR of at least one doubling dose reduction in PC<sub>20</sub> MCh. Our ability to achieve the designated sample size completing the study was affected by several factors. First, despite a rigorous recruitment campaign during which over 700 patients were screened, due to the inclusion and exclusion criteria employed to ensure participant safety, only 94 screened participants were dispensed randomised medication. Second, variability in PC<sub>20</sub> from baseline to week 12 was larger than anticipated, with a pooled SD of 2.27 doubling doses compared with that used in the sample size calculation based on an SD of 1.9, derived from previous studies.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Another factor that affected the study power was the requirement to randomise participants prior to their final screening visit in order to allow the pharmacy adequate time for dispensing at visit 2, following final determination of eligibility. If the participant failed this final eligibility, the randomised medication was not dispensed, the participant was withdrawn from the study and the randomisation code was not reused. By chance, this resulted in a disparity between the proportion of participants receiving active and placebo study medication. The power was reduced further due to the withdrawal of 10% of participants after randomised treatment was dispensed. As there is an uncertain association between observed variables and missing BHR data in these participants, it was not possible to perform a robust imputation.</p><p>Compliance was high when measured via pill count, and although less than half of participants in the paracetamol group had measurable levels of paracetamol in the blood at the times tested throughout the study, this is likely to be due to the laboratory cut-off for a detectable paracetamol level (30&#x02005;&#x003bc;mol/L). Following a 1&#x02005;g dose, participant blood levels may fall below this laboratory cut-off level in as little as 3&#x02005;h (given a paracetamol half-life of 2&#x02005;h and a peak plasma concentration 1&#x02005;h after administration of 80&#x02005;&#x003bc;mol/L<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The use of this laboratory cut-off for paracetamol levels meant that it was not possible to investigate medication compliance through this method.</p><p>Our 12-week dosing period was chosen based on evidence that regular, long-term use of paracetamol is associated with an increased risk of asthma in adults<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref>

These concerns were based on a previous clinical trial of paracetamol in which the incidence of ALT elevations more than three times the upper limit of normal in healthy participants taking 4&#x02005;g/day for 14&#x02005;days was 31&#x02013;44%.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Our results showed no clinically significant liver function derangement with paracetamol administered at a dose of 2&#x02005;g/day for 12&#x02005;weeks.</p><p>While the study did not demonstrate a statistically significant effect of paracetamol on BHR to MCh, the results do not rule out a clinically significant effect, with the upper 95% CI of a 1.28 doubling dose worsening in BHR containing the prespecified difference of one doubling dose. Furthermore, our point estimate of a reduction in PC<sub>20</sub> of 0.48 of a doubling dose could potentially be of major public health significance. As proposed by Mitchell,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> a small shift to the left of the BHR curve in a population could lead to a relatively large increase in the prevalence of severe asthma. Relevant to the interpretation of our findings it has recently been calculated that a one half doubling dose increase in BHR increases the prevalence of moderate and severe BHR by about 30%.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Likewise, although the 9% increase in FeNO with paracetamol was not statistically significant, a change of this magnitude is considered clinically significant.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> For FEV<sub>1</sub>, the point estimate was consistent with a lower value in the paracetamol group, however, the difference was of uncertain clinical significance and was associated with wide CIs.</p><p>No significant effect was seen on serum IgE or peripheral blood eosinophil levels. It was not possible to undertake any meaningful analysis of the cytokine measurements due to the low numbers of participants with detectable levels, and as a result we were unable to determine whether paracetamol influenced the Th1/Th2 balance. Another less recognised potential mechanism of action, which was not directly assessed in this study, relates to neurogenic inflammation of the airways through the stimulation of the transient receptor potential ankyrin-1 cation channel by <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-<italic>p</italic>-benzoquinoneimine, the metabolite of paracetamol.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> This pathway, which is activated following therapeutic doses of paracetamol, mediates a non-eosinophilic inflammatory response and has been implicated in the pathogenesis or provocation of asthma by isocyanates, aldehydes, cigarette smoke and chlorine.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></p><p>Our findings provide information on which the design of further studies could be based. A trial of similar design, utilising the same duration and dose of paracetamol and with BHR testing to MCh as the primary outcome variable, based on the SD derived from this study, would require a sample size of approximately 650 to attain adequate power to detect a difference of 0.5 doubling doses. Alternatively, a study of short-term use of paracetamol at higher doses could be undertaken, to more closely replicate the common use of paracetamol for relief of fever or pain in self-limited illnesses. Based on our findings, a sample size of 140 would be adequate to determine a 0.5 doubling dose difference in MCh BHR, and a 10% increase in FeNO, in a short-term study of crossover design. Important issues with the design of such a study are the duration of the treatment periods and the crossover period. It would be important if possible to include a placebo rather than ibuprofen arm, as NSAIDs may have the potential to both cause NSAID-induced bronchospasm, as well as reducing asthma severity with long-term use.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Finally, our study investigated the effect of paracetamol on asthma severity and not whether paracetamol has a role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Testing this hypothesis would require clinical trials of the effect of paracetamol use in pregnancy on the development of asthma in childhood and the effect of paracetamol use in infants and older children and subsequent asthma risk. Such studies would raise ethical and practical issues regarding consent and the use of placebo for the management of pain or fever during pregnancy and in young children. However, given the common usage of paracetamol in all age groups including pregnancy and the global burden of asthma, we propose that randomised controlled trials are required to determine the effect of paracetamol use on the development of asthma in infancy and early childhood.</p><p>In conclusion, this study has shown no significant effect of 12&#x02005;weeks of treatment with paracetamol at half the maximum therapeutic daily dose on BHR and asthma control in adults with well-controlled asthma. While this outcome provides some reassurance that regular paracetamol use has no marked deleterious effect in adult asthma, further adequately powered studies are needed before the safety of paracetamol for patients with asthma is assured. Furthermore, the study findings do not preclude an effect of paracetamol on the development of asthma in infancy, childhood or adult life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e238" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004324.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e239" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004324.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> SJI and RB contributed to study planning, study conduct, data analysis and manuscript preparation.
