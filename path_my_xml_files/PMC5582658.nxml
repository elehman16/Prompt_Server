This study, a randomized controlled trial, aims to demonstrate a clinically significant improvement in subacute and chronic otitis media with effusion through the administration of hyaluronic acid associated with hypertonic solution compared with the administration of hypertonic solution alone. The setting was an outpatient clinic of 20 primary care pediatrician offices affiliated with the 3 Local Health Units (Azienda Sanitaria Locale) of Naples. <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>. The study was conducted for 6 months, from October 2014 to the end of March 2015. The study saw the participation of 20 pediatricians who were experts in pneumatic otoscopy, each of whom enrolled 15 children. Each investigator was randomized to carry out the treatment with 3% hypertonic solution or high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid + 3% hypertonic solution. <italic>Results</italic>. A total of 275 children were enrolled, of whom 11(equal to 4% ) were lost to follow-up. A total of 264 children completed the trial according to the protocol, 120 in the hyaluronic acid + hypertonic solution group and 144 in the hypertonic solution group. Hyaluronic acid associated with hypertonic solution and hypertonic solution alone administered by nasal lavage have proven to be safe and effective in the treatment of prolonged otitis media with effusion (initial score of &#x02212;0.5, final score of 0.9, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 001, for the hypertonic + hyaluronic acid group; initial score of &#x02212;0.3, final score of 0.2, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001, for the hypertonic solution group). Though starting from a less favorable initial clinical score (&#x02212;0.5 vs &#x02212;0.3, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .016), hyaluronic acid associated with hypertonic solution resulted in a significant increase in clinical healing (0.9 vs 0.2, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001). One interesting outcome was the significant reduction in the consumption of drugs (cortisone and antibiotics) during the follow-up.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>otitis</kwd><kwd>hyaluronic acid</kwd><kwd>hypertonic solution</kwd><kwd>clinic score</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-2333794X17725983"><title>Background</title><p>Otitis media with effusion (OME) is defined as an endotympanic effusion without signs of acute inflammation. OME may develop as a result of acute otitis media (AOM) or without any chronological correlation with an infectious episode.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2333794X17725983" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The prevalence of OME is at its peak in the early years of life and in the winter period, reaching values equal to 8% to 9% of children aged 5 to 12 years.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2333794X17725983" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> It is the main cause of hearing loss in childhood. The main risk factors of OME include age; the risk of persistence of OME following AOM is inversely correlated with age, and children who have experienced their first episode of AOM before 2 months of life are at increased risk of OME compared with those who have their first episode of AOM later on. Other risk factors are feeding with artificial milk, allergy, socioeconomic status, and the attendance of children&#x02019;s communities.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2333794X17725983" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The diagnosis is mainly clinical and otoscopic.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2333794X17725983" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-2333794X17725983" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-2333794X17725983" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American Academy of Otolaryngology Head &#x00026; Neck Surgery<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2333794X17725983" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-2333794X17725983" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> identify pneumatic otoscopy as the most important diagnostic exam.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2333794X17725983" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2333794X17725983" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The complications of OME are typically otological and include AOM due to superinfection of the exudate, eardrum perforation (generally the outcome of repeated episodes of AOM), retraction pockets, atelectasia of the eardrum, and last but not least the risk of conductive hearing loss. In common clinical practice, the first-line treatment of OME is medical therapy. The most widely used drugs include specifically antibiotics, antihistamines, and mucolytic drugs administered per os, together with topical corticosteroids.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2333794X17725983" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-2333794X17725983" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-2333794X17725983" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Despite the widespread availability of various types of drugs for the treatment of OME, to date there is no evidence indicating the certain efficacy of any one of them in the long term. A new therapeutic approach involving the use of hyaluronic acid associated with hypertonic solution could be valid in treating OME.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2333794X17725983" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-2333794X17725983" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-2333794X17725983" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>Hyaluronic acid is one of the fundamental components of connective tissues in humans and other mammals. It gives skin its unique properties of resistance and shape retention. Chemically, it can be defined to be an unsulfonated glycosaminoglycan without a protein core and with an unbranched polysaccharide chain produced by the condensation of thousands of disaccharide units, which are formed in turn from residues of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine, linked together, alternately, by glycosidic bonds &#x003b2;1 &#x02192; 4 and &#x003b2;1 &#x02192; 3 and by intramolecular hydrogen bonds that stabilize the conformations. At physiological pH, the carboxylic groups of the glucuronic acid units are ionized, giving the hyaluronate molecule a high polarity, and consequently a high solubility in water. Thanks to this property, sodium hyaluronate is able to form a complex with many molecules of water reaching a high degree of hydration. High-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid participates in &#x0201c;remodeling&#x0201d; mucous membranes and also has an anti-inflammatory, mucus-regulating activity by improving mucociliary clearance and finally an anti-edematous action. Despite the widespread availability of various types of drugs for the treatment of OME, to date there is no evidence indicating the certain efficacy of any one of them in the long term. In recent times, hyaluronic acid, especially when used in association with hypertonic saline solution, has proven to be an excellent drug for its anti-inflammatory and draining (mucociliar clearance) characteristics and for its ability to protect the mucous membranes in the therapy of OME though pediatric evidence is lacking.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2333794X17725983" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-2333794X17725983" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><sec id="section2-2333794X17725983"><title>Clinical Trial Design</title><p>We conducted a randomized clinical trial, and the purpose of the study was to demonstrate a clinically significant improvement in the administration of hyaluronic acid associated with hypertonic solution compared with the administration of hypertonic solution alone in subacute and chronic OME.

Cycles of 15 days a month of aerosol therapy with nasal lavage were carried out over a period of 3 months with 2 administrations a day in the first month and then a single daily administration (at night before going to bed).
