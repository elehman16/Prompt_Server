The first-line therapy, based on medical treatment combined with laxatives and dietary rules, is often disappointing. Interferential therapy is a new treatment that has demonstrated its efficiency in the treatment of chronic constipation in children and encouraging results in adults. The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of interferential therapy during 8 weeks in adult patients. The secondary objectives are to assess this new and noninvasive therapy in terms of persistence of the clinical efficacy, colonic transit time, ano-rectal manometry, patient satisfaction and quality of life (QoL), and tolerance.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Design: multicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, two-parallel groups study. Setting: nine French adult gastroenterology centers. Inclusion criteria: adult patients with a history of chronic constipation refractory to medical treatment for at least 3 months. Treatment groups: (1) interferential-experimental group (effective stimulation); (2) placebo-control group (sham stimulation). Randomization: 1:1 allocation ratio. Evaluation times: inclusion (T0, randomization), baseline assessment (T1), start of stimulation (T2), intermediary assessment (T3, 4 weeks), end of stimulation (T4, 8 weeks), follow-up (T5 and T6, 1- and 6-month). Endpoints: (1) primary: short-term efficacy at T4 (treatment response defined as three or more spontaneous, complete bowel movements per week); (2) secondary: efficacy at T5 and T6, symptoms (Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms questionnaire), colonic transit time, anorectal manometry, patient satisfaction (analogical visual scale), patient QoL (Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life Questionnaire), side/unexpected effects. Sample size: 200 individuals to obtain 80 % power to detect a 20 % difference in treatment response at T4 between the two groups (15 % of lost to follow-up patients expected).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design is the most appropriate to demonstrate the efficacy of a new experimental therapeutic (Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group classification).

Two subtypes of constipation can be identified: slow transit constipation (STC), characterized by impaired propulsion of stool and due to dysfunction of colonic smooth muscle (myopathy) or its innervation (neuropathy), or both; and evacuation disorders, characterized by difficulty or inability with stool expulsion. They include disorders of the anorectal function, such as dyssynergic defecation, as well as structural disorders, such as rectocele, descending perineum syndrome and rectal prolapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In case of failure, few treatment options are currently available. Surgery can sometimes be discussed for intractable chronic constipation. Indeed, sub-total colectomy can be proposed in case of STC but is associated with a significant morbidity. In case of pelvic floor disorders, a specific surgical treatment can be indicated. However, surgery is invasive and has a significant morbidity, and the results are inconsistent. Recently, some studies have assessed the efficacy of sacral neuromodulation in the treatment of chronic constipation with some success, but this technique is expensive and requires the surgical implantation of a medical device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. More recent works, including a randomized trial, have shown the efficacy of interferential current stimulation in the treatment of chronic transit constipation in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This treatment is used daily, at home, and uses four adhesive surface electrodes, two abdominal (placed below the costal margin) and two paraspinal (placed between T9 and L2), producing two sinusoidal currents crossing the body, 1 h per day for 1&#x02013;3 months.</p><p>To date, only one open-label study has evaluated this technique in adults and has shown encouraging results in 3 months with an efficiency in 7/11 patients (63.6 %) in the number of stools, severity score of constipation and quality of life score associated with a significant improvement in the colonic transit time measured by radiomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These data are of particular interest since laxative treatments are often disappointing, are expensive and may have adverse events.</p><p>These observations prompted us to establish a multicenter, prospective, two-group, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study with the primary objective of assessing the efficacy of interferential therapy during 8 weeks in adult patients with severe chronic constipation. The secondary objectives are to assess this new noninvasive therapy in terms of persistence of the efficacy, colonic transit time, ano-rectal manometry, patient satisfaction and quality of life (QoL), and tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>This multicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-parallel group study is performed to assess the efficacy of the use of interferential therapy: the experimental group (effective stimulation) and control group (sham stimulation).

The device is marketed in France by A-Legrand Co. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.a-legrand.com/">http://www.a-legrand.com</ext-link>). Interferential treatment delivers a 4-kHz carrier frequency, a beat frequency of 80&#x02013;160 Hz and an intensity of less than 33 mA. The stimulation will be done according to the procedure described by Ismail et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This technique uses four adhesive surface electrodes, two abdominal (placed below the costal margin) and two paraspinal (placed between T9 and L2), producing two sinusoidal currents crossing the body. To ensure the proper placement of the electrodes, the first stimulation must be made in the presence of the practitioner. During the 8-week treatment period, the stimulation protocol is home-based and self-applied by the patient for 1 h per day every day.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Recruitment and follow-up</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Screening and inclusion</title><p>During a 2-week observational period, the eligible patients will be asked to report the number of spontaneous, complete bowel movements per week to the physicians (partners of the study) in a bowel diary (T0).

If its effectiveness is demonstrated, it will provide, for the first time, a new noninvasive step for patients with laxative treatment failure before considering surgical treatment. We will use a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, which is the most appropriate design to demonstrate the efficacy of a new experimental intervention in accordance with the Levels of Evidence classification of the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group (Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, table of Evidence Working Group, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=5653">http://www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=5653</ext-link>, May 26, 2015). In the future, national and international recommendations could be updated based on our findings.</p><p>However, some issues related to the content of the protocol study should be discussed.</p><p>A parallel design has been adopted, although an intra-individual crossover design is generally considered to be the most appropriate to assess the efficacy of a new analgesic strategy because of the well-known patient variation in the subjective perception of constipation symptoms. In the crossover study, each subject acts as his/her own control. Several limitations of crossover trials have led us to avoid this design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The crossover design is suitable for patients in stable condition, which is not the case for patients with chronic constipation. Moreover, we suspect that the treatment may have a remnant effect that may alter the response to subsequent treatments inducing that subjects may not be in a comparable condition at the start of each treatment period. Lastly, the crossover design does not allow the assessment of long-term efficacy.</p><p>In the current study, patients receiving the sham device will not feel any stimulation, and they will use the device during a total time of 1 h for 8 weeks. The sham device will be programmed in this way, and its external aspect will not differ from the effective device. Patients with the effective stimulation will feel the stimulation during the whole stimulation period (1 h for 8 weeks). However, since the instructions need to differ between the two patient groups, the practitioner that will give the instructions must absolutely differ from the one who will follow the patients. All patients will be told that they may or may not feel something with the stimulation because people always respond differently to the stimulation. Because only one practitioner will know which device is attributed to the patient, participants will be instructed not to reveal or discuss the type of treatment characteristics they are experiencing with the other practitioner. The other option would have been to use a sham stimulator inducing a short (few seconds or minutes) stimulation before stopping. Our choice is supported by two main reasons: The first reason is to be in accordance with the literature. Indeed, a recent review of the literature on randomized controlled trials about transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation showed that the majority of the studies reported using an inactive device looking identical in appearance to the active one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The second reason is supported by the physiological effect of somato-sympathetic reflexes. Indeed, some studies have demonstrated that stimulating the skin could induce somato-visceral reflexes that can modify visceral functions. Since these activities can be induced by a very short stimulation, it seems that, to be a real control, a sham stimulator should not induce any stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Concerning the patient characteristics, the selection criteria chosen are usual criteria to evaluate a new treatment for chronic constipation defined according to the Rome criteria. However, what can be different from some other studies here is that we choose to include both slow transit constipation (STC), characterized by impaired propulsion of stool, and also evacuation disorders, characterized by difficulty or inability with stool expulsion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although the underlying mechanism is not the same, these two types of constipation are linked. Indeed, slow transit constipation may induce the production of dehydrated and small hard stools that are difficult to evacuate, thus inducing defecatory disorders. In the same manner, in case of evacuation disorders, the ano-colonic reflex is not correctly stimulated, and it can slow down the colonic transit. According to the usual imbrication of these two mechanisms, especially in clinical practice, we choose to include both of these types of chronic constipation.</p><p>The treatment procedure chosen is the same initially described by Chase et al. in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Indeed, to our knowledge, this team is the only one that has published this technique with a very interesting success rate confirmed in a randomized study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The treatment response will be assessed according to both clinical and radiological criteria. The primary criterion chosen is a clinical one and will be the short-term efficacy at 8 weeks defined as the response to treatment. A subject will be classified as a responder when he/she has three or more spontaneous, complete bowel movements per week during the 8 weeks of the trial. This primary end point was chosen considering the last randomized trial on severe chronic constipation published in the New England Journal of Medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. To obtain a complete assessment of the interferential therapy effect, we complement this primary criterion with clinical and radiological efficacy endpoints. In conclusion, the results of this randomized trial are expected to confirm that interferential therapy may be a new noninvasive treatment in chronic constipation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p>At the time of manuscript submission, the status of the trial was &#x02018;not yet recruiting&#x02019;.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANSM</term><def><p>Agence Nationale de S&#x000e9;curit&#x000e9; du M&#x000e9;dicament</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AP-HM</term><def><p>Assistance Publique-H&#x000f4;pitaux de Marseille</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AVS</term><def><p>analog visual scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICH</term><def><p>International Conference on Harmonization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAC-QOL</term><def><p>Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAC-SYM</term><def><p>Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STC</term><def><p>Slow transit constipation.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>Conception and design: VV, AB, PA, KB.
