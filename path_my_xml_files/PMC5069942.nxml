Participants will be randomized to 3&#x000a0;months of BWW or treatment as usual. At the end of the 3&#x000a0;months, participants in the intervention group will have the opportunity to opt-in to an intervention extension arm. Those who opt-in will be randomized to receive an additional 3&#x000a0;months of BWW or no additional intervention. The primary outcome is recovery at 3&#x000a0;months as measured by the Recovery Assessment Scale-revised (RAS-r). Secondary outcomes include symptoms of depression and anxiety measured with the Personal Health Questionnaire-9 item (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-7 item (GAD-7) respectively, quality of life measured with the EQ-5D-5L, and community integration assessed with the Community Integration Questionnaire. Cost-effectiveness evaluations will account for the cost of the intervention and direct health care costs. Qualitative interviews with participants and stakeholders will be conducted throughout.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Understanding the impact of virtual strategies, such as BWW, on patient outcomes and experience, and health system costs is essential for informing whether and how health system decision-makers can support these strategies system-wide.

In Canada, 1 in 5 people are affected by this leading cause of disability, associated with more than $51 billion CAD in annual costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Utilization of mental health care, however, is limited by structural barriers such as specialist availability, geography, time, out-of-pocket costs for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and attitudinal barriers including stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

While these innovative solutions may address some mental health care access issues through components such as anonymity and rapid availability, their advancement and adoption often occurs in the absence of rigorous evaluation and adequate planning for sustainability and spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Studies&#x000a0;evaluating virtual mental health applications have demonstrated conflicting findings, with some trials demonstrating no benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and others demonstrating substantial improvement among participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These conflicting findings illustrate the importance of studying the processes of implementation, including contextual factors, and the mechanisms of action that help to determine whether and how virtual mental health applications have effects on patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although a wide variety of theories and methods are available to focus attention on key issues in the adoption and scale-up of new technologies, these are only recently being applied in large implementation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In the province of Ontario, Canada, the Ontario Telemedicine Network (OTN), a non-profit and government-funded organization, is the largest provider of telemedicine services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In 2015, OTN conducted a selection process to initiate a series of pilot telehomecare interventions for patients with chronic conditions, ultimately choosing to test Big White Wall (BWW) for those struggling with mental health. This manuscript describes the approach to the evaluation of this virtual mental health application within the local health care system in Ontario, Canada.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Virtual care application: Big white wall</title><p>BWW is an internet-based application, built on evidence-based components of mental health care (eg. peer support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], cognitive behavioural therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]) combined in a virtual environment that provides anonymity (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bigwhitewall.com/">www.bigwhitewall.com</ext-link>). BWW offers users access to self-assessment tools, a social network that connects people who have similar problems, and access to on-line courses. The service is monitored at all times by &#x0201c;Wall Guides&#x0201d;, trained mental health professionals (psychiatrists, social workers, and psychologists), ensuring that users are responded to and that the content posted is appropriate and safe. BWW was first developed and implemented within the National Health Service in the UK in 2007, and is now available in the UK, New Zealand, and the USA with over 35,000 users since its inception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. An independent pre-post evaluation of BWW users in the UK over 3&#x000a0;months found that 50&#x000a0;% showed a meaningful reduction in symptoms using validated scales of depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. While more rigorous evaluations of BWW are currently underway, it has not yet been comprehensively evaluated, and not within a Canadian context.</p><p>This protocol outlines a mixed methods study guided by a theoretical approach to examine the implementation of BWW in Ontario. The overall approach taken in this study employs a novel model of integrated knowledge translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], whereby the health system decision makers, implementation leads, and scientific evaluators have been engaged in the development of the research project from the outset. This approach facilitates the assessment of implementation and scalability, and increases the likelihood that results will have a future impact on health system policy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study aims</title><p>This study aims to evaluate whether the intervention, BWW, is acceptable, effective and cost-effective. In addition, the study aims to generate knowledge on the implementation processes and outcomes that will inform future health system decision-making regarding the potential scale-up of this and other mental health virtual care applications in Ontario.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>We hypothesize that access to BWW will increase mental health recovery orientation and reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety among patients seeking specialized mental health care. Further, we expect that a greater response to BWW will be predicted by higher baseline belief in credibility and outcome expectancy of the intervention as well as actual level of engagement with the intervention. The core mechanisms by which we hypothesize BWW to be effective include: 1) enhanced self-efficacy to self-manage mental health conditions through acquisition of knowledge, personal use of tracking tools, and vicarious learning; and 2) rapid access to peer and facilitated support within a constrained health care system leading to a feeling of security and enhanced ability to cope in crisis situations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study setting</title><p>This study is based in Ontario, Canada&#x02019;s most populous province. In Ontario, all physician and hospital mental health care, including outpatient services located in hospitals, are publicly funded under the single-payer provincial health insurance plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Subsidized community services offer some services for free or at a low cost. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] There is also a large network of private inter-professional health providers including social workers, psychologists and registered psychotherapists who provide counselling and psychotherapy for a fee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Third party insurers may offer partial or limited coverage for these services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Due to limited publicly funded services and high costs for private services, public programs have long wait times on the order of months to a year or more, and often provide time-limited treatment only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Although the potential for virtual mental health care platforms within this resource constrained system is apparent, few widely accessible platforms exist, and none with sufficient evidence to warrant their wide scale adoption into clinical practice.</p><p>Within Ontario, three test sites were selected from cities with populations of&#x000a0;approximately 80,000, 150,000, and 2.5 million. These sites include: 1) a community general hospital with inpatient and outpatient mental health services and an emergency department (ED) that sees a high volume of mental health-related visits, 2) a psychiatric hospital with inpatient and outpatient mental health services, and 3) an academic ambulatory care hospital with a large outpatient mental health program. With the exception of the ED, the majority of the clinical programs accept referrals from the community or from within their respective hospital for assessment and management of chronic and/or treatment refractory mental health problems. The third site offers self-referral to some of the treatment programs with the requirement that individuals undergo an extensive intake assessment prior to being formally accepted to the waitlist.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participant eligibility</title><p>Eligible patients are individuals 16&#x000a0;years of age and older who are seeking mental health care at any of the participating sites. Inclusion criteria: 1) able to provide informed consent; 2) able to read in English; 3) able and willing to access the internet, 4) able to navigate an on-line program independently or with minimal assistance; and 5) have or are willing to obtain and use an email address. Exclusion criteria: There are no exclusion criteria but clinicians are reminded that BWW is a peer community and participants need to be able to coherently and respectfully interact with others. As such, we do not recommend individuals with severe psychosis or behavioural disorders be recruited.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Evaluation framework</title><p>The RE-AIM framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] will guide the study of whether and how to scale BWW across Ontario. RE-AIM draws researchers&#x02019; attention to the issues of Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Within this framework, the RCT aims to evaluate reach and effectiveness, and Realist Evaluation will explore adoption, implementation and maintenance. Realist Evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] is growing in international popularity in the health services and policy research community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and is proposed for the evaluation of complex health care interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Realist Evaluation has a number of appealing features for researchers and health system decision makers, as it does not simply provide a binary indication of whether an intervention works or not. Instead, it answers the question, &#x0201c;what works, for whom, under what circumstances&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]?<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The RE-AIM Framework</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12888_2016_1057_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study design</title><p>This study consists of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a nested comparative effectiveness arm to assess the value of intervention extension, with concurrent Realist Evaluation. At enrollment, participants will be randomized to either immediately receive the intervention, BWW (immediate treatment group; ITG) or receive access to BWW after a 3&#x000a0;month waiting period (delayed treatment group; DTG). The DTG will serve as the control group during the first 3&#x000a0;months.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Part 1. Pragmatic randomized controlled trial</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Participants will be recruited at a number of entry or exit points including outpatient clinics and their waitlists, emergency department (ED) discharges, and rapid assessment clinic discharges. Outpatient clinics include youth mental health services (age 16 and over only), adult general psychiatry consultation services (typically serving mood and anxiety disorders), psychotherapy services, post-traumatic stress and trauma therapy services, an outpatient substance use program, and a borderline personality disorder clinic. These recruitment settings were selected because: 1) they serve patients with the potential to benefit from the intervention, 2) they were identified by the participating sites and OTN as high priority settings, and 3) they have high volumes of use and turnover that will allow the implementation organization to reach their recruitment target. With the exception of the ED and rapid assessment clinics, the wait times to access these services vary from 4&#x000a0;months up to 2&#x000a0;years. Participation in the study will not affect wait list position or access to services.</p><p>Potential participants will be approached by a member of the clinical staff either by telephone, or in person in the clinic or ED. Hard-copy pamphlets or a website link to the study information will be provided. Once a potential participant indicates their interest, a research assistant (RA) or research co-ordinator (RC) will either meet them in person or contact via telephone to provide more information and obtain consent. Consent will include: 1) Consent to participate in the RCT (required), 2) Consent to be contacted for a qualitative interview (optional), 3) Consent to provide individual provincial health insurance plan (OHIP) number for linkage of survey data to health administrative data (optional), and 4) Consent for primary care provider to be notified of study enrollment (optional).</p><p>Separate consent to be re-randomized at 3&#x000a0;months will be obtained from ITG participants who opt-in to the nested intervention extension arm of the trial. This will be done with a question posed at the end of the 3&#x000a0;month data collection survey.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Allocation and blinding</title><p>At enrollment, a 2:1 allocation ratio will be used to randomize participants to ITG or DTG. This allocation ratio was chosen to immediately provide the intervention to more participants and increase likelihood of participation. Participants and providers will not be blind to treatment group. Randomization sequences will be generated independently and will be stratified by site and recruitment setting. Allocation sequence will be concealed until after baseline data has been collected to blind those involved in recruiting and consenting procedures. Group allocation will be revealed by phone or email. At t&#x02009;=&#x02009;3&#x000a0;months, ITG participants who opt in to the nested study arm, will be randomized 1:1 to a 3&#x000a0;month BWW extension (ITG-e) or no extension (ITG-n). Group allocation will again be revealed via phone or&#x000a0;email. The nested treatment extension arm will be concealed from participants at enrollment to encourage maximal usage of the intervention during the first 3&#x000a0;months.

This measure captures utilization of physician and hospital services as well as community mental health services. Health administrative data will be used to validate reports of physician and hospital care, however, community service use and non-physician visits are not captured in Ontario data.

Guided by the RE-AIM framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the interviews will focus on different content for each participant group. Interviews with participants will focus on how the patient manages his or her mental health in the community, perspectives of BWW, and how BWW is used in daily life. If the participant&#x000a0;has not engaged with BWW as evidenced by no or very few times logged in, the qualitative interview will include questions about why not, and what alternative strategies the patient uses to manage mental health in the community. Participants will be offered the opportunity to conduct the interviews remotely using personal computer videoconferencing with the option to enable screen sharing of the participant&#x02019;s computer. Alternatively, a telephone interview will be arranged.

At least two researchers will review the transcripts, field and analytical notes independently and meet to develop a code workbook with emergent key themes. If a discrepancy emerges between the two researchers, a third researcher will review and consensus will be achieved.

First, the sample size requested by the funder necessitated broad inclusion criteria which is pragmatic but may present challenges around interpreting efficacy, particularly if no effect of the intervention is observed. We have limited recruitment to treatment settings where BWW is theorized to have the greatest applicability, and will seek to understand through our analysis and qualitative data if particular participant groups respond differently. Second, stakeholder&#x000a0;desire for all participants to receive the intervention within a specific time interval meant that a control arm could not be continued throughout, and necessitated a short follow-up period, which will limit the interpretation of sustained intervention effectiveness. We have included a nested intervention extension arm open to interested participants to pragmatically evaluate the effectiveness of the sustained intervention in a self-selected patient group. Third, the specific intervention, BWW, was selected by the partners and although the process evaluation will seek to determine which components and mechanisms lead to the observed effects, it is uncertain how the findings of the study will be generalizable to other on-line mental health interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p>Mental health recovery through self-management and life fulfillment is a priority across countries around the world in this recovery-oriented era [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].
