Tooth brushing plays an important role in personal oral hygiene and plaque control. Toothbrushes may become heavily contaminated with microorganisms from the oral cavity, environment, hands, aerosol contamination, and storage containers.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Micro-organisms that attaches, accumulate, and survive on toothbrushes may be transmitted to the individual, which in turn can further cause diseases.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>After a single use for duration ranging from 30 s to 4 min, however, toothbrushes may become contaminated by a wide array of bacteria, viruses, yeasts, and fungi, which are present both in the oral cavity and in the external environment.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Prolonged use of the toothbrush facilitates contamination by various micro-organisms such as <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, and <italic>Lactobacilli</italic>. These micro-organisms are implicated to cause dental caries, gingivitis, stomatitis and even infective endocarditis in an individual, affecting both oral and general health.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Microorganisms can remain viable on toothbrush bristles for periods ranging from 24 h to 7 days.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Cobb (1920) reported that the toothbrush to be a cause of repeated infections of the mouth.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Toothbrushes may play a significant role in disease transmission, and increase the risk of infection since they can serve as a reservoir for microorganisms in healthy, medically ill and adults with poor oral health.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Unfortunately, proper care of toothbrush is often neglected and is kept in bathrooms that are a good place to harbor millions of micro-organisms.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Svanberg found that toothbrushes can be heavily infected by mutans streptococci after 24 h. Mutans streptococci cells exist in moist dental plaque that adheres to and can remain on toothbrushes; several studies have focused on toothbrush disinfection methods so far.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Procedures for the decontamination of toothbrushes would prevent the risks of reinfection or infection by other pathogenic microorganisms from the environment.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Over the years, numerous methods of toothbrush sanitization have been put forward, such as exposure to ultraviolet light and microwaves, disinfectant tablets, and immersion in solutions such as Clorox and antimicrobial agents.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Among the chemical agents, chlorhexidine (CHX) gluconate solutions (0.12%) have proved efficient toothbrush disinfection. It has been reported in successfully eliminating microbial species such as <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> within 10 min.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Although various sanitization techniques that have been tried exhibited varying levels of effectiveness, none of them proved to be the ideal sanitization method for decontamination of tooth brushes.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Modern dentistry strongly emphasizes prevention and bio-security regarding how toothbrushes should be appropriately stored, disinfected, and changed at regular intervals.</p><p>Concerns regarding instruments for oral cleaning such as toothbrushes and dental floss have always existed. Although methods for tooth brushing are described in the literature, procedures for maintaining the cleanliness of toothbrushes are rarely discussed.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Therefore, the present study is under taken to evaluate the efficacy of 0.2% CHX gluconate solution, ultra violet (UV) toothbrush-sanitizer and normal saline for toothbrush disinfection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This short term clinical trial was conducted for the duration of 1 week among a group of 15 adults with age range of 21&#x02013;50 years old, working in a private institution.

To standardize and maintain the uniformity with regards to mechanical plaque control, the dispensed toothbrushes were soft bristled with uniform make. Furthermore, the fluoridated dentifrice (80 g each) dispensed in the kit, served the dual purpose of increase the compliance of study participants and maintaining the uniformity regarding plaque control measures.</p><p>The study groups were asked to refrain from all other unassigned forms of oral hygiene practices. All the participant were instructed to brush once daily (in the morning using about a gram of toothpaste) for a period of 2-4 min with the assigned toothpaste for a period of 1 week. Following the brushing, they were asked to rinse their toothbrush in running tap water for 30 s and thereafter place the brush in an open brush holder, bristles up, outside the bathroom. After 1 week, all the used toothbrushes were collected by the investigator and stored in sterile plastic pouches. All the tooth brushes were coded from 1 to 15 numbers. The tooth brushes were promptly delivered to the laboratory for bacterial extraction.

The tooth brush plays a vital role in mechanical plaque control. It has been used in various forms and has proven to be efficient in removing plaque. Tooth brush, during oral use can get contaminated with microorganisms present in the mouth. It is a common practice to rinse the tooth brush with plain water after oral use and store it in a place near or in the bathrooms. Bacteria are more likely to grow in these moist and warm conditions.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Therefore, the storage and maintenance of the toothbrush after brushing has become increasingly important. In an attempt to decontaminate the toothbrushes, several chemical disinfecting solutions have been tried such as hexidine mouthwash, hydrogen peroxide, dettolin and cetylpyridinium chloride. Herbal products like 3% neem, 5% turmeric were also investigated for their effectiveness as antimicrobial solutions. Literature review suggests that chemical disinfectants and herbal products are effective in decontamination of tooth brushes.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>However, none of these studies have suggested an easy, economical and the most effective method for disinfecting a toothbrush. Hence, the present study is an attempt to compare the efficacy of 0.2% CHX gluconate solution, ultraviolet radiation and saline solution in the reduction of bacterial load from contaminated tooth brushes.</p><p>The tooth brushes in the present study were collected 7 days after oral use, and were subjected to microbial analysis at different dilutions.</p><p>The toothbrush collection time, i.e., 7 days in the present study can be compared to studies by Sogi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Bhat <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Different study intervals in the present study are based on the methodology employed in studies like Grewal and Swaranjit.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Toothbrushes were randomly allocated to three intervention groups. In all the groups, the mean CFU at 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>, 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> and 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> dilution were recorded and were in the range of 123&#x02013;311 CFU's. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean CFU's before intervention (pre-sanitization) among the groups. All the toothbrushes were contaminated with bacteria after oral use. This finding suggests that the stored toothbrushes harbor different species of bacteria. Similar results have been described in the previous studies indicating that there exists a risk of colonization of bacteria on the toothbrushes after use.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Microorganisms can not only colonize, but also retain on the toothbrushes for considerable time duration. Svanberg[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] in their study observed that heavily infected toothbrushes even after 24 h of use. Studies have shown that contaminated toothbrush can harbor streptococci that may cause pharyngitis or tonsillitis in children.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Furthermore, improperly cleaned or rinsed toothbrushes may lead to bacteremia.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Toothbrushes can be a source or carrier of infection into the oral cavity. Therefore, it is useful to disinfect toothbrush at regular interval to prevent serious infections. The need for disinfection of used toothbrushes has been suggested by several authors using different methods like microwave irradiation, chemical and herbal agents.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The present study used three disinfection or sanitization techniques like CHX solution, Ultraviolet irradiation and saline solution. Our results showed a significant reduction in mean bacterial count after the use of CHX solution, UV irradiation and normal saline solution at various dilutions. The difference was statistically significant before (pre-sanitization) and after intervention (post-sanitization).This suggests that the definite disinfection procedure is required for contaminated toothbrushes. Our findings with CHX solutions are in accordance with the results of Bhat <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Balappanavar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] though both of the studies assessed only the reduction of S. Mutans count after disinfecting with CHX solution. CHX is the gold standard and exhibits broad spectrum antimicrobial effect. CHX gluconate has shown to inhibit bacterial count effectively in contaminated toothbrushes.</p><p>In the present study, 0.2% CHX gluconate solution was used, and toothbrushes were soaked for 12 h overnight. Though, studies using different concentration of CHX (Glass and Jensen)[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and soaking times (Grewal and Swaranjit)[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have also been conducted.</p><p>The findings in the UV radiation group reveal that it is more effective in the reduction of total viable count on toothbrushes compared to CHX solution and saline solution. UV light is capable of inactivating the microorganisms by disrupting the chemical bonds that hold the DNA atom. The toothbrushes were exposed to UV light for seven minutes as per manufacturer's instructions. Studies have suggested that longer exposure to UV light can further lead to complete deactivation of microorganism. Study by Arrage <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] suggests that some of the bacteria are tolerant to UV radiation. Several aerobic, Gram-positive, subsurface bacteria exhibited greater resistance to UV light. Although UV tolerance/resistance may also depend on physiological and behavioral traits, such as cell morphology, pigmentation and photo-toxicity.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Similar to our results Boylan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] have reported 86% reduction in total viable bacteria after irradiation with UV in toothbrush holder.</p><p>The present study demonstrated that saline solution, when used as disinfecting solution showed a significant reduction in the mean number of colony-forming bacterial units. This may be due to storage of toothbrushes in saline for 12 h. Storage conditions of toothbrushes are an important factor for bacterial survival (Dayoub <italic>et al</italic>.).[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>In this study 0.2% CHX gluconate solution, UV rays and saline solution were all efficacious in reducing bacterial load on toothbrushes. However, UV toothbrush holder was found to be more efficacious, when compared with other groups. Hence, the present study concludes that UV light toothbrush holder is rapidly effective and nontoxic, and can be easily implemented. However, the UV light toothbrush holder is expensive and may not be that much cost effective. The cost factor also needs to be addressed before recommending the technique for a community at large. CHX solution is easily available and it is cost effective, when compared to UV light toothbrush holder. Therefore, chemical method of disinfection of toothbrushes using CHX may be recommended for toothbrushes, as a disinfecting solution in the developing countries.</p><p>The small sample size and lack of monitoring of the study participants is one of the limitations of the study. Another limitation is that the study did not consider specific microorganisms responsible in the causation of oral diseases. Nevertheless, it opens new avenues for further researches and contributes to the understanding of the existing literature.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on this study results, the following conclusions can be made.</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>All the three methods are effective in toothbrush decontamination, but UV rays have greater efficacy followed by CHX and saline</p></list-item><list-item><p>Overnight immersion of a toothbrush in CHX gluconate (0.2%) was also found to be highly effective in preventing microbial contamination</p></list-item><list-item><p>Disinfection of tooth brush may prevent the occurrence of cross infection or re-infection of patients using a contaminated toothbrush</p></list-item><list-item><p>UV rays toothbrush holder used in the study was expensive compared to other groups used in the study. Studies to find out the cost-effectiveness of UV chamber (toothbrush holder) may be recommended in the future.</p></list-item></list>
