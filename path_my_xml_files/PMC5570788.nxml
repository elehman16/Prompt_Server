It is applied for the treatment of various problems, such as pelvic pain, menstrual problems, tumors, and other related diseases. However, based on the patient&#x02019;s problem, in addition to the uterus, removal of the fallopian tubes, ovaries, or cervix may be necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Every year, 600,000 women are undergoing hysterectomy surgery in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The surgery is done as abdominally and vaginally, but from 1980 onwards, it is also done by laparoscopy, which plays a major role in the treatment of gynecologic malignancies, uterine leiomyoma, endometrial hyperplasia, and uterine prolapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Hysterectomy may have complications. One of the most important complications is reduced ovarian function, which is not dependent on the type of surgery and is very important for women of reproductive age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that women undergoing hysterectomy experience menopausal symptoms faster and compared with other women have lower number of follicles, lower serum progesterone levels, and higher levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The measures for preserving ovarian function after hysterectomy are always important.</p><p id="Par8">Salpingectomy is a procedure for sterilization and with hysterectomy leads to good results, especially in recent decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Salpingectomy can be due to different reasons, including treatment of ectopic pregnancy, infections in the fallopian tubes, and fallopian tube prolapse treatment after hysterectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It seems that preserving ovarian function after hysterectomy is very important. Hysterectomy preserves the both ovaries and tubes through salpingectomy close to the uterus to preserve blood supply to the mesosalpinx of ovaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Many gynecologists refuse to perform salpingectomy at the time of hysterectomy due to blocking uterine blood flow to the ovaries and disrupting its function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is no agreement on the effect of salpingectomy, and some studies revealed the devastating impact of salpingectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Interestingly, findings of studies have shown that the primary source of ovarian cancer is fallopian tubes and if hysterectomy is along with salpingectomy, cancer progression may be prevented. The preferred surgery is removing tubes associated with hysterectomy in women who have high levels of uterine cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It can be proved in practice that hysterectomy with salpingectomy has no harmful effects on ovarian function and is used as a suitable technique for hysterectomy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of salpingectomy on ovarian function by measuring anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) (as a substitute for ovarian reserve). Therefore, the mean AMH was compared between the two groups of hysterectomy and hysterectomy with salpingectomy within 3&#x000a0;months after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par9">This study was a balanced, single-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial in Ruin Tan Arash Hospital, Tehran, between May 2013 and November 2014.</p><p id="Par10">The participants were premenopausal women aged 18 to 45&#x000a0;years who were undergoing abdominal hysterectomy for non-malignant gynecologic disease with preservation of the ovaries. All patients gave written informed consent before any study-related tests were done. Ethics approval was obtained from the Tehran University of Medical Sciences Clinical Research Ethics Board. Date of approval was January 31, 2015. The study was registered in Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.irct.ir">www.IRCT.ir</ext-link>) by the number of IRCT2014123118866N4.</p><p id="Par11">The inclusion criteria were age &#x0003c;&#x02009;45&#x000a0;years, elective hysterectomy (without oophorectomy), absence of menopausal symptoms, and baseline FSH value of &#x0003c;10&#x000a0;IU/mL. Women with the following characteristics were excluded prior to enrollment: a history of pelvic surgery, cystic (&#x0003e;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;mm) or any solid ovarian mass in transvaginal ultrasound, hormone replacement treatment and/or hormonal contraception for the last 6&#x000a0;months, a history of pelvic surgery, and a present or past smoking history.</p><p id="Par12">After their consent was obtained, patients were randomly assigned in two groups, using a random number sequence, generated with a proprietary computer application, according to a randomized block design. The randomization list was created by the clinical trial&#x02019;s epidemiologist, who kept the codes until completion of the study. Allocation concealment was maintained by having procedure indicator cards inside a set of numbered opaque sealed envelopes. Patients were allocated to treatment by the author opening the next numbered envelope, after screening, in the presence of the patient. None of the staff or patients had access to the randomization codes during the study. A patient&#x02019;s treatment assignment would only be unblended when knowledge of the treatment was essential for the further management of the patient. The surgeon performing the procedures was blinded to the treatment allocation until the time of surgery.</p><p id="Par13">Group 1 patients (salpingectomy) underwent total hysterectomy with removal of the fallopian tubes bilaterally. Caution was given to avoid injury to the ovarian vessels and to divide the mesosalpinx as close to the fallopian tube as possible.

The present study was conducted as RCT with relatively satisfactory sample size that confirmed the results of others studies and did not report a harmful effect of salpingectomy. Another reason was the use of different markers of ovarian reserve in the studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the retrieved studies, reported measures included duration of gonadotropin stimulation, the amount of used gonadotropin, follicle count, the number of retrieved oocytes, fertility rate, and hormone levels (FSH, LH, estradiol, and AMH).</p><p id="Par26">AMH is a glycoprotein dimer mainly secretes from granulocytes of preantral and small antral follicles. AMH levels are relatively constant throughout the menstrual cycle and have a very strong correlation with the number of follicles and ovarian reserve and are an important indicator of fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that AMH compared with other hormone markers is better predictive factor and is less affected by manipulating the endogenous gonadotropin. In the present study, AMH measured best predict ovarian reserve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Some studies have shown that an effect of salpingectomy is harmful in infertile patients undergoing IVF-ET. In these studies, confounding factors affecting ovarian reserve and the process of infertility treatment (eligibility for IVF) were not adjusted. Infertile individuals undergoing ART is specific and cannot be a representative of all women of reproductive age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, the results of these studies can be influenced by selection bias. Another factor that could contradict the results of these studies is due to measurement bias the skill of the surgeon.</p><p id="Par28">It seems that if salpingectomy is done with minimum damage to the ovarian microvascularization, blood flow to the ovaries will be complete and the ovary function remains undisturbed. Adequate amounts of blood flow have a vital role in the follicular maturation, either spontaneously or stimulated, by influencing the synthesis of steroid hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Ovarian blood flow is provided from two basic sources: ovarian artery originated from the aorta and ramus ovaricus that comes from the uterine artery. The blood flow of the tubes arises from ovarian artery and ramus ovaricus. Studies that found harmful effect of salpingectomy concluded based on decreased blood flow to the ovaries and reduction in its efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. One of the important reasons for the phenomenon is expertise and skill of the surgeons.</p><p id="Par29">The strengths of this study included study design (RCT), measuring objective outcomes and high prediction, and relatively desirable sample size. The most important limitation of the study was lack of long-term follow-up that causes to no tracking medium-term and long-term effects of hysterectomy and salpingectomy in menopause patients and their ovarian function. The lack of uterine blood flow measurement is the limitations of this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par30">Salpingectomy with abdominal hysterectomy is a safe and convenient treatment that does not have a deleterious effect on ovarian reserve. It is suggested that multicenter RCT studies with higher sample size and longer duration of follow-up are done to extract more accurate and reliable results about the effects of salpingectomy on fertilization.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Key message</title><p id="Par31">The findings of this study confirmed the results of previous studies that showed that salpingectomy with hysterectomy cannot cause to a devastating effect on the ovarian reserve and 3&#x000a0;months after treatment, no significant difference was seen in the levels of AMH between the two treatments.</p></sec></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AT contribute to the conception and design of the work, interpretation of data.
