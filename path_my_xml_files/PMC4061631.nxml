Numerous interventions have been carried out to improve the QOL in patients with cancer, but the effect of indirect interventions on the patients&#x02019; QOL has not been investigated yet. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of group meaning centered hope therapy of cancer patients and their families on the patients&#x02019; QOL.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This is a clinical trial conducted in three groups with a pre-test post-test design in which the effect of independent variable of meaning centered hope therapy on the dependent variable of QOL was investigated. The subjects were selected from the cancer patients who were aware of their diagnosis, were in primary stages of the disease, and had passed one period of chemotherapy. In this study, 42 patients (16 in control group, 14 in patients&#x02019; group therapy, and 12 in patients&#x02019; families&#x02019; group therapy) were studied, and WHOQOL was adopted to investigate their QOL.

This finding is important for therapists, as when the patients cannot attend group therapy sessions due to complications of chemotherapy, these sessions can be held for their families to improve patients&#x02019; QOL.

The psychological impact of cancer diagnosis and its physical complications negatively affects the quality of life (QOL) of the patients and their families.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] QOL is a multidimensional concept including subjective and objective factors,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and often refers to personal concept of satisfaction with life, physical health, social and familial health, hope, and mental health. Investigation of QOL has changed to a variable associated with clinical care in the research.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] There are numerous methods to improve the QOL among cancer patients, including group psychotherapy interventional methods. Psychotherapy methods resulting in promotion of hope among the patients lead to improvement of their QOL. Among these methods, hope therapy has the main goal of promoting hope among the patients.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] As these patients usually think that cancer equals death, they develop problems in understanding the meaning and values of their life. A mere solution-centered treatment does not seem to help these patients. Therefore, in order to promote hope therapy sessions and increase their efficacy, it is better to practice them with an existential approach like meaning therapy.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Numerous studies have been already conducted to help cancer patients lower their disease-related complications. These studies include the effect of mindfulness on cancer patients&#x02019; mood,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] the effect of combined psychotherapy on cancer patients&#x02019; QOL,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] the effect of spirituality, psychotherapy, and music in the palliative care of cancer patients, the effect of group meaning therapy on cancer patients&#x02019; life expectancy,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] etc. Literature review revealed no study concerning the effect of group meaning centered hope therapy (combination of hope therapy and meaning therapy) on cancer patients and their families and comparison of this effect on patients&#x02019; QOL. In most of the reviewed articles, patients&#x02019; problems were investigated and not those of their families, although social support of the families has been reported very impressive on patients&#x02019; recovery trend[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in the existing references. In addition, when the patients are in the phase of denial or anger due to their disease, they may not cooperate enough with the treatment team, especially nurses. In these cases, if hope therapy on the patients&#x02019; families can have an equal effect as patients&#x02019; own hope therapy, psychological interventions on the family members can replace those of the patients. With regard to the above-mentioned challenges, the main goal of this study was to compare the effect of group meaning centered hope therapy in the families compared to the group meaning centered hope therapy in patients on the patients&#x02019; QOL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This is a clinical trial conducted to investigate the effect of the independent variable of meaning-centered hope therapy on the dependent variable of QOL.</p><p>This is a three-group pre-test post-test design with a control group, in which group meaning centered hope therapy sessions were held for both the groups of patients and their families. In group 3 (control group), just conventional interventions were administered. In all three groups, patients&#x02019; QOL was compared before and after the intervention. Research environment was Seyed Al-Shohada Hospital in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran, which is a professional center for cancer patients in Isfahan province. The subjects were the cancer patients referring to the research environment during Sept-Oct. 2012 who met the inclusion criteria including knowing about their diagnosis of cancer, being in primary stages of the disease, and having passed through at least one period of chemotherapy. Then, the patients and their family caregivers were randomly assigned to the control and study groups. Exclusion criteria were any diagnosed metastasis and patients affected by dementia and other psychotic conditions. Based on similar related researches and their sample sizes, and after consultation with one of the professors of statistics in the university, the sample size in this clinical trial study was calculated to be 16 subjects in each group to achieve an accuracy of 95%, a power of 0.8, and standard deviation (SD) of QOL score of 10. Data were collected by a personal characteristics questionnaire with eight questions and a World Health Organization's Quality Of Life questionnaire (WHOQOL) including 26 items scored with a five-point Likert's scale (scores 1-5), and were standardized in Iran by Yousefi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] These questionnaires were given to the subjects before and after the group sessions, and the subjects were asked to fill them up and return to the researcher on the same day. Group meaning centered hope therapy was administered in eight 90-min weekly sessions for the patients and their families (<italic>n</italic> = 14 in patients group therapy and <italic>n</italic> = 12 in patients&#x02019; family group therapy). This is a combination of hope therapy and meaning therapy sessions presented by Sotoudeh and Mehrabizadeh. In the first intervention session, the patients were familiarized with the principles of meaning-centered hope therapy and its application in daily life. Theoretical bases of QOL and cancer were described to the patients, and each subject was asked to tell the story of his/her disease with emphasis on the level and manner of its effect on his/her QOL, and then, the principle of free will was emphasized. In the second session, the association between patients&#x02019; QOL on the one hand and hope, meaning, attitude values, experimental and innovative values on the other hand was emphasized. In the third and fourth sessions, experimental attitude and ethical values and their roles in the formation of hopeful thinking and finding the meaning were discussed in depth. In the fifth and sixth sessions, it was explained that as everybody is responsible for his/her past and future life, one should set goals with regard to the innovative values and plans to access them. In other words, three components of Schneider's theory (goals, factor, and pathways) should be considered. At this stage, patients were asked to state any example of hope from their life. Then, subjects&#x02019; past success was used to detect and empower their hope components in life accordingly. The specifications of appropriate goal setting to improve patients&#x02019; QOL were discussed, and the patients were asked to determine goals for each of the above-mentioned cases. In the seventh session, the formula of &#x0201c;hope = goal + will power + patience + planning power + detection of obstacles in the achievement of goal + coping mechanisms&#x0201d; was introduced. The patients were asked to practice and make imaginations about regulating and the way of achieving goals. In the last session, a feedback was taken from the group, and they were helped to conclude that we are responsible for the world we make, out of the conditions we are in.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Data were analyzed by deceptive and inferential statistical tests through SPSS<sub>14</sub>.

In general, the obtained results show that group meaning centered hope therapy in either patients&#x02019; group or families&#x02019; group led to improvement of patients&#x02019; QOL, which is consistent with the results of other studies on cancer patients&#x02019; QOL, including those of Yao, Spiegel, Snyder, Kang, Bijari, and Zamanian.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>With regard to the first hypothesis, &#x0201c;group meaning centered hope therapy is effective on patients&#x02019; QOL&#x0201d;, the test results showed that group meaning centered hope therapy in patients led to promotion of patients&#x02019; QOL. Group meaning centered hope therapy was conducted in none of the reviewed researches, but there were studies on other psychological interventions. In the study of Haravi, the effect of group counseling program on the QOL of 164 breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy was studied in two groups of study and control (<italic>n</italic> = 82, <italic>n</italic> = 82) and it was found that group counseling promoted patients&#x02019; QOL in all domains.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Also, Sharif <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in a study on the effect of peer education on the QOL of breast cancer patients after surgery, showed an increase in patients&#x02019; QOL after the intervention.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Blake-Mortimer <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] in a literature review study on the promotion of quality and quantity of cancer patients&#x02019; life (a review on the efficacy of group psychotherapy), showed that group psychotherapy influenced not only the patients&#x02019; QOL but also their quantity of life (years of life) and led to more survival of these patients, reduction of their pain, reduction of their mood disorders, and improvement of their QOL. In addition, the results of a pilot study showed that an intervention like mindfulness-based stress reduction can result in an improvement of cancer patients&#x02019; physical and psychological status and QOL.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] All the above-mentioned studies obtained results consistent with those of the present study, although they were not methodologically similar.</p><p>Test results of the second hypothesis revealed that group meaning centered hope therapy led to improvement of patients&#x02019; QOL. In the reviewed studies, group meaning centered hope therapy had been administered, but a meta-analysis was conducted by Northouse <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] on the social&#x02013;psychological care among the caregivers of cancer patients and they found that caregivers&#x02019; stress can result in sleep disorders and changes in their physical health and immunity system function. Psychological interventions presented in the research can relieve these signs in the caregivers of cancer patients and other chronic patients and improve their QOL. The authors of the latter article reported that these interventions can positively affect the patients&#x02019; signs and reduce their mortality, although they are practically less used. Their results are in line with the results of the present study, which showed that group meaning centered hope therapy in families is effective on patients&#x02019; QOL. In 2012, a study conducted on the effects of lung cancer complications on the patients and their caregivers showed that the patients, their caregivers, and their professional caregivers were all under the influence of cancer-related complications, faced QOL reduction, and needed supportive interventions.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The present study seems to have worked on a new issue (the effect of a combined intervention on QOL of the cancer patients and their families), as no similar study has been found on this by the researchers of the present study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Cancer is one of the chronic diseases that affect the QOL of patients and their families. The obtained results showed that meaning centered hope therapy, if conducted either for the patients or for their families, can promote patients&#x02019; QOL. This finding is important in work therapy as in cases when the patient cannot attend group therapy sessions due to chemotherapy or other treatment problems, the patients&#x02019; QOL can be promoted by forming these sessions for the patients&#x02019;
