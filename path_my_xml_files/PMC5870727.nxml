Early detection and effective management of these conditions relies on vital signs. The Microlife&#x000ae; CRADLE Vital Sign Alert (VSA) is an easy-to-use, accurate device that measures blood pressure and pulse. It incorporates a traffic-light early warning system that alerts all levels of healthcare provider to the need for escalation of care in women with obstetric haemorrhage, sepsis or pregnancy hypertension, thereby aiding early recognition of haemodynamic instability and preventing maternal mortality and morbidity. The aim of the trial was to determine whether implementation of the CRADLE intervention (the Microlife&#x000ae; CRADLE VSA device and CRADLE training package) into routine maternity care in place of existing equipment will reduce a composite outcome of maternal mortality and morbidity in low- and middle-income country populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The CRADLE-3 trial was a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial of the CRADLE intervention compared to routine maternity care. Each cluster crossed from routine maternity care to the intervention at 2-monthly intervals over the course of 20 months (April 2016 to November 2017). All women identified as pregnant or within 6 weeks postpartum, presenting for maternity care in cluster catchment areas were eligible to participate. Primary outcome data (composite of maternal death, eclampsia and emergency hysterectomy per 10,000 deliveries) were collected at 10 clusters (Gokak, Belgaum, India; Harare, Zimbabwe; Ndola, Zambia; Lusaka, Zambia; Free Town, Sierra Leone; Mbale, Uganda; Kampala, Uganda; Cap Haitien, Haiti; South West, Malawi; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia). This trial was informed by the Medical Research Council guidance for complex interventions. A process evaluation was undertaken to evaluate implementation in each site and a cost-effectiveness evaluation will be undertaken.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">All aspects of this protocol have been evaluated in a feasibility study, with subsequent optimisation of the intervention. This trial will demonstrate the potential impact of the CRADLE intervention on reducing maternal mortality and morbidity in low-resource settings. It is anticipated that the relatively low cost of the intervention and ease of integration into existing health systems will be of significant interest to local, national and international health policy-makers.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ISCRTN41244132.

Obstetric haemorrhage (antepartum and postpartum), sepsis and hypertension in pregnancy account for more than 50% of maternal deaths worldwide, 99% of which occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Early detection and effective management of these conditions relies on vital sign monitoring, including pulse and blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Strategies aiming to improve the detection of haemodynamic instability are vital in recognising women in need of urgent medical care.</p><p id="Par14">There are simple, cost-effective and established interventions to save lives for each of these pregnancy-related conditions, but the barrier to initiating treatment lies in recognition of maternal haemodynamic compromise and access to interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Accurate blood pressure measurement is essential for detecting and monitoring pre-eclampsia, enabling antihypertensive and prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy, appropriate transfer to higher-care facilities for timed delivery and, thereby, prevention of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity; however, the majority of blood pressure devices that are commercially available either fail validation in pregnancy or their accuracy is unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In LMICs, hypertension is frequently under-detected, not only because of poor availability of working and accurate blood pressure devices, but also because of inadequate training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Vital sign measurement is equally critical in the management of obstetric haemorrhage and sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Postpartum haemorrhage, the leading cause of maternal mortality in LMICs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], can cause death within a few hours, but effective interventions are available and early recognition facilitating immediate intervention is often lifesaving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">The CRADLE Research Group proposes that the introduction of the CRADLE Vital Sign Alert (VSA) device, a vital-sign-measuring device and alert tool, integrated with the CRADLE training package, will aid the early recognition of haemodynamic instability secondary to haemorrhage, sepsis and pre-eclampsia in LMICs. The CRADLE VSA device has been validated as accurate for use in pregnancy, including in women with pre-eclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and is the first device to be validated as accurate in pregnant women with low blood pressure; from example, from haemorrhage or sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It has been designed to be robust and longer lasting for use in community and health facility environments in LMIC settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The device is affordable, easy-to-use (including for community healthcare providers), reliable and portable. The CRADLE Group has incorporated a traffic-light early warning system into the device alerting users to hypertension and shock.</p><p id="Par16">This protocol describes the stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial to assess the implementation and clinical usefulness of the CRADLE intervention in LMICs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Feasibility phase: November 2015 &#x02013; March 2016</title><p id="Par17">The trial was preceded by a mixed-methods feasibility phase. The aim was to explore the acceptability and feasibility of the CRADLE intervention and its implementation strategies in three non-trial sites representative of the 10 main trial clusters (Ramdurg, Belgaum, India, Bishoftu, Ethiopia, Masvingo, Zimbabwe). Simultaneously, the 10 main trial clusters collected primary outcome data to evaluate the methods of data collection, and to inform the randomisation programme and the sample size calculation. Results were used to optimise the final CRADLE-3 protocol including training materials and implementation strategy for the main trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Definitive stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial: April 2016 &#x02013; November 2017</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Aim</title><p id="Par18">The primary aim of the trial was to determine whether implementation of the CRADLE intervention to community and facility maternity care reduces a composite of (all-cause) maternal mortality or major morbidity by &#x02265;&#x02009;25%.</p><p id="Par19">The trial is complemented by simultaneous process evaluation informed by the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance. The aim of the process evaluation is: (1) to explore if the CRADLE trial was delivered as intended (fidelity, dose and adaptation); (2) to understand whether, how and why the intervention had an impact, through exploring healthcare provider (HCP) perspectives of their usual care and of the intervention and (3) to explore if the results are likely to be scalable and sustainable.

The device has undergone extensive testing for accuracy and is one of few blood pressure devices to have been validated as accurate in pregnancy, including in pre-eclampsia and hypotension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], as well as non-pregnant adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">The device incorporates a traffic-light early warning system that alerts all levels of HCP to abnormalities in blood pressure and pulse secondary to obstetric haemorrhage, sepsis and pregnancy hypertension.

Details on staffing levels and availability of key resources, such as intensive care beds, blood transfusion and magnesium sulphate use, was collated. In addition, major changes to the trial catchment, such as changes to infrastructure, policy, patient payment requirements or environmental conditions, were systematically reviewed each month.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par84">Methods of data collection were discussed and optimised based on the existing resources available in each site. Outcomes were triangulated across multiple sources (including referral registers, ward registers, patient records, local mortality and morbidity records and active case finding) to ensure data completeness and all outcomes checked to avoid double counting.</p><p id="Par85">Outcome data were recorded over the 20-month period. Consistency and quality of source data was monitored by the research midwife/assistant at each cluster (monthly). Data were entered onto an online database (MedSciNet). This allows for extensive monitoring and query processing features, as well as a comprehensive alerting system to identify missing data. The trial coordinator will monitor data entry continuously on MedSciNet. Ten percent of the source data were validated by the primary investigator and a proportion of this was reviewed by the trial coordinator. Patient records are identified with a unique identification number generated sequentially and no identifying data are stored.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Method of randomisation</title><p id="Par86">The unit of randomisation is the cluster (or clusters), rather than individual women. Large variation in the primary event rate was anticipated between clusters; therefore, a restricted method of randomisation was used with zero rank correlation between events per month and order of randomisation. The sequence of timing for receiving the CRADLE intervention was determined by computer-generated random numbers by the CRADLE statistician. The clusters were masked to the order of implementation until they are informed of their allocation 2 months prior to their implementation date (to enable training to be arranged).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p id="Par87">Sample size estimation has been carried out by the CRADLE statistician, using Stata version 13.1 and the methods of Hemming and Girling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This was informed by data from the feasibility phase. For the purpose of the power calculation an assumption that there are at least 4000 deliveries per centre per month was made (or 8000 per cluster period of 2 months) and at least nine clusters, each observed for 20 months (10 time periods of 2 months each). We anticipated a baseline event rate of 1% and anticipate a 25% reduction in this to 0.75% post intervention. We would require a total of 6300 outcome events, with a coefficient of variation of 0.4 and an Intra Cluster Correlation of 0.0085, to have power of 99%. We would require a total of 2450 outcome events with a coefficient of variation of 0.4, to have power of 95%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Statistical plan</title><p id="Par88">The effect of the intervention on the primary outcome, on each of the three components, and on the secondary outcomes specified above, will be reported. Results will be reported firstly as odds ratios (ORs), with risk ratios (RRs) as a secondary comparison if the appropriate models converge. Within the stepped-wedge cluster design it remains appropriate to analyse outcome data from clusters individually, despite randomising cluster time points with some clusters paired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par89">The main statistical analysis method will be by logistic regression, using generalised estimating equations with a population-averaged model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] (Stata command xtgee) with fixed centre effects and separate fixed linear trends in each centre for changes in outcome over time. Autoregressive correlation will account for decreasing correlations between observations over time. This model outperformed the multilevel model structure of Hussey and Hughes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], being apparently less susceptible to bias. It gives equal weight to each woman, rather than each centre, and (being population-averaged) reports effects averaged over the length of the trial. Simulations studies suggest that using time categories, rather than linear trends do not correct well for separate time trends by centre, and can cause convergence problems. Results will be expressed as ORs; at the low event rates expected (&#x02264;&#x02009;5%), ORs and RRs are reasonably close (in the simplest case, for 5% and 3.75%, RR = 0.75, OR = 0.74). A secondary analysis to obtain RRs using a log link will be attempted, but simulation studies suggest that the convergence may be poor. We will adjust for centre effects and linear time trends and the interaction between them. This will effectively adjust for differences in baseline availability of resources between clusters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par90">We have described the protocol for a mixed-methods, multicentre, stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial. The main objective of this trial is to determine whether the introduction of the CRADLE intervention (CRADLE VSA device and CRADLE training package) to maternity care settings in LMIC communities and facilities reduces maternal mortality and morbidity. A stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial design has been chosen to evaluate the intervention in a pragmatic fashion. Individual randomisation would be logistically difficult and would not measure impact and transferability at a population level. The stepped-wedge design is useful where phased implementation is preferable because of logistical and practical constraints.</p><p id="Par91">The CRADLE intervention is intended to be beneficial to all types of practice in a wide variety of settings. In keeping with the pragmatic trial design, and to ensure that results are generalisable, efforts were made to ensure that participating clusters represented diverse settings, at both a country level with different healthcare systems and at a facility level. Our study clusters, therefore, included academic/specialist facilities, private facilities and primary and secondary-level government facilities. We hypothesise that the intervention will work by facilitating earlier detection, referral and treatment of pregnancy complications.</p><p id="Par92">A composite of maternal mortality or morbidity (one of maternal death, eclampsia or emergency hysterectomy with no double counting) was chosen as the primary outcome as powering a trial for maternal death alone would require a prohibitively large sample size. These are robust and meaningful clinical endpoints that are unambiguous and, therefore, feasible to collect in these environments. Maternal complications were selected, each of which is associated with significant acute and chronic morbidity. Therefore, a reduction in this composite would be highly desirable. Each component of the primary outcome will be individually interrogated to ensure no paradoxical effects within the composite, i.e. an increase in morbidity may be associated with a reduction in mortality, as a consequence of intervention. Therefore, should the CRADLE intervention result in appropriate referral and intervention (e.g. hysterectomy) this will be recognised as beneficial even though the overall effect on the composite outcome may be neutral. We have ensured that all primary outcome measures are feasible to collect at primary to tertiary facilities, as determined through the feasibility study. It is, therefore, not necessary to conduct costly household surveys. In the unlikely event that a primary outcome occurs without HCP contact, this is likely to be unchanged pre and post intervention and should not affect our ability to assess the impact of intervention implementation.</p><p id="Par93">It is recognised that the CRADLE intervention may reduce perinatal mortality and morbidity. Perinatal outcomes have not been included as primary outcomes as the intervention is designed specifically to identify maternal health complications. Many of these occur postpartum and will not directly influence perinatal outcomes. Acquisition of detailed perinatal data within LMIC settings would be a substantial additional cost. However, the secondary perinatal outcomes will be collected in women who experience a primary outcome.</p><p id="Par94">The potential for this trial to demonstrate reductions in maternal mortality and morbidity and a positive impact on the working lives of HCPs will be of interest to local, national and international health-policy makers. The CRADLE VSA could become a key tool in achieving the post-2015 global maternal health goals, as well as facilitating a basic recommended standard of care, i.e. accurate blood pressure determination in all pregnant women. Given the low cost, reliability and accuracy of the device, if the trial is successful, a low regulatory hurdle and rapid progression to adoption is anticipated. The trial results will be generalisable beyond the immediate research setting, as the trial will be carried out in a variety of countries and at both at community and facility levels. A robust scale-up strategy will be required to support international scale-up to allow widespread and equitable access to the innovation. This will require appropriate resourcing to include commercial expertise and facilitate partnership between inventors, manufacturers and governments to maximise effective and efficient marketing, supply and distribution through appropriate channels and fair pricing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par95">Ongoing</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec21"><p>
