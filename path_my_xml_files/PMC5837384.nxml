As a pre-specified secondary outcome of a cluster-randomized controlled trial among &#x0003e;400 000 low-income residents in Dhaka, Bangladesh, we examined the impact of cholera vaccination plus a behaviour change intervention on diarrhoea-associated hospitalization.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Ninety neighbourhood clusters were randomly allocated into three areas: cholera-vaccine-only; vaccine-plus-behaviour-change (promotion of hand-washing with soap plus drinking water chlorination); and control. Study follow-up continued for 2 years after intervention began. We calculated cluster-adjusted diarrhoea-associated hospitalization rates using data we collected from nearby hospitals, and 6-monthly census data of all trial households.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 429 995 people contributed 500 700 person-years of data (average follow-up 1.13 years). Vaccine coverage was 58% at the start of analysis but continued to drop due to population migration. In the vaccine-plus-behaviour-change area, water plus soap was present at 45% of hand-washing stations; 4% of households had detectable chlorine in stored drinking water. Hospitalization rates were similar across the study areas [events/1000 person-years, 95% confidence interval (CI), cholera-vaccine-only: 9.4 (95% CI: 8.3&#x02013;10.6); vaccine-plus-behaviour-change: 9.6 (95% CI: 8.3&#x02013;11.1); control: 9.7 (95% CI: 8.3&#x02013;11.6)]. Cholera cases accounted for 7% of total number of diarrhoea-associated hospitalizations.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Neither cholera vaccination alone nor cholera vaccination combined with behaviour-change intervention efforts measurably reduced diarrhoea-associated hospitalization in this highly mobile population, during a time when cholera accounted for a small fraction of diarrhoea episodes.

We terminated follow-up for all individuals on 31 August 2013 or, if they had died or permanently out-migrated, their final date of assessment; during this monitoring period, study participants in the vaccine-plus-behaviour-change area (including in-migrants) continuously received the behaviour-change interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><p>The pre-specified outcome of interest was the rates of hospital admission for diarrhoea of any clinical severity. We also conducted an exploratory analysis of the impact of the interventions on severe diarrhoea hospitalization. Severe diarrhoea was defined by the presence of at least two of the following signs and symptoms: sunken eyes, dry tongue, thirst, irritability, less active than usual, skin pinch going back slowly, low volume radial pulse along with inability to drink, or absence of radial pulse. The number of diarrhoea-associated hospitalizations (defined as &#x02265; 3 loose/liquid stools within 24 h<xref rid="dyx187-B26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref>) was collected through hospital surveillance. The number of person-years observed was estimated based on information collected through 6-monthly census updates, during which data collectors visited each house in the study areas to obtain information on births, deaths and migrations of individuals.<xref rid="dyx187-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p><p>Each month, a separate survey was conducted among a different set of 200 randomly selected study participants in the vaccine-plus-behaviour-change area, and 100 participants in each of the vaccine-only and control areas, to determine uptake of the hand-washing and water treatment interventions. Unannounced home visits assessed intervention uptake by examining for the presence of soap/soapy water and water in the most convenient place for hand-washing. Presence of residual chlorine in stored drinking water was tested using colorimetre (HACH LANGE GmbH, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical methods</title><sec><title>Primary analysis</title><p>Using 6-monthly census data, we compared baseline demographic characteristics of study participants across the three intervention areas, and identified individuals who in- or out-migrated into the study area after outcome-monitoring commencement. Since the behavioural interventions were geographically based, people could not take the intervention-enabling hardware with them following migration out of the vaccine-plus-behaviour-change area. Conversely, people migrating into the vaccine-plus-behaviour-change area gained access to interventions. Our analysis accumulated person-years for each individual in a time-dependent manner according to their time at risk in each trial area. Specifically, when a person moved from one trial area to a different trial area, or migrated for the first time into the overall study area, we waited 14 days before beginning to allocate their person-time to the in-migrated trial area so that the effect of their previous exposures could be reduced and their new exposure established. Once a person migrated out of the overall study area altogether, we stopped accumulating his/her person-time. We allowed multiple hospitalizations per individual by continuing accumulation of person-years after hospitalization.</p><p>We calculated the diarrhoea-associated hospitalization incidence by counting the number of admissions from each study area during the outcome-monitoring period, and summed the person-time that study participants contributed to each trial area. We adjusted hospitalization incidence rates for the cluster-randomized trial design, and the potential multiple hospitalizations per individual using robust standard errors applied at the cluster level. To calculate the hazard ratio for diarrhoea-associated hospitalization of any severity, we compared incidence of hospitalization for diarrhoea in the vaccine-plus-behaviour-change area with the control and to the vaccine-only areas using Cox proportional hazards regression with cluster-robust standard errors. Results were adjusted for age, sex, education and pre-intervention individual-level hospitalizations.</p><p>We divided the 2-year outcome-monitoring period into quartiles (term 1 to term 4) to examine the consistency of the intervention effect on incidence of hospitalization over time, using intervention*quartile interaction terms in the Cox proportional hazards regression models. We assessed effect modification of the intervention by age in a similar manner with interaction terms. </p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary analyses</title><p>These included:

Despite using an effective cholera vaccine and culturally adapted behaviour-change interventions, we found no significant impact of combined vaccine-plus-behaviour-change intervention on rates of hospitalization with diarrhoea or hospitalization with severe diarrhoea.</p><p>In an earlier study, cholera vaccine reduced all-cause severely dehydrating diarrhoea-associated hospitalization.<xref rid="dyx187-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> In the current study, in an earlier analysis vaccination reduced the incidence of diarrhoea attributable to <italic>V. cholerae</italic>,<xref rid="dyx187-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> yet we did not observe any significant impact of cholera vaccine alone on all-cause diarrhoea hospitalization, presumably because the cholera incidence was too low during the study period to make a detectable contribution to overall hospitalization rates for all-cause diarrhoea. Indeed, the culture-confirmed cholera cases accounted for &#x0223c;7% of total number of cases of diarrhoea-related hospitalization, well below the years immediately preceding the study.<xref rid="dyx187-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> In countries like Bangladesh where cholera is endemic, the magnitude of cholera incidence can vary from year to year.<xref rid="dyx187-B27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Additionally, the high migration rate diluted cholera vaccination coverage of the intervention areas, thus reducing the impact of vaccine on diarrhoea-associated hospitalization.</p><p>The vaccine-plus-behaviour-change area received intervention hardware and instructions to wash their hands and treat their drinking water, in addition to receiving cholera vaccine. The corresponding behaviour-change strategy was tested in a pilot study to estimate acceptability before roll-out in the main trial.<xref rid="dyx187-B22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Chlorinating water and hand-washing promotion have been effective in reducing self-reported diarrhoeal diseases in small-scale efficacy studies.<xref rid="dyx187-B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyx187-B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> However, we observed no statistically significant overall or age-specific impact on hospitalization outcomes.</p><p>One reason for the lack of impact of the behavioural intervention may have been because of the low uptake. We ideally would have examined diarrhoea hospitalization rates among those who had good intervention uptake versus those who did not, but we could not link the intervention uptake data that was collected from only a small sub-sample of the study population to the hospitalization data. Identifying and reporting details of the reasons for poor uptake of these previously tested interventions will be assessed and reported separately, but may be related to difficulty of delivering the behaviour change intervention with high quality on a large scale.<xref rid="dyx187-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyx187-B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p><p>Our indicator of hand-washing behaviour uptake was the presence of soap and water at the primary hand-washing station. Among the vaccine-plus-behaviour-change population, the hand-washing indicator was only 17% points (45% vs 28%) higher than in the control area. Even though this is a commonly used indicator to assess hand-washing uptake,<xref rid="dyx187-B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyx187-B28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> it does not ensure that people actually wash their hands or use soap. Based on the presence of residual chlorine in drinking water, only 4% people used the chlorine dispenser. This was disappointing but not entirely unexpected, as the pilot study had also shown low uptake and hardware-related problems which were unresolved when the vaccine became available and main trial commenced. Low uptake of chlorine-based water treatment products has been reported in similar contexts.<xref rid="dyx187-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyx187-B29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> For example, a study conducted in urban Dhaka in 2009, promoting chlorine-based products detected residual chlorine in only &#x0223c;8% of households.<xref rid="dyx187-B29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> The taste and smell of chlorine-treated water is a commonly reported barrier.<xref rid="dyx187-B30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Moreover, a large number of the study participants migrated out of the study area before completion of the 2-year follow-up, thereby limiting the consistency of participants&#x02019; exposure to the intervention. However our analysis, restricted to people who stayed in the study area for the entire study period, also showed no reduction in diarrhoea hospitalization, despite a slightly higher uptake of interventions compared with those who migrated. The hospitalization rate was comparatively lower during the 6&#x02013;12 months preceding theintervention period. The reason for this is unknown, but it could be due to variations in diarrhoea rate at the community level over time or to delays before the surveillance was fully capturing all cases.</p><p>In conclusion, we observed limited public health impact, by the combination of oral cholera vaccine and behavioural interventions to improve drinking water quality and hand-washing behaviour, on the rate of hospitalized diarrhoea in the setting under study. Developing better behavioural interventions that increase water treatment and hand-washing remain important in areas where marginal improvement is possible. Whereas the low rate of cholera and high rate of population migration account for the limited impact of oral cholera vaccination, the failure of the drinking water and hand-washing intervention underscores the need for investment in research to improve the pace and effectiveness of community-wide interventions that separate human faeces from the environment, food and water supply of low-income country residents.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>
