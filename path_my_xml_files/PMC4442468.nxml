Test and reference products were administered to 60 volunteers with 240 ml water after overnight fasting. Plasma concentrations of losartan and its active carboxylic acid metabolite were monitored over a period of 36 h after drug administration by validated LC/MS/MS analytical method. The pharmacokinetic parameters C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0-t</sub>, AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub>, AUC<sub>0-t</sub>/AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub>, t<sub>max</sub>, K<sub>el</sub> and t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> were determined from plasma concentration time profile of both formulations for losartan and its active metabolite losartan carboxylic acid and were found to be in good agreement. The carboxylic acid metabolite was considered for profiling purpose only. The analysis of variance did not show any significant difference between the two formulations and 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of C<sub>max</sub> (84.89-104.09%), AUC<sub>0-t</sub> (95.84-102.84%) and AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> (96.43-103.25%) values for losartan between the test and reference products were within the 80-125% interval, satisfying the bioequivalence criteria of the US FDA guidelines. These results indicate that the test and the reference products of losartan potassium are bioequivalent and, thus, may be prescribed interchangeably.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Losartan Potassium</kwd><kwd>angiotensin</kwd><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>bioequivalence</kwd><kwd>ANOVA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Hypertension is a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries remains above the normal recommended range. It leads to the development of cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, cardiac and renal failure. Following treatment of hypertension, 40% reduction in the risk of stroke and 15% reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction is achieved[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Losartan potassium (LP), C<sub>22</sub>H<sub>22</sub>ClKN<sub>6</sub>O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig. 1</xref>), is an angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. It is a non-peptide molecule, chemically described as 2-butyl-4-chloro-1-[p-(o-1H-tetrazol-5-ylphenyl) benzyl] imidazole-5-methanol monopotassium[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and plays an important role in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex is also stimulated by angiotensin II. Losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Losartan and its principal active metabolite losartan carboxylic acid (LCA) block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptors present in many tissues (like vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). Both losartan and its metabolite LCA do not show any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptors and have much greater affinity (about 1000-fold) for the AT1 receptors than the AT2 receptors. LCA is more potent (10 to 40 times) by weight than losartan and is a reversible, noncompetitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Losartan and LCA do not inhibit ACE (kininase II, angiotensin converting enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin). They do not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels involved in cardiovascular regulation[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Structure of losartan potassium.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPhS-77-190-g001"/></fig><p>It is observed in clinical trials that losartan effectively lowers blood pressure as the otherfirst line antihypertensive drugs[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Usually, LP is preferred in the management of essential hypertension because of lower incidence of side effects like cough. It is readily absorbed and <italic>via</italic> Cytochrome P-450 system it undergoes rapid hepatic metabolism to form an active metabolite, EXP-3174[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The active metabolite contributes to a great extent to its antihypertensive effect, which lasts over 24 h after once-daily administration[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Its oral bioavailability is only 33%, while the remaining amount is excreted unchanged in faeces. This is due to its poor absorption in lower gastrointestinal tract and short elimination half-life of 1.5-2 h[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists show improved safety profile than those of ACE inhibitors and there is growing supporting evidence for that[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>FDA has defined bioequivalence as the absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent to which the active moiety in the drug products becomes available at the site action when administered at the same molar dose and under similar conditions[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The rising cost of medicines increases the overall cost of health care. Generic equivalents of branded or innovator drugs lower the cost of medication[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This saved about $8.8 billion or about 11% of expenditures on drugs for adults, in the United States each year at the same time providing quality[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In a study more than 50% of respondents were comfortable accepting a generic medication for a branded medication and didn&#x02019;t mind when their pharmacist switched their prescriptions to a generic medication, while 30.5% disagreed to accept generic medication. About two-thirds of prescriptions in the United States was generic drugs that provided 13% reduction in medication costs[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Due to increased demand, it is advisable that the pharmaceutical quality, safety, and efficacy of generics ought to be compared with the corresponding comparator product. &#x0201c;Orange Book&#x0201d; published by the FDA contains a list of approved drug products with therapeutic equivalents[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. &#x0201c;<italic>In vivo</italic> equivalence&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;bioequivalence&#x0201d; studies are carried out to assess the &#x0201c;interchangeability&#x0201d; between the innovator and generic products[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate bioequivalence between the test product, losartan potassium tablets 100 mg of Micro Labs Ltd., India and the reference product, Cozaar<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 100 mg of Merck and Co., INC., USA, under fasting condition in normal, healthy, adult, male and female human subjects, in a randomized crossover study.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Investigational medicinal products were procured from Micro Labs Ltd., Bangalore, India, which included the test product, losartan potassium tablets 100 mg of Micro Labs Ltd., India and the reference product, Cozaar<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 100 mg of losartan potassium tablets of Merck and Co., INC., USA.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethics:</title><p>The study was conducted with prior approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee (Protocol No: ARL/08/229, Approval Date: 17 Nov 2008) and according to the current version of the declaration of Helsinki (Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, Revised by World Medical Association General Assembly Tokyo, 2004), current ICH GCP guidelines, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines and Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) guidelines.
