A number of disadvantages have been shown to be associated with this technique. Periodontal ligament (PDL) injection could be considered as an alternative to inferior alveolar nerve block.

The study was performed using sequential double-blind randomized trial. Based on a pilot study and a previous study 80 children aged between 3 and 7 years who required pulpotomy (based on pre-operative radiograph and clinical signs) on symmetrical mandibular primary molars were selected and entered in the study sequentially. These children were healthy and did not have any contra indications for local anesthesia and were cooperative (3,4 Frankle classification). Informed consent was obtained from the parents of the children. All children participating in the study were treated by the same operator. In each child who did not have any disease and contra indication for local anesthesia and was not uncooperative (1,2 frankle classification). A primary molar on one side randomly received a nerve block injection and its symmetrical tooth received PDL injection randomly. Random allocation (using a coin) was done by the dental assistant who was instructed for this duty and was not informed about the study design. Topical anesthetic was applied before injection in both techniques. In the mandibular nerve block technique approximately 1/3 and 0/5 ml of an esthetic solution<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> (Persocain E, Lidocain Hcl Darupakhsh Pharmaceutical Mfa Co., Iran) was placed near the inferior alveolar nerve and in the muco buccal fold (Aesculap Syringe, Made in USA, Niddle: Nik Rahnama KarCo, Made in Iran, 27G- short (0.4-25 mm), respectively. In the PDL technique, 0.2 ml of anesthetic solution was placed in the bottom of the middle part of the buccal gingival sulcus until blanching of the buccal tissue was observed. At the time of injection, needle was slightly bent that needle was not seen by the child. Pulpotomy for symmetrical teeth were performed on each patient during the same appointment. Turn of treatment in each side was also selected randomly. Signs of discomfort included eye movement, hand and body tension, the verbal complaint and crying (SEM scale).<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> These were evaluated after 3 min in the PDL injection group (because onset of anesthesia after PDL injection is faster than mandibular block) and after 5 min in the block group by a single rater who was not the surgeon and was blinded to group allocation. This rater was instructed about this evaluation. Finally, the data were analyzed using the exact Fisher test and Pearson Chi-square exact test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>The results of this investigation were derived from a sample population comprising 41 female (the samples were selected randomly) and 39 males.

According to results of this study, PDL injection was effective in 88/75% of all cases.</p><p>The results of Malamed&#x02019;s study showed that PDL injection is 50% effective for endodontic treatment, and these results do not agree with our results.

It is probable that the differences between the results of our study and Malamed&#x02019;s stem from this key difference. Furthermore, anatomical position of primary molars and bone density in the primary dentition can affect on the success rate of PDL injection in the present study.</p><p>Walton and Abbott reported a 92% success rate for this technique.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The results of his study are in accordance with those of our study.

Studies generally compared effectiveness of PDL injection in mandibular first and second primary molars. In PDL injection, an anesthetic agent is injected into the bottom of the gingival sulcus and this area is similar to the mandibular first and second primary molars.</p><p>Time is an important factor in pediatric treatment.
