Short-term treatment (7&#x02013;14 days) with oral prednisone is used for many acute inflammatory and allergic conditions. This study was conducted to characterize the safety and pharmacodynamic (PD) dose&#x02013;response of a 7-day course of oral prednisone on biomarkers of GC receptor agonism.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study (A9001309), 37 healthy subjects received placebo or a prednisone dose from 2.5&#x02013;60&#x000a0;mg daily over 7&#x000a0;days in each of three treatment periods. White blood cell counts and plasma samples for measuring cortisol, osteocalcin and procollagen type 1&#x000a0;N-propeptide (P1NP) were obtained at 2, 4, 8, and 12&#x000a0;h post-dose on Day 1, immediately prior to dosing on Days 1, 2, and 4, and at nominal dosing time on Days 0 and 8. Urine samples for urinary N-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type 1 collagen (uNTX) were collected on Days 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8. Serum samples for adiponectin were obtained prior to dosing on days 0, 1, 4 and 8.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Daily doses of prednisone up to 60&#x000a0;mg resulted in dose- and time-dependent decreases in plasma osteocalcin, plasma P1NP, serum cortisol, and absolute blood eosinophil counts. Absolute blood neutrophil counts increased, while blood lymphocyte counts rebounded to an increased level following an initial rapid decrease after dosing. An increase was observed for uNTX and adiponectin. The incidence of adverse effects with prednisone was not dose related, and nervous system disorders, mainly headache, were the most frequently reported adverse effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This characterization provides important and relevant information on safety and PD responses of short-term prednisone dosing over the commonly-used clinical dose range, and also provides a reference for early clinical development of dissociated agents targeting a differentiated PD profile.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02767089">NCT02767089</ext-link> (retrospectively registered: 21 April 2016).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Biomarker</kwd><kwd>Dose&#x02013;response</kwd><kwd>Glucocorticoid</kwd><kwd>Healthy-subject</kwd><kwd>Pharmacodynamic</kwd><kwd>Prednisone</kwd><kwd>Safety</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004319</institution-id><institution>Pfizer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Glucocorticoids (GCs) are commonly used to manage inflammatory and immunologically-mediated conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and continue to have a prominent place in the clinic despite having a profile of serious adverse effects that are dose- and time-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Due to these known serious adverse effects, a GC such as prednisone is used at the lowest effective dose (5&#x02013;7.5&#x000a0;mg daily) for chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA); the use of higher doses is limited to the shortest treatment duration required for management of acute conditions and disease exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. One of the most prevalent adverse effects is that on bone remodeling, specifically, an uncoupling of bone formation and resorption in favor of bone loss via direct effects on osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Indeed, the most common form of iatrogenic osteoporosis is GC induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Many other adverse effects, such as electrolyte imbalance, weight gain, and metabolic disturbances, result from GC-induced effects on other tissues including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Similarly, due to a plethora of effects on leukocytes and vascular endothelial cells, such as altered cell distribution patterns, immobilization, and apoptosis, GC therapy can result in dramatic changes in circulating white blood cell profiles that may contribute to an increased risk of GC-associated infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Recent drug discovery and development efforts have focused on approaches to reduce adverse effects, while maintaining efficacy of GC therapy. These approaches include development of a modified-release prednisone formulation and discovery of selective GC receptor ligands that putatively dissociate anti-inflammatory effects mediated by genomic transrepression from adverse effects mediated by genomic transactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Despite the present understanding of the known adverse effects of GC therapy, and recent drug development efforts to potentially dissociate efficacy and safety of GCs, the dose&#x02013;response and time course of the effect of current GCs on various biomarkers of GC receptor agonism (anti-inflammatory and adverse effects) have not been systematically characterized. The characterization of the safety and pharmacodynamics (PD) of multiple doses of a standard GC such as prednisone, over the commonly used clinical dose range (2.5<bold>&#x02013;</bold>60&#x000a0;mg once daily), provides important and relevant information for clinical use, as well as reference for early clinical development of dissociated agents targeting a differentiated PD profile.</p><p>The present study was conducted to further characterize the safety and dose&#x02013;response of 7-day prednisone administration using biomarkers of GC receptor agonism in a healthy adult population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eligible subjects were healthy adult volunteers aged 18&#x02013;55 years (male) or 18<bold>&#x02013;</bold>44 years (female), with a body mass index of 18&#x02013;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and a total body weight &#x0003e;50&#x000a0;kg (110&#x000a0;lb).

Serum samples for cortisol were obtained at 2, 4, 8, and 12&#x000a0;h following the first sample on Day 0 (Period 1 only) and following the first prednisone dose on Day 1. A radioimmunoassay (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) was used initially for measurement of cortisol in serum, but the results indicated the possibility of assay interference from prednisone and its metabolite prednisolone. Consequently, a specific, validated, high-performance liquid chromatography assay (calibration range, 10&#x02013;3000&#x000a0;ng/mL) with tandem mass spectrometry (SGS Cephac, Poitiers, France) was used to assay cortisol in plasma samples collected for osteocalcin (OC) measurement on Day 0 and Day 1 (pre-dose and 2, 4, 8, and 12&#x000a0;h post-dose) and prior to dosing on Day 2. These plasma samples were stored at &#x02212;70&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until assayed for cortisol and had previously undergone one freeze-thaw cycle. Stability of cortisol was confirmed in plasma for a time period greater than the duration of storage with up to three freeze-thaw cycles.</p><p>Serum was also obtained for assaying cortisol levels on Day 8 before and 30&#x000a0;min after low-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation.

Daily doses of prednisone up to 60&#x000a0;mg were generally well-tolerated and resulted in dose- and time-dependent effects on a number of biomarkers. As would be expected, a decrease relative to placebo was noted in biomarkers of bone formation (OC and P1NP), whereas there was an increase in a biomarker of bone turnover (uNTX). Also as expected, suppression of morning cortisol levels was seen at higher prednisone doses. Metabolic effects on glucose concentrations, OGTT, and triglyceride levels were modest and generally not statistically significant; however, adiponectin levels were significantly increased relative to placebo with higher prednisone doses by Day 8.</p><p>GCs are reasonably safe for short-term use. However, serious complications have often been reported with long-term use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In this study, inhibition of the HPA axis was evident by the potent, dose-dependent suppression of serum cortisol following the first dose of prednisone. As expected, with regard to the low-dose ACTH stimulation test, the subjects that took longer to return to normal were in the treatment groups that received the higher doses of prednisone in Period 3.</p><p>GCs are well known for their ability to affect circulating white blood cell profiles. It is generally acknowledged that administration of GC induces a transient fall in circulating lymphocytes, which is maximal 4&#x02013;6 h after administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], particularly if the drug is administered in the morning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; this is thought to arise mainly from a reduced efflux of lymphocytes from lymphoid organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The transient fall is followed by a subsequent return to normal values within 12&#x02013;24 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This was demonstrated in the present study, where all doses of prednisone reduced lymphocyte counts within 2&#x000a0;h, with maximum effect seen at 4&#x02013;8 h. Levels started to return towards normal by 8&#x000a0;h after dosing, and were close to baseline values by 24&#x000a0;h. Repeated dosing with prednisone resulted in dose-dependent increases in lymphocyte counts, with the stimulation maintained for doses &#x02265;10&#x000a0;mg on Day 8. The increases in lymphocyte count on the mornings prior to dosing were likely due to a rebound phenomenon reported previously for GCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Conversely, the dose-dependent decreases in eosinophils observed in the first 24&#x000a0;h continued through Day 8, albeit at a diminishing rate. The increased neutrophil counts observed following GC treatment are consistent with the literature, and are thought to be due to increased release from bone marrow and decreased movement out of the blood into tissue sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Osteoporosis, a condition characterized mainly by a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD), is a well-established side effect of chronic GC therapy. In fact, chronic use of GCs increases the already increased risk of osteoporosis in patients with RA by twofold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Some studies suggest that the associated fractures actually occur at higher BMD levels in patients treated with GCs than in patients not treated with GCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, low-dose GC therapy has been recognized to avert the deleterious effects of GCs seen at higher doses, possibly due its anti-inflammatory effect countering the bone loss caused by chronic inflammation; a literature review on the safety of long-term, low-dose GC therapy in patients with rheumatic diseases demonstrated that AEs can in fact be quite modest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. For example, the data from four extensively reviewed randomized controlled trials showed that BMD loss over 2&#x000a0;years of low-dose prednisone treatment is not significantly different from that with placebo. On the other hand, osteoporosis is still likely to be the most common side effect of chronic low-dose GC therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Many studies maintain the idea that reduced bone formation is predominantly responsible for the GC-associated bone loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. OC, an osteoblast-derived protein involved in bone formation, is routinely utilized as a biomarker because of its close association with BMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In this study, plasma OC levels were significantly reduced as early as 2&#x000a0;h after the first administered prednisone doses above 10&#x000a0;mg on Day 1. This decrease was maintained throughout Day 1 and, consistent with the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], throughout the treatment period. A similar trend was also observed for P1NP, another biomarker of bone formation. Furthermore, prednisone increased uNTX, a biomarker of bone loss. Taken together, these data support both decreased bone formation and increased resorption, and demonstrate dose- and time-dependent effects of daily prednisone. Interestingly, biomarkers of bone turnover are thought to be useful in predicting the rate of bone loss in postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In addition, some of these biomarkers, such as urinary C-telopeptide and free deoxypyridinoline, predict the associated threat of hip fracture independently of BMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], which is thought to be the most important predictor of osteoporotic fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It has also been reported that several of these markers, such as serum OC and the CrossLaps peptide of urinary C-telopeptide, may be used to monitor the efficacy of therapy in patients with osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, Garnero et al. reported that the rate of bone turnover plays an increasing role as a determinant of bone mass with increasing time following menopause, with high bone turnover being associated with low bone mass, and suggests that bone marker assessment may be useful in the evaluation of osteoporosis risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Thus, the bone biomarker data in the present study have potential predictive value for subsequent bone-related AEs of GCs.</p><p>This study carefully and thoroughly characterized the dose&#x02013;response of prednisone on two significant safety concerns associated with use of GC: HPA axis suppression and adverse effects on bone metabolism. The dose- and time-dependent responses to prednisone on the HPA axis and bone biomarkers can be used for comparison with novel glucocorticoid receptor agonists. To demonstrate preliminary evidence of dissociation, however, it is essential to characterize dose&#x02013;response for putative anti-inflammatory biomarkers of GCs. In healthy volunteers there is no ongoing inflammation that can be assessed for evidence of dose-dependent suppression. The effects on trafficking of circulating leukocytes may serve as a biomarker for anti-inflammatory effects in healthy volunteers. While not true anti-inflammatory biomarkers, they are likely to be associated with similar GC agonistic effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This characterization of the dose&#x02013;response of prednisone on various biomarkers of GC agonism provides important and relevant information on safety and PD responses associated with short-term prednisone dosing over the commonly used clinical dose range, and provides a reference for early clinical development of dissociated agents targeting a differentiated PD profile.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; AE, adverse event; BMD, bone mineral density; DAGR, dissociated agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor; GC, glucocorticoid; HPA, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal; MOS-Sleep, medical outcomes study: sleep scale; OC, osteocalcin; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test; P1NP, procollagen type 1&#x000a0;N-propeptide; PD, pharmacodynamics; POMS<sup>TM</sup>, profile of mood state; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; TEAE, treatment-emergent adverse event; uCR, urinary creatinine; uNTX, urinary N-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type 1 collagen</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the A9001309 study team as well as Charles Mebus, PhD, former DAGR Research Lead, Thomas C.
