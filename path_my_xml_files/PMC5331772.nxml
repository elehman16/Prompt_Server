HIIT includes short-term intensive activities (6 s&#x02013;4 min) with high intensity (&#x02265;90% of maximum aerobic capacity) and active or passive short-term recovery intervals.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The influence of HIIT on inflammatory markers shows contradictory results in literature, while some indicate attenuation of inflammation and[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] others show no change.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It has been shown that 2 weeks of HIIT improved MCP-1 and oxygen consumption to a maximum level, without any change in serum IL-10 and ICAM-1 in obese and overweight men.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It has been shown that the main ginger elements such as gingerols (gingerol-6, -8, and -10) and shogaols (shogaol-6 and -8) reduced MCP-1 and ICAM-1 mRNA in different cells by the inhibition of nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) activation in response to inflammatory stimuli[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] while there are many reasons supporting the effectiveness of ginger on inflammatory indices; a few studies have reported contradictory results.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Although there are some evidences regarding the simultaneous implementation of ginger intake and physical activity on inflammatory indices, the outcomes are not in agreement.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Atashak <italic>et al</italic>. observed no change in levels of lipid profile after 10-week of progressive resistance training, together with ginger supplement.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In contrast, Ayaz and Roshan demonstrated reduced plasmatic levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein following physical exercise together with ginger supplement.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>However, the effect of ginger which has a potent anti-inflammatory effect has not been evaluated in HIIT, exclusively on ICAM-1, MCP-1, and IL-10 markers.

Regarding the effectiveness of intensive interval exercise and ginger consumption, our findings were consistent with other studies that showed a significant reduction in circulating MCP-1 in 12 overweight men following 2 weeks of HIIT on ergometer with 89.5% VO<sub>2</sub><sub>max</sub> and lack of a significant change in serum IL-10 and ICAM-1.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In addition, Bartlett <italic>et al</italic>. showed that 10 weeks of HIIT on ergometer reduced serum MCP-1 level in inactive 20&#x02013;60 years participants.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Reduction in MCP-1 might be as a result of decrease in PBF. In contrast, Ahmadizad <italic>et al</italic>. did not observe any change in young men's inflammatory indices after 6 weeks of HIIT.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The short length of training in the mentioned study may be the relevant cause of discrepancy.</p><p>Very few studies have dealt with the combined effect of exercises and ginger consumption on inflammatory indices.

Perhaps one can claim that in &#x0201c;exercise + ginger&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;ginger&#x0201d; groups, consumption of ginger (gingerol and shogaol) for 10 weeks has had decisive anti-inflammatory effects on nuclear transcription factor[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] resulting in insignificant reduction of ICAM-1 expression. A few studies, however, have reported different results.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] In these studies, participants were suffering from different disorders and pretest ICAM-1 values were two to three times more than present participants. While the participants in the current study were healthy and probably, the effects of exercise and ginger have little been observed.</p><p>It has been said that the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-10 relate to its capacity to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1 &#x003b2;, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, and MCP-1) from monocytes through decreasing NF-&#x003ba;B activity and increasing interleukin -1 receptor antagonist production.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] However, in the current study, decrease in MCP-1 was not parallel to IL-10 increase; perhaps this mechanism was not so effective.</p><p>Of course, some scholars hold that MCP-1 as potentially independent diagnostic index regarding CVDs.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] The other aspect of MCP-1 to carry out its pro-inflammatory role is the fatty tissue, which has been reported.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] MCP-1 is secreted from intestinal fatty tissue and attracts an increasing number of macrophages to the fatty tissue, thus, organizes the inflammatory process.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] MCP-1 reduction in the &#x0201c;exercise + ginger group&#x0201d; in the present study might be due to insignificant decrease of waist: Hip girth ratio and significant decrease of body fat. Regarding the relationship between aerobic fitness and improvement of inflammatory indices to lower CVDs, in the current study, significant improvement in VO<sub>2</sub><sub>max</sub>, probably related to the improvement of MCP-1 in the training groups. Frequent touching of legs with the ground and producing stress-fracture in legs because of brisk running is associated with muscular injuries and inflammation. Present exercise protocol was a form of intense-shuttle running, which is a reason for the insignificant reduction in ICAM-1 value.</p><p>An example of this phenomenon is seen in the study by Akimoto <italic>et al</italic>., which assessed the effect of different exercises on sICAM-1 in healthy men. Lack of change in serum ICAM-1 levels after an ergometer exercise, while increased values following endurance running have been observed. They suggested that exercises associated with muscular injuries and inflammation increased the plasma concentration of sICAM-1.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] However, it is certain that quality and intensity of exercising stimulus, individuals&#x02019; genetic flexibility, various exercise protocols, and other factors of lifestyle influence the interpretation of the obtained results.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>The significant increase observed in training groups, VO<sub>2</sub><sub>max</sub> compared to the &#x0201c;ginger group&#x0201d; is a reason supporting the beneficial effects of HIIT on exercise performance and recovering from CVDs. Butcher reported the effectiveness of such exercises on VO<sub>2</sub><sub>max</sub> of the old and youth through exercising for 2&#x02013;15 weeks.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Improved stroke volume relates to increased heart muscle contraction capacity during maximum pressure and increase in mitochondria biogenesis which are the main possible mechanisms of VO<sub>2</sub><sub>max</sub> advance as a result of HIIT protocols.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The main characteristic of interval exercises, which makes it more valuable than continuous ones, is their more energy outcome of peripheral muscles without interfering with cardiopulmonary increasing capacity. The recovery intervals between intensive activity intervals, while reforming phosphocreatine and myoglobin stores influences the blood lactate concentration through delectating it.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Therefore, interval exercises compared with continuous ones with the same volume can impose maximum pressure on peripheral muscles and oxygen delivery organs without employing anaerobic metabolism and lactic acid concentration. Increased VO<sub>2</sub><sub>max</sub> is of value because weak VO<sub>2</sub><sub>max</sub> predisposes individuals to cardiovascular mortality.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>A 10-week intensive interval exercise, by itself or together with ginger supplement, improved MCP-1 and VO<sub>2</sub><sub>max</sub> in overweight women; without any significant effect on sICAM-1 and IL-10.
