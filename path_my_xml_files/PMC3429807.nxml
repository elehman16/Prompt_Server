The single most effective tool in reducing death due to cervical cancer is the use of pap smear as a screening tool.

The samples were randomly divided in two groups (35 in intervention group and 35 in control group). There was no difference between the two groups in age, job, and education level. A self-administered questionnaire was designed by the researchers. The questionnaire was divided into four sections: demographic data (3 questions), knowledge (21 questions), HBM model constructs (57 questions) including 15 questions on perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, each part (5 questions), perceived barriers (8 questions), cues to action (3 questions), and practice (1 question). Likert scoring method was used to assess the answers as follows: (certainly agree = 4, agree = 3, no idea = 2, disagree = 1, and certainly disagree = 0) and the score range for every section was 0 to 100.</p><p>For knowledge section, one score was given to each correct answer. The score for wrong answers was zero. Finally, practice and behavior of participants were assessed by yes and no question.</p><p>We allocated score 1 and 0 to yes and no answers about practice, respectively.</p><p>The reliability of questionnaire was determined by Cronbach's alpha, which was in the range of 0.60&#x02013;0.83.</p><p>The questionnaires were distributed in two groups one week before the intervention and one month after the intervention. Interventions were run based on Health Belief Model during three sessions in health center only for intervention group. In first session, health educator informed them about cervical cancer and causes of this cancer and tried to promote perceived susceptibility and severity in women by showing cancer patients film. In second session, health educators and midwifery specialist conduced group discussion about the benefit and barriers to give pap smear test, also we used film about pap smear steps to decrease women's fear about test. Finally, specialist informed their family as their mothers and husbands about the necessity of having pap smear test for women. Women in both groups were intimated with detail of the study and were asked to read and sign a consent form.</p><p>Each educational session lasted 45&#x02013;60 min. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (version 18). Comparison between two groups was done by independent <italic>t</italic>-test. Paired <italic>t</italic>-test analysis was used for comparison in one group before and after intervention. A two-tailed <italic>P</italic> value lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 70 married women entered the study.

Other studies confirm this matter.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>Considering to the impact of knowledge on practice, lack of knowledge about benefits and the purpose of the pap smear can be known as the reason for poor practice of pap smear. Consistent with our study findings, Hazavehei and colleagues have also known the lack of knowledge as one of the reasons of not doing the test.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] After educational intervention, the level of knowledge improved significantly that is emphasized on the impact of the education on knowledge. Our study findings confirmed by other similar studies in our country.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Park study has also confirmed the impact of educational intervention on increasing women's knowledge and participation in cervical cancer screening program.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>Following the intervention, the mean score of perceived susceptibility has been increased in the intervention group, but we are facing a decrease in the perceived susceptibility in control group. This significant difference indicates that educational intervention on the basis of Health Belief Model causing women to be awarded of being susceptible to cervical cancer. Significant increase in perceived susceptibility also emphasized by Hazavehei, Yakhfrooshha, and Shojaeezadeh studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>In contrast with our findings in park and colleagues study, the perceived susceptibility in both intervention and control groups did not have any effect on participating in cervical cancer screening program. They considered insufficient intervention time for changing the attitudes to be the reason.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>With regards to perceived severity, the mean scores increased in intervention group following education program. That is, educational intervention based on HBM increased perceived severity regarding cervical cancer, which is similar with the result of other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>Based on our study findings, perceived benefits in both groups were desirable before the intervention. This showed that women in both groups were aware of the resulted benefits from doing pap smear. These findings were also proved by other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] The emphasis on perceived benefits has been emphasized in another study for women persuasion to do the test.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</p><p>According to the findings, difference between intervention and control groups about perceived barriers was not significant before the intervention, but educational intervention increased perceived barriers in intervention group. These findings were supported by Mc Farland and colleagues study who stated that the women, who had more barrier perception, had less performance regarding doing pap smear test during past 5 years.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Psychological barrier like fear and embarrassment have been the most important barriers in women in lee study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] It may refer to effectiveness of educational intervention based on the Health Belief Model that has caused the individuals in the intervention group to overcome to barriers. In the other performed studies based on the model, the education has been able to reduce the barrier on performing the health activities.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>]</p><p>In relation to cues to action in the intervention group, 42.86% have chosen the health staff as the performance guide which has been increased to 57.14% after education. This is similar with the results of Enjzab and colleague study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] In Akbari study women who have done the pap smear test regularly have considered the health care providers encouragements as the most important cues to action[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] In the present study, majority of participants (97.4%) in intervention group have done the test after intervention and the only one person avoided doing the test because of financial ability to pay the cost. This indicates that financial support and providing free or low cost services can improve health behavior of women regarding doing pap test. Also, in control group, after the intervention, one person (2.85%) has done the test due to the sensitivity resulted from answering the questionnaire. This study reveals the considerable increase in intervention group practice as a result of educational intervention, which were also proved in other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] As general, the results of the study imply that education based on Health Belief Model lead to giving pap smear test in women. By considering the benefit of giving pap smear as a useful screening tools, educational intervention based on Health Belief Model is recommended in health centers. The study was limited to women who referred to the health centers and had a limited number of participants too. Further research must have participants from different groups of women, increasing the number of participants would also allow for a more robust evaluation and analysis. This study had pre- and postintervention measurements at two times, which showed only the short-term effects of the intervention.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The
