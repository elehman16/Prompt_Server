We evaluated the usefulness of crossword puzzles as a self-learning tool to help pharmacology students to remember drug names. We also measured the students&#x02019; satisfaction with this learning method. This was an open-label randomized, two-arm intervention study, conducted with II MBBS students (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;70), randomly selected and assigned to two groups A (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;35) and B (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;35). Two self-learning modules containing crossword puzzles with antihypertensive and antiepileptic drug terms were prepared and pre-validated. Hard copies of both crossword puzzles were administered to Group A (Intervention group) on two different occasions. One hour was allotted to solve a puzzle. Students were allowed to refer to their textbooks. Group B (Control group) underwent the self-learning module without the crossword puzzles. In both groups, pre- and post-test knowledge was assessed. Students&#x02019; perceptions of the crossword puzzles were assessed using a pre-validated 10-item questionnaire. Responses to items 1&#x02013;8 were recorded using a 5-point Likert scale. Responses to item 9 were recorded on a 10-point rating scale while item 10 was an open&#x02013;ended question. The crossword completion index was 92.86&#x000a0;%. In group A, the average pre-test score was 6.09 whereas the average post-test score was 12.87 (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). In group B, average pre- and post-test scores were 6.03 and 9.74, respectively. A significant difference (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) was observed between the post-test scores of the two groups. The absolute learning gain was 33.9&#x000a0;% in Group A and 18.55&#x000a0;% in Group B. The response rate for the questionnaire was 100&#x000a0;%. Of the students, 71.43&#x000a0;% strongly agreed that crossword puzzles enhanced their knowledge of antihypertensive and antiepileptic drugs and were helpful for remembering and recalling the drug names, 60&#x000a0;% students found it challenging and a good problem solving activity and 85.71&#x000a0;% students opined that it was a good self-learning, recreational activity. The test scores improved when crossword puzzles, designed to improve retention of drug names, were incorporated in the self-study modules of pharmacology training. Students rated the crossword puzzles as a challenging and effective self-learning tool. Students&#x02019; acceptability for crossword puzzles further favours their usefulness as a self-learning tool. The crossword puzzle is an effective tool for &#x02018;recreational learning&#x02019; and can be used as an active learning strategy to promote self-directed learning.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Crossword puzzles</kwd><kwd>Self-learning</kwd><kwd>Active learning</kwd><kwd>Pharmacology</kwd><kwd>Recreational learning</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; the authors 2012</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Teaching&#x02013;learning methods are broadly classified as teacher controlled and learner controlled methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Among the various learner controlled methods, self-learning methods have their own importance and relevance. Various studies in medical education have shown that self-learning methods should be incorporated into the teaching&#x02013;learning process to make learning more effective, efficient and meaningful.</p><p>Self-learning promotes active learning and critical thinking which in turn enhances self-reliance and in this process teachers can manage their time effectively to reinforce knowledge and skills. Moreover, for students, learning on their own can be an enjoyable experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Active learning strategies have their own benefits which primarily include fostering development of critical thinking, communication, cooperative learning skills and attitudes and values; promoting concept formation; providing an avenue for discovering misconceptions; and increasing motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Various formats of interactive games [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and puzzles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] have been advocated by researchers as active learning strategies which create an interactive learning experience by transforming inactive learning material into learning episodes where the learners are active players and participants.</p><p>Crossword puzzles are commonly found in newspapers and magazines. Crossword puzzles have also appeared in medical and nursing journals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] to review and summarize information in an engaging manner.</p><p>However, they have not yet been well explored as a self-learning tool in pharmacology. Pharmacology is a subject in the Second Professional MBBS course of the Indian medical curriculum (II MBBS). During the II MBBS course in pharmacology, students get acquainted with the core areas of this subject such as drug classification, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles of drugs, therapeutic uses, adverse effects and contraindications of drugs.</p><p>The students often perceive pharmacology as a &#x02018;Volatile Subject&#x02019;. Students are introduced to newer terms and concepts in pharmacology and it has been observed that students often find it difficult to remember and recall drug names. Hence, reinforcement of key concepts is essential to increase understanding, learning and retention.</p><p>Crossword puzzles stimulate the mind, increase the vocabulary and help to develop healthy scepticism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, instead of passive memorization of material, crossword puzzles can be beneficial as a self-learning tool to promote active learning and to develop critical thinking.

Based on these suggestions, two self-learning modules containing crossword puzzles with antihypertensive and antiepileptic drug terms were prepared. Modules of 1-day duration were designed. Two didactic lectures of 1&#x000a0;h each had already been given on antihypertensive drugs and antiepileptic drugs.</p><p>The crossword puzzle clues (Across and Down) were verified from the standard textbooks of pharmacology.

The responses to items 1&#x02013;8 were recorded on a 5-point Likert scale (1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;strongly disagree to 5&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;strongly agree) while responses for item 9 were recorded on a 10-point scale (1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;not useful to 10&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;very useful). Item 10 was an open&#x02013;ended question and students were asked to give their comments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Crossword activity</title><p>The selected 70 students were further divided into high achievers (16), moderate achievers (34) and low achievers (20), based on their performance in first part of the completion test in pharmacology. According to our university criteria, we defined high achievers as students who score &#x0003e;75&#x000a0;%, moderate achievers as those with a score between 40 and 74.9&#x000a0;% and low achievers with a score &#x0003c;40&#x000a0;%. The students from these subgroups were then randomly assigned to two groups, Group A (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;35) and Group B (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;35) using a simple lottery method (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Thus, the two groups comprised an approximately equal number of high, moderate and low achievers, making them similar prior to intervention. These students were briefed about the study and the objectives of the study were explained.

In both groups, pre- and post-test assessment was done. As neither of the groups in the study should miss out on this innovation in medical education, Group B students (Control group) were able to do the crossword puzzles after the post-test. Students&#x02019; perceptions about crossword puzzles as a self-learning tool in pharmacology were only recorded for the intervention group, using a pre-validated questionnaire as described above (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Schematic presentation of crossword puzzle activity</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40037_2012_33_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>The crosswords for the two modules (antihypertensive drugs and antiepileptic drugs) were taken on two different occasions.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>Quantitative and qualitative data analysis was carried out.

Pharmacology is a fact-filled subject in the second professional MBBS course in the Indian medical curriculum. Students often find it difficult to understand concepts in pharmacology when they move from the first to the second professional level (II MBBS). Problems in recalling drug names during viva-voce of pharmacology are a routine observation by faculties. McDonald and Saarti [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] also mentioned that learning a fact-filled subject such as pharmacology should be less of a chore and more of a pleasurable experience. Active learning strategies in pharmacology may overcome these problems. Various educational researchers have advocated incorporation of active learning strategies into the curriculum to improve understanding and learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Self-directed learning promotes active learning and develops critical thinking. We used crossword puzzles in pharmacology as a self-learning tool to promote active learning. The objectives of this study were to evaluate their usefulness and students&#x02019; perception towards this innovation.</p><p>This study concludes that in pharmacology the crossword puzzle is a useful self-learning tool. Effectiveness of this intervention was evident from improved post-test scores, absolute and relative learning gain and class-average normalized gain and students&#x02019; acceptability towards this innovation.</p><p>We evaluated the effectiveness of crossword puzzles in pharmacology using pre-test, post-test and learning gain. Although an improvement in the post-test score was observed in both groups, absolute as well as relative learning gain was observed to be greater in the intervention group as compared with the control group. In addition, class-average normalized gain in the intervention group was more than 0.3 (30&#x000a0;%).</p><p>Class-average normalized gain (g) has been used as a measure of effectiveness of an educational intervention by various researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Hake (2002) stated that class-average normalized gain offers a comparative measure for course effectiveness over diverse student populations with widely varying average pre-test scores. Thus, it diminishes the confounding effect of pre-course knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Hence, we used class-average normalized gain (g) as a measure of effectiveness for our educational intervention, in addition to learning gain. Hake categorized a class-average normalized gain of 0.1&#x02013;0.29 as low gain (g), 0.3&#x02013;0.69 as medium gain and 0.7&#x02013;1.0 as high gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In our study, we observed the class-average normalized gain (g) of 0.4872 (48.72&#x000a0;%) in the intervention group as compared with 0.2656 (26.56&#x000a0;%) in control group. That means that the intervention group had an average gain of 48.72&#x000a0;% of the maximum possible average gain. Thus, according to Hake&#x02019;s criteria, the crossword puzzle in pharmacology was a moderately effective educational intervention in the form of a self-learning tool.</p><p>A literature search showed that none of the studies in medical education used a randomized control design and pre-test/post-test analysis as measure to determine effectiveness of crossword puzzles. Hence, no previous data are available for comparison. However, a randomized control design and pre-test/post-test analysis was used to evaluate the crossword puzzle as a tool to improve the vocabulary mastery of eighth grade students at a high school in Riau, which showed improved vocabulary in the intervention group as compared with the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Pre-test/post-test measurement in an educational intervention is often associated with extraneous variables such as history (any event, other than the planned treatment event that occurs between the pre- and post-test measurement and has an influence on the dependent variable); testing (any change on the second administration of a test as a result of having previously taken the test); differential attrition (differential loss of participants from the various comparison groups); Hawthorne effect (knowing that he/she is being tested may affect the results) and halo effect (human tendency to respond positively or negatively to a situation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These extraneous variables are threats for the internal validity of results, and results of educational research involving evaluation of knowledge gain out of educational intervention may be affected. However, the threats such as history, testing, Hawthorne effect and halo effect do not affect two-group or multi-group designs. In our study, we used a two-group design. Pre-test, post-test and self-learning modules with intervention were administered on the same day. Significant gains in the post-test score would not be possible without intervention in this type of short duration course module. In addition, the randomized controlled design of our study further reduces the risk of such threats. Hence, we argue that many of these threats did not influence our educational intervention.</p><p>Effectiveness of the crossword puzzle as a self-learning tool is sustainable due to the positive feedback received from the students. Students&#x02019; feedback indicated that they enjoyed this new teaching&#x02013;learning activity. Thorndike&#x02019;s law of effect states that responses that are made just prior to pleasant events are more likely to be repeated and learnt. The crossword puzzle activity was a pleasurable experience for the students. They perceived crossword puzzles as a challenging, problem solving, useful, and recreational tool for learning. Hence, we can argue that retention was better in the intervention group as compared with the control group. As far as students&#x02019; perceptions towards this tool are concerned, our findings were consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Students have suggested that they should have been pre-informed about the crossword puzzle activity. Nevertheless, we deliberately used this strategy of not pre-informing to avoid any confounding effect of pre-knowledge on pre-test/post-test analysis. A few students felt that the crossword puzzles used in this study were less problem solving and challenging as evident from their suggestion to use more extensive clues. This is useful feedback for us to prepare crossword puzzles with different difficulty levels.</p><p>Crossword puzzles have a unique feature of self-correcting due to the length of each word and overlap of each answer from the other answer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This unique feature helps students to correct their mistakes instantaneously. This develops their critical thinking and helps them retain the knowledge gained. Bailey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] developed educational puzzles as a supplementary tool to promote learning, enhance problem-solving skills to complement the information provided through traditional teaching. They also found crossword puzzles a useful and fun learning tool to evaluate their own knowledge. Saxena et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] described crossword puzzles as useful for assessing near transfer, which is called for when students encounter problems very similar to the problems they worked on during the learning stage. In our study, students&#x02019; performance improved after the intervention. Hence, we can claim the crossword puzzle as a useful inventory of active learning methods.</p><p>The important parameters considered for successful implementation of an educational intervention are its utility (effectiveness), acceptability and feasibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The crossword puzzle in pharmacology as a self-learning tool was well perceived by the students. Crossword puzzles were helpful for revising learnt topics, for remembering and recalling drug names and were perceived as a recreational method of learning in a non-threatening environment by the students. These strengths indicate students&#x02019; acceptability of this self-learning tool.</p><p>Although preparing topic-specific crossword puzzles is somewhat time-consuming, the advantage is that this intervention is easy to implement. Tutorials and small group teaching can be conducted using this intervention. Crossword puzzle activities are easy to implement either using hard copies (as described in the study) or electronically. A range of software is available on the internet to prepare an electronic form of crossword puzzle. Moderate effectiveness of crossword puzzles and their acceptability by students favour their usefulness as a recreational self-learning tool in pharmacology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Crossword puzzles in pharmacology were found to be a useful self-learning tool. Test scores improved when crossword puzzles, designed to improve the retention of drug names, were incorporated in self-study modules. Students rated this activity highly. Students perceived the crossword puzzles as a challenging and effective self-learning tool. Students&#x02019; acceptance of the crossword puzzles further favours their usefulness as a self-learning tool. The crossword puzzle is an effective tool for recreational learning and can be used as an active learning strategy to promote self-directed learning.</p></sec><sec
