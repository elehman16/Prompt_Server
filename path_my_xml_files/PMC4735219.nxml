Following on from the Turrisi trial of once-daily versus twice-daily (BD) concurrent chemoradiotherapy, there is a real need for a new phase III trial using modern conformal RT techniques and investigating higher once-daily radiation dose. This trial has the potential to define a new standard chemo-RT regimen for patients with LS-SCLC and good performance status.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>447 patients with histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of SCLC were recruited from 74 centres in eight countries between 2008 and 2013.

Outcome is poor even in this early stage of disease, with a median survival of 16&#x02013;24&#x02005;months, using current forms of treatment.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> Combining chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy (RT) is the standard treatment for LS SCLC). Two meta-analyses have shown that RT associated with chemotherapy improves median survival, 3-year survival rate and local control.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Subsequently, meta-analyses of trials investigating the optimal timing and sequencing of chemo-RT have shown that the best results have been reported with early concurrent thoracic RT.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;9</xref> Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that twice-daily RT is superior to once-daily RT, in the landmark Turrisi study.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Patients were randomised to either 45&#x02005;Gy once-daily (1.8&#x02005;Gy per fraction) over 5&#x02005;weeks or 45&#x02005;Gy given twice-daily (1.5&#x02005;Gy per fraction) over 3&#x02005;weeks. In both arms, RT was given concurrently starting with the first cycle of chemotherapy (cisplatin and etoposide). Twice-daily RT improved 5-year OS (26% vs 16% in the once-daily arm), reduced the risk of thoracic relapse (52% compared with 36% in the twice-daily arm) but at the cost of increased grade 3 radiation oesophagitis (defined as inability to swallow more than liquids, or to require hospitalisation). However, there were no other significant differences in acute toxicity between the two arms and no long-term oesophageal strictures were reported. Consequently, twice-daily RT concurrently with chemotherapy is accepted as a standard regime in LS-SCLC.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> It is, however, unclear whether the better results in the twice-daily arm are explained by the increase in the biologically equivalent dose of radiation in the twice-daily arm or by the use of altered fractionation leading to a shorter overall treatment time. Indeed, the control dose was considered to be quite low, for example, in comparison with the NCI Canada regime of 40&#x02005;Gy in 15 daily fractions.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Moreover, since the late 1980s, when the Turrisi trial was designed, important progress has been made in RT techniques. The RT used in any contemporary trial should be CT-planned, conformal treatment, with individual field shaping careful dose calculation using modern planning algorithms of target and organs at risk, with image guidance, correction of set-up errors and allowance made for the effects of respiratory motion on the position of the target volume. None of these were routine from 1989&#x02013;1992, when the Turrisi trial was carried out. The use of three-dimensional RT/intensity modulated RT and the omission of elective nodal irradiation are likely to result in lower rates of toxicity, particularly oesophagitis. Further studies by Choi <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> using once-daily RT, and Komaki <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> using a concomitant boost technique, have suggested that doses of 70&#x02005;Gy over 7&#x02005;weeks and 61.8&#x02005;Gy over 5&#x02005;weeks, respectively, are possible, the former being delivered in five cycles of full-dose chemotherapy.</p><p>There is, therefore, a need to improve on the current survival results, and a strong rationale to compare twice-daily with a higher dose of radiation delivered once-daily.</p><p>In view of the lack of data in the literature addressing the question of the dose and fractionation for LS-SCLC, we carried out a randomised phase III trial to establish a standard chemo-RT regimen for LS-SCLC with good performance status (PS) (Concurrent ONce-daily VErsus twice-daily RadioTherapy, CONVERT). At the time the trial was being developed, in 2006&#x02013;2007, there were no international trials for this group of patients, thus an opportunity existed to set up a global trial to answer this important question. The results of the trial will be crucial in determining the best international standard treatment for routine clinical use in the treatment of patients with limited-stage SCLC and good PS. In addition, the translational studies carried out in parallel with CONVERT will indicate those hypotheses needing testing in the next generation of trials in this disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The CONVERT trial is an international, multicentre, prospective, non-blinded, superiority randomised controlled trial.

It is usually diagnosed on a small biopsy specimen or fine needle aspirate insufficient for detailed molecular studies. Consequently, existing SCLC tumour banks include relatively small series (&#x0003c;100 patients) of samples collected over many years from patients who are heterogeneous with respect to stage and treatment received. The CONVERT trial provides a unique opportunity to prospectively collect a large number of biospecimens from patients of uniform (limited) stage, who are exposed to the same chemotherapy, treated with one of two RT schedules and for whom there will be robust clinical outcome data.

Using Freedman's sample size calculation based on a two-arm trial, with a 5% significance level, two-sided test, 80% power and HR of 0.70, a 12% overall survival benefit at 2&#x02005;years from 44% with the control arm to 56% in the experimental arm, required a total of 506 patients. The number of deaths required is 247. An additional 5% was added to allow for ineligible patients, giving a total of 532 patients required. An additional 15 patients were recruited (total of 547) to replace patients either randomised in error or for whom we were never able to obtain data.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Statistical analysis plan</title><p>The analysis will be based on intention-to-treat principles (ITT). Patient data will be grouped by treatment arm according to the treatment assignments made via the MAHSC-CTU randomisation line. The primary data analysis is planned for January 2015.</p><p>The stratification factors include centre, PS (0&#x02013;1 vs 2) and biochemical factors (eg, LDH, sodium, alkaline phosphatase). Comparison of data by centre will be scrutinised to identify any data inconsistencies, it will also be used to identify those centres planning to give either four or six cycles of chemotherapy. Analysis will be carried out to identify any differences between the two schedules. Other factors have been identified in previous studies to be prognostic factors and will be used to calculate the Manchester score, which gives three groupings of good, intermediate and poor prognosis; these scores will be used to compare OS and response rate.</p><p>The only planned interim analyses have been performed for the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). Reports have been submitted to the IDMC on an annual basis starting 12&#x02005;months after the first patient was randomised.</p><p>The following are the qualifications for analysis of time-to-event efficacy parameters:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>All randomised patients will be included in the analysis of overall survival (OS) and local progression free survival (ITT).</p></list-item></list></p><p>OS is the time between date of randomisation and date of death of any cause. Survivors will be censored on the last date known to be alive. Local progression-free survival (local control) will be calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of first clinical evidence of progressive disease at the primary site, or death. Kaplan-Meier curves will be drawn for each treatment group. Overall survival and local progression-free survival will be compared using the Mantel-Cox version of the log rank test.

The proportion of patients experiencing a grade of 3 or above acute toxicity, including acute and/or late radiation morbidity, will be compared between the treatment groups using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> and Fisher Exact tests. Acute toxicity will be defined as toxicities occurring from commencement to 3&#x02005;months after completion of treatment; late toxicity will be defined as toxicities occurring between 3&#x02005;months and 2&#x02005;years after completion of treatment.</p><p>All patients treated with at least one dose of cisplatin and etoposide will be evaluated for tumour response and included in the analysis of tumour response rates. Response will be assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) criteria. The proportion of patients in each treatment group whose best response (up to approximately 28&#x02005;days postcycle 4 or, if stopped prior to cycle 4, approximately 28&#x02005;days after last chemotherapy cycle given) from randomisation is complete or partial will be compared using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> and Fisher Exact tests.</p><p>Safety analyses will be performed for all randomised patients treated with at least one dose of chemotherapy. Adverse effects will be summarised and compared between the two arms.</p><p>The relative chemotherapy and RT dose intensity (RDI) will be summarised by calculating the median, SD, IQR and range for patients in each randomised treatment group.
