Adherence to more complicated basal&#x02013;bolus regimens may be challenging. These regimens have an increased risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain, and both patients and health care providers may be reluctant to intensify therapy despite being clinically indicated. Even adherent patients with seemingly adequate glycemic control measured by hemoglobin A1C (A1c) may experience significant glucose excursions over 24 hours, at least in part due to elevations in postprandial glucose (PPG). Although it is not yet established that reduction of postprandial glycemia alone is sufficient to reduce the risk of vascular disease in people with diabetes, the total amount of time spent under conditions of hyperglycemia is an important determinant for development of diabetes complications.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1932296815610124" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-1932296815610124" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr5-1932296815610124" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr6-1932296815610124" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr7-1932296815610124" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr8-1932296815610124" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Thus, a treatment that helps address both fasting and postprandial control should be more effective in reducing the amount of time spent in the hyperglycemic state.</p><p>Accordingly, treatment incorporating several different classes of drugs with complementary modes of action may be the preferred strategy in T2D.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1932296815610124" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-1932296815610124" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The combination product insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira; Xultophy&#x000ae;, Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) has been developed for the treatment of T2D to take clinical advantage of the complementary modes of action of its individual components, the once-daily basal insulin with long duration of action, insulin degludec, and the once-daily, long-acting human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog liraglutide.

IDegLira was initiated at 10 dose steps (10 units insulin degludec plus 0.36 mg liraglutide) and insulin degludec was initiated at 10 units. On the basis of prebreakfast SMBG measurements (mean of 3 consecutive days), IDegLira and insulin degludec doses were titrated stepwise twice a week to an FPG target of 72-90 mg/dl; if blood glucose was &#x0003c;72 or &#x0003e;90 mg/dl, the IDegLira dose was decreased or increased by &#x000b1; 2 dose steps, respectively, and the insulin degludec dose was decreased or increased by &#x000b1; 2 units. IDegLira could be titrated to a maximum of 50 dose steps (50 units insulin degludec and 1.8 mg liraglutide), but there was no dose limit for insulin degludec. Liraglutide was initiated at 0.6 mg/day and increased by 0.6 mg per week, with the goal of eventually reaching 1.8 mg/day for all participants in this substudy by week 3.

Trial products and oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) were withheld on the day of the meal test until blood sampling had been completed (meal test duration of 4.5-5 hours). Blood samples for determination of plasma glucose (PG), insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon levels were taken at 9 time points in relation to the start of the test meal: &#x02013;10, +15, +30, +45, +60, +90, +120, +180, and + 240 minutes.</p><p>A central laboratory (Quintiles Limited, Kingston, UK) performed laboratory analyses for glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon.

AUC endpoints were log-transformed and analyzed separately using an ANCOVA model (hereafter the standard ANCOVA model), with treatment, country, baseline A1c stratum, and previous OAD treatment as fixed factors and the relevant log-transformed baseline value used as covariate.

Due to the magnitude and nature of missing data from iPro1 (which are assumed to be missing completely at random), the CGM results are based on observed values rather than imputing missing values, such as with using last observation carried forward (LOCF). Mean postprandial increment in interstitial glucose (iAUC<sub>0-4h</sub>) was calculated as the AUC above the premeal value from t = 0 to 4 hours (calculated using the trapezoidal method) divided by measurement time.

This is demonstrated by lower blood glucose levels with IDegLira during a standardized meal test following a single meal and by improved interstitial glucose profiles measured using CGM over 3 main meals. Compared to insulin degludec alone, which demonstrated a 4.1% decrease from baseline in PPG increment, the decrease with IDegLira was 21.6% versus 18.4% with liraglutide. These data are consistent with the 9-point SMBG profile results from the full analysis set for all (n = 1663) subjects in the main trial, which showed a greater reduction in PPG increment for IDegLira versus insulin degludec for each main meal as well as across all 3 meals, and a similar reduction compared to liraglutide used alone.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1932296815610124" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> These results are consistent with those from a study using a standardized meal test, at which both absolute and incremental PPG were reduced for liraglutide versus placebo.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1932296815610124" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> In this substudy (as in the main trial population), the more gradual titration with IDegLira was associated with a reduced incidence of gastrointestinal side effects compared to liraglutide alone.</p><p>One of the pathophysiological deficits in T2D is chronic hyperglucagonemia during fasting and postprandial states.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1932296815610124" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Liraglutide, like other GLP-1 analogs, has a stimulating effect on insulin secretion and an inhibitory effect on glucagon secretion, both in a glucose-dependent manner.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1932296815610124" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In this substudy, the postprandial glucagon response was similar in the IDegLira and insulin degludec groups. The glucagon response for IDegLira was statistically significantly lower compared to liraglutide, which may explain part of the glycemic superiority. However, the underlying mechanism for the improved PPG control with IDegLira versus insulin degludec observed in this substudy seems to be a stimulatory effect on endogenous insulin secretion, rather than enhanced glucagon suppression (since glucagon responses were similar). This notion is supported by indices of beta cell function (such as insulin secretion ratio and static index), which were improved for IDegLira versus insulin degludec but were similar compared with liraglutide at 26 weeks. The reason for the difference in glucagon responses between IDegLira and liraglutide could be the combination of 2 potential inhibitors of glucagon secretion in IDegLira. However, the precise interaction between the 2 cannot be determined from these experiments because of the varying dosing of the individual components in the 3 groups. Interestingly, analysis of the data from the placebo-controlled LIBRA trial indicated that the postprandial glucagonostatic effect of liraglutide observed after short-term treatment was lost with chronic administration in patients with a short duration of diabetes.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1932296815610124" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> However, the overall glycemic effects on insulin secretion, C-peptide response and reduction of glycemic excursion were accompanied with an expected improvement of glycemic control (as assessed by A1c and 2-hour glucose) in line with the well-established glycemic efficacy of liraglutide. More trials are needed to further explore these findings.</p><p>Demonstrating the PPG-lowering effect of liraglutide (alone or as part of IDegLira) after all meals and after individual meals throughout the day, in conjunction with showing indices of improved beta cell function (ie, static index and insulin secretion ratio), reinforce results previously reported using SMBG profiles.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1932296815610124" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The long duration of action of liraglutide (half-life 11-15 hours) contributes to blood glucose lowering across all main meals when administered once daily,<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1932296815610124" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> as opposed to short-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists, including exenatide (half-life 2.4 hours<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1932296815610124" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>) and lixisenatide (half-life 2-3 hours<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1932296815610124" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>) which, because of their rapid elimination, primarily target the meal immediately following product administration.

Due to the maintained benefits of liraglutide when used in a combination product with insulin degludec, IDegLira provides significantly better postprandial glycemic control following a mixed meal test than insulin degludec, which is at least partially explained by a higher endogenous insulin secretion and improved beta cell function with IDegLira. Because of the long duration of action of the liraglutide component of IDegLira, the effect on PPG is evident across all main meals, and IDegLira is able to achieve tighter glycemic control compared with either insulin degludec or liraglutide used alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section15-1932296815610124"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The improved control of PPG described for patients in this substudy is consistent with results from the full analysis set from the main DUAL I trial, which showed 81% of patients using IDegLira achieved A1c &#x0003c;7.0%, compared with 65% of patients using insulin degludec and 60% using liraglutide (both <italic>P &#x0003c;</italic> .0001 vs IDegLira).<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1932296815610124" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> That analysis also reported that more patients using IDegLira achieved glucose targets without increasing hypoglycemia and/or weight gain, compared to insulin degludec. Improved tolerability of IDegLira compared to its monocomponents, in conjunction with improved glycemic control during fasting as well as after meals, and the convenience of administering both drugs in a single injection, should be appealing to patients and providers alike.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Gary Patronek and Mark Nelson at Watermeadow Medical (funded by Novo Nordisk) for medical writing and editorial assistance.
