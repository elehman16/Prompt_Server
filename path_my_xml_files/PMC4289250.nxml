The study recruits patients in both Asia and Africa to ensure the relevance of its results to the populations in which the disease burden is highest. The 10-week mortality risk in the control group is expected to be between 30% and 50%, depending on location, and the target hazard ratio of 0.7 corresponds to absolute risk reductions in mortality from 30% to 22%, or from 50% to 38%. Assuming an overall 10-week mortality of at least 30% in our study population, recruitment of 824 patients will be sufficient to observe the expected number of deaths. Allowing for some loss to follow-up, the total sample size for this study is 880 patients. To generate robust evidence across both continents, we aim to recruit roughly similar numbers of patients from each continent. The primary end point is 10-week mortality.

It is the leading cause of death in HIV patients in Asia and Africa, affecting 3.2% of the HIV-infected population per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The incidence in these regions is the highest in the world; in Africa, more deaths are estimated to be due to CM than to tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The 90-day case-fatality rate is up to 55% in Asia and 70% in Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Despite improvements in access to HIV care, the WHO estimates that HIV/AIDS will be the leading cause of disease in middle- and low-income countries by 2015, and models suggest that, even if 80% access to HIV treatment is achieved by 2012, there will be 6.5 million AIDS deaths p.a. by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, CM is likely to remain a significant health burden for the foreseeable future.</p><p>No major advance has occurred in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis since the 1970s. The mainstays of induction therapy are drugs that are more than 50&#x000a0;years old (amphotericin B and flucytosine), although these are often poorly available where the disease burden is highest. Although amphotericin therapy is undoubtedly superior to fluconazole monotherapy, amphotericin combination therapy has only recently been shown to reduce mortality when compared with amphotericin monotherapy. Whereas effective antifungal therapy is the key, adjunctive treatments, which have been seen to have dramatic effects on mortality in other neurologic infections, are untested in cryptococcal meningitis. Given the high death rates in patients receiving current optimal treatment, and the paucity of new agents on the horizon, adjuvant treatments offer the greatest potential to reduce mortality in CM.</p><p>This study aims to reduce the death rate from CM. The principal research question is as follows: does adding dexamethasone to standard antifungal therapy for CM reduce mortality? In this double-blind placebo-controlled trial (DBRCT) patients will be randomised to receive either dexamethasone or placebo. Dexamethasone is a cheap, readily available, and practicable intervention.</p><p>This multicentre study recruits patients in both Asia and Africa to ensure the relevance of the study results in the populations in which the disease burden is highest.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Treatment of CM</title><p>Successful treatment of CM depends on effective antifungal therapy and successful management of complications, notably increased intracranial pressure (see Appendix 3). Antifungal treatment schedules for cryptococcal meningitis are not globally uniform but are affected by drug availability, costs, and human resources. The Infectious Diseases Society of America convenes an international panel to draw up treatment guidelines, most recently published in 2010, and the WHO currently has guidelines in development that will be specifically aimed at management in resource-poor countries. These conform closely to the IDSA guidelines. Treatment generally consists of a period of induction therapy by using high-dose or combination antifungal therapy (usually for 2&#x000a0;weeks), followed by a period of consolidation therapy of 8&#x000a0;weeks with fluconazole. After this time, provided that the patient has responded to treatment, secondary prophylaxis using lower-dose fluconazole is given to prevent disease relapse. It is generally considered safe to stop secondary prophylaxis if ARV therapy has resulted in suppression of the plasma viral load and immune reconstitution with recovery of the CD4 cell count to &#x0003e;100 cells/&#x003bc;l has lasted for at least 6&#x000a0;months).</p><p>Consistent with the local practices and the WHO and IDSA guidelines, in this study, patients will receive antifungal therapy consisting of amphotericin B (1&#x000a0;mg/kg/day) combined with fluconazole, 800&#x000a0;mg/day for 2&#x000a0;weeks, followed by fluconazole 800&#x000a0;mg/day for a further 8&#x000a0;weeks before switching to secondary prophylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Rationale for adjuvant treatment with dexamethasone</title><p>Several mechanisms exist through which dexamethasone may modify disease outcome in cryptococcal meningitis. Current IDSA guidelines suggest that corticosteroids may be beneficial in cryptococcal meningitis in patients who have cryptococcomas with mass effect, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or IRIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, corticosteroids have never been tested in a randomised controlled trial. Of note, 150 of 381 patients in the ACTG trial of combination antifungal therapy in cryptococcal meningitis received steroids during the study. The Graybill (2000) <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of these patients has some serious limitations (1997) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Steroids were prescribed at the discretion of the attending physician, and the reasons for prescription are unclear. The Graybill analysis was limited to just 41 of the 150 steroid recipients, and did not report their impact on mortality. Clinical success (defined as stabilisation or improvement at 2&#x000a0;weeks) was lower in the 41 steroid recipients analysed (66% versus 86%). Apparently worse mycologic outcomes in these 41 patients are impossible to interpret, because no adjustments were made for the antifungal therapy received, fungal load, or clinical severity at baseline, all of which are known to be important outcome predictors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The exclusion from the analysis of the vast majority of patients who received steroids means that it is impossible to draw robust conclusions about their effect and underlines the need for a trial.</p><p>In contrast with the article by Graybill, a study in HIV-uninfected patients with <italic>C. gattii</italic> meningitis found a 10-fold reduction in blindness in those who received steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, in tuberculous meningitis (TBM), a disease that shares pathophysiologic features with CM, dexamethasone has been shown to improve outcome (RR of death, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.92; <italic>P</italic> =0.01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In this RCT, conducted in Vietnam, 545 patients were recruited, of whom 98 were HIV infected. In addition to the reduced risk of death, fewer adverse events were found in patients receiving dexamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Potential mechanisms of action dexamethasone in CM</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Antiinflammatory action</title><p>Cryptococcal meningitis is a chronic granulomatous meningitis, with foci of inflammation in the basilar meninges, cerebral mass lesions, and a lymphocytic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The basilar meningitis leads to impairment of resorption of CSF, and this, along with physical blockage of CSF drainage by yeast cells and conglomerations of capsule, is believed to contribute to the increased intracranial pressure seen in the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The immune response in the mouse model mimics that seen in AIDS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The effect of antiinflammatory agents has been tested in this model. Reduction of inflammation prolongs survival in mice infected with a lethal dose of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Dexamethasone increases median survival from 19 to 26&#x000a0;days (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05), a benefit preserved when dexamethasone is combined with amphotericin B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Dexamethasone does not interfere with the pharmacologic properties of amphotericin or fluconazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moderation of the inflammatory response is postulated to be through microglial cells, a key in the immune response to CM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Reduction of cerebral oedema and brain swelling</title><p>Cerebral oedema is a key feature of CM, and cryptococcal capsule has been shown directly to induce cerebral oedema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent inducer of vascular permeability and angiogenesis, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of brain oedema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Elevated levels are seen in both the CSF and blood of HIV patients with cryptococcal meningitis, and cryptococcal capsule has been shown to induce VEGF production by monocytes, neutrophils, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a dose-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, this induction is significantly downregulated by dexamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Downregulation occurs at a range of concentrations consistent with those achieved in human dosing. A rat model of brain oedema suggests that the effect of steroids on oedema is mediated through the inhibition of VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Corticosteroids reduce vascular permeability and limit oedema, and inhibition of VEGF may explain the beneficial effect of steroid therapy in TBM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Reduction of intracranial pressure</title><p>Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is frequent in CM and is an important cause of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Dexamethasone reduces increased ICP in models of other brain infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The mechanisms are not clear, but through attenuation of inflammation, cerebral oedema, and restoration of the blood/brain barrier, it is plausible that dexamethasone may reduce increased ICP in CM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Modification of cerebral vasculitis</title><p>Cerebral vasculitis, frequently described in infections, is a recognised feature of CM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The pathophysiology of neurologic vasculitis is relatively well understood: the neurologic features arise principally through ischaemia and infarction secondary to inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In infections, the vascular insult may be mediated through any or all of vascular wall invasion, immune complexes, or cryoglobulins. Of these, both endothelial invasion and immune complex disease are described in cryptococcosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Steroids are an important therapeutic option in primary cerebral vasculitides, and their beneficial effect in TBM may be through an antivasculitic action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Attenuation of the vasculitis seen in CM may improve outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Potential harms of dexamethasone</title><p>Reported side effects of dexamethasone are well described and similar to those of other corticosteroids. Side effects include dysglycaemia, changes in mood, Cushing-like syndrome, gastrointestinal bleeding, immunosuppression, hypertension, and secondary hypoadrenalism. Side effects are more likely with higher doses (dexamethasone &#x02265;16&#x000a0;mg/kg/day) and longer courses of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Dexamethasone is frequently prescribed for patients with intracranial pathology, including infectious diseases, and in addition, data on adverse events are available from large RCTs of dexamethasone that have been completed in tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and acute bacterial meningitis (BM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In the BM trials, the duration of steroid therapy was 4&#x000a0;days, and in TBM, 6 to 8&#x000a0;weeks. In all these trials, adverse events, including potentially life-threatening adverse events such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were rare and were no more common in patients receiving dexamethasone compared with placebo.</p><p>In this study, patients will receive dexamethasone 0.3&#x000a0;mg/kg/day, reducing weekly over 6&#x000a0;weeks. This is the lower dose that was used in the TBM trial for patients with Grade I disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The risk and severity of any adverse events must be considered in the context of the high mortality seen in cryptococcal disease. Notably, dexamethasone has no mineralocorticoid effect and is not associated with hypokalaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Immunosuppression</title><p>Corticosteroids are immunosuppressive. It is possible that they may slow yeast clearance from CSF, and increase the risk of other infections. However, animal studies suggest that dexamethasone improves yeast clearance from CSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

All patients will be receiving either treatment doses of antifungal therapy or secondary prophylaxis doses during the 6-month period of follow-up. Although all patients will be encouraged to return to the study hospital in the event of illness during the 6-month follow-up period, it is possible that, because of their location, some patients will undergo treatment elsewhere where diagnostic facilities may be less developed. This episode may only be identified at the 6-month follow-up period. For this reason, a pragmatic definition of relapse will be used. This is defined as either intensification of antifungal therapy above that according to the study antifungal schedule, or readmission for treatment of cryptococcal disease. The main outcome measure will be the cause-specific hazard of relapse, taking into account the competing risk of death.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Health economics</title><p>If effective, the low cost of dexamethasone makes it promising as a cost-effective intervention in low-income settings. To assess this formally, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted in collaboration with the Health Economics Research Centre, University of Oxford. The objective of the analysis will be to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost per life year gained and cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained and per Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted of dexamethasone treatment compared with standard antifungal therapy for cryptococcal meningitis (CM).</p><p>The analysis will collect information during the study on resources used and direct and indirect costs, including health care costs (treatments, medications, consultations, initial and subsequent hospitalisations), and patient/family incurred costs (out-of-pocket costs, employment). Health-care resources used will be obtained primarily from trial case record forms. Unit costs will be obtained in each country from participating centres and national sources. Information on patient-employment status and costs will be obtained from patients by a small number of questions administered at recruitment and again at the final follow-up (10-week) visit. The main measures of effectiveness will be (a) life years gained (b) quality-adjusted life years gained (QALYs), estimated by using the EQ-5D instrument in official English, Vietnamese, and Thai languages in its three-level version, and (c) disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, which measures both years of life lost because of premature mortality and years lived with disability. Life years gained will be based on the primary outcome measure of survival at 10&#x000a0;weeks, extrapolated by using best estimates of longer-term survival in each country for HIV-infected adults. QALY and DALY estimates will adjust the life-year estimates by taking into account secondary end points, including blindness, deafness, and other neurologic disabilities that are important sequelae of cryptococcal disease. QALY adjustment will be done by using EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L responses, and DALY adjustment by using clinical judgment to align recorded morbidity with DALY states. The use of both approaches will provide internal validity checks and maximise opportunities to present relevant information to decision makers.</p><p>As unit costs, absolute risks, life expectancy, and other variables are likely to differ substantially across regions, separate cost-effectiveness estimates will be produced for Asia and Africa; however, a trial-wide estimate of effectiveness will be applied unless clear evidence exists of heterogeneity in effect across regions. All estimates of costs, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness will be reported with full recognition of uncertainty, including cost-effectiveness acceptability curve and sensitivity analyses around key parameters, including unit costs, long-term life expectancy, and disability adjustment.</p><p>The economic evaluation is concerned primarily with estimation of cost and outcome differences and cost-effectiveness rather than hypothesis testing, and a power calculation for a ratio statistic is likely to be highly uncertain, especially as the DALY/QALY measure (the denominator) will itself be a composite of survival and quality/disability adjustment. The proposed size of the study (880 patients) should permit cost differences of 12% or greater to be reliably detected by assuming a coefficient of variance of 60%.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec36"><title>Study design</title><p>A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with two parallel arms: dexamethasone versus placebo during the first 6&#x000a0;weeks of treatment.

Few good-quality data are available to enable prediction of the degree of adrenal suppression that occurs with corticosteroid therapy.

Examples of this are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><bold>Tuberculous meningitis:</bold> Dexamethasone has been demonstrated in a large randomised controlled trial to reduce the risk of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. If a patient develops TB meningitis, the study drug should be stopped, and the patient should receive the appropriate dosage of steroids according to the severity of the disease. This does not necessitate unblinding of treatment allocation.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Intracranial space-occupying lesion with mass effect:</bold> For example, a primary brain tumour such as CNS lymphoma. Space-occupying lesion with mass effect is generally considered to be an indication for steroid therapy. A typical dose would be dexamethasone, 4&#x000a0;mg, 4 times daily. The study drug should be stopped in all patients, and the patient should receive corticosteroid treatment as per local guidelines. This does not necessitate unblinding of treatment allocation.</p><p><bold>Note</bold>: a suspected cryptococcoma is not an indication to alter the study drug; we do not know whether dexamethasone is indicated in this case, and the study is testing this indication.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Severe pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP):</bold> All patients in the study must receive PCP prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole; this reduces the risk of developing PCP. However, PCP may still occur. Microbiologic confirmation of PCP is not always possible, and the diagnosis is often made on clinical grounds. The chest radiograph typically shows bilateral interstitial, often perihilar, shadowing. The differential diagnosis of this appearance includes bacterial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to cryptococcosis. The gold standard for diagnosis of PCP is to demonstrate the presence of <italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic> in bronchoalveolar lavage washings or in induced sputum samples. Severe PCP is confirmed when there is a typical clinical syndrome is present AND the arterial blood oxygen partial pressure (pO<sub>2</sub>) is less than 70&#x000a0;mm Hg (FiO<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;20%). Prednisolone (40&#x000a0;mg twice daily for 5&#x000a0;days, 40&#x000a0;mg once daily for 5&#x000a0;days, followed by 20&#x000a0;mg/day for 11&#x000a0;days), in combination with high dose co-trimoxazole, has been shown to reduce the risk of death from severe PCP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Where arterial blood gas measurement is not available, diagnosis of severe PCP should be made in accordance with local guidelines. In any patient in whom the diagnosis of severe PCP is made, the study drug must be stopped immediately, and the patient treated with prednisolone in conventional doses, and high dose co-trimoxazole as per local guidelines. This does not necessitate unblinding of treatment allocation.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Any changes to study medication will be recorded in the case-record form.</p></sec><sec id="Sec60"><title>Unblinding</title><p>Unblinding means revealing the identity of the study treatment (that is, dexamethasone or placebo). Treatment allocation should be unblinded only if knowing the treatment that a patient has been allocated will result in a change in the patient&#x02019;s management. The need to unblind is likely to be rare during the study. Unblinding a patient&#x02019;s treatment allocation does not enable us to tell if a particular adverse event is due to the investigational agent; that conclusion can be drawn only with an analysis of all available data, either at an interim safety analysis (which is done by the independent data and safety-monitoring board) or after the final analysis of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec61"><title>Process for unblinding</title><p>The decision whether to unblind should be discussed with the lead country investigator or the principal investigator, when possible. Unblinded treatment allocation should be held securely at each site and be available at all times. The responsibility to approve unblinding will be assigned to dedicated staff at each site.

If this occurs, the patient will be referred to standard clinical care facilities. The patient&#x02019;s withdrawal from the trial will not affect the access to the best standard of care within the local health system. With the agreement of the patient, clinical and laboratory assessment should be performed and recorded at the time of withdrawal. Patients may also decide to stop study treatment without withdrawing from the study, in which case, treatment will be adjusted as described later, and follow-up will continue as per the study schedule.</p><p>Provided no more than 4&#x000a0;days of study drug have been administered, if a patient wishes to withdraw, the study drug can be stopped immediately. If a patient has received 5 or more days of study drug, then it is possible that adrenal suppression has occurred, and the dose of dexamethasone should be tapered. Thus, if a patient wants to withdraw from the study, and has received 5 or more days of study drug, then the withdrawal phase of steroid dosing will be started immediately; the patient will be switched to the next dexamethasone dose in the steroid-dosing sequence. For example, if on day 16, a patient wants to leave the study, then he or she will be immediately switched to the next phase of steroid/placebo dose (3&#x000a0;mg/day), and the treatment tailed off according to the treatment schedule (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). This continuation of treatment after withdrawal will be fully explained in the informed-consent form. Follow-up will be according to clinical need. All patients in the study will be provided with steroid information cards in their own language. These will detail the need to reduce the dose gradually if they are to be stopped, and to inform other health care workers that they are taking dexamethasone, should they require treatment from a health care worker not involved with the trial. If the patient has an unscheduled period off treatment or not in follow-up, this should be recorded in the case-report forms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec64"><title>Definition and assessment of adverse events</title><sec id="Sec65"><title>Definition of adverse events</title><p>An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable event that occurs to a study participant during the course of the study, regardless of whether that event is considered related to the study drug.

In the event that an adverse event is not described within the CTCAE definitions, or a new AIDS-defining event, as defined in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>, the following generic severity grading will be used:</p><p><bold>Grade 1 Mild;</bold> asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.</p><p><bold>Grade 2 Moderate;</bold> minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)*.</p><p><bold>Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening;</bold> hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisation indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL**.</p><p><bold>Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences;</bold> urgent intervention indicated.</p><p>*Instrumental ADLs refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, and so on.</p><p>**Self-care ADLs refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.</p><p>Details on the grading of specific adverse events can be found in Appendix 6. [Note: &#x0201c;Life-threatening&#x0201d; as a severity grade is not necessarily the same as &#x0201c;life-threatening&#x0201d; as a &#x0201c;serious&#x0201d; criterion used to define a serious adverse event. The former is a &#x0201c;potential&#x0201d; threat to life, and the latter is an &#x0201c;immediate&#x0201d; threat to life.]</p><p>A <bold>laboratory abnormality</bold> must be recorded as a clinical adverse event only if it is associated with an intervention. Intervention includes, but is not limited to, discontinuation of a current treatment, dose reduction/delay of a current treatment, or initiation of a specific treatment. In addition, any medically important laboratory abnormality may be reported as an adverse event at the discretion of the investigator. This would include a laboratory result for which no intervention is needed, but the abnormal value suggests a disease or organ toxicity. Laboratory events will be graded according to CTCAE definitions.</p><p>If clinical sequelae are associated with a laboratory abnormality, the diagnosis or medical condition should be reported as the adverse event (for example, renal failure, haematuria), not the laboratory abnormality (for example, elevated creatinine, urine RBC increase).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec69"><title>Recording and reporting of adverse events and protocol violations</title><sec id="Sec70"><title>Adverse event recording</title><p>Grade 3 and 4 adverse events will be recorded in the case report form and entered into the study database. Grade 1 and 2 events will not be recorded, because in a severe disease such as CM, the number of low-grade adverse events is likely to be high, representing a large reporting burden, which may affect the quality of recording and reporting of more important grade 3 and 4 adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec71"><title>Adverse event reporting</title><p>Serious adverse events and serious unexpected adverse events will be <bold>reported</bold> to the Principal Investigator within 7&#x000a0;days of occurrence, or sooner, according to local requirements.

We have based our estimate of the effect size on data from tuberculous meningitis, which shares clinicopathologic features with CM. In a large RCT of dexamethasone to treat tuberculous meningitis in Vietnam, the hazard ratio (HR) for death was 0.69 at 9&#x000a0;months in favour of dexamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Most of this effect occurred during the first 3&#x000a0;months of treatment. The dose of dexamethasone we will test is the same as that used in that trial. Additionally, in a study of dexamethasone in bacterial meningitis in Vietnam, the HR was 0.43 in patients with microbiologically confirmed disease, and 0.59 in a study based in Europe, again in favour of dexamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. These analyses were all based on the intention-to-treat principle (including noncompliant patients), and it seems sensible to expect a similar rate of noncompliance in our study. Therefore, we believe a target hazard ratio of 0.7 in favour of dexamethasone to be reasonable for our trial.</p><p>To detect such a risk reduction of 30% with 80% power at the two-sided 5% significance level, a total of at least 247 deaths must be observed. Based on historical data and consultation with principal investigators from all study sites, the 10-week mortality risk in the control group is expected to be between 30% and 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and the target hazard ratio of 0.7 corresponds to absolute risk reductions in mortality from 30% to 22%, or from 50% to 38%. Assuming an overall 10-week mortality of at least 30% in our study population, recruitment of 824 patients is sufficient to observe the target number of deaths. Allowing for some loss to follow-up, the total sample size for this study is 880 patients.</p><p>A major aim of this trial is to generate robust evidence across both continents. To achieve this goal, we aim to recruit roughly similar numbers of patients from each continent.</p><p>Event-driven stopping of the trial after 247 observed deaths is not foreseen even if this should occur prior to recruiting 880 patients. Thus, the study will be conservatively powered if the study mortality is larger than 30%. For example, if overall mortality was around 50% and 412 deaths were observed during the study, power would increase to 95% for a true hazard ratio of 0.7 and to 83% for a true hazard ratio of 0.75.</p></sec><sec id="Sec75"><title>Analysis</title><sec id="Sec76"><title>Analysis of the primary end point and 6-month mortality</title><p>The analysis will be based on a stratified Cox proportional hazards model allowing for separate baseline hazards for each continent (Asia or Africa) and treatment allocation as the only covariate. The stratification is based upon the expectation of different mortalities in the control arm by continent but similar (relative) effects of the intervention across continents. The proposed test is essentially equivalent to using a stratified log&#x02012;rank test to compare the two treatment arms. We prefer to use the Cox model as it automatically provides treatment effect estimates and confidence intervals in addition to the <italic>P</italic> value.</p><p>In a second stage, overall survival will be modelled by using the Cox proportional hazards regression model with stratification by continent and the following covariates (in addition to the treatment group): country, baseline fungal load, Glasgow coma score less than 15, and ARV status at study entry (ARV na&#x000ef;ve or experienced).</p><p>Potential heterogeneity of the treatment effect will be assessed based on appropriate interaction (likelihood ratio) tests and the following predefined subgrouping variables:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Continent</p></list-item><list-item><p>Country</p></list-item><list-item><p>IDSA indications for steroid treatment at baseline (cryptococcoma with mass effect, acute respiratory distress syndrome or IRIS: yes or no)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Glasgow coma score &#x0003c;15 (yes or no)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Na&#x000ef;ve to ARVs at study entry versus on ARVS at study entry</p></list-item></list></p><p>All Cox regressions and sub-group analyses will be performed for the primary end point (10-week survival) as well as for 6-month survival. Kaplan-Meier plots and explicit survival estimates at 10&#x000a0;weeks and 6&#x000a0;months of follow-up will also be calculated for the full populations and for each continent separately.</p></sec><sec id="Sec77"><title>Analysis of secondary end points</title><sec id="Sec78"><title>Neurologic disability</title><p>The disability score at week 10 and month 6 of follow-up is defined as the higher (worse) of the &#x0201c;simple question&#x0201d; and the Rankin score assessed at that time point and will be categorised as good outcome, intermediate disability, severe disability, or death (in case the patient died before the respective time point) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] (also see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The proportion of patients with a good outcome will be compared between the two arms with a logistic regression adjusted for continent (in addition to the treatment arm). Patients lost to follow-up will be analysed according to their last recorded disability status. If the rate of patients lost to follow-up exceeds 10%, we will also perform an alternative analysis based on multiple imputation of missing values.</p></sec><sec id="Sec79"><title>Rate of CSF sterilisation during the first 2&#x000a0;weeks (based on available data from selected sites only)</title><p>Fungal decline in the first 14&#x000a0;days will be modelled with a joint model for longitudinal and survival data. The longitudinal part of the model will be a linear mixed-effects model with longitudinal log-CSF quantitative culture fungal counts as the outcome, continent and interaction terms between the treatment groups and the time since enrolment of the measurement as fixed covariates, and a random patient-specific intercept and slope. The survival part of the joint model models mortality up to 2&#x000a0;weeks depending on the treatment group, continent, and the patient-specific random intercepts and slopes. The survival part acts as a missing data mechanism to allow potentially informative truncation of quantitative count measurements due to death.</p><p>Longitudinal measurements of intracranial pressure during the first 2&#x000a0;weeks will be modelled in the same way.</p></sec><sec id="Sec80"><title>Adverse events</title><p>The frequency of serious and grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions as well as the frequency of specific adverse events will be summarised (both in terms of the total number of events as well as the number of patients with at least one event). The proportion of patients with at least one such event (overall and for each specific event separately) will be summarised and (informally) compared between the two treatment groups based on the Fisher Exact test.</p><p><bold>The rate of IRIS and the rate of relapse</bold> (defined as antifungal treatment intensification or re-treatment) will be modelled with cause-specific proportional hazards models stratified by continent, taking into account the competing risk of prior death. Cumulative incidence functions for the competing events will also be calculated and displayed by treatment arm. Secondary time-to-event end points (time to new AIDS-defining illness or death and time to new neurologic event or death) will be analysed with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models, as described for the primary end point expressed earlier. The proportion of patients with blindness or visual deficit will be compared between the two arms with a logistic regression (as for the proportion of patients with good disability described earlier).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec81"><title>Analysis populations</title><p>The primary analysis population for all analysis is the full analysis population containing all randomised patients except for those mistakenly randomised without CM. Patients will be analysed according to their randomised arm (intention-to-treat). In addition, the primary end point will be analysed on the per-protocol population, which will exclude the following patients: major protocol violations and those receiving less than 1&#x000a0;week of administration of the randomised study drug for reasons other than death.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec82"><title>Interim analysis and role of the Data Monitoring and Ethical Committee (DMEC)</title><p>An independent DMEC will oversee the trial. Unexpected serious adverse events with treatment allocation blinded will be reported to the DMEC within 10&#x000a0;days of occurrence and followed up until resolution. The DMEC will perform formal interim analyses after every 50 deaths. According to the sample-size calculations, we expect to observe around 247 deaths during the course of the study. Thus, four to five planned formal interim analyses after 50, 100, 150, 200, and (possibly) 250 deaths will take place.</p><p>At these interim analyses, the DMEC will receive a report including unblinded summaries of mortality, serious adverse events, grade 3 and 4 adverse events, and estimates of the rate of CSF sterilisation during the first 14&#x000a0;days (from selected sites only) by treatment arm. The report will be prepared by the DMEC statistician and distributed to all DMEC members for review. Based on these data, the committee will make recommendations on the continuation, cessation or amendment of the study. The study statistician will remain blinded throughout the study but will aid in setting up the code for generating the interim analysis summaries. The randomisation list will be sent to the DMEC statistician directly from the study central pharmacist.</p><p>Stopping for efficacy of dexamethasone at an interim analysis is foreseen only if the benefit of adjuvant treatment with dexamethasone is shown &#x0201c;beyond reasonable doubt.&#x0201d; The Haybittle-Peto boundary, requiring <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001 at interim analysis to consider stopping for efficacy, will be used as guidance. Stopping for harm of dexamethasone should be considered if an unfavourable trend emerges, sufficiently large to rule out a clinically relevant benefit of dexamethasone. Conclusive evidence that dexamethasone is harmful is not sought, as continued exposure of patients to a nonbeneficial novel treatment that could be harmful appears to be unethical. To support the DMEC decision, the DMEC will receive conditional power curves in addition to the summaries described earlier. Conditional power assesses the probability that a benefit of dexamethasone will eventually be detected, conditional on the data accrued so far. If this probability is low for a wide range of reasonable assumed treatment effects (including the target hazard ratio of 0.7 from the original sample-size calculation), this suggests little reason to continue the trial because the treatment is unlikely to show benefit.</p><p>Importantly, the DMEC recommendations will not be based purely on statistical tables but will also use clinical judgment.</p><p>As the dissemination of preliminary summary data could influence the further conduct of the trial and introduce bias, access to interim data and results will be confidential and strictly limited to the involved independent statistician and the monitoring board, and results (except for the recommendation) will not be communicated to the outside and/or clinical investigators involved in the trial.</p><p>Further reviews will be at the discretion of the DMEC or the request of the Trial Steering Committee. All DMEC reports, replies, or decisions will be sent to the Trial Steering Committee and the responsible Research Ethical Committees.</p></sec><sec id="Sec83"><title>Ethical considerations</title><sec id="Sec84"><title>Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice</title><p>The Investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in compliance with the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki (Seoul 2008) and the Medical Research Council Guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (1998).</p></sec><sec id="Sec85"><title>Ethical review</title><p>The Oxford University Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OxTREC) is the ethical committee of reference for this trial.

Two interim analyses were made by an independent data monitoring and ethics committee, as predetermined, and on both occasions, it was concluded that the trial was being conducted well, and should continue. An investigators&#x02019; meeting was held in Vietnam to develop the collaborative network, share best-practice qualities, discuss recruitment strategies, and consider opportunities for substudies.</p><p>Initially, the trial was designed to recruit 550 patients from Asia and 330 from Africa (880 total) with the rationale being that the 10-week death rate in patients in Vietnam would be 30%, and in Malawi, 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and that the target hazard ratio of 0.7 corresponded to an absolute risk reduction in mortality from 30% to 22%, or from 50% to 38%. These national mortality rates were assumed to be representative at the continental level, and recruitment of 500 patients from Asia and 300 patients from Africa (800 patients in total) would have been sufficient to observe the target number of deaths, a total of 880, allowing 10% loss to follow-up.</p><p>As the trial progressed, it became apparent that this strict division could hamper recruitment and was based on information that suggested a larger difference between Asian and African patients than was being observed in the blinded data. After discussions amongst the investigators and the trial steering committee, this requirement was replaced by a more-lenient statement that the study would aim to recruit roughly similar numbers of patients from each continent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec99"><title>Publication</title><p>Any publication or presentation during the active phase of the study must have permission from the Investigators.

The mechanism is not clear, but probably is a combination of impaired CSF drainage, increased CSF production, cerebral oedema, and inflammation. Adults have approximately 175&#x000a0;ml of cerebrospinal fluid, and the 24-hour production of CSF is on the order of 550&#x000a0;ml. The normal CSF pressure recorded by lumbar puncture with the patient reclining in the left lateral position is 5 to 18&#x000a0;cm of CSF. Few data guide the management of increased intracranial pressure in patients with cryptococcal meningitis, but the recommendations of the IDSA guidelines are that the CSF pressure should be identified at baseline. If the CSF pressure is &#x02265;25&#x000a0;cm of CSF and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure are present during induction therapy, relieved by CSF drainage (by lumbar puncture, reduced the opening pressure by 50% if it is extremely high or to a normal pressure of &#x02264;20&#x000a0;cm of CSF). If persistent pressure elevation of &#x02265;25&#x000a0;cm of CSF exists and symptoms, repeat lumbar puncture daily until the CSF pressure and symptoms have been stabilised for 1 to 2&#x000a0;days.</p><p>Brain imaging should be considered before lumbar puncture in patients with focal neurologic signs or profound coma, although its sensitivity for predicting cerebral herniation is poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec112"><title>Appendix 4 Antifungal treatment</title><p>All patients will receive amphotericin B deoxycholate 1&#x000a0;mg/kg/day for 2&#x000a0;weeks combined with fluconazole, 800&#x000a0;mg/day, for the first 2&#x000a0;weeks after randomisation. This will be followed by 800&#x000a0;mg fluconazole per day for 8&#x000a0;weeks. After this point, patients are switched to fluconazole, 200&#x000a0;mg/day, secondary prophylaxis. This continues until the patient has had sustained immune reconstitution (CD4 count &#x0003e;100 cells/&#x003bc;l) secondary to antiretroviral therapy.
