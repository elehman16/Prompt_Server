The two primary treatments for knee OA are non-surgical treatment (e.g., exercise) and surgery (total knee arthroplasty (TKA)); however, national guidelines recommend non-surgical treatment to be tried prior to surgical procedures. Patients with knee OA are characterized by decreased muscle strength, particularly in the knee-extensor muscles. Correspondingly, decreased knee-extensor strength is found to be associated with an increased risk of development, progression and severity of knee OA symptoms. Recent trials suggest a positive effect of pre-operative exercise on pre- and post-operative outcome; however, the most effective pre-operative knee-extensor strength exercise dosage is not known. The purpose of the present trial is to investigate the efficacy of three different exercise dosages of pre-operative, home-based, knee-extensor strength exercise on knee-extensor strength before and shortly after surgery in patients eligible for TKA due to end-stage knee OA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In this randomized dose-response trial with a three-arm parallel design, 140 patients with end-stage knee OA (candidates for TKA) are randomized to one of three exercise dosages (two, four or six session/week) of knee-extensor strength exercise (three sets, 12 repetitions at 12 RM, per exercise session) for 12&#x000a0;weeks. The knee-extensor strength exercise is home-based (unsupervised) and performed with an elastic exercise band following an initial exercise instruction. Adherence is objectively quantified using a sensor attached to the exercise band. The primary outcome will be the change in knee-extensor strength. Following the 12-week exercise period, the need for TKA surgery is re-assessed by an orthopedic surgeon.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Decreased knee-extensor strength is a major challenge in patients with knee OA. Exercise programs focusing on knee-extensor strength are found to be more effective in relieving knee OA pain and symptoms compared to more general exercise programs. However, the optimal exercise dosage for knee-extensor strength deficits in patients with knee OA is inconclusive. Knowledge on the dose-response relationship for knee-extensor strength exercise in patients with knee OA will help guide future non-surgical treatment in this patient population.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02931058">NCT02931058</ext-link>.

As a consequence, in Denmark, around 8000 patients with end-stage knee OA receive surgical treatment annually, in the form of total knee arthroplasty (TKA), to overcome their knee-related disabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Currently, the two primary treatments for knee OA are non-surgical treatment (e.g., pain treatment, exercise and weight loss if indicated) and surgery (TKA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">There is preliminary evidence that pre-operative exercise may postpone total hip arthroplasty in patients with hip OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Likewise, pre-operative exercise in candidates for TKA will provide an optimized basis for deciding whether to commence TKA; e.g., patients experiencing pain relief and functional improvement following exercise might benefit from postponing their potential TKA and vice versa. The latest systematic review on the efficacy of pre-operative strength exercise to enhance post-operative recovery after TKA and THA concludes that pre-habilitation may slightly improve early post-operative pain and function among patients undergoing total joint replacement; but the effects are too small and short-lived to be considered clinically important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, this conclusion is based on trials with significant limitations, providing very low certainty in estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Recently, the first randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of TKA in patients eligible for TKA was conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It showed an added effect (pain relief and functional improvement) of 30% by TKA and non-surgical treatment to that achieved by non-surgical treatment alone (30%). This highlights the importance of coordinating non-surgical and surgical care to select the right candidates for surgery, especially as patients undergoing TKA seem to experience more serious adverse events compared to non-surgical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These results suggest that non-surgical treatment should at least be tried out and considered before commencing surgical procedures. Optimally, patients awaiting TKA would conduct home-based, pre-operative exercise as the effect of exercise helps to establish the potential need for a future orthopedic operation. At the same time, it would be a potential solution of little cost and it enables the patients to self-manage their symptoms.</p><p id="Par23">Patients with knee OA are characterized by decreased knee-extensor strength and this decrease in knee-extensor strength is associated with limitation of activities of daily living, independent of knee pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Correspondingly, knee-extensor muscle weakness is found to be associated with increased risk of developing knee OA, progression of knee OA, symptoms of knee pain and decline in function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Clinically, patients diagnosed with end-stage knee OA who are awaiting TKA to reduce pain and disability are reported to have 35% reduced knee-extensor strength compared to healthy, age-matched persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Shortly after TKA, patients lose an additional 80% of their pre-operative knee-extensor strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This massive loss in knee-extensor strength severely limits functional performance and may delay hospital discharge in the large number of patients undergoing TKA every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. One of the latest systematic reviews on the efficacy of exercise to reduce pain and disability in patients with knee OA showed that isolated knee-extensor strength exercise was more effective in reducing pain and disability if not combined with other forms of exercises (e.g., other muscle groups or cardiovascular training) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In line with this, the 2014 international guidelines for non-surgical management of knee OA include strength exercise of the knee-extensor muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Two recent randomized controlled trials have indicated that high-volume, pre-operative strength exercise may enhance pre- and post-operative knee-extensor strength as well as functional performance in patients undergoing TKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Hence, there are indications that the applied pre-operative exercise dose seems related to pre- and post-operative efficacy, making a dose-response trial of pre-operative exercise particularly relevant.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Purpose</title><p id="Par25">The purpose of the present trial is to investigate the efficacy of three different exercise dosages (two, four and six exercise sessions per week) of pre-operative, home-based, knee-extensor strength exercise on knee-extensor strength before and shortly after surgery in patients eligible for TKA due to end-stage knee OA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hypothesis</title><p id="Par26">We hypothesize that a dosage of four knee-extensor strength exercise sessions per week will elicit the greatest strength increase pre-operatively compared to two or six sessions per week. The recommended minimum exercise dosage required for strength gains according the American College of Sports Medicine is two sessions per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; therefore, two greater dosages are investigated and used as comparators. Four sessions per week is likely optimal and six sessions per week probably have no additional benefit, but could potentially increase knee pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Literature search and search matrix</title><p id="Par27">Before commencing the planning of this trial, a systematic literature search was conducted to locate trials investigating the same research question or planning to do so (protocols).

At the orthopedic outpatient clinic, possible patients for TKA surgery due to end-stage knee OA are introduced to the trial and offered to participate by the orthopedic surgeon if they fit the initial eligibility criteria (please see below). On the same day, eligible patients interested in participating in the trial are then referred to a research assistant who provides thorough oral and written information about the trial. Eligible patients are informed that participation in the project includes 12&#x000a0;weeks of home-based, knee-extensor strength exercise with the purpose of improving knee-extensor strength, relieving knee pain and improving functional performance. Further, they are informed that after the exercise period, they will be re-assessed at the orthopedic outpatient clinic with regards to undergo surgery or not. To prevent performance bias, eligible patients are blinded to the exercise dosage randomization as well as the trial hypothesis. Information about the trial is provided in a calm setting dedicated to the trial. Should the patients wish for a companion to be present during the information meeting a new information appointment is scheduled. Along with the information, a second more thorough screening of inclusion and exclusion criteria is commenced. The patients are given a minimum of 24&#x000a0;h to decide whether they would like to participate in the trial or not. If the patients decide to participate, a baseline assessment is scheduled. Written informed consent is obtained at the baseline assessment. Once written informed consent and baseline assessment is completed, the patient is fully included in the trial. Outcome assessments will be performed blinded by the primary investigator and a research assistant dedicated to the trial, who are both trained according to the trial outcome-assessment protocol to ensure standardized assessments throughout the trial. To further refine and ensure standardization of the trial outcome-assessment protocol we piloted the outcome-assessment procedures in seven patients prior to initiating the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Eligible criteria</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p id="Par33">

The rationale for changing the exclusion criteria relating to the ASA score is that patients with knee OA and an ASA score of 3 who are possible candidates for TKA are likely to benefit from participating in the trial.

The initial exercise instruction takes place there, where the patients are received by a trial-dedicated physiotherapist who is specialized in instructing and training patients with knee OA. Once the instruction is completed and the patients are comfortable with the exercise, an exercise session is completed under supervision from the physiotherapist. The patients are handed personal elastic exercise bands for exercise at home and a study-specific brochure where instruction notes to the exercise are illustrated and described (Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). All the physiotherapists dedicated to the trial were trained by the primary investigator prior to the start of the trial to ensure standardized exercise instruction and information across the physiotherapists.</p><p id="Par55">The intervention period is 12&#x000a0;weeks. After 4 and 8&#x000a0;weeks of exercise, the patients have an exercise quality check-up (booster visit) with the physiotherapist in the municipality setting. The exercise quality check-up includes exercise technique re-assessment (fractional and temporal distribution of the contraction modes, range of motion and positioning), ensuring optimal length or type of elastic exercise band (resistance corresponding to 12 repetitions-maximum (RM)) and exercise-related questions from the patients.</p><p id="Par56">Three exercise dosages are investigated; two, four and six sessions per week for 12&#x000a0;weeks (group 2, 4 and 6, respectively) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Each exercise session comprises a single-strength training exercise, knee-extension, which is performed in three sets with 12 repetitions at a load corresponding to 12 RM in each set. There is no control group. The patients are randomly allocated to one of the three exercise dosages. The patients are instructed to perform only one exercise session per day. That is, they are not allowed to combine several exercise sessions on the same day. For example, patients randomized to group 6 are instructed to exercise 6&#x000a0;days of the week.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Exercise sessions per week according to exercise dosage randomization</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Dosage groups</th><th colspan="6">Sessions/week</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gp. 2 &#x02013; 2 sessions/week</td><td colspan="3">3*12 RM</td><td colspan="3">3*12 RM</td></tr><tr><td>Gp. 4 &#x02013; 4 sessions/week</td><td>3*12 RM</td><td colspan="2">3*12 RM</td><td>3*12 RM</td><td colspan="2">3*12 RM</td></tr><tr><td>Gp. 6 &#x02013; 6 sessions/week</td><td>3*12 RM</td><td>3*12 RM</td><td>3*12 RM</td><td>3*12 RM</td><td>3*12 RM</td><td>3*12 RM</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Knee-extensor exercise dosages investigated</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par57">The intervention is personalized to the extent where each patient is exercising with an individual absolute resistance in the elastic exercise band corresponding to a relative load of 12 RM.

If volitional muscular failure occurs before 12 RM, the resistance of the elastic band is adjusted so that the pre-determined number of repetitions can be completed. Whenever a given resistance in the elastic exercise band becomes too low (i.e., more than 12 repetitions per set can be performed), the patients are instructed to adjust the resistance in the elastic exercise band (increase the distance between the two endpoints of the elastic exercise band, i.e., moving the chair further away from the door (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>)) to achieve a new resistance corresponding to a relative load of 12 RM.

This is also possible for single exercise sets (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Objective quantification of exercise adherence for a full exercise session comprising three sets of 12 repetitions</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2366_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig><fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Objective quantification of exercise adherence for a single exercise set of 12 repetitions</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2366_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="FPar9"><title>Adverse events</title><p id="Par77">All adverse events occurring while the patients are enrolled in the trial will be recorded regardless of their relation to the exercise intervention, surgery or occurrence likely not related to the trial. Thus, an adverse event can both be a negative effect of the intervention, surgery or an occurrence not related to the trial, that is an untoward occurrence during the trial which may or may not causally related to the intervention or trial. Regardless of a relation to the trial, all adverse events are recorded and reported.</p><p id="Par78">Finally, a qualitative study will be embedded in the trial. Semi-structured interviews will be performed with randomly selected participating patients both before and after the trial about their experienced enablers and barriers related to the knee-extensor strength exercise and adherence to the home-based intervention. The orthopedic surgeons allocated to the trial will also undergo semi-structured interviews about their experienced enablers and barriers with the non-surgical, pre-operative, home-based intervention both before and after the trial. The physiotherapists allocated to the trial will undergo focus interviews, both before the trial is commenced and once the trial is completed, to explore their experienced enablers and barriers related to administering the home-based intervention. This embedded qualitative study is undertaken to refine the home-based intervention for future trials and clinical implementation. This knowledge can then be used to design a context-specific implementation plan, given a positive trial outcome. The embedded qualitative study will be reported in a separate qualitative paper, with a clear reference to the QUADX-1 trial.</p><p id="Par79">Regular auditing is planned during the trial. Regular meetings between the primary investigator, the orthopedic department, the municipalities and the research team will allow for checking of treatment notes and outcome assessment forms for fidelity to protocol which allows for addressing deviations.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par80">For a three-group-level One-way ANOVA of a normal mean difference with a two-sided significance level of 0.05, a common standard deviation of 0.22&#x000a0;Nm/kg (isometric knee-extensor strength measurement) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], and a minimal clinically important difference of 0.15&#x000a0;Nm/kg (15%), a sample size of 126 (42 per group) patients is required to obtain a power of 80%.

After being included in the trial (signed written informed consent and completion of baseline assessment) a person independent of the trial will open one of these envelopes and inform the patient&#x02019;s municipality which of the three exercise groups the patient is allocated to.

At outcome assessment sessions, the outcome assessor will start by informing the patients that they are not allowed to mention what exercise dosage they have received. The data will be coded in such a way that group allocation is concealed in the dataset, thus blinding the outcome assessors and data analysts to the group allocation. The patients and the physiotherapists instructing in the intervention will not be blinded due to the nature of the intervention; however, the patients will be blinded to the exercise dosages in the other groups, which exercise dosages will be compared in the analysis and which dosage is hypothesized to have the largest effect. Unblinding will only happen in the case where the wellbeing a the patient is at risk.

Consequently, this population is very large and growing, which stresses the importance of optimizing the treatment offered to these patients. The <italic>QUADX-1 trial</italic> will add knowledge relating to which knee-extensor strength exercise dosage is most effective in increasing knee-extensor strength and whether a single, home-based (unsupervised) knee-extensor strength exercise is feasible in patients with end-stage knee OA.</p><p id="Par100">The minimal treatment approach (single exercise) has been chosen as it is a pragmatic and time-saving solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Further, the rationale for investigating a home-based, single knee-extensor strength exercise is that it could improve exercise adherence as it is simple (minimal intellectual effort), does not take a long time (requires less surplus energy) and is likely to inflict less pain (less stress imposed on the knee joint). An exercise targeting the knee-extensor muscle is chosen as it is the single most important muscle for function in the knee OA population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par101">In summary, the objective of the <italic>QUADX-1 trial</italic> is to investigate the efficacy of three different exercise dosages of pre-operative, home-based, knee-extensor strength exercise before and shortly after surgery in patients eligible for total knee replacement. The results will indicate which knee-extensor strength exercise dosage is most effective for increasing knee-extensor strength in the end-stage knee OA population. Furthermore, the results will indicate whether pre-operative knee-extensor strength exercise improves knee-extensor strength and function prior to surgery and whether this effect (if any) is sustained following surgery.</p><sec id="Sec39"><title>Strengths</title><p id="Par102">The trial design has several strengths as it addresses numerous gaps in the academic literature. Trials investigating the dose-response relationship of strength exercise in patients with end-stage knee OA are rare. Accordingly, there is a need for investigating the most effective exercise dose in this patient population, as highlighted in two recent systematic reviews using meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Peer et al. highlight the scarcity of evidence related to exercise dose-response in patients with knee OA needed to guide pre-habilitation in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Further, Bartholdy et al. suggest that a 30&#x02013;40% gain in knee-extensor strength is needed to positively affect pain and disability in patients with knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], highlighting the need for evidence to suggest the exercise dosage required to obtain adequate improvement in knee-extensor strength.</p><p id="Par103">Adherence to home-based exercise is reported to be low with a high risk of over-reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The use of sensors attached to the elastic exercise band will address this in an objective manner. Further, in a recent systematic review on adherence with physiotherapy exercises it was requested that the relationship between adherence and treatment outcome was investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par104">The exercise regimes currently offered to patients with knee OA are mostly supervised exercise sessions at outpatient clinics and comprise several exercises resulting in accumulated time spent and cost. In this trial, a single, simple, home-based exercise is applied, thus, investigating whether an alternative exercise treatment, which is simplified and maintained unsupervised at home, might be offered to these patients.</p><p id="Par105">This trial protocol follows the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) Checklist (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and the exercise intervention is reported according to the TIDieR Checklist (Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] allowing for replication and direct clinical use, which has been requested in a recent review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The cross-sectional design mimics everyday practice of cross-sector boarder communication increasing the external validity for future clinical implementation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par106">The trial has some limitations which must be taken into consideration. There is no control group limiting the inferences that can be made on the effect of the knee-extensor strength exercise.</p><p id="Par107">Due to the nature of the intervention (exercise) there is a risk of selection bias, e.g., patients motivated for exercise are more likely to participate in the trial. This also limits the external validity with respect the whole knee OA population.</p><p id="Par108">In the present trial design, the patients are asked about their <italic>need for surgery</italic> after the 12-week exercise period. In line with the above limitation, the answer to this question could be biased as patients motivated for exercise might be less motivated towards surgery affecting their answer to <italic>need for surgery</italic> towards.</p><p id="Par109">Though the sensor objectively measures activity with the elastic exercise band, the sensor cannot measure who is exercising, which muscle is exercised or what movement is performed.</p><p id="Par110">Finally, no recording or monitoring of the use of knee-related pain medication during the trial is planned for.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par111">Protocol version no. 4.1 (21 November 2017).
