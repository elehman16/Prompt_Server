Introduction</title><p>Coronary disease is the most important cause of death and inability in all communities. The American Heart Association (AHA) reported that 17.6 million people in the United States have coronary heart disease, which, including 8.5 million with MI, and 10.2 million with angina pectoris (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Lloyd-Jones D, Adams &#x00026; Brown, 2010</xref>).</p><p>By 2007, these diseases have been first cause of the mortality among people &#x0003e;35 years old in Iran (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Hasanpour et al., 2007)</xref>, and 40% total mortalities. As per the study conducted by <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Vyzshfar (2002)</xref>, 120&#x02013;140 thousands persons are dying annually for this reason. World Health Organization of the United Nations (WHO) notified the depression as 4<sup>th</sup> generalized health problem (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Modabernia et al., 2001)</xref>. According to these studies, the depression following MI is an independent and potential serious reason of mortality, among the patients with MI. Incidence of the depression symptoms, following MI is a common psychological problem. Depressive symptoms are widespread among post-MI patients and may cause effects on cardiac prospects (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Bagherian et al., 2011)</xref>. In 40&#x02013;60% patients, the manifest clinical symptoms of depression are seen. The gross risk (without controlling other agents of the risk) of the mortality, six-months after MI, in patients with depression is six times more than those without it. This high risk of the mortality is observed until 18 months after MI. It is evident that for preventing, or taking the subsequent therapeutic measures, it is important to diagnosis the depression in the patients with MI, especially identify the hospitalized patients with high-risk of incidence, the depression symptoms following MI.</p><p>Preventive implementations and therapeutic methods for post-MI depression can decrease risk of death and acceptance of therapeutic methods and rehabilitation, promote and maintain health level and quality of life, prevent development of risky behaviors, and finally it can prevent negative outcomes of depression patients with myocardial infarction</p><p>There are many methods for treating the depression following MI, such as, cardiac rehabilitation, social support, behavioral-cognitive therapy, and using anti-depression drugs (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Bagherian et al., 2011)</xref>. It has been shown that some anti- depression, anxiety drugs could result in the risk of the cardiac dysrhythmia and sudden death (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Harry et al., 2003)</xref>.</p><p>Considering results of the study by <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Behnammoghadam et al., (2013)</xref>, it can be said that non-pharmacological methods, which are cheap and non-invasive, can be used for controlling and treating depression of patients with MI, and they do not have any side effects.</p><p>Behavioral-cognitive techniques, such as, EMDR are among the therapeutic methods used for treating the depression. This new method is safe and without negative side effects, and only using the rapid and regular eye movements of the patient (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Behnammoghadamet al., 2015)</xref>. Schneider et al., showed that after EMDR therapy, there was a significant recovery in hospital depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, followed by post-traumatic stress disorder in a patient with co-morbid epilepsy (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al., 2005)</xref>.</p><p>Tavanti et al., compared two therapeutic methods of Sertraline and EMDR in treating the symptoms of depression and anxiety. Their results showed that both Sertraline and EMDR were significant reductions in PTSD symptoms (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), and EMDR would obtain faster recovery than Sertraline (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Tavanti et al., 2008)</xref>. Arabia et al., conducted a study on treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and anxiety and depression symptoms in survivors of life-threatening cardiac events. The findings of their study indicated the mean depression score of 17.14 before intervention in these patients. After employing EMDR procedure, the score decreased to 6.38, which indicate statistically significant difference (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Arabia et al., 2011)</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was a clinical trial conducted to identify efficacy of EMDR on the depression of patients with MI. Firstly, the patients were assessed according to Beck Depression Questionnaire and included in the study, if they were depressive (score &#x0003e;17). They divided into two groups randomly, as experimental and control group, each with 30 subjects.</p><p>For experimental group, depression was measured before and after using the therapeutic method by Beck Depression Questionnaire (pre- and post-test). This therapeutic method was performed at three sessions per 45&#x02013;90 min for one week to experimental group during four months, after their MI in Heart and Vessel Clinic, and after one week, their depression score studied again.</p><p>For control group, at first session, demographic characteristics and Beck Depression Questionnaire completed; then after four months and at second session, Beck Depression Questionnaire completed again.</p><p>MI diagnosis by a cardiologist, stability of the hemodynamic condition of the patient, literacy, age group of 30&#x02013;70 years, lack of psychological diseases, addiction, strabismus, and visionary problems were the criteria to consider the study, while inability to tolerate EMDR procedure, and lack of cooperation with therapist were the exclusion criteria. For data collection, two instruments, including demographic questionnaire, and Beck Depression Inventory, were used. The demographic characteristics were age, gender, marital status, education level, and smoking experience. To measure depression level, BDI instrument was applied. BDI contains 21 questions. Scoring system of the responses was as &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d; (0), &#x0201c;minimum&#x0201d; (1), &#x0201c;moderate&#x0201d; (2), and &#x0201c;severely&#x0201d; (3). The BDI has a maximum score of 63 where: 0&#x02013;9, 10&#x02013;16, 17&#x02013; 29, and &#x0003e;30 indicate, not at all, minimum, moderate, and severe levels of depression, respectively.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>2.1 Protocol of EMDR Therapy</title><p>The EMDR therapy included eight phases. Each session time was 45&#x02013;90 minutes. In the reprocessing phases, the patient was instructed to recognize a picture that represents the most terrible part of the cardiac incident; a negative unreasonable self-belief related with the picture; a positive adaptive cognition, emotions, and employee body sensations. Then, at first, focusing on the picture, negative belief, and sensation, the patient was guided, according to standardized protocols to simultaneously move his eyes back and forward, following the therapist&#x02019;s finger as they moved across their field of vision for a set of about 24&#x02013;36 seconds. After the set, the patient reported any new associations that may have emerged. Such associations, generally, became the focus of the next set of double attention, or were guided by the physician. This procedure continued until the target memory was desensitized. After that, more eye movement sets were used, while the patient was thinking of a recognized adaptive belief. This was repeated until the new statement felt proper to the patient, and until all physical disorder was dissipated. Over the sessions, this treatment method was used to address memories of the cardiac incident, and associated present triggers, as well as anticipatory anxiety related to possible future incidents (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Shapiro, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The data collected in experimental and control group were analyzed using the SPSS-16 software, through the descriptive and inferential statistic tests, such as, independent <italic>t</italic> (for comparing mean depression level in two groups), paired <italic>t</italic>-test (for comparing the mean depression level before and after intervention), and Chi-square test (for investigating demographic characteristics of the samples).</p><p>The author started data collecting process after obtaining permission from Ethics Committee of Yasuj University of Medical Sciences (registration No. 28.20.6190), and registering it in Iran Clinical Trial Center (registration No. of IRCT2012090610752N1); received written informed consent form from all subjects; and received official permission from the concerned authorities.

So, the findings confirm that EMDR results in reducing the depression symptoms of the patients with MI. Schneider et al., showed that EMDR yielded a significant recovery in the hospital depression, and anxiety and PTSD symptom with post-traumatic stress disorder in a patient with co-morbid epilepsy. Their results were consistent with present study and confirm the same.</p><p>Arabia et al., conducted a study on treatment of PTSD and anxiety and depression symptoms in survivors of life-threatening cardiac events. The findings of their work indicate the mean depression score of 17.14, before intervention in these patients. After employing EMDR procedure, the score decreased to 6.38, which indicates statistically significant difference (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). These results, correspond with other randomized-controlled studies, found that EMDR treatment had a concurrent effect in reducing depressive symptoms in survivors of traumatic events, who developed PTSD symptoms (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">van der Kolk et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Abbasnejad et al., conducted a work on efficiency of EMDR in reducing unpleasant feelings resulting from Bam earthquake, and found that the mean depression score before the intervention in experimental group and after the intervention were 33.51 and 16.42, which indicates statistically significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Abbas Nejad et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Narimani et al.

Their findings showed that both the methods result in a significant reduction in amount of the hospital depression, but they had no significant difference in terms of the amount of reducing the depression. These findings are consistent with the results of <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Narimani and Rajabi (2009)</xref>.</p><p><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Power et al.
