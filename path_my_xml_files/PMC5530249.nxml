Majority of WP research in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) involved acute challenge or weight loss studies. It is not known if WP supplementation can provide sustained glucose lowering. Our goal was to investigate the effects of WP on glycemia comprehensively by using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) while avoiding the confounding effects of variable food intake through controlled feeding.</p></sec><sec><title>Research design and methods</title><p>This double-blinded and placebo (PL)-controlled study included 22 patients with T2DM patients (11 male, 11 female; age 57.1&#x000b1;12.6 years) on diet or metformin monotherapy. First, one serving (21 g) of WP was compared with PL in parallel-armed acute challenge studies. Next, in a crossover design, each patient underwent CGM twice, over 2 consecutive weeks, 3.5 days each week. Identical diets were provided by the study during both CGM periods. During the first CGM, one serving of either WP or PL was consumed before breakfast and another before dinner. During the second CGM, participants switched to the alternate supplement. Order of the supplements was randomized.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During acute challenge studies, WP stimulated insulin and glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 secretion; suppressed ghrelin (all p&#x0003c;0.05), while PL had no effect. During CGM, glucose response to WP varied depending on the baseline characteristics of the patients. When evaluated using linear regression, the most predictive baseline variables were body mass index (BMI) (p=0.0006), triglycerides (p=8.3&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) and GLP-1 (p=0.006). Lower BMI, triglyceride and GLP-1 predicted decreased glucose levels on WP. Obesity, hypertriglyceridemia and high fasting GLP-1 concentrations predicted increased glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Effects of WP supplementation on glycemia in T2DM depend on the baseline characteristics.

Protein intake before meals has been shown to reduce postprandial glycemia in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) by stimulating secretion of insulin and incretins as well as by delaying gastric emptying.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;7</xref> Among different proteins, whey protein (WP) was found to be most efficacious probably because WP is rich in leucine and branched-chain amino acids which are potent insulin secretagogues.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In addition, WP is rapidly absorbed and readily bioavailable.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Based on the findings of the challenge studies, it has been proposed that WP may be used as a natural food supplement to lower glucose in T2DM.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 10 11</xref>
</p><p>So far the majority of WP research in patients with T2DM focused on acute challenge studies or weight loss interventions.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5 7 9 11&#x02013;13</xref> Varying doses of WP&#x02014;sometimes relatively high doses&#x02014;were tested.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref> A study including seven patients with diabetes showed that WP stimulated incretin secretion and delayed gastric emptying during acute challenge tests, but there was no significant improvement in fructosamine over 4&#x02009;weeks.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> It is possible that some of the effects of WP may negate its long-term benefit. For example, WP stimulates insulin and glucagon-like peptide&#x000a0;(GLP)-1, and &#x000a0;glucagon.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Increased glucagon may interfere with the hypoglycemic effects of WP by increasing hepatic glucose output.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Moreover, delayed gastric emptying can blunt the peak glucose right after a&#x000a0;WP-containing meal, but may extend the duration of hyperglycemia and raise preprandial glucose levels before the subsequent meal. Thus, it is not sufficient to determine the effects of WP over a single meal.</p><p>We hypothesized that WP consumption before meals would reduce postprandial hyperglycemia and lower average glucose levels in patients with T2DM. The primary variable of interest was the average blood glucose level determined by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). The secondary variables were the segmental glucose values during CGM. Dietary intake was controlled to eliminate confounding effects of variable food intake on blood glucose levels. Hence the changes in glucose levels could be attributed to WP supplement only. An identical tasting placebo&#x000a0;(PL), without any hormonal effects, was used to assure blinding. Clinical and biochemical factors which can modify the glycemic response to WP were also investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research design and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty-two patients with T2DM (11 men and 11 women; 9 white, 4 African-American, 5 Asian, 1 Latino and 3 East Indian) either managed by diet alone or on metformin monotherapy, with glycosylated hemoglobin (HgBA1c) between 48&#x02013;70&#x02009;mmol/mol (6.5%&#x02013;8.6%) were included after signing informed consent forms.

Two sensors were used to obtain complete data even if one of them failed during the study. The sensors were numbered and the same sensors were used in the same patient. The odd numbered sensor was placed on the right and was defined as the primary; the even numbered sensor was inserted on the left and was defined as the alternate. The recordings and the data from the primary sensor, unless they failed to meet the quality control criteria, were analyzed. As CGM measures glucose in the interstitial fluid, for calibration with the blood glucose, the participants monitored blood glucose three to four times a day using their glucometers. Patients were blinded to their glucose levels as iPRO2 CGM does not have a display or does not provide alarm for high or low glucose.

In contrast, a patient who is in the third quartiles of BMI, triglyceride and GLP-1 would have the following increases in glucose values: 0.57&#x02009;mmol/L in average; 1.72&#x02009;mmol/L during sleep and 0.15&#x02009;mmol/L during the evening.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Based on the results of the WP challenge studies in the literature, we expected WP to lower glucose levels in all of our patients. This study demonstrated for the first time that the baseline clinical characteristics of the patients with T2DM modified the glycemic response to WP. Patients with lower BMI, fasting triglyceride and GLP-1 were likely to have glucose lowering. In contrast, patients with obesity, hypertriglyceridemia and higher fasting GLP-1 were likely to develop hyperglycemia.</p><p>The study design differed from the published reports in several aspects: It used a smaller dose of WP; monitored glucose levels over days, every 5&#x02009;min, 288 times/day. It employed controlled feeding to avoid confounding effects of food intake, and used an inert PL which had no effects on insulin or incretin secretion.</p><p>Several challenge studies reported that WP acutely stimulates insulin and incretins and delays gastric emptying.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5 7 17&#x02013;21</xref> The majority of these administered 45 g&#x000a0;to 55 g of WP as a single dose. Because long-term high protein intake may affect kidney function adversely in diabetes,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> we investigated a smaller dose of WP. We showed that 21 g WP effectively increased insulin and GLP-1 and suppressed ghrelin. As importantly, PL was inert and did not affect these hormones.</p><p>Even though the acute WP challenge studies reported consistent decreases in blood glucose,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;6 23</xref> a closer look at the literature indicates that these studies recruited only non-obese patients with BMIs ranging between 26.2&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2&#x000a0;</sup>and&#x000a0;28.2&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. This weight range corresponds to our patients in the first quartile of the BMI. Our findings agree that this quartile of patients is likely to benefit from WP, as shown on <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">table 3</xref>.</p><p>The majority of the published acute challenge studies measured incretin response to glucose; only a handful reports determined the response to protein. It was shown that incremental GLP-1 response to oral glucose was blunted in T2DM and obesity.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> Dietary weight loss could not restore the incremental GLP-1 response.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> It is not yet known whether T2DM and/or obesity blunt incremental GLP-1 response to protein challenge as well. If obese patients with diabetes exhibit less incremental increase in GLP-1&#x000a0;when challenged with WP, this would explain the negative effect of BMI on CGM-glucose during WP supplementation. During our WP challenge studies, per&#x000a0;cent increase in GLP-1 appeared to correlate inversely with BMI (r=&#x02212;0.526, p=0.15) suggesting that obese patients may have smaller incremental increase in GLP-1 in response to WP. However this correlation was not significant, possibly because of the small sample size.</p><p>Several mechanisms may contribute to the hyperglycemic effects of WP. One explanation may be stimulation of glucagon secretion. It is well recognized that WP stimulates glucagon acutely in healthy subjects<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> as well as patients with T2DM.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Glucagon rapidly mobilizes glucose from hepatic glycogen stores. Moreover hypertriglyceridemia augments the hyperglycemic effects of glucagon.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> This could explain the relationship between hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemic response to WP seen in our study.</p><p>Another explanation may be the changes in plasma amino acid metabolites. Growing evidence supports that elevated plasma concentrations of branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), other hydrophobic amino acids including alanine, and the aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine and tyrosine) are associated with increased risk for T2DM.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> These amino acids constitute approximately 30% of WP.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Hence WP intake may increase the amino acids which cause insulin resistance in the circulation.</p><p>Adverse effects of hypertriglyceridemia on glucose response to WP may be explained by the experimental evidence showing modulatory effects of fatty acids. In animal studies, branched chain amino acids increased insulin resistance only when fed along with a high-fat diet.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The underlying mechanism is that delivery of excess fatty acids along with branched chain amino acids to the mitochondria interferes with glucose utilization.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref> In an earlier study we had demonstrated that polyunsaturated fatty acids (3 g/day) alter plasma amino acids and their metabolism in humans.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Endogenous hypertriglyceridemia also increases fatty acid delivery to mitochondria. Therefore, patients&#x000a0;with hypertriglyceridemia&#x000a0;may develop mitochondrial dysfunction when exposed to the excess branched chain and essential amino acids supplied by WP.</p><p>Previously we had demonstrated that insulin resistance correlated with plasma leucine, isoleucine and valine in obese women with metabolic syndrome, and weight loss abolished these correlations.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Moreover, WP supplementation (20 g/day) did not cause insulin resistance during weight loss. Potent effects of weight loss masked the differences in protein intake. This may explain why the weight loss studies in the literature did not show increase in glucose during WP supplementation.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</p><p>The correlations observed between BMI and fructosamine,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> between ghrelin and HgBA1c,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and between GLP-1 and insulin and GLP-1 and glucose<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> were consistent with previously published reports.</p><p>In summary, this study identified the baseline clinical characteristics which can modify the glycemic response to WP in patients with T2DM. The strengths of the study were that food intake was controlled and weight was stable; therefore, changes in glucose could be attributed directly to the supplements. The PL was inert and did not have any independent effects on insulin or incretins, and therefore did not confound the results. The CGM permitted detailed analysis of the glucose response patterns over days, after meals and during fasting. The weaknesses were that the acute challenge studies were not crossover and glucagon was not measured. Consequently, it was not possible to compare the acute insulin, incretin or glucagon responses to the longer-term glucose changes seen during CGM. In addition, the small sample size of the acute challenge studies did not allow subgroup analysis. Finally, even though the food intake was unchanged during the WP and PL phases of CGM, the controlled feeding was not adjusted to patients&#x02019; habitual energy intakes or basal metabolic rates.</p><p>In conclusion, the study findings suggest that WP can lower blood glucose in T2DM. However, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia and high baseline GLP-1 levels predict poor response to WP. This novel information may help to individualize our recommendations. Further investigation of the underlying mechanisms, such as the effects of WP on gut microbiota and plasma metabolites, is essential to understand the interindividual variability in glycemic response to different nutrients and proteins.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> RUA conducted clinical studies, organized data.
