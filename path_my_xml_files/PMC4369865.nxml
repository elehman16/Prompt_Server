Practices are randomised a second time, i.e. intervention practices in the ADDITION study could be control practices in the current study and vice versa. For the GPs from the intervention group a 2-hour training in SDM was developed as well as a decision support tool to be used during the consultation. GPs plan the first visit with the patients to decide on the intensity of the treatment, personalised targets and the priorities of treatment. The control group will continue with the treatment they were allocated to in the ADDITION study. Follow-up: 24 months. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who achieve all three treatment goals. Secondary outcomes are the proportion of patients who achieve five treatment goals (HbA1c, blood pressure, total cholesterol, body weight, not smoking), evaluation of the SDM process (SDM-Q9 and CPS), satisfaction with the treatment (DTSQ), wellbeing and quality of life (W-BQ12, ADD QoL-19), health status (SF-36, EQ-5D) and coping (DCMQ). The proportions of achieved treatment goals will be compared between both groups. For the secondary outcomes mixed models will be used.

In primary care no more than 10-15% of the patients with T2DM achieve all three treatment targets (glycaemic control, lipids, blood pressure) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For separate targets much higher percentages of about 30-70% are reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, it has been suggested that a more personalised and patient centred approach might increase the proportion of patients who successfully reach all their treatment targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. To personalise treatment targets for HbA1c, lipids, blood pressure, weight loss and smoking cessation, several factors have to be considered in order to encourage active participation of patients in evidence based clinical decision making.</p><p>Physicians are advised to consider the patients&#x02019; age, motivation, risk of hypoglycaemia, diabetes duration, comorbidity and established vascular complications in setting the glucose control target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For statin therapy, physicians should consider the patient&#x02019;s individual cholesterol level, his/her risk for cardiovascular mortality, age and T2DM duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The blood pressure target for patients with T2DM is below 140/80 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but for older patients a less strict treatment target may result in a higher survival rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. With regard to weight control, physicians have to consider the side effects of weight gain of medication. Intensive lifestyle modification remains an elusive gold standard for weight reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] Although smoking cessation has been associated with weight gain, it is recommended as a routine component of the treatment of diabetes; however, evidence to guide best practice is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>To achieve and maintain treatment targets, not only individual clinical characteristics should be considered, but also patients&#x02019; preferences for treatment intensity. Generally speaking, the doctor is the expert on medicine, while the patient is the expert on his or her priorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Shared decision making (SDM) is an approach that takes into account both the clinical evidence for treatment goals as well as the patient&#x02019;s preferences. SDM is defined as &#x02018;an approach where clinicians and patients make decisions together, using the best available evidence&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It promotes patient autonomy and patient engagement in the treatment decision making by giving the patient an active role in weighting the benefits and harms of more than one evidence based treatment option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although SDM is promising for patients with chronic diseases by setting realistic treatment targets, such an extensive approach had not been broadly studied in T2DM patients before 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Recently the effects a patient oriented decision aid for SDM and goal setting in T2DM patients on patient empowerment and treatment decisions have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. No effect was found on empowerment, the decision aid was not used to measure the effect on clinical outcomes and achievement of goals.</p><p>Because SDM is especially useful when there are two or more equally beneficial treatment options, the results of the ADDITION-Europe study, in which the Netherlands participated, could be used in a SDM approach in patients with T2DM. The ADDITION study included screen detected T2DM patients and compared an intensive multifactorial treatment of HbA1c, cholesterol, blood pressure and body weight with less intensive usual care according to national guidelines. The intensive treatment was associated with a significant increase in prescribed medications and a non-significant 17% reduction of cardiovascular events and death after 5 years. However, the rate of cardiovascular events seemed to diverge after 4 years of follow-up. It was concluded that intensified treatment and treatment according to national guidelines can theoretically be equally effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Based on the results of the ADDITION study, it is questionable which evidence based treatment advice the diabetes care provider should give to the T2DM patient. There is no decisive evidence for either option. This situation is very appropriate for treatment decisions that incorporate the patient&#x02019;s preferences.</p><p>In a recent statement of both the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) personalised and patient-centred care is mentioned as the cornerstone of the treatment of patients with T2DM. The use of a decision support tool is strongly advocated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A decision support tool can encourage active patient participation in many evidence-based healthcare decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the last decade decision support tools have been developed to support the achievement of cardiometabolic goals and to select patient-centred treatment options for lifestyle modifications or medication use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, most of them focus on a single risk factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], on only the patients&#x02019; preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] or on some individual clinical characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We hypothesise that a decision support tool that takes into account both treatment intensity, patient&#x02019;s clinical characteristics and patient&#x02019;s preferences can facilitate a SDM process and will be effective in achieving treatment targets. We aim to evaluate whether such an approach increases the proportion of treatment targets that T2DM patients achieve.</p><p>The following research questions are addressed:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>What is the effect of shared decision making with a multi-faceted decision support tool on the percentage of patients with T2DM that achieve all individualised treatment targets for HbA1c, blood pressure and LDL-cholesterol; and to identify determinants for achieving all individualised treatment targets.</p></list-item><list-item><p>What is the effect of shared decision making with a multi-faceted decision support tool on treatment satisfaction, quality of life, health status, well-being and on coping styles?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What is the level of SDM-knowledge/attitude of the GPs from both treatment groups after 24 months?</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>The OPTIMAL study is a cluster-randomised trial with randomisation at practice-level and two years follow-up.

It should be used to discuss the treatment options and the prioritising of treatment targets during the first visit and the 12- and 24-months follow-up visits. The tool consists of three steps: 1) considering the pros and cons of two almost equally effective evidence based multifactorial treatments, namely the intensified ADDITION protocol and the protocol derived from the 2006 Dutch guidelines for GPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] (for details see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, step 1b), and the shared decision on which option will be chosen; 2) prioritising of treatment targets according to the chosen option, and 3) treatment selection (medication or lifestyle) to achieve the treatment targets.

The GP will explain the pros and cons of each option, and the treatment targets that should be achieved, depending on the option that is chosen. The GP should explain that both treatments are equally suitable for treating T2DM. Next, the patient&#x02019;s preferences and lifestyle habits are discussed against the background of the patient&#x02019;s most recent values of HbA1c, lipids, blood pressure, body weight and smoking habits. Then the GP and the patient will together decide on the preferred treatment option and the accompanying treatment targets. For a patient who underwent the intensified treatment in the ADDITION study and did not change it after the end of ADDITION, this visit provides him/her the opportunity to choose a less intensive treatment. Also the other way around is possible. The patient will prioritise the five treatment targets (HbA1c, cholesterol, blood pressure, body weight, smoking habits) for the first 12 months. The target with the highest priority will get the most attention and require the most effort of both the patient and GP. There will be no pre-defined way in how the patients should reach their targets; the patient and the GP need to determine this way together in a final step in the decision process. The patient and GP decide whether medication changes and/or lifestyle changes should be made in order to reach the prioritised targets. During the second and third OPTIMAL visit (12 and 24 months later) the patient and GP evaluate the decisions they made during the first visit using the decision support tool. The priority of the treatment targets can be changed during these visits, but not the choice between the two treatment options (ADDITION protocol or the less intensive protocol). During the third and final visit the patient and the GP will decide whether or not to keep to the chosen treatment option. Between the first and third visit, three monthly T2DM visits will take place either with the GP or the practice nurse.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Training</title><p>The GPs from the practices randomised to the SDM-treatment arm are trained in the SDM approach during a two hours training session.

It is a continuous scale, and the questionnaire developers did not describe any thresholds for &#x02018;bad&#x02019; or &#x02018;good&#x02019; SDM. Over the last years the SDM-Q9 has become a frequently used instrument in clinical practice. It has been translated into several languages. Internal consistency has been assessed for the Spanish and Dutch version (Rodenburg-Vandenbussche S, Pieterse AH, Kroonenberg PM, Stiggelbout AM,et al.: Further validation of the SDM-Q-9 and SDM-Q-Doc: psychometric properties in Dutch patients from primary and secondary care.

The original Control Preference Scale by Degner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], was developed to measure preference for involvement and is one of the most commonly used instruments to assess preferred decisional role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>Subsequently, the GPs of both groups (the intervention group trained, the control group not) will audio- or videotape one of their yearly consultations with a T2DM patient. They can choose the consultation to be taped themselves. These tapes will be evaluated by two independent observers, making use of the SDM-Q9, to assess the extent to which the GP is likely to involve his/her patients in the diabetes treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Sample size</title><p>As stated in the Introduction, only 10-15% of T2DM patients achieve all three treatment targets for both HbA1c, lipids and blood pressure. We estimate the percentage of patients that already has reached three targets at the start of the study will be approximately 10%. We hypothesise that in the OPTIMAL study, after two years of follow-up, the intervention group will show an increase of this percentage until 30% (about 10% increase per year), whereas in the treatment-as-before-group this percentage will stay at 10%. Assuming a two-sided significance level of 5%, with alpha 0.05 and power of 80% and with a drop-out of 10%, 65 patients will be needed in each treatment group (Department of Statistics Sample Size Calculator, University of British Columbia). Because the OPTIMAL study is a cluster randomised study the sample size will require an correction for the cluster effect. The used correction factor is equal to [1&#x02009;+&#x02009;(m - 1) r], where &#x02018;m&#x02019; is the total amount of eligible patient per practice (approximately 6), and &#x02018;r&#x02019; the within-cluster correlation coefficient. For &#x02018;r&#x02019; we use a within-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.025, based on the cluster correlation found in the ADDITION-Europe study. When taken the cluster effect (1.125) in to account, 73 patients per group are needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Intention-to-treat analyses (ITT) will be performed to examine between-group differences. Generalized linear models will be used to correct for clustering at practice level. The proportions of achieved treatment goals of HbA1c, blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol within each study group will be estimated by calculating relative risk. The same applies to the difference between groups in the proportion of patients which achieved all the five above mentioned treatment goals. A p-value of &#x0003c;0.05 is considered statistically significant. To identify patients who show better results after the SDM process, the analysis for the primary outcome will be repeated with taken into account interaction of SDM with age, gender, education level, duration of diabetes and comorbidities. Within and between group differences in treatment satisfaction, perceived quality of life, health status, well-being, and coping style between baseline and 24 months follow-up will be analysed by using paired t-tests and mixed models respectively. We will add random effects for patient and practice.</p><p>The SDM-Q9 will be analysed in the intervention group by using paired t-tests. Mixed models will be used to study the between groups differences after 24 months. We will add random effects for patient and practice.</p><p>To evaluate the SDM proces, the tapes will be evaluated by two independent observers by making use of the SDM-Q9.</p><p>The Medical Research Ethics Committee of the University Medical Centre Utrecht has approved the study protocol (Protocol number: 11-153).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The treatment of T2DM is mostly target driven. However, only a low percentage of all patients with T2DM achieve all goals. SDM and goal setting can be useful to increase the percentage of patients that achieve all targets. However, the decision support tool to be used in SDM should likely not only focus on the clinical factors of the patients but also on the patient&#x02019;s preferences, because each of these variables may affect the optimal treatment targets. Besides, the decision support tool should be used in a SDM process during more than one consultation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The results of the ADDITION trial, in which half of the participants of the current study also participated, offers a unique opportunity to discuss with the patient two almost equally effective treatment strategies.</p><p>In the current cluster-randomised controlled trial we will evaluate the effectiveness of such a repeated use of a decision support tool, taking into account both the intensity of treatment, individual clinical factors and the patients&#x02019; experiences and preferences. We hypothesise that the SDM process with such a well-balanced decision support tool will improve the percentage of patients that achieve all three individual goals compared to the control group, making SDM really beneficial.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>SDM</term><def><p>Shared decision making</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>General practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T2DM</term><def><p>Type 2 diabetes</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>Designed the study: GER; Study conduct: GER; Drafting manuscript: HdO; Critical review of manuscript: RCV, CR, HdO, GER; Study supervision: GER.
