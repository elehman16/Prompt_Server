In most countries one intervention is preferred while the other is considered as inhuman or not sufficiently safe, but identical arguments refer to different preferences. There is a lack of evidence from well-designed studies on compulsory measures in psychiatry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a cohort study with optional randomisation comparing seclusion and mechanical restraint among in-patients with acute psychotic disorders. We determined an ethical aspect as main outcome variable: the restriction of human rights from the patients' point of view, measured by a scale developed for this purpose, Human DIgnity during COercive Procedures, DICOP. In addition we screened for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). After one year a follow-up was conducted by telephone interviews. We reassessed the incidence of PTSD after coercive measures by the Impact of Event Scale (IES).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>102 out of 233 patients exposed to coercive measures within 24 months could be included, 26 could be randomized (12 seclusion, 14 restraint). 60 patients could be contacted for follow-up interviews. Further results will be presented.</p></sec></body></article>
