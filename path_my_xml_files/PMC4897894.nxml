Currently, there are no medications approved for treating patients with VaD. Fufangdanshen (FFDS) tablets (<italic>Radix Salviae miltiorrhizae</italic> formula tablets) are a traditional Chinese medicine that has been reported to improve memory. However, the existing evidence for FFDS tablets in clinical practice derives from methodologically flawed studies. To further investigate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of FFDS tables in the treatment of mild to moderate VaD, we designed and reported the methodology for a 24-week randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This ongoing study is a double-blind, randomized, parallel placebo-controlled trial.

The primary efficacy measurement will be the Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) and the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change&#x000a0;(CIBIC-plus).

The EURODEM Prevalence Research Group compared the prevalence of VaD in five datasets from Europe (Finland, Italy, Sweden, and two from the United Kingdom) and found that the prevalence ranged from 0.0&#x02013;1.6&#x000a0;% for those aged between 60 and 70&#x000a0;years and increased to 2.8&#x02013;9.2&#x000a0;% for subjects aged 80&#x02013;90 years. The annual incidence rate was estimated to be 3.79 per 1000 among non-demented populations. At present, the treatment of VaD focuses on primary and secondary prevention strategies because randomized clinical trials in VaD have not been able to demonstrate clinically relevant symptomatic improvement. Additionally, it has not yet been possible to establish disease-modifying effects in VaD syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus, the development of an effective treatment for VaD is important.</p><p>Fufangdanshen tablets (FFDS), a traditional herbal medicine approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) in 2008 (Number: [2008]1919), are extracted from the Chinese herbs <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic>, <italic>Panax notoginseng</italic>, and <italic>Borneolum syntheticum</italic> and contain tanshinone, salvianolic acid, panax notoginsenosides, ginsenoside Rb1, ginsenoside Rg1, and borneol. The tablets are used to treat patients with VaD. Preclinical studies have shown that tanshinone can improve the impaired learning and memory induced by A&#x003b2;1-40 in rat models of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], inhibiting AD-induced expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and matrix metalloproteinase II (MMP-2), reducing toxic free radicals, and suppressing oxidative injury in AD rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Salvianolic acid can inhibit glutamate release and anti-cerebral ischemic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Borneol can improve the permeability of the blood-brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Many studies have reported that FFDS tablets can improve the memory of demented mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and improve the impairment of spatial discrimination and memory impairment in rat models of AD. The mechanisms may involve improvement in the brain choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) activity that is decreased in AD rats and induced by A&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], lowering the toxicity of excitatory amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and increasing the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the brains of rats during chronic cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Additionally, FFDS tablets could improve the learning and memory capabilities in rat models of VaD, increase the activity of superoxide dismutase, and reduce neuron apoptosis in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>A phase II clinical trial on the efficacy of FFDS tablets in VaD was carried out in five centers. The trial enrolled 231 patients; all patients were randomized to the FFDS tablets group (115 patients) or the dihydroergotoxine mesylate tablets group (116 patients). Scores on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and activities of daily living significantly improved in both groups compared with baseline (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). However, there were some limitations to this study. First, there was no placebo group. As all subjects knew that they were being treated with one of two drugs and all of the individuals who assessed the patients knew this as well, the results may have been influenced by a positive response bias. Second, the sample size was relatively small. Third, this previous study only followed up patients for 12&#x000a0;weeks, and this period of follow-up was too short to detect the effects of the drugs.</p><p>To further investigate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of FFDS tablets in the treatment of mild to moderate VaD, we designed and report the methodology for a 24-week randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter clinical study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This ongoing study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial (six centers).

The previous study reported that patients who received donepezil (5&#x000a0;mg/day) showed a mean improvement of 0.67&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.51; the patients who received the placebo showed a worse score of 1.82 points. Using a one-sided test with a significance level of 0.05 and power of 90&#x000a0;%, the minimum number was 88 per group to detect a difference of 1.5 points on the ADAS-cog. To achieve an adequate number to detect the safety of the FFDS tablets, the number of the patients was increased to 100 per group. Considering a greater rate of discontinuation of 20&#x000a0;%, the sample size was increased to 120 per group to ensure adequate patients to complete the study.</p><p>The randomization is stratified according to center using SAS statistical software (version 9.13) (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Balanced randomization generated by SAS statistical software is carried out in three steps (in blocks of four) by a statistician with no access to information on the patients or physicians. Patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive the FFDS or placebo tablets. The randomized code is generated in the randomization process and sealed in an envelope. Statisticians assign the medication group according to the randomization code. Afterwards, the sealed randomization codes and each available medication number are sent out to each center. Blinding will be broken only if a patient&#x02019;s trial medication requires specific emergency treatment.

The Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test will be used for CIBIC-plus scores. The occurrence of adverse events will be analyzed using frequency calculations and descriptive statistics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion</title><p>Currently, there is no medication approved for treating patients with VaD. This ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled, 24-week clinical trial will be the first rigorous testing of FFDS tablets for the treatment of patients with VaD. Success in this clinical trial will provide evidence for the use of FFDS tablets in the treatment of VaD.</p><p>A series of neuropathological studies have shown that the diagnostic accuracy of the NINDS-AIREN criteria is 90&#x000a0;%, and the sensitivity is 0.20&#x02013;0.58 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; the HIS also showed high specificity (87&#x02013;95&#x000a0;%) and a relatively lower sensitivity for the diagnosis of VaD (43&#x02013;50&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Thus, in the present ongoing study, the diagnosis of VaD is based on the criteria of the NINDS-AIREN and the HIS. Additionally, the present study uses structural neuroimaging to differentiate VaD from AD to enroll proper VaD subjects.</p><p>The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have issued guidelines on the criteria of efficacy with symptomatic improvement clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Both of these guidelines emphasize three domains as efficacy endpoints: cognition endpoint, ADLs (functional endpoint), and overall clinical response as reflected by global assessment (global endpoint). Based on these guidelines, in the present study we are using each of these three endpoints as efficacy endpoints. In conclusion, the results of the present study are expected to provide evidence for the efficacy and safety of FFDS tablets for the treatment of patients with VaD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial has been approved and registered.
