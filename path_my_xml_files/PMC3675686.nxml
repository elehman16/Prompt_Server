This paper describes the qualitative findings of the experience of the intervention and its impact on health and psychosocial outcomes. Twenty four primary care facilities (12 public and private each) were randomized to provide either collaborative stepped care (CSC) or enhanced usual care (EUC) to adults who screen positive for CMDs. Participants were sampled purposively based on two criteria: gender and, in the CSC arm, adherence with the intervention. The qualitative study component involved two semi-structured interviews with participants of both arms (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;115); the first interview within 2 months of recruitment and the second 6&#x02013;8 months after recruitment. Data were collected between September 2007 and November 2009. More participants in the CSC than EUC arm reported relief from symptoms and an improvement in social functioning and positive impact on work and activities of daily life. The CSC participants attributed their improvement both to medication received from the doctors and the strategies suggested by the lay Health Counselors (HC). However, two key differences were observed in the results for the two types of facilities. First, the CSC participants in the public sector clinics were more likely to consider the HCs to be an important component of providing care who served as a link between patient and the doctor, provided them skills on stress management and helped in adherence to medication. Second, in the private sector, doctors performed roles similar to those of the HCs and participants in both arms placed much faith in the doctor who acted as a confidante and was perceived to understand the participant's health and context intimately. Lay counselors working in a CSC model have a positive effect on symptomatic relief, social functioning and satisfaction with care in patients with CMD attending primary care clinics although the impact, compared with usual care, is greater in the public sector.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Qualitative evaluation of a lay counselor primary mental health care intervention.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>The intervention led to improved patients' health and social outcomes.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Improvements were attributed to both counselling and medicines.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Differences were greater in the public compared with the private facilities.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>India</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Anxiety</kwd><kwd>Qualitative</kwd><kwd>Lay health workers</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Depressive or anxiety disorders ('common mental disorders' or CMD) are the leading psychiatric causes of the global burden of disease and the vast majority of patients with these disorders present in primary health care (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Marcus, Yasamy, Ommeren, Chisholm, &#x00026; Saxena, 2012</xref>). In spite of robust evidence that supports the effectiveness of brief psychological treatments and antidepressants for these disorders (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2001</xref>); a large treatment gap is observed in low resource settings due to various barriers faced for mental health care in primary care settings (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Kohn, Saxena, Levav, &#x00026; Saraceno, 2004</xref>). Notable among these barriers is the lack of skilled and affordable human resources in such settings to deliver the psychosocial interventions and support adherence with medication. The MANAS trial (MANashanti Sudhar Shodh, which means &#x0201c;project to promote mental health&#x0201d; in the Konkani language) was aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a collaborative stepped care (CSC) intervention, against the enhanced usual care (EUC), for CMD that was led by lay counselors in government-run primary health centers (PHCs) and private general practitioner (GP) settings in Goa, India. Full details of the intervention and the evaluation have been published elsewhere (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chatterjee, Chowdhary, Pednekar, &#x00026; Cohen, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Patel, Weiss, Chowdhary, &#x00026; Naik, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). <xref rid="tbox1" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref> provides the detailed overview of the MANAS trial. The major results of the quantitative outcome measures revealed that although the intervention was consistently associated with strong beneficial effects on the mental health and functional status of participants in the PHCs, there was little evidence of impact of the intervention on outcomes among participants attending GP facilities, principally because the comparison arm facilities did as well as the intervention facilities.</p><p>There is an increased recognition of the value of embedding qualitative research in RCTs as qualitative data can offer explanations of the processes and intervening factors that yielded quantitative outcomes (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hawe, Shiell, Riley, &#x00026; Gold, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Lewin, Glenton, &#x00026; Oxman, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Oakley, Strange, Bonell, Allen, &#x00026; Stephenson, 2006</xref>) and in evaluating outcomes which are difficult to assess using quantitative tools (e.g., subjective experiences of the quality of care). Thus, the qualitative approach not only helps unpack the contextual factors or intervention characteristics that may have influenced the trial results but also increases the range of outcomes which might be evaluated in the trial (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bower, Gilbody, Richards, &#x00026; Flecher, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Glenton, Lewin, &#x00026; Scheel, 2011</xref>). The major aim of the qualitative study described in this paper was to explore the experience of the addition of a lay counselor, and the role of key other members of the primary care team, to address CMDs in public and private primary care. A secondary aim was to explore and compare the impact of the intervention on health and social functioning between the two arms. The analyses were carried out separately for each of the two types of facilities in order to understand better the reasons for the differential quantitative findings. The analyses in this article focus on the experiences of participants; the experiences of providers have been published elsewhere (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Pereira, Andrew, Pednekar, Kirkwood, &#x00026; Patel, 2011</xref>) and the findings of the two analyses are triangulated in the discussion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Sample</title><p>The qualitative study sample was recruited after meeting the sample targets of quantitative trial, but following the same criteria as the main trial (<xref rid="tbox1" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref>) with the sole exception that only patients with moderate to severe CMD, i.e. a higher cut-off score on the General Health Questionnaire-12 were selected (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Patel, Araya, Chowdhary, King, Kirkwood, 2008</xref>). Of those who met these criteria and were screened positive, purposive sampling was then carried out to meet two criteria: we over-sampled females to be consistent with the demographic characteristics of patients with CMD in primary care and, in CSC attendees; we sampled participants to reflect a diverse level of adherence with the intervention. In this way, in each EUC facility, 3 female and 1 male participant and in each CSC facility, 6 female and 2 male participants were purposively invited to participate. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> reports the total numbers of participants recruited, their characteristics and follow-up rates. In summary, 69 CSC and 46 EUC participants took part in the study of whom 79% (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;55) and 82.6% (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;38) respectively completed the follow up interview.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Data collection and analysis</title><p>Data were collected through two semi-structured interviews; the first interview was conducted about 2 months after recruitment while the second interview was conducted between 6 and 8 months after recruitment. Data for the PHC phase were collected between September 2007 and July 2008 and for the GP phase between December 2008 and November 2009. Interviews were mostly at the participants' home, with one exception (where the participant preferred PHC as the location of the interview). Most interviews were conducted in Konkani (113/115; the remainder in English) by a team of four trained field researchers. On an average, the first interview lasted for 45&#x000a0;min to an hour while the follow up interview took around 30&#x000a0;min. The first interview guide addressed the participant's experience of the illness before recruitment in the trial; changes in health and social well-being since recruitment; and the participant's experiences about the various treatment components (based on the allocation arm). In the follow up interview, the participant's health and social well being were reviewed once more and gaps in the information from the first interview were addressed.</p><p>All interviews were audio-taped; the recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and local language interviews were translated into English. Subsequently, the memos (reflective notes about the interviews) and field notes written by the interviewers were attached to the main text of the interviews. We used thematic analysis (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Aronson, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Auerbach &#x00026; Silverstein, 2003</xref>, Chap. 6 &#x00026; 7; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Braun &#x00026; Clarke, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Miles &#x00026; Huberman, 1994</xref>, Chap. 4 &#x00026; 5; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Strauss, 1987</xref>, Chap. 1; Part II). In the first stage, two authors (SS &#x00026; GA) read and familiarized themselves with the data. In the second stage, the two authors (SS &#x00026; GA) selected 10 interviews and generated initial codes through coding parcels of data in a systematic fashion (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Miles &#x00026; Huberman, 1994</xref>, Chap. 4 &#x00026; 5). Third, based on the coded data and the original research questions, the researchers defined and collated codes into potential themes, and finalized the code-book. The major identified themes were: role and experience of the HC, HA and primary care doctor; baseline experience of symptoms and social functioning; and change and attribution of change over time in these outcomes. In the fourth stage, the inter-rater reliability was tested by double coding 10 randomly selected interview scripts (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Miles &#x00026; Huberman, 1994</xref>, Chap. 4 &#x00026; 5), i.e. four researchers (including two researchers who worked during the earlier stages) coded the same documents and discussed the agreements and disagreements. The inter-rater reliability i.e. total number of agreements divided by total number of comparisons was around 85%. Then these four researchers coded the entire data set. In the final stage, two researchers (SS &#x00026; GA) tallied simple frequencies for major themes (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Neuendorf, 2002</xref>, Chap. 3), selected and analyzed vivid and compelling examples of narrative extracts, and related these to the research questions.

Belonging to the local community, she delivered a range of psychosocial treatments including psychoeducation, interpersonal therapy, adherence management, referral to various agencies for social difficulties and offering yoga sessions where practical. More than three-fourth of the CSC participants in the PHC phase (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;25; 81%) and half of the participants in the GP phase (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;19; 50%) described the interactions with the HCs as beneficial. These participants depicted the HC as a good listener, problem solver, empathetic, caring, gentle, and supportive. Participants appreciated the HC's approach of helping the participant to understand his/her illness, probing about the psychosocial context and participants' beliefs and priorities, and suggesting various techniques for coping. These participants reported that communication with the HC was also essential to creating a good interpersonal relationship, information exchange and optimal decision making.<disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;She asked what is happening with me. I understood all her questions. She has to ask such questions about my health. The questions she asked were good. I told her whatever she asked. She patiently listened to my answers.

She gave me some useful information and also told about the yoga and breathing exercises. This kind of information is not provided in other clinics. In those clinics, one just visits the doctor and comes back. But this was very helpful for me. These exercises helped in calming down and think in right direction. I feel much better now. I do not feel weak and fatigued. I feel like working. I now carry most of the household work. I feel this change is there because I follow the techniques suggested by the lady in the PHC (HC). She is good natured. Every time I meet her, she reminded me to take medicines on time.&#x0201d; (Female, 32, CSC)</p></disp-quote></p><p>CSC arm participants, mainly from the PHC phase, also reported that the HC was instrumental in helping them improving the disturbed relationship with the family members and significant others (such as neighbors).

They found this process helpful as someone listened to them carefully and this offered an opportunity for catharsis of their stressors. Thus, some HAs seemed to exceed their prescribed role of screening by also offering advice and exploring the participant's perspective (ideas, concerns, expectations, impact of condition on everyday life, etc.) about their illness and these were instrumental in relieving distress.<disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;I think this programme is good.

Patients in both arms encountered a new health personnel (the Health Assistant) in the clinic who carried out the screening to detect CMD in addition to their doctor. In the intervention arm, an additional personnel was the Health Counselor (HC), the lay health worker who provided case management and psychosocial interventions. Our primary findings are that when compared with enhanced usual care, more participants in the intervention arm reported relief from symptoms, and an improvement in social functioning in terms of relationships with other family members and significant others and positive impact on work and activities in day-to-day life. The intervention arm participants attributed their improvement to both medication received from the doctors and the strategies suggested by the HCs. Greater number of participants from the intervention arm also reported satisfaction with the overall quality of the care. Contact with the HA was also found to be beneficial by participants in both arms. Participants from control arm were more likely to seek multiple treatment sources and engage in &#x02018;doctor shopping&#x02019; due to lesser satisfaction with provision of services and perceived impact of care received. However, some key differences were observed in the results for the private and public facilities.</p><p>The quantitative evaluation revealed that the intervention was consistently associated with strong beneficial effects over the 12 months on impact on mental health and disability outcomes in public facilities (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Patel, et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). The results obtained through this qualitative investigation confirm that a collaborative-stepped care intervention delivered by HCs can improve recovery rates for patients with CMDs in public PHC settings. Though two key components of the intervention (provision of screening results to participants and physicians, and evidence-based guidelines to the physician) were offered in both the groups, the qualitative investigation indicate that the differences in the results are due to the instrumental role played by HCs in intervention arm. The intervention arm participants considered the HCs to be an important component of providing care who served as a link between patient and the doctor, provided them skills on stress management and helped in adherence to medication. In the PHCs, larger numbers of patients are seen by the doctor in a shorter period and hence the setting and time constraints limit the ability of the doctor to discuss the interpersonal and social difficulties and issues related to treatment management and adherence. Our findings indicate that this gap was filled by the HCs and to some extent by HAs, with whom participants could discuss range of issues related to illness as well as interpersonal and social difficulties. It is well established that a positive therapeutic relationship in which patients feel free to discuss their problems and work toward their resolution is related to improved outcomes from treatment, particularly in primary care (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson, Lindberg, &#x00026; Troein, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cape, 2000</xref>). These findings are also consistent with those obtained from semi-structured interviews with healthcare providers of the MANAS trial (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Pereira et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). The PHC healthcare providers recognized the importance of screening and the categorization of the severity of CMD by the HA and reporting of the results on a patient card as an aid in diagnosis and providing treatment, which helped them in overcoming the challenges of the shortage of time and the common presentation of somatic symptoms. These health care providers also valued the contribution of HCs who provided a range of psychosocial treatments and emphasized adherence management which widened the scope of health care interventions and enhanced the likelihood of success.</p><p>Quantitative findings of the MANAS trial also revealed significant effect modification by type of site, i.e. the recovery rates were not significantly different between the two arms in the private facility phase because the control arm participants had similar recovery rates as those of the intervention in either phase (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Patel et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). In part, our qualitative findings confirm that the greater effectiveness of the private control arm (compared with the control arm of the public facilities) was due to the nature of the therapeutic relationship between patients and doctors. Thus, participants described sharing a long-term and trusting relationship with the doctor. Participants from both arms placed faith in the doctor who also acted as a confidante, was known to the patient for a long period of time, and was perceived to understand the patient's health and context intimately. Unsurprisingly, private sector participants were more likely to report satisfaction with the communication and treatment provided by the doctor. In addition, majority of the beneficiaries, even from the intervention arm, associated improvement to the antidepressants rather than to the HC component of intervention. Thus, it seemed that to a large extent the treatment and care provided by the private doctors approximated the care provided by the HCs. In addition, some participants also reported that interaction with HAs was helpful and therapeutic, and served as a catharsis of their stressors in life; indeed, some participants in the intervention arm confused the roles of the HC with the person carrying out the screening. Although the qualitative investigation observed that greater numbers of participants from the intervention arm than control reported relief from the symptoms, there were fewer differences in improvement in interpersonal relations, work life and perceptions of quality of care. These findings are consistent with those obtained from semi-structured interviews with private GPs of the MANAS trial (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Pereira et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). The interviews with the control arm GPs revealed a number of practices which approximated the program interventions to the extent to which these might well explain their comparable performance. Thus, most GPs routinely diagnosed CMD, and provided psychoeducation, advised on life style changes and problem solving. These GPs also routinely prescribed ADT and referred patients with severe CMD to a psychiatrist. Above all, GPs developed good rapport with patients, offering one-to-one consultations in a private space, maintaining confidentiality, and offering advice which reflected their long-standing relationship with the patient and understanding of the patient's social context. Hence, it appears that there is little advantage in adding a new human resource in the form of a counselor/case manager in private primary care settings, though the addition of screening may be of some additional value.</p><p>Although there are now several trials conducted on collaborative stepped care approach to manage depression in the primary care settings in the high and middle income countries, to the best of our knowledge, MANAS is the first trial evaluating the impact of the intervention through concurrent quantitative and qualitative investigation. In conclusion, results from this qualitative investigation indicate the effectiveness of a lay health counselor-led collaborative stepped-care intervention for CMDs in public PHCs on a range of outcomes including symptomatic relief, social functioning and satisfaction with care. The intervention used in the current study may provide a model of how a trained lay counselor can assist the busy public sector primary care physician in educating patients, monitoring and reinforcing adherence, and helping patients with behavioral and lifestyle changes that may be beneficial to their clinical outcome. In the private sector, training GP's in detection, treatment and care of common mental disorders may be sufficient to achieve comparable outcomes. Policy makers concerned with public health care should consider including lay health workers as a key human resource for delivering collaborative care for CMDs in resource constrained, busy public primary care facilities.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindberg</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Troein</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>What shapes GPs' work with depressed patients?

Exclusion criteria: Participants requiring urgent medical attention; and having difficulty with hearing, speaking or cognition that makes interviewing difficult</td></tr><tr><td>Total N: 2796 participants (1648 in public sector, and 1148 in private sector)</td></tr><tr><td>Intervention: The Collaborative Stepped Care (CSC) multi-component intervention was developed through a systematic process based on the MRC framework for the development of complex health care interventions (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Craig et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). The findings of this formative work and the final intervention are published elsewhere (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chatterjee et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). The intervention comprised the following components: case management, psychoeducation, interpersonal psychotherapy, antidepressants (for moderate/severe CMD), adherence support and referral to social welfare agencies. In addition, yoga was offered as an adjunctive intervention in those clinics where space was available. All psychosocial components were delivered by a lay health counselor (HC) and medication by the primary care physician. A mental health specialist provided support and supervision to the PHC team. The intervention components were delivered in a four step fashion (step 1: psychoeducation; step 2: antidepressant or psychotherapy; step 3: antidepressant plus psychotherapy; step 4: referral to a psychiatrist) with clear rules on progression between steps.</td></tr><tr><td>Comparison arm: Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) comprised providing the primary care physicians with the results of the diagnostic screening and guidelines for the treatment of CMD. There were no additional human resources.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></boxed-text></floats-group></article>
