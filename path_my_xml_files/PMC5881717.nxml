Introduction</title><p>Until recently, the main objective when treating patients with Crohn&#x02019;s disease [CD] was to alleviate disease-related symptoms.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, improvement of symptoms does not always indicate control of objectively assessed underlying inflammation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In contrast, the presence of deep, extensive ulcers strongly increases the chance of future colectomy.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Newer, more highly effective therapies have shifted the treatment goals for patients with CD to achieving outcomes such as mucosal healing which potentially lead to disease modification in parallel with clinical remission.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Mucosal healing has been associated with positive long-term clinical and surgical outcomes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref></sup></p><p>Treatment with the anti&#x02013;tumour necrosis factor [TNF] monoclonal antibodies adalimumab and infliximab may allow mucosal healing to be a realistic treatment target for patients with CD. The Extend the Safety and Efficacy of Adalimumab through Endoscopic Healing [EXTEND; NCT00348283] study was the first randomised, placebo-controlled study in patients with CD to use mucosal healing as the primary endpoint.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In EXTEND, maintenance adalimumab treatment [ie, induction and subsequent active therapy] resulted in greater mucosal healing rates compared with induction-only adalimumab treatment [ie, randomisation to placebo after adalimumab induction] in patients with moderate to severe ileocolonic CD and documented mucosal ulcers.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>To date, no data are available regarding the characterisation of mucosal lesions across the different colonic segments and ileum [ie, the rectum, sigmoid/left colon, transverse colon, right colon, and ileum] during the course of anti&#x02013;TNF alpha treatment. This has clinical implications because it remains an open question whether mucosal healing observed by colonoscopy in the more easily accessed distal colonic segments is likely to indicate healing in the ileum as well. If the pattern of mucosal healing is found to vary among the segments [in particular, between ileal and colonic mucosa], it could suggest differences in the resolution mechanisms induced by anti-TNF alpha agents along the inflamed intestinal tract. These findings offer possibilities of adjusting treatment strategies for response enhancement based on specific locations of involvement. Using data from patients enrolled in the EXTEND study, we assessed the potential of adalimumab maintenance treatment [including an induction period] to achieve mucosal healing at five different specific ileocolonic segments.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2. Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>2.1. Study design and patients</title><p>Detailed information regarding the design and patient disposition of EXTEND has been reported previously.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Briefly, EXTEND was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that assessed adalimumab safety and efficacy in inducing and maintaining mucosal healing in adults with moderately to severely active ileocolonic CD for &#x0003e; 4 months and a Crohn&#x02019;s Disease Activity Index [CDAI] value of 220 to 450 with documented mucosal ulceration by recorded ileocolonoscopy at screening.</p><p>All patients received open-label adalimumab induction [160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2]. At Week 4, patients were randomised to receive adalimumab [40 mg every other week] or placebo until Week 52. Beginning at Week 8, patients experiencing flare/non-response could move to open-label adalimumab every other week, followed by weekly adalimumab for continued flare/non-response.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>2.2. Study assessments</title><p>To better establish patterns of healing, multiple scoring systems derived from endoscopy (Crohn&#x02019;s Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity [CDEIS]<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn&#x02019;s Disease [SES-CD]<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>) and histology (Colonic and Ileal Global Histologic Disease Activity Scores [CGHAS and IGHAS], respectively)<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>] were used. All analyses presented here used data from blinded central readings.</p><p>In EXTEND, patients underwent a maximum of four endoscopies, conducted at screening, Week 12, the time of moving to open-label every-other-week dosing [if after Week 12], and Week 52. For the endoscopies, the five segments were recorded sequentially for approximately 1 min each on withdrawal of the endoscope and read centrally by one of the authors [PR].</p><p>The presence and extent of ulcers in the ileocolonic segments were derived from the CDEIS.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The CDEIS scores six endoscopic variables [presence of deep ulcers, superficial ulcers, nonulcerated stenosis, and ulcerated stenosis; proportion of ulcerated surfaces; and surface involved by disease] that are assessed in each of five ileocolonic segments [rectum, sigmoid/left colon, transverse colon, right colon, and ileum].<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> When present in a segment, deep ulcers received a score of 12, whereas superficial ulcers received a score of 6; the absence of ulcers was scored as 0.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Overall CDEIS values range from 0 to 44, with higher values indicating more severe disease.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In this analysis, the two stenosis-related subscores were not evaluated. Few patients had stenosis at baseline.</p><p>The SES-CD is a simple scoring system based on four endoscopic variables [presence and size of ulcers, proportion of surface covered by ulcers, proportion of affected surface, and presence and severity of stenosis] measured in the same five ileocolonic segments as the CDEIS.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Overall values on the SES-CD range from 0 to 56, with higher values indicating more severe disease.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The value for each variable ranges from 0 to 3, so that the score in each segment can range from 0 to 15; however, the maximum stenosis score in a segment distal to another evaluable segment cannot exceed 2, so that the stenosis scores cannot exceed a total of 11.</p><p>For the histological analysis, performed by one of the authors [KG], up to 10 biopsy specimens [two from each segment] were collected at each endoscopy; if involved areas were present, the samples were taken from those locations. Healing based on histology was assessed using the CGHAS and IGHAS <bold>[</bold>
Supplementary Table 1, available as Supplementary data at <italic>ECCO-JCC</italic> online
<bold>]</bold> and was defined as CGHAS or IGHAS &#x02264; 2 at Weeks 12 and 52.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> These measures assessed: the extent of epithelial damage and architectural changes; the presence of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells in the lamina propria, polymorphonuclear cells [ie, neutrophils] in the epithelium, erosions or ulcers, and granuloma; and the proportion of &#x02265; 6 biopsy samples that were affected. Each total score could range from 0 [least severe] to 16 [most severe] when segments were summed either in the entire colon or in the ileum specifically.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>2.3. Statistical analyses</title><sec id="s6"><title>2.3.1. CDEIS endoscopy data</title><p>In this report, CDEIS endoscopy analyses included only patients randomised at Week 4 who had CDEIS values at all three endoscopy visits [baseline, Week 12, and Week 52]. Patients who moved to open-label adalimumab before Week 12 were excluded. Patients were analysed according to their randomised treatment group, regardless of whether they moved to open-label adalimumab at Week 12 or later. However, if a patient moved to open-label adalimumab after Week 12, the observation at the time of moving to the open-label treatment was imputed as the Week 52 data point. In the ileocolon as a whole, for the CDEIS, the absence or presence of deep mucosal ulcers [originally scored as 0 or 12, respectively, and coded for this analysis as &#x02018;no&#x02019; or &#x02018;yes&#x02019;] was calculated at Weeks 12 and 52; the same analysis was repeated for superficial ulcers [originally scored as 6 when present and coded for this analysis as &#x02018;yes&#x02019;]. In individual ileocolonic segments, mean changes from baseline in the CDEIS subscores of percentage surface involved and ulcerated surfaces were determined at Weeks 12 and 52; improvement was indicated by a decrease in the CDEIS subscores.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>2.3.2. SES-CD endoscopy data</title><p>In this report, SES-CD endoscopy analyses included only patients randomised at Week 4 who had SES-CD values at all three endoscopy visits [baseline, Week 12, and Week 52]. As with CDEIS analyses, patients who moved to open-label adalimumab before Week 12 were excluded, patients were analysed according to their randomised treatment group, and patients who moved to open-label adalimumab after Week 12 had the assessment at that time imputed as the Week 52 data. For SES-CD analysis, two subscores were evaluated: size of ulcers (0 = no ulcers, 1 = aphthous ulcers [&#x0003e; 0.1&#x02013;0.5 cm], 2 = large ulcers [&#x0003e; 0.5&#x02013;2 cm], and 3 = very large ulcers [&#x0003e; 2 cm]) and ulcerated surfaces [0 = none, 1 = &#x0003c; 10%, 2 = 10%&#x02013;30%, and 3 = &#x0003e; 30%].<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Shifts from baseline in these SES-CD subscores were determined in each ileocolonic segment at Weeks 12 and 52. In patients with subscores of 1, 2, or 3 at baseline, the percentages who improved [ie, decreased by at least 1 point] at Weeks 12 and 52 were also determined. No data were imputed for missing values in shift analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>2.3.3. CGHAS and IGHAS histology data</title><p>For histological analyses, all randomised patients who had CGHAS or IGHAS scores &#x02265; 3 at the baseline colonoscopy, indicating an ulcer, and who received at least one dose of blinded therapy, were included. Patients with missing data at Weeks 12 and 52 [and those who moved to open-label adalimumab at any time] were counted as not having achieved a response for these endpoints (ie, imputed as non-responders [NRI]). The different population for the histological analyses [ie, including patients with missing data at some time points, whereas endoscopic analysis included only patients without missing data] was dictated by the timing of study assessments. For patients who moved to adalimumab treatment because of disease flare after Week 12, endoscopy data from the visit at the time of the move to the open-label treatment was used as the last assessment for colonoscopy endpoints and did not include tissue samples for histology analysis.</p><p>
<italic>P</italic>-values for continuous variables [eg, mean changes from baseline] were from an analysis of covariance model with treatment as independent variable and the baseline value of the variable under analysis as covariate. <italic>P</italic>-values for categorical variables [eg, percentages of patients achieving an endpoint] were derived from Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. Due to small sample sizes, <italic>p</italic>-values were not calculated for some categorical variables.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s9"><title>3. Results</title><sec id="s10"><title>3.1.

Discussion</title><p>Identifying the pattern of mucosal healing following treatment may be important for indicating whether patients with positive changes in a distal region [eg, the colon] are likely to experience corresponding improvements in proximal regions [eg, the ileum]. It has generally been thought that disease involvement in CD is more severe in the rectum and ileum, and that healing of mucosal ulceration with systemic therapy proceeds in a mostly uniform way among segments of the colon and ileum. However, no research has been done specifically to support these beliefs. The EXTEND study provided an opportunity to examine these questions in patients with moderately to severely active CD and ulcers at baseline, who were treated for 52 weeks. In this post-hoc analysis, our findings based on EXTEND data challenge both of the prior assumptions. The severity of disease before initiation of adalimumab treatment was similar across segments [range of mean values in patients who later received maintenance adalimumab: CDEIS surface involved, 3.6&#x02013;4.9; CDEIS ulcerated surface, 0.9&#x02013;1.9], and was no greater in the rectum and ileum compared with other locations. However, healing of mucosal ulcers with maintenance adalimumab was not consistent across segments; multiple different assessments based on endoscopy demonstrated that the rectum, sigmoid/left colon, and transverse colon healed more readily than the right colon and ileum. Baseline ulceration was similar across segments; thus, the different patterns of healing among those segments at Week 52 cannot be explained by initial variation in the degree of involvement. Consistent with endoscopy results, healing according to histology was more frequent in the colon than the ileum. Our analyses indicate that healing in distal and proximal ileocolonic regions is not uniform, implying that colonoscopy of all segments may be important for a full assessment of disease activity. The difference in endoscopic healing among ileal and colonic segments could be correlated with recent genetic data, which separated ileal Crohn&#x02019;s disease and colonic Crohn&#x02019;s disease.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>The greatest improvements in CDEIS surface involved and ulcerated surfaces subscores at Week 52 following maintenance adalimumab treatment occurred in the rectum [&#x02212;86% to &#x02212;88%], sigmoid/left colon [&#x02212;83% to &#x02013;91%], and transverse colon [&#x02212;69% to &#x02212;75%], compared with the right colon [&#x02212;27% to &#x02212;50%] and ileum [&#x02212;22% to &#x02212;31%]. The differences in improvements were unrelated to CDEIS subscores at baseline, which were similar across segments, although mean baseline severity was worst in one of the segments [ie, the transverse colon] that later improved the most with treatment. Similarly, SES-CD shift analyses suggested a pattern of greater healing in the rectum, sigmoid/left colon, and transverse colon relative to the right colon and ileum. However, in these analyses, the CDEIS appeared to be more sensitive to changes in ulcerated surface than the SES-CD; this could be an important consideration when designing studies that aim to detect small efficacy signals. Finally, histological healing was more common in the colon compared with the ileum at Week 52 [28% vs 21%, respectively]. The natural course of CD in the patients who received adalimumab induction followed by placebo exhibited a different trajectory: surface involvement increased slightly at Week 52 in the rectum, but ulcerated surface decreased, which suggests spreading of mild effects of CD on the mucosa.</p><p>The improvements in the presence of ulcers and in the CDEIS surface involved and ulcerated surfaces observed following adalimumab maintenance in the different ileocolonic segments are consistent with the original findings from the EXTEND study, which showed that a greater percentage of patients receiving adalimumab maintenance compared with adalimumab induction only followed by placebo achieved complete mucosal healing.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The present findings suggest that adalimumab has efficacy across all segments but that some of those segments heal less readily than others. However, several differences from the original analyses should be noted when considering the implications of the segmental analyses. First, the mucosal healing results in the present analyses as compared with the original analyses could have been influenced by differences in the endpoints that were chosen and the imputation methods that were used. The original analysis included all patients with ulceration at screening, and patients with missing data at Weeks 12 and 52 were treated as non-responders at those time points. The present analysis included only patients who had data at baseline, Week 12, and Week 52 [or who moved to open-label adalimumab therapy after Week 12]; therefore, no imputation was needed. Selecting patients with data at all assessments could have biased the results. Finally, the original analysis examined all types of ulcers, whereas the present analysis explored deep and superficial ulcers separately.</p><p>This analysis that characterised CDEIS and SES-CD improvements by ileocolonic segments has several potential strengths. All analysed patients had at least one ulcer at baseline; therefore, any improvements in those segments clearly constitute resolution of mucosal inflammation. The 52-week period of treatment allowed for evaluation of long-term effects, which may be important for robust healing, particularly of deep ulcers. Focusing on data from Week 52 also avoided complications at earlier times caused by lingering effects of the induction regimen in patients subsequently randomised to placebo.</p><p>The interpretation of the results is limited by several considerations beyond the potential bias that is inherent in post-hoc exploration of data. First, the overall number of patients available for analysis, compared with the original EXTEND study population, was limited by the necessary requirement that they have valid data at baseline, Week 12, and Week 52. Second, the sizes of some analysis groups were small, limiting the validity of comparisons, especially for the shifts in SES-CD ulcerated surfaces and ulcer size subscores. In particular, the numbers of patients with large or very large ulcers and with ulcerated surfaces &#x02265; 10% at baseline were very small, creating a &#x02018;ceiling effect&#x02019; on possible improvement. More fundamentally, the endoscopic data did not track individual lesions over time. Therefore, a deep ulcer could have become a superficial ulcer or vice versa, and entirely new ulcers could have appeared. This limits the confidence with which it is possible to say that ulcers were completely healed. The consistent pattern of results among different endpoints increases confidence in the overall findings, which suggest that mucosal healing was common in the rectum, most frequent in the sigmoid/left colon and transverse colon, less common in the right colon, and least frequent in the ileum.</p><p>Whether some ileocolonic segments are inherently more resistant than others to healing is an intriguing question that cannot be definitively answered with the data from EXTEND. Genome-wide association study data have suggested that some genes involved in susceptibility to CD differ for colonic vs ileal involvement.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Arguing against the idea of resistance to healing in the ileum is that adalimumab suppressed recurrence of ulceration to a significantly greater degree than thiopurine treatment in the Post-Operative Crohn&#x02019;s Endoscopic Recurrence study; nearly all patients in that study had previous partial resection of the ileum.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> However, greater healing according to the CDEIS ulcerated surface subscore was observed previously in the rectum and right colon as compared with the transverse colon, sigmoid/left colon, and ileum in patients with CD who received infliximab.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Because of the small sample size of this study, we could not address whether baseline variables associated with differences in outcome to anti-TNF alpha agents [ie, disease duration, previous treatment history, concomitant treatment, and body weight] could further modulate differences in segment-specific resolution of inflammation. Larger prospective studies would be needed to confirm our descriptive findings on the locations and timing of mucosal healing among ileocolonic segments.</p><p>In conclusion, in patients with moderate to severe CD, the baseline severity of disease involvement was similar across segments of the colon and ileum, yet mucosal healing at Week 52 with systemic treatment was not uniform among all segments. The greatest improvements in subscores for CDEIS surface involved in the disease, CDEIS ulcerated surface, SES-CD ulcer size, and SES-CD ulcerated surfaces subscores, were observed in the rectum, sigmoid/left colon, and transverse colon. Histological findings indicated that healing in the colon was more frequent than healing in the ileum. Together, our results suggest that the colon might heal more readily than the ileum during treatment with adalimumab and, potentially, other agents of the anti-TNF class. Thus, it cannot be presumed that healing of distal segments on imaging indicates that proximal segments have also healed; rather, direct inspection of all ileocolonic segments is necessary to determine to what extent ulceration in the entire tract has resolved.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by research grants from AbbVie Inc.
