Microvascular and macrovascular complications are mainly or partly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) dependent on dysglycemia, which has two main components: chronic sustained hyperglycemia (integrated by HbA<sub>1c</sub>) and acute glycemic fluctuations from peaks to nadirs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Both components lead to diabetes complications through two major mechanisms: activation of oxidative stress and increased activity of the innate immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Recent studies strongly suggest that daily periods of glucose fluctuations exhibited a more specific triggering effect on oxidative stress than chronic sustained hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Oxidative stress has been highly and positively correlated with glycemic variability over a daily period as assessed from the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). As consequence, the concept that postprandial hyperglycemic spikes are &#x0201c;dangerous waves&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) should be extended to upward (postprandial) and downward (interprandial) periods as well as to nocturnal fluctuations of glucose around a mean value. All these values might be integrated in the MAGE. In such context, the failure of a therapeutic strategy targeting chronic sustained hyperglycemia to the normal levels in reducing cardiovascular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) might have been because the mere control of fasting glucose and HbA<sub>1c</sub>, without control of glycemic excursions over a daily period, may be not sufficient to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. Therefore, the pathophysiology of diabetes complications can be considered the result of three main glycemic disorders: fasting hyperglycemia, postprandial hyperglycemia, and acute glucose fluctuations over a daily period. Thus, a global antidiabetes therapeutic strategy should be aimed at reducing the values of those three main glycemic disorders.</p><p>It is not clear, however, whether pharmacologic interventions targeting glycemic excursions over a daily period provide specific benefits (reduction of oxidative stress and production of proinflammatory cytokines) relative to other pharmacologic therapies lowering HbA<sub>1c</sub> comparably. The acute fluctuations of glucose around a mean value over a daily period have been proved independent of mean glycemia and related to defects in insulin secretion and suppression of glucagon secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). More recently, we demonstrated that augmentation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) by inhibitors of the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-4), such as vildagliptin, that enhance glucose-induced insulin secretion and decrease glucagon secretion over a daily period, reduces HbA<sub>1c</sub> and glycemic fluctuations over a daily period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). However, no prior studies have examined the effects of the blunted glycemic fluctuations with vildagliptin on atherosclerosis risk factors such as oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines.</p><p>According to the evidence that daily glucose fluctuations are more reduced in patients treated with vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) than in patients treated with sitagliptin (100 mg once daily) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), a study was conducted to evaluate the effects of vildagliptin as a therapeutic strategy useful for stabilizing glucose excursions over a daily period and lowering oxidative stress (as estimated from measurement of nitrotyrosine) and proinflammatory cytokines implicated in the atherosclerotic process, such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-18, in patients with type 2 diabetes poorly controlled along with metformin therapy.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>We screened 111 type 2 diabetic patients regularly attending our clinic at the Second University of Naples. Among them, we selected 90 type 2 diabetic patients (43 men and 47 women) without adequate glycemic control (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;7.5%) on metformin treatment at maximal dose (2,000 mg/day) for at least 8 weeks before enrollment. Criteria for exclusion encompassed insulin use or GLP-1 analog, concomitant chronic diseases, including kidney, liver, cardiovascular diseases, severe uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure &#x02265;200/100 mmHg), or recent acute illness, or a change in diet, treatment, or lifestyle within the 3 months before the study. All patients gave informed consent to participate in the trial, which was approved by our institution&#x02019;s ethics committee.</p><sec id="s2"><title>Randomized trial</title><p>We evaluated the effects of blunted daily glucose excursions on plasma nitrotyrosine, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), and IL-18 levels in type 2 diabetic patients. The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, open-label PROBE (parallel group with a blinded end point) study of vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily; vildagliptin group) versus sitagliptin (100 mg once daily; sitagliptin group). The doses of both compounds are approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and both compounds were planned to be used in a dose of 100 mg daily. Patients were informed about their therapy in both the vildagliptin and sitagliptin phases.</p><p>The study lasted 15 weeks, including a 3-week screening period and a 12-week active treatment period (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-0199/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>). After 3 weeks, eligible patients were equally randomized in a one-to-one ratio to one of two arms for 12 weeks. All patients received standard dietary counseling by a study investigator in accord with the dietary recommendations of the American Diabetes Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The 90 patients who completed the 12-week study complied with the treatment program through the 6-week return for clinic visits and blood glucose monitoring. Patients were asked to record all hypoglycemic symptoms in their diaries and, if possible, to measure their blood glucose at the time of symptoms. The trial was conducted from May 2010 to June 2011.</p><sec id="s3"><title>Anthropometrics determination.</title><p>Clinical evaluations included physical examination, vital signs, and review of adverse events. Fasting blood levels (at least 12 h from last meal) were assessed at every visit for glycemia and lipid profile, comprising total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL and LDL cholesterol.

CSGM measurements were monitored for 3 consecutive days by using a CSGM system. The sensor was inserted on day 1 and removed on day 3 at midmorning. Glucose levels in a venous sample were calibrated on days 1 and 2 to determine fasting, postprandial, and interprandial glycemia. Standardized meal tests, comprising three mixed meals, was performed on days 1 and 2. After an overnight fast, patients received medications at 0700 h and had breakfast 30 min after treatment. Lunch and dinner were provided 5 and 10 h after the beginning of breakfast, respectively. Standardized breakfast contained 419 kcal (57% carbohydrate, 17% protein, and 26% fat), lunch contained 692 kcal (66% carbohydrate, 16% protein, and 18% fat), and dinner contained 507 kcal (41% carbohydrate, 26% protein, and 32% fat).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Glycemic evaluations.</title><p>The glucose patterns obtained from each patient on study days 1 and 2 underwent the following readings and calculations: <italic>1</italic>) fasting glucose, mean of the fasting values (before breakfast); <italic>2</italic>) postprandial glucose, mean of 2-h postmeal glucose; <italic>3</italic>) insulin secretion (&#x003b2;-cell function), as the ratio between the area under the curve (AUC) of insulin and glucose over the meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>); and <italic>4</italic>) MAGE, calculated according to Service et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), was used for assessing glucose fluctuations during the daily periods. In particular, we used the glucose profiles obtained from the CGMS data on study days 1 and 2 (i.e., from continuous monitoring for 48 h). This parameter was designed to quantify major swings of glycemia and to exclude minor ones. For this reason, only increases of more than 1 SD of the mean glycemic values were taken into account.</p><p>Calculation of the MAGE was obtained by measuring the arithmetic mean of the differences between consecutive peaks and nadirs; measurement in the peak-to-nadir or nadir-to-peak direction was determined by the first qualifying excursion. Measurement of this parameter, which has been proved independent of mean glycemia, is of particular interest because the greater the MAGE, the higher the glycemic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). After each meal, blood samples for measurement of plasma glucose, GLP-1, glucagon, and insulin were obtained every 30 min for 3 h. Values at 180 min after meals were considered as the interprandial period. The serum concentration of adiponectin levels was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&#x00026;D Systems). According to the homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated as follows: Insulin resistance = fasting insulin (&#x003bc;U/mL) &#x000d7; fasting glucose (mmol/L)/22.5.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Oxidative stress.</title><p>Nitrotyrosine plasma concentration was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Nitrotyrosine was determined because this modified amino acid is a product of free-radical (O<sup>2&#x02013;</sup>) interaction with nitric oxide (NO). The interaction of O<sup>2&#x02013;</sup> with NO is very rapid and leads to inactivation of NO and production of the potent oxidant peroxynitrite. Detection of nitrotyrosine is strongly suggestive of increased generation of peroxynitrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). After an overnight fast, at breakfast time, and before the sensor insertion, venous blood samples were drawn for nitrotyrosine evaluation at visits 1 and 3.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Proinflammatory cytokines.</title><p>Serum concentrations of IL-6 and IL-18 were determined in duplicate using a highly sensitive, quantitative sandwich enzyme assay (Quantikine HS PharmPak, R&#x00026;D Systems). High-sensitivity TNF-&#x003b1; was assayed by immunonephelometry on a Behring Nephelometer 2 (Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany). After an overnight fast, at breakfast time, and before the sensor insertion, venous blood samples were drawn for the IL-6 and IL-18 evaluations at visits 1 and 3.

In such analyses, only the change in MAGE was independently associated with both nitrotyrosine (&#x003b2; = 0.39; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and inflammation score (&#x003b2; = 0.62; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) changes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s11"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Our study provides evidence that activation of oxidative stress and increased activity of the innate immune system can be reduced by the control of acute glucose swings over a daily period in type 2 diabetic patients. In particular, vildagliptin versus sitagliptin, despite similar plasma fasting hyperglycemia, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and postprandial glucose, was associated with a greater amelioration of MAGE and reduction of nitrotyrosine levels and proinflammatory cytokines. Although a nonglycemic effect (yet unknown) of vildagliptin on these atherosclerotic markers cannot be ruled out, these results suggest that excessive excursions of plasma glucose over a daily period are harmful for the vascular tree and that MAGE should be considered a treatment target of therapy.</p><p>We found that acute glucose fluctuations were strongly correlated with nitrotyrosine levels, whereas no relationship was observed when nitrotyrosine levels were plotted against the main markers of chronic sustained hyperglycemia (HbA<sub>1c</sub> and fasting glucose concentrations). Nitrotyrosine is considered a good marker of peroxynitrite formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>); thus, the strong correlation between nitrotyrosine levels and MAGE is strongly suggestive for increased generation of peroxynitrite, a potent oxidant. Because peroxynitrite is collectively formed from the interaction of O<sup>2&#x02212;</sup> with NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), the association between nitrotyrosine and MAGE may be a good indicator of the activation of oxidative stress as well as endothelial dysfunction in diabetic patients with acute glucose swings over a daily period, disorders that have been described as one of the main causes of vascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). A similar association was observed between MAGE and inflammatory markers, but no relationship was observed when IL-6 and IL-18 were plotted against the main markers of sustained chronic hyperglycemia (HbA<sub>1c</sub> and fasting glucose concentrations). Such a profile of circulating cytokine concentration may be dangerous for cardiovascular health because elevated circulating concentrations of IL-6 predict future myocardial infarction among apparently healthy men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), and elevated IL-18 concentrations predict future cardiovascular events and death in patients with documented coronary artery disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In addition, we found that nitrotyrosine and circulating cytokines were also correlated with postprandial hyperglycemia values. However, our data evidenced that values of nitrotyrosine and cytokine were more dependent on MAGE than on postprandial glucose. Because glycemic fluctuations as estimated from MAGE indexes reflect both upward and downward glucose changes, whereas postprandial values are only markers of upward variations, there is some reason to think that MAGE indexes are wider integrators of glycemic variations than postprandial glucose. In addition, low glycemic levels in type 2 diabetes might stimulate oxidative stress and the innate immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Therefore, our data provide an important issue on the toxicity of daily glycemic excursions that can lead to endothelial damage as well as to microvascular and macrovascular complications.</p><p>Although several studies have found associations of oxidative stress with daily glucose swings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), interventional studies have not evaluated the effects of the blunted MAGE on both oxidative stress and circulating cytokines. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that glucose fluctuations over a daily period affect the concentration of plasma cytokines and that the control of MAGE reduces the markers of systemic inflammation as well as oxidative stress in type 2 diabetic patients. However, a recent study suggests that a DPP-4 inhibitor exerts antiatherosclerotic effects and reduces inflammation via inhibition of monocyte activation/chemotaxis in mice with atherosclerosis and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In our study, diabetic patients assigned to vildagliptin treatment obtained the greatest reduction in glycemic swings over a daily period. However, the efficacy of vildagliptin was comparable with sitagliptin on the control of main glucose parameters, such as HbA<sub>1c</sub> and fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, over a 3-month study period; nevertheless, the effect to reduce glucose fluctuations over a day, as estimated from MAGE indexes that reflect upward and downward glucose changes, were more pronounced in the vildagliptin group than in the sitagliptin group. These effects could be due to a significantly a better daily GLP-1 inhibition profile, which could be responsible for the changes in MAGE within a shorter range.</p><p>The different kinetics of DPP-4 inhibition (vildagliptin acts as substrate inhibitor, whereas sitagliptin acts as competitive inhibitor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) may help to explain the different effects on incretin profile. On the basis of the crystal structures of chemically related pyrrolidine nitriles with DPP-4, vildagliptin is believed to form a reversible covalent imidate ester adduct, with the active site serine likely assisted by protonation by a neighboring residue, with morphologic change in the binding site, resulting in a longer and stable inhibition compared with sitagliptin, which binds to the same region of the protein as the pyrrolidine nitrile compounds, with the amide carbonyl of sitagliptin binding to Tyr547.62, without morphologic change in the binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Moreover, the differences in pharmacokinetic profiles may induce a different activity over a daily period: plasma DPP-4 activity is inhibited by almost 100% at 15&#x02013;30 min, and &#x0003e;80% inhibition lasts for almost 14 h after a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>); DPP-4 inhibition after vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) remained &#x0003e;80% throughout the 24-h period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>Finally, it is possible that the further improvement observed with vildagliptin is due to a better bioavailability compared with sitagliptin: although the dosage of the two drugs is equivalent, vildagliptin is administered twice daily, whereas sitagliptin is administered once daily, as reported by EMA advice. Thus, the different DPP-4 inhibition profiles as well as the different pharmacokinetic profiles may be responsible for the different effects on glucose fluctuations over a daily period observed in diabetic patients treated with vildagliptin twice daily.</p><p>Moreover, patients who had the greatest reduction of MAGE had the largest reduction of both nitrotyrosine and IL-6 levels. Emerging data suggest that besides being a marker of cardiovascular risk, IL-6 may be a mediator of atherogenesis by quenching NO availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Interestingly enough, glycemic excursions over a daily period also reduce NO bioavailability and increase peroxynitrite, pointing to the intriguing possibility that the combined effect of raised IL-6 concentrations and increased daily glycemic excursions levels in diabetic patients may act synergistically to diminish NO bioactivity. Moreover, increased inflammation and oxidative stress are observed in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and interestingly, reduction of glycemic variability with pancreas transplantation almost completely eliminates oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Finally, DPP-4 inhibition, with both vildagliptin and sitagliptin, had no effects on HOMA-IR and adiponectin levels, according to previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, this study has some limitations. First, the randomized clinical trial used open-label administration of the study drug; however, the concealment of allocation and the use of an objective, blinded, end-point assessment strengthened the significance of results. Second, because of the limited follow-up, we could not evaluate clinical events.</p><p>In conclusion, in type 2 diabetic patients, amelioration of glycemic swings over a daily period provides superior efficacy for regression of atherosclerosis markers at 3 months compared with amelioration of both HbA<sub>1c</sub> and fasting hyperglycemia. These results suggest that control of excessive daily glucose excursions may provide clinical benefit in type 2 diabetic patients, mostly in patients treated with vildagliptin, in which the control of glucose swings over a daily period were more evident than in the group treated with sitagliptin.</p></sec>
