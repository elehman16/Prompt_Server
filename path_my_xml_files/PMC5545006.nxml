Households will be invited to participate, and entomology surveys among 40 randomly selected households per cluster will be carried out quarterly. The primary outcome will be the population density of adult female <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes (i.e., number per house) trapped using adult resting collections. Secondary outcome measures will include the House Index, Container Index, Breteau Index, Pupae Per House, Pupae Per Person, mosquito infection rate, guppy fish coverage, Sumilarv&#x000ae; 2MR coverage, and percentage of respondents with knowledge about <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes causing dengue.

Dengue infection is a systemic and dynamic disease with a wide clinical spectrum that includes both severe and non-severe manifestations and in some cases can lead to death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. With an estimated 3.6 billion people in 124 countries at risk of contracting the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and 390 million dengue infections occurring each year (of which 96 million are clinically apparent) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the dengue virus has become a leading cause of illness in the tropics and subtropics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Asia records 70% of the global disease burden due to dengue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and Cambodia has one of the highest per-capita incidence rates in the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Identified in Cambodia in 1963 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], a total of 194,726 dengue cases were reported to the National Dengue Control Program (NDCP) between 1980 and 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Between 2003 and 2008, annual dengue incidence ranged between 0.7 and 3.0 per 1000 persons, the cost to society estimated at between US$3,327,284 and US$14,429,513 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Since most of this cost falls onto the family, it is estimated that 67% of affected households (HHs) fall into debt to pay for medical bills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, it is likely that the real number of cases and cost to society is much greater, with some studies suggesting the real case numbers are between 3.9 and 29.0 times higher than those of the National Dengue Surveillance System [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Although a number of promising vaccine candidates are in preclinical and clinical development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and methods of genetic control of mosquitoes are being developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], they are years from operational roll-out in Cambodia and are unlikely to provide universal protection. Without a cure or vaccine the most appropriate dengue control measures are vector control and the avoidance of mosquito bites. Several vector-control methods have been studied in Cambodia including chemical and biological substances (temephos, pyriproxyfen (PPF), and <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis</italic> (<italic>Bti</italic>)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], jar covers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and distribution of larvivorous copepods and fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Past research</title><p id="Par29">
<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is highly anthropophilic (preference for human beings), endophilic (resting indoors), and endophagic (preference for feeding indoors) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This partially explains why previous studies showed that household water storage jars contained over 80% of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larvae in Cambodia, and why these jars became the main target for dengue vector-control activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Since the early 1990s, the NDCP has used the larvicide temephos (distributed with brand name Abate&#x000ae;) to target large (200&#x02013;400 L) household water containers as the primary means of vector control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This has continued despite susceptibility tests in 2001 showing resistance of <italic>Ae.</italic> a<italic>egypti</italic> in urban Phnom Penh and incipient resistance in a rural province in Cambodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. An evaluation of the effectiveness of temephos control programs to control larvae in 2007 concluded that control strategies emphasizing the use of temephos should be reconsidered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Although temephos was only distributed during the rainy season, there were still containers found to be positive for immature <italic>Aedes</italic> during the dry season; and the program ignored discarded containers &#x02013; which had twice the number of larvae as water storage containers. Khun and Manderson (2007) concluded that &#x0201c;continued reliance on temephos creates financial and technical problems, while its inappropriate distribution raises the possibility of larvicide resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].&#x0201d;</p><p id="Par30">Following the success of <italic>Mesocyclops</italic> (a genus of copepod crustaceans) programs in locally eliminating <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in Vietnam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], the Cambodian NDCP implemented a 2-year <italic>Mesocyclops</italic> project in Kratie province from 2002 to 2004, searching for an alternative vector-control option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Initial results showed a reduction in the <italic>Aedes</italic> population in the intervention area, but by the end of the project larval densities in the intervention area had increased by 62% from baseline. This apparently lower effectiveness in Cambodia may be because <italic>Mesocyclops</italic> from the local water sources had various parasites, and colonizing them parasite-free requires special training beyond what is possible in most rural Cambodian villages. The environment could have played a role as Northern Vietnam (where programs were most successful) has four distinct seasons and has different flora and fauna. Additionally, many people did not accept <italic>Mesocyclops</italic> to the same extent as other interventions that were provided by the NDCP such as temephos (personal communication, To Setha, 2015).</p><p id="Par31">The search for other vector-control options continued with an evaluation of <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis</italic> (<italic>Bti</italic>), a Gram-positive, soil-dwelling bacterium used as a biological control agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The evaluation of <italic>Bti</italic> in Phnom Penh showed positive results with significant reductions in the number of pupae for at least 2 and 2.5 months in containers with river and well-water, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. More extensive usage and evaluation of <italic>Bti</italic> by the Cambodian government are currently occurring in Kandal and Kampong Thom Provinces (personal communication, Bunleng Sam, 2015).</p><p id="Par32">Jar covers with long-lasting insecticidal netting (LN) treated with deltamethrin were found to have significantly fewer pupae per house, a three-fold decline in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> adult females per house and adult mosquito survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, the magnitude of the reduction diminished over time due to a gradual reduction of insecticidal effect of the jar covers and a residual deltamethrin life of 22 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Interestingly, this is less than the average residual life of deltamethrin in treated bed nets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Another cause may have been children not always keeping the jar covering on after extracting water, and using the covers as toys around the house (personal communication to Setha, 2015) as Khun et al. noted in Cambodia before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Improvements in engineering and design to prevent entry and egress of mosquitoes, especially when the container is used, and an increase the insecticidal effectiveness may be needed for jar covers to be cost-effective public health interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">The use of a larvivorous guppy fish (guppies) (<italic>Poecilia reticulata</italic>) was evaluated in 14 Cambodian villages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and subsequently in a larger study of 28 Cambodian villages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Results from the initial study done from 2006 to 2007 were extremely encouraging with guppies in 56% of eligible containers, and a 79% reduction in <italic>Aedes</italic> infestation compared to the control. Guppy fish are not able to colonize all potential <italic>Aedes</italic> breeding sites, especially those which are polluted or with volume of less than 50 L (personal communication to Setha, 2015). However, despite not having guppies, the smaller or discarded containers in the intervention villages had 51% less infestation than those in the control, suggesting a community-wide protective effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This could partly be due to a spillover effect from treatment villages as no results of guppy coverage were reported in the paper. These results led the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to fund a larger scale-up in 2010&#x02013;2011 which included Communication for Behavioral Impact (COMBI) activities. Results showed 88% guppy fish coverage in eligible water containers and a Container Index (CI), i.e., proportion of surveyed containers containing <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larvae/pupae and indoor resting adult females of near 0 (while the control had a CI of 30) at the end of the project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Similarly encouraging results were found in Laos as a part of the same project. However, there were additional miscellaneous breeding sites including containers too small for guppy survival. Additional tools beyond larvivorous fish are required to target these varied, hard-to-reach and cryptic breeding containers or sites.</p><p id="Par34">One such alternative that has been evaluated in Cambodia is pyriproxyfen (PPF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. PPF is a juvenile hormone analog that interferes with the metamorphosis of juvenile <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, preventing their development into adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The results of the first study in 2003 were so promising &#x02013; at higher doses, inhibition of adult emergence (IE) greater than 87% for 6 months &#x02013; that a larger second study was designed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This showed that a novel 5% controlled-release formation led to IE above 90% for 20 weeks, and above 80% for 34 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A slow-release PPF matrix release formulation (Sumilarv&#x000ae; 2MR) has since been developed and is suitable for containers uninhabitable by guppy fish. The added benefit of this product is that it only requires one distribution every 6 months (the entirety of the rainy season) and cuts down on operational costs as compared to temephos or <italic>Bti</italic> which have a residual efficacy of 2&#x02013;3 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">The effective implementation of Integrated Vector Management requires mobilization and coordination of the resources needed to achieve and sustain behavior changes among populations at risk of dengue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The COMBI strategy provides a social mobilization and communication approach that connects knowledge and behavior, addresses the cost and value of engaging in healthy behaviors, recognizes the gradual stages of behavior change, and creates a supportive environment for behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The challenge for vector control is how community participation can be integrated into vector breeding-source reduction efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Community health workers (CHWs) are a vital part of successful COMBI communication and social mobilization activities. A recent review of 22 studies found that educational messages embedded in a community-based vector-control approach were effective at reducing <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> measured through entomological indices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A separate systematic review found that community-based control strategies in addition or together with biological and chemical vector-control tools reduced classical <italic>Aedes</italic> larval indices in five of six field trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Two cluster randomized trials published after the reviews showed that a community empowerment strategy embedded in a routine dengue vector-control program drastically reduced entomological indices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These past studies show the importance of having a strong community-based COMBI strategy, and the important contribution that it can add when integrated into the vector management strategy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Need for a trial</title><p id="Par36">Although there is evidence suggesting that the use of guppy fish can be beneficial in dengue vector control, recent reviews show that there has never been a cluster randomized trial to evaluate their effectiveness to reduce mosquito indices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Although some studies have evaluated the use of community-based communication programs for dengue control, a recent review found that none had assessed their costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This trial has the potential to inform the strategic application of community-based distribution of PPF and larvivorous fish in an outbreak, during inter-epidemic periods or for broad-scale application. This trial will also be the first to our knowledge to evaluate the wide-scale use of the new Sumilarv&#x000ae; 2MR product in the field (personal communication, John Lucas, 2015). Although guppies, PPF, and COMBI activities have all been evaluated, some of these evaluations were methodologically flawed. Furthermore, they have never been tested in combination.

Finding the appropriate metric to measure disease impact is bedeviled by the effect of human movement on patterns of transmission, and the pronounced temporal and spatial heterogeneity in transmission, which will necessitate very large cluster randomized study designs. We considered passive surveillance for dengue with rapid diagnostic tests in HCs. Although sensitivity among currently available tests was considered acceptable for routine clinical diagnostics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] it was not considered high enough for seroconversion studies. No studies had used rapid diagnostics to estimate seroprevalence. Therefore, more expensive and labor-intensive efforts were preferable, such as cohort studies or capture-recapture methods (which have their own limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]) to estimate the true number of cases, and using a more sensitive diagnostic tool such as RT-PCR. However, due to budget limitations it was not possible to employ them. Additionally, unpublished data from a recent cohort study in the proposed districts suggest that, given similar number of cases during this study timeframe, and the resources available to the current project, there would not be enough statistical power to show an impact of the likely size on case numbers.

A possible source of bias may be not having data collectors blind to the intervention; however, in this case it is unavoidable as data collection teams will be able to see the interventions in the containers which they sample. Contamination (spillover) of COMBI activities from intervention villages could affect our study by increasing knowledge or use of guppy fish in control areas. However, in the previous study it was found that only about 5% of containers had guppies in the control area at the end of the project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Measurements of guppy fish coverage will also be conducted in control villages to identify the extent of any contamination.</p><p id="Par96">Although these data are being collected within one province in Cambodia, it is likely that the result of this trial could be generalizable to areas with similar ecology within the country and in neighboring countries. Each country or province will have to make its own decision based on individual contexts. For example, unpublished MC studies in Myanmar showed similar size and types of containers and community practices in two regions, and interest from government officials in introducing guppies to water containers in response to dengue outbreaks (personal communication, Jeffrey Hii, 2015). However, the decision was made to not introduce guppies in the Philippines as the community acceptance was low and the cool climate in higher altitudes was not suitable for guppy survival and reproduction (personal communication, Jeffrey Hii, 2015).</p><sec id="Sec33"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par97">At the time of submission of this manuscript the trial had completed the baseline data collections, enrollment of villages, and randomized allocation of the villages to three study arms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec34"><p>
