<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> A qualitative study involving GPs showed that GPs were aware of &#x02018;classic&#x02019;, but long-term features of axial SpA, that is, hyperkyphosis and a bamboo spine. Knowledge about the entire disease spectrum, including early disease, extra-articular manifestations and other characteristic SpA features, was limited.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>We hypothesised that education with special focus on SpA might improve the recognition of SpA features and early referral of patients suspected for having SpA. The objectives of this study were to evaluate (1) the current practice performance of GPs and GP residents in recognising and (considering) referral of patients suspected for having axial or peripheral SpA, and (2) to assess the influence of education on this performance, by using unannounced standardised patients (SPs) who visit GP (residents) in their own practices.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This study is a prospective controlled multicenter educational intervention study in primary care. GP residents and their supervising GPs were recruited through the department of General Practice from the Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC). Every trimester, 1&#x02013;2 group(s) of 10&#x02013;12 GP residents enter the final year of their residency. Once a week, they meet at the MUMC for training. We used this structure for providing an educational programme, &#x02018;the intervention&#x02019;, to half of the groups. Each group was alternately assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. This allocation strategy was only applied to the GP residents. The groups did not have direct contact hours with each other. A similar training structure was not available for GPs. It was logistically not possible to organise an extratraining conference for GPs without revealing the topic of interest in advance. Therefore, despite GPs may be supervising a resident who received intervention, we decided to assign all GPs to the control group.</p><p>The ethics committee of the academic hospital Maastricht considered this study as &#x02018;evaluation and improvement of daily clinical practice&#x02019;. No further approval was required. The GP (residents) were informed about SPs visiting their practice for &#x02018;evaluation of using SPs in daily practice and education&#x02019;, and were asked to sign informed consent. No further specification was provided on the purpose of the study and the nature of the medical problems, nor were they informed that the education was related to the study with unannounced SPs.</p><p>The SP encounters took place 3&#x02005;months before and 3&#x02005;months after the intervention.</p><p>The study started in September 2012, and was ended prematurely in May 2014.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Standardised patients</title><p>SPs, recruited from a pool of SPs working at the Maastricht University medical school and among clerkships, had to meet the following criteria: stable health, ability to play the role and to fill out the case-specific checklists, no confounding physical symptoms and sufficient time available for the visits.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>All SPs were trained to simulate one case. Two 2&#x02005;h training sessions were organised and guided by several GPs and rheumatologists, during which the SPs were trained in playing their role, and how to behave during the physical examination, in a valid and reliable way. GPs and a rheumatologist not involved in the development of the cases judged whether the SP simulated realistically. Close attention was paid on completion of the checklist to secure uniform data quality and comparability. Discrepancies in checklist rating scores were discussed.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Based on good reproducibility demonstrated in previous studies, and after this thorough training, we assumed good representation of the cases by the SPs.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref></p><p>All participants faced two cases of axial SpA, two cases of peripheral SpA, and one case of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RMDOPEN2015000152F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> shows an example of a predefined schedule for two participants. The CTS case was included as a diversionary tactic, preventing premature identification of the objectives of the study, but was also considered as &#x02018;common knowledge&#x02019;. Recognition of CTS by the far majority of participants was expected and therefore only simulated during round 1. Each SpA case was simulated by a male and a female SP, in random order, according to a predefined schedule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RMDOPEN2015000152F1">figure 1</xref> shows an example). A short description of the included cases is provided in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>. The SPs were unaware which participants received education. The SPs received a small allowance for every visit.

We decided to combine both referral and considering referral, because GPs may spread diagnostic interventions over several consultations or only refer to secondary care when complaints fail to resolve within a few weeks after the first consultation. Secondary outcomes included (1) correct recognition of axial SpA, peripheral SpA and CTS, respectively by the GP (resident), (2) ordering of additional diagnostic tests, (3) identification of variables contributing to correct recognition of SpA or CTS (GP vs GP resident, and gender of the SPs).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size calculation was based on the primary outcome, (considering) referral of the SP to the rheumatologist. We estimated that 20% of the SPs would be referred without education and aimed at increasing this by 40%. To detect a 40% difference in the change scores between the intervention group and control group in the proportion of SPs referred to the rheumatologist, 23 complete pre-education and posteducation SP encounters were needed per group (80% power, &#x003b1; of 0.05).</p><p>Descriptive analyses were used for the demographic data. &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> Tests and fisher's exact tests, as appropriate, were used to analyse the primary and secondary end points. The difference in change scores between the intervention group and control group with regard to (considering) referral of the SP and correct recognition of SpA was compared with the Mann-Whitney U test. Within-group changes in referral and recognition of SpA before and after education were analysed with McNemar tests. Only participants that completed both rounds of SP encounters were included in these analyses. Descriptive analysis was used for investigating which diagnoses were mentioned by GP (residents) and the frequency of ordering additional diagnostic tests by GP (residents). SPSS software V.20.0 was used for all analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Participant characteristics</title><p>In total, 117 GPs residents and their supervising GPs were invited, of which 68 (38 GP residents and 30 GPs) participated in the study.

While medical history and symptoms simulated by SPs would have acknowledged a referral to a rheumatologist, such a policy was executed by only 10% of the GPs. Specific SpA-aimed education improved this policy dramatically. The primary outcome, more than 40% improvement in (considering) referral for axial and peripheral SpA after education, was met.</p><p>Approximately 20% of the adult population consult their GP because of musculoskeletal symptoms, among which chronic low back pain is the most prevalent.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Although it is impossible for GPs to have considerable expertise in all areas, the high exposure to musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) warrants development of high-quality training programmes aiming at gaining and maintaining sufficient expertise on MSD. Several studies, however, suggest that graduated medical students and residents lack knowledge and confidence in this respect.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;30</xref> Multifaceted education interventions, including mixed interactive and didactic learning activities focusing on pertinent outcomes have shown to sustainably change physicians&#x02019; behaviour.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In the present study, we also applied multifaceted educational tools including interactive power-point presentations, case vignettes and printed materials, which may have added to a better recognition of SpA 3&#x02005;months after the intervention. Future studies may shed light on the sustainability of education in this context.</p><p>Strengths of our study are that we have used a prospective, multicenter design and that we have included a control group for an evaluation of the effect of education. In addition, our study was conducted in primary care which is the source of most referrals of SpA to the rheumatologist. Furthermore, the SP-model has proven reliability for the assessment of physicians&#x02019; knowledge and -skills in a &#x02018;genuine&#x02019; clinical setting.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref>

<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>Several limitations of this study require discussion. First, SPs did not truly have signs of their disease detectable at physical examination, which may have jeopardised recognition. SPs performing a role of peripheral SpA, for example, showed a photograph with dactylitis to the GP. Dactylitis is a relatively uncommon (albeit specific) manifestation of peripheral SpA. Nevertheless, one in two GPs (residents) ranked an inflammatory rheumatic disease as the diagnosis of highest likelihood in both SP encounters. This observation suggests that a knowledge deficit about peripheral SpA prevented an adequate diagnosis but not the recognition of a rheumatic disease. While referral to a medical specialist would have been the best option here, only a minority of the patients was indeed referred.</p><p>Second, information to GPs about an SP visiting their practice may have raised arousal leading to different diagnostic behaviour. However, GP (residents) were neither aware of the specific case presentation or the purpose of the study nor were they informed about education being part of this study. In addition, participants were visited in their own practices by SPs during regular working hours. Since a previous study has failed to demonstrate a difference in performance by residents evaluating real patients and SPs,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> we believe the precautions we have taken have assured a most truthful performance of GP (residents) in daily practice.</p><p>Third, one may argue that the GP (residents) suspected the SP was simulating SpA, but that they were unaware of the fact that referral would have been indicated in this case. Making a correct diagnosis was a secondary outcome in our study. Before education, only a minority of GPs correctly diagnosed axial SpA (20%) and peripheral SpA (10%). In contrast, CTS was recognised by the large majority of participants (83%), indicating that GPs have sufficient knowledge of common disorders. However, they fall short regarding SpA, which is more unfamiliar than CTS.</p><p>Fourth, we were unable to include the projected number of participants. Nevertheless, the primary outcome was met. A small sample size, however, may limit generalisability of results to a larger population.</p><p>In conclusion, recognition and referral of patients suspected for having SpA by GP (residents) is in general low, but targeted education can markedly improve this. Increased awareness of a potential underlying inflammatory condition in patients presenting with musculoskeletal complaints and timely referral may prevent a debilitating disease course in patients with SpA. Therefore, we recommend the combination of a referral tool targeted at SpA and educational activities that maximise practitioner engagement and support for practice change.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all study participants, GPs, GP residents and SPs.
