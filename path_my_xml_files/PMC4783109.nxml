However, the literature is far from conclusive, as some studies report no beneficial effect of strength training on running performance [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Running performance is mainly determined by the maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2max</sub>), fractional utilization of VO<sub>2max</sub> and running economy [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Addition of strength training has neither a negative nor a positive effect on VO<sub>2max</sub> (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). The effect of combining strength and endurance training on fractional utilization of VO<sub>2max</sub> has not been directly investigated, but the indirect measure of VO<sub>2</sub> at the lactate threshold, expressed as percent of VO<sub>2max</sub>, seems to be unchanged [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Running economy on the other hand seems to be positively affected by strength training (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). An improved running performance following strength training is therefore suggested to be mainly related to improved running economy [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>One of the most frequent proposed mechanisms behind improved running economy after strength training is changes in the stiffness of lower limb muscles and tendons [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. During the first part of the contact phase in the running stride, elastic energy is stored in the muscles, tendons and ligaments acting across joints [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A partial return of this stored energy during the second part of the contact phase limits the muscle energy expenditure and amplifies the mechanical output of the muscle-tendon complex [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Hence, the stiffness of series elastic component, mainly tendons, can affect both the utilization of this elastic energy and the muscle contraction mechanics during the running stride. In fact, stiffer Achilles tendons have been associated with better running economy [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Intriguingly, more compliant patellar tendons were associated with better running economy [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], whereas heavy strength training has been shown to increase patellar tendon stiffness [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A more compliant patellar tendon may indeed allow the muscle to operate at mechanically efficient lengths and velocities during the contact phase [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, for a given tendon stiffness a stronger muscle would enable larger energy storage. Consequently, heavy strength training might induce changes in muscle and tendon properties with both potential beneficial and negative effects on running economy. It is therefore important to gain insight into the effects of strength training on patellar tendon mechanical properties, and if possible effects induces changes in running economy. However, to our best knowledge, no studies to date have investigated this.</p><p>Most research on the effects of strength training on running performance are performed with male athletes (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]) or a combination of male and female athletes (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). Unfortunately, there is performed a substantial lower volume of research in this area using only female athletes [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, there is a need for more research with female athletes. This is especially true regarding the effect of strength training induced changes in patellar tendon stiffness on running economy since it seems that male and female tendons may react differently to increased loading [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Even though strength training may enhance middle to long distance running performance through improved running economy it will also normally increase cross sectional area (CSA) of the muscle fibers [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, it can be speculated that strength training can increase diffusion distances from the capillaries to the interior of muscle cells, which will be negative for performance. In untrained individuals there are reports of increased or unchanged numbers of capillaries around each muscle fiber [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and no change in capillaries per fiber area [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] after strength training. However, as performing endurance training concurrently with strength training may blunt the hypertrophic response (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]), and endurance trained athletes have larger numbers of capillaries than untrained [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] these findings may not apply for endurance athletes. Consequently, there is a need to look closer into the effects of combined strength and endurance training on capillarization and fiber CSA in well-trained endurance athletes.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 11 weeks of heavy strength training on running performance during a 40 min all-out test and running economy in well-trained female endurance athletes. Furthermore, we wanted to assess the effects of the strength training on the mechanical properties of the patellar tendon to elucidate whether this could be related to changes in running performance and running economy. To investigate if strength training would have any effect on capillarization in endurance athletes we measured muscle fiber CSA and capillarization in <italic>m</italic>. <italic>vastus lateralis</italic>.</p><p>We hypothesized that the addition of heavy strength training would result in improved 40 min all-out performance and improved running economy and that these changes would be related to changes in mechanical properties of the patellar tendon, together with no negative effect on capillarization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee at Lillehammer University College.

Some of the basic characteristics as anthropometrics and endurance training have been reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The strength training program for the <italic>E+S</italic> group consisted of two strength training sessions per week and lasted for 11 weeks (during the competition period from April to July). Testing before and after the intervention period was performed over four test-days. During pre-tests, day one was utilized to sample muscle biopsies from the right <italic>m</italic>. <italic>vastus lateralis</italic>, and measure the mechanical properties of the left patellar tendon. At day two 1RM in one-legged leg press and half squat was measured. Day 3 consisted of an incremental running test for determination of blood lactate profile, a VO<sub>2max</sub> test and testing of maximal squat jump (SJ) and counter movement jump (CMJ) height. Day 4 consisted of a 40 min all-out running test. There were at least 7 days between day one and two and 3&#x02013;7 days between the remaining test-days. All tests for each participant were completed within 2&#x02013;3 weeks. During post tests, athletes in <italic>E+S</italic> maintained their strength training with one session per week until all testing were complete. In general, post-tests were performed in the same order as pre-tests. However, muscle biopsies and patellar tendon measurements were moved to the last test day. The athletes did not perform any systematic periodization so neither the pre tests nor post tests were performed in a particular phase of periodization.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Training</title><p>Endurance training duration and intensity were calculated based on heart rate (HR) recordings. Endurance training was divided into three HR zones: 1) 60%-82%, 2) 83%-87%, and 3) 88%-100% of maximal HR. The endurance training performed has been previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In brief, there were no significant differences between groups in the mean weekly duration of the endurance training, the distribution of this training within the three intensity zones (across groups values were: zone 1: 3.7 &#x000b1; 1.6 h, zone 2: 1.1 &#x000b1; 0.5 h, zone 3: 0.8 &#x000b1; 0.5) and the numbers of endurance training sessions per week (across groups values were 4.3 &#x000b1; 1 session &#x000b7; week<sup>-1</sup>).</p><p>The heavy strength training sessions for the <italic>E+S</italic> groups targeted leg muscles and were performed twice per week during the 11-week intervention period. Adherence to the strength training was high, with <italic>E+S</italic> athletes completing 21.4 &#x000b1; 1.0 (range 19&#x02013;22) of the planned 22 strength-training sessions. The strength-training program was performed as reported in Vikmoen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Briefly, each strength training session consisted of four leg exercises: half squat in a smith machine (Gym 80 International, Gelsenkirchen, Germany), leg press with one leg at a time (Gym 80 International, Gelsenkirchen, Germany), standing one-legged hip flexion in a cable cross machine (Gym 80 International, Gelsenkirchen, Germany), and ankle plantar flexion in a smith machine. For a detailed description of the exercises, see Ronnestad et al. [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Three sets were performed <italic>per</italic> exercise. An investigator supervised the athletes at all workouts during the first two weeks and at least one workout per week thereafter. During weeks one to three, athletes trained with 10RM sets at the first session and 6RM sets at the second session. These alternating loads were adjusted to 8RM and 5RM during weeks four to six, and was further adjusted to 6RM and 4RM during weeks seven to eleven (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0150799.t001">Table 1</xref>). The numbers of repetitions was always the same as the prescribed RM load meaning that the sets were performed until failure, and the athletes adjusted the absolute load as they got stronger to correspond to the prescribed RM load. The athletes were allowed assistance on the last repetition if necessary. Because a proposed mechanisms behind improved running performance after strength training is an increased rate of force development [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] the athletes were instructed to perform the concentric phase of the exercises with focus on maximal effort (duration around 1 s) while the eccentric phase was performed more slowly (duration 2&#x02013;3 s). During each strength training session the athletes consumed a bar containing 15 g protein (Squeezy recovery bar, Squeezy Sports Nutrition, Braunschweig, Germany) to ensure adequate protein intake in conjunction with the strength training sessions. The athletes were encouraged to perform the strength training and endurance training on separate days. On days the athletes had to perform both endurance and strength training, they were encouraged to perform strength training in the first session of the day.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0150799.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0150799.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Training loads used during the strength training intervention</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0150799.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0150799.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Week</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Load session 1</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Load session 2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1&#x02013;3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10RM</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6RM</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4&#x02013;6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8RM</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5RM</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7&#x02013;11</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6RM</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4RM</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t001fn001"><p>RM: Repetition maximum</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Strength, jumping and running tests</title><p>The athletes were instructed to refrain from intense exercise the day preceding testing, to prepare for the tests as they would have done for a competition, and to consume the same type of meal before each test. Running tests was performed on a motor driven treadmill (Woodway Desmo Evo, Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA). The inclination of the treadmill was set to 5.3% at all tests. All testing were performed under similar environmental conditions (18&#x02013;20&#x002da;C).</p><sec id="sec012"><title>1RM tests</title><p>1RM was tested in one-legged leg press and half squat and the mean value from these two exercises were used for statistical analyses. Prior to the testing day, each athlete was given a supervised familiarization session to learn proper lifting technique, find individual equipment settings and practice SJ and CMJ. During this session, the load was gradually increased to allow estimation of a proper starting point for the 1RM testing.</p><p>The 1RM tests in both exercises were performed as previously described (Vikmoen et al. 2015). Briefly, testing started with a specific warm-up, consisting of three sets with gradually increasing load (40, 75 and 85% of expected 1RM) and decreasing number of repetitions (10&#x02192;6&#x02192;3). The first attempt was performed with a load approximately 5% below the expected 1RM. If a lift was successful, the load was increased by approximately 5%. The test was terminated when the athletes failed to lift the load in 2&#x02013;3 attempts and the highest successful load lifted was noted as 1RM. Athletes were given 3 min rest between lifts.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Blood lactate profile</title><p>The blood lactate profile tests started with 5 min running at 7 km&#x000b7;h<sup>-1</sup>, which was subsequently increased every 5 min by 1 km&#x000b7;h<sup>-1</sup>. Between consecutive 5 min bouts there was a 1 min break, wherein blood was sampled from a finger-tip and analyzed for whole blood lactate concentration ([la<sup>-</sup>]) using a Lactate Pro LT-1710 analyzer (Arcray Inc., Kyoto, Japan), and the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was recorded. The test was terminated when a [la<sup>-</sup>] of 4 mmol&#x02219;L<sup>-1</sup> or higher was measured. VO<sub>2</sub> and HR were measured during the last 3 min of each bout, and mean values were used for statistical analysis. VO<sub>2</sub> was measured (30 s sampling time) using a computerized metabolic system with mixing chamber (Oxycon Pro, Erich Jaeger, Hoechberg, Germany). The gas analyzers were calibrated with certified calibration gases of known concentrations before every test. The flow turbine (Triple V, Erich Jaeger, Hoechberg, Germany) was calibrated before every test with a 3 l, 5530 series, calibration syringe (Hans Rudolph, Kansas City, USA). HR was recorded using a Polar S610i heart rate monitor (Polar, Kempele, Finland). From this incremental running test, the running velocity at 3.5 mmol&#x02219;L<sup>-1</sup> [la<sup>-</sup>] was calculated for each athlete from the relationship between [la<sup>-</sup>] and running velocity using linear regression between data points. Running economy was determined by the mean VO<sub>2</sub> at a running velocity of 10 km&#x000b7;h<sup>-1</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>VO<sub>2max</sub></title><p>After termination of the blood lactate profile test the athletes ran for 10 min at a freely chosen submaximal workload. The VO<sub>2max</sub> test was then initiated with 1 min running at 8 km&#x000b7;h<sup>-1</sup> and the speed was increased by 1 km&#x000b7;h<sup>-1</sup> every minute until exhaustion. The athletes received strong verbal encouragement to run for as long as possible. VO<sub>2</sub> was measured continuously, and VO<sub>2max</sub> was calculated as the mean of the two highest 30 s VO<sub>2</sub> measurements. The VO<sub>2max</sub> test was considered valid when two or more of the following criteria were met: a plateau in VO2 was despite increased workload, a respiratory exchange ration above 1.1 and HR<sub>peak</sub> &#x000b1; 10 bpm pf the predicted maximal HR (220-age) [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Peak running performance during the test (V<sub>max</sub>) was calculated as the mean running velocity during the last 2 min of the incremental test. The highest HR recorded during the test was taken as HR<sub>peak</sub> and immediately after the test blood [la<sup>-</sup>] and RPE were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>SJ and CMJ</title><p>Twenty min after termination of the VO<sub>2max</sub> test, explosive strength was tested as maximal jumping height in SJ and CMJ. These jumps were performed on a force plate (SG-9, Advanced Mechanical Technologies, Newton, MA, USA, sampling frequency of 1kHz). After 3&#x02013;5 submaximal warm up jumps, the athletes performed three SJ and three CMJ with 2&#x02013;3 min rest between jumps. The highest SJ and CMJ were utilized for statistical analyses. During all jumps the athletes were instructed to keep their hands placed on their hips and aim for maximal jumping height. The SJ was performed from ~90 degrees knee angle. In this position, they paused for 3 s before jumping. No downward movement was allowed prior to the jump and the force curves were inspected to verify this. During the eccentric phase of the CMJ the athletes were instructed to turn at a knee angle they felt was optimal for achieving maximal jumping height.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>40 min all-out test</title><p>Prior to the 40 min all-out test, athletes performed 10 min warm up at self-selected submaximal velocities, containing three submaximal sprints performed during the last 2 min. These sprints were standardized from pre to post in each athlete. During the first 5 min of the test, the investigators set the velocity. This individual selected velocity was based on the lactate profile test and corresponded to the velocity at 2.5 mmol&#x02219;L<sup>-1</sup> [la<sup>-</sup>]. Thereafter, running velocity were controlled by the athletes themselves, with instructions to run the greatest distance possible during the 40 min. Measurements of VO<sub>2</sub> was made during the last minute of every 5 min section, to allow estimation of performance VO<sub>2</sub> and fractional utilization of VO<sub>2max</sub>,. During this minute, athletes were not allowed to adjust the running velocity. The mean VO<sub>2</sub> during this minute was estimated to reflect the mean VO<sub>2</sub> during the corresponding 5 min section. During the last 5 min of the test, VO<sub>2</sub> was measured continuously as pilot testing showed that athletes performed numerous velocity adjustments during this part of the test. Performance VO<sub>2</sub> was calculated as the mean VO<sub>2</sub> of all 5 min sections, and fractional utilization of VO<sub>2max</sub> was calculated as performance VO<sub>2</sub> in percentage of VO<sub>2max</sub>. During the test, the athletes were allowed to drink water <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Measurements of the mechanical and material properties of the patellar tendon</title><p>All the measurements of the mechanical and material properties of the patellar tendon were performed on the left leg and were done as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Briefly, the athletes were seated with a 90&#x000b0; angle in both knee and hip joint in a knee extension apparatus (Knee extension, Gym 2000, Geithus, Norway) instrumented with a force cell (U2A, Hottinger Baldwin Messtechnik GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). To measure patellar tendon CSA, transversal scans were performed proximally, medially and distally along the tendon length using an B-mode ultrasound apparatus (HD11XE, Phillips, Bothell, WA, USA). Sagittal scanning was used to measure tendon length. To measure tendon force and elongation the ultrasound probe was attached to the left knee with a custom-made device. The athletes performed ramp contractions at a constant rate of 100 N&#x000b7;s<sup>-1</sup>. To correct for hamstring co-activation when calculating tendon force (see below), a maximal isometric knee flexion were performed after the knee extension test. In addition, EMG data were recorded (TeleMyo 2400 G2 telemetry Systems, Noraxon Inc., Scottsdale, AZ, USA) from the biceps femoris muscle during isometric knee extension and flexion. Patellar tendon force (F<sub>PT</sub>) was calculated as the force measured in the force cell, corrected for hamstring co-activation, internal and external moment arms as follows:

Tendon elongation data were analyzed using a video analysis software (Tracker Video Analysis and Modeling Tool, Open Source Physics, Douglas Brown, 2012). The patellar apex and the tibia plateau were digitally marked within a common coordinate system. The actual elongation of the tendon was calculated as the change in the distance between coordinates of these anatomical landmarks. To calculate tendon material and mechanical properties force-elongation curves were fitted with a 2nd degree polynomial. All the recordings used in the results had a fit of R<sup>2</sup> = 0,92 or higher. Stiffness was calculated as the slope of the force&#x02013;elongation curve, between 90 and 100% of each athlete&#x02019;s maximal force. The Young&#x02019;s modulus was calculated by multiplying the stiffness values by the ratio between the patellar tendon resting length (l<sub>0</sub>) and mean CSA. Patellar tendon l<sub>0</sub> and maximal length (l<sub>max</sub>) was used to calculate the patellar tendon strain. Two sets of ultrasound data (from two <italic>E+S</italic> athletes) had to be discarded because of an insufficient quality to enable analysis.

Strength training had no negative effect on capillary density despite increased muscle fiber CSA and muscle strength.</p><sec id="sec030"><title>Maximal strength and muscle fiber cross sectional area</title><p>The strength-training program used in the current study was effective in increasing maximal leg strength as shown by an increase in 1RM in the leg exercises. This is in accordance with previously observed increases in 1RM in endurance athletes adding heavy strength training to their normal endurance training (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]).

This is important for runners since increased body mass can negatively influence running performance. In spite of this, the improved strength seemed to be at least partially dependent on increased muscle mass, as evident from the increased muscle fiber CSA. The present muscle hypertrophy is in agreement with other studies using similar strength training protocols in endurance athletes [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Interestingly, there were no difference in the CSA of the type I and type II fibers in the current athletes, confirming the notion that in endurance athletes the type I fibers may be just as large [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] or even larger [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] than the type II fibers.</p></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>SJ and CMJ</title><p>The current strength training protocol was also effective in increasing leg muscle power, as evident from the increased SJ and CMJ performance.

The current study indicate that quite large improvements in jumping ability and explosive strength can be achived with heavy strength traning despite concurrently performing endurance training.</p></sec><sec id="sec032"><title>Capillarization</title><p>Eleven weeks of heavy strength training did not affect capillarization expressed as either CAF or CAFA, despite leading to significant muscle fiber hypertrophy. Importantly, this suggest that the potentially negative effect of increased muscle fiber CSA on diffusion distances between blood and inner parts of muscle fibers was counteracted by a non-significant increase in CAF. However, this data should be treated with caution because of the limited sample size. Despite of this, our finding are in line with previous studies in untrained participants that have reported either no change or a slight increase in CAF [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and no change in CAFA [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] after a period of heavy strength training. Our finding is also in agreement with results reported in elite male cyclists after 16 weeks of heavy strength training [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, it seems like endurance athletes should not be afraid of reduced capillarization when they consider adding heavy strength training to their ongoing endurance training.</p></sec><sec id="sec033"><title>Mechanical properties of the patellar tendon</title><p>The lack of changes in mechanical properties of the patellar tendon following heavy strength training is in contrast to most studies, typically reporting increased patellar tendon stiffness, at least in previously untrained participants [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. A possible reason for the discrepancy in results between our study and that by others is that we included female participants while the other studies included males [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In fact, female tendons have been reported to show a lower rate of new connective tissue formation in response to mechanical loading [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Differences in the strength training protocol may also explain the lack of changes in the current study. Indeed, most previous studies reporting increased patellar tendon stiffness following strength training have included heavy knee extension exercise [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] or isometric muscle actions [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In the current study, the exercises involved were more complex involving multiple joints that perhaps reduced the absolute mechanical loading on the patellar tendon compared to a pure knee extension exercise. In addition, the athletes were instructed to perform the concentric phase of the exercises as fast as possible making the time under tension quite low.</p><p>In contrast to the lack of effect of strength training on patellar tendon properties, it led to increases in its CSA. In line with these findings, some studies on the effect of strength training, yet not all [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], reports an increase in patellar tendon CSA [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Without changes in mechanical properties, the tendon hypertrophy measured here suggests that material properties may also have been altered. The lack of change in Young&#x02019;s modulus following training may highlight the limitation of this parameter based on finite tendon sections to reflect whole tendon material properties. Interpreting the mechanisms driving tendon hypertrophy extends beyond the scope of the present article. One could speculate that increasing tendon CSA may shield this tissue against damage caused by excessive and/or unusual stresses. Taken together, the present measurements indicate that resistance training triggers an adaptive response in the patellar tendon of female runners, without affecting the mechanical properties of this tissue. Whether this adaptation may affect injury rates or have other effects amongst runners warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="sec034"><title>VO<sub>2max</sub>, fractional utilization of VO<sub>2max</sub>, running velocity at 3.5 mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup> blood [La<sup>-</sup>], and running economy</title><p>The lack of change in VO<sub>2max</sub> after strength training is not surprising and is actually in accordance with the current literature (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]).

Despite this speculation, studies have yet to investigate the effect of heavy strength training on patellar tendon mechanical properties in conjunction with running economy. In the current study, the unchanged tendon stiffness and increased strength suggest that more elastic energy may be stored in the patellar tendon during the stance phase, amplifying muscular power output and efficiency. However, the lack of changes in running economy do not support this hypothesis, and conclusion cannot be drawn regarding the influence of patellar tendon properties in the present study.</p><p>V<sub>max</sub> has been reported to be the best laboratory measure to predict performance in various running distances [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and can actually be considered a measure of running performance [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The lack of increased V<sub>max</sub> further indicates that heavy strength training did not lead to improved running performance in the current study. It has previously been reported both improved [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150799.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and no change [<xref rid="pone.0150799.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in V<sub>max</sub> after heavy strength training in trained runners.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec036"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In contrast to our hypothesis, adding heavy strength training to endurance training in well-trained female endurance athletes did not affect running performance measured as running distance during a 40 min all-out test. The lack of effect on performance was probably because the strength training intervention did not improve running economy or changed the mechanical properties of the patellar tendon. However, strength training had no negative effect capillary density.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the participants for their time and effort.
