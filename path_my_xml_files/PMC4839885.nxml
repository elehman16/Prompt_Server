These factors cause insulin resistance (IR) as well as various adverse effects on glucose metabolism.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> IR has been linked to lipid metabolism disorders such as hypertriglyceridemia and high blood-free fatty acid levels.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In addition, obesity can readily predispose patients to hypertension, dyslipidemia, coagulation abnormalities and fibrinolysis disturbance, inflammatory reactions, and so on, eventually causing damage to vascular endothelial cells, leading to the development of atherosclerosis and an increased risk of serious cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In recent years, increasing young and obese patients have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) and early insulin injection has been recommended to achieve glycemic control,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> because early intensive insulin therapy can help to restore and maintain the functions of &#x003b2; cells in newly diagnosed T2DM patients.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> But for obese or overweight newly diagnosed T2DM patients who have glycated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) levels &#x0003e;9.0%, multiple approaches including lifestyle intervention, hypoglycemic drugs such as incretin and intensive insulin treatment, are all considered to be important components of a comprehensive therapeutic plan. It is still debated which therapeutic approach should be used as first choice therapy in these patients. The Chinese T2DM treatment guidelines (2013 edition) recommends metformin or alpha-glycosidase inhibitor/insulin secretagogues as the first-line therapy and alpha-glycosidase inhibitor/insulin secretagogues, thiazolidinedione, and DPP 4 inhibitors as second-line therapy. Insulin is included in the third- and fourth-line therapy choices. Further treatment will be considered only when previous therapies for glycemic control have failed (HbA1c &#x02265; 7.0%). Therefore, oral hypoglycemic drugs are still among the first therapeutic choices for Chinese patients with T2DM. Results from meta-analysis including the ACCORD, VADT, ADVANCE, and UKPDS studies have shown that improved glycemic control can reduce the risk of major vascular events by 9% but increase the risk of hypoglycemia due to adverse events. Moreover, the increase in the variability of blood glucose levels in T2DM patients also increases the risk of cardiovascular events and death; thus, smooth hypoglycemic intervention is critical. This intervention is worthy of attention among those obese or overweight diabetic patients because obesity is regarded as an important predisposing factor for IR. Excessive fat deposition in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and the liver will lead to systemic IR and related inflammatory reactions. A study in Singapore revealed remarkable differences in insulin sensitivity between individuals with similar body mass indices (BMIs), with ethnicity being 1 of the key factors. For example, the IR of Asian people is more severe than people of difference races who have similar BMIs. A study from Japan found that in Asian T2DM patients,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> the glycogen output was significantly higher in patients with normal body weight compared with those who were obese, and their risks of cardiovascular (CV) events were remarkably reduced. Thus, the characteristics of Asian people need to be taken into account when planning therapy, considering the higher CV risks found in Asian people compared to white people with a similar BMI.</p><p>A recent report from JAMA showed that the use of exogenous insulin too early could promote CV disorders or even death.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The potential mechanism might be related to weight gain caused by the anabolic role of excessive insulin in peripheral tissues. However, an appropriate controlled study focusing on optimizing treatment strategies in these patients has not been carried out, especially in obese Chinese T2DM patients. Thus, we conducted this study to explore the optimal therapeutic strategies for newly diagnosed T2DM patients who were overweight or obese and had a glycosylated hemoglobin level &#x0003e;9%. A comprehensive comparison between oral sitagliptin/metformin and insulin glargine combined with oral metformin was performed by analyzing basic clinical characteristics, serum lipids, quality of life, and pharmacoeconomical measurements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Subjects</title><p>A total of 166 newly diagnosed T2DM patients who came to the outpatient clinic of the Endocrinology Department in the Shanghai Changhai Hospital from October 2013 to July 2014 were enrolled in the study.

Each dimension had up to 100 points, and the higher a patient scored the better their life quality was assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis of the experimental data was performed with SPSS for Windows (Version 16.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Data that was normally distributed are presented as the mean&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;standard deviation and categorical variables are expressed as percentages. We conducted independent-sample <italic>t</italic> tests to compare the mean values of 2 samples, while a paired <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare paired data. A chi-squared test was used to compare the rates of 2 samples, and variance analysis was conducted to compare the mean values of multiple samples. <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

For comparing treatment regimens, group sample sizes of 112 and 56 achieved 80% power to detect noninferiority using a 1-sided, 2-sample <italic>t</italic> test. The margin of noninferiority was &#x02212;0.010. The true difference between the means is assumed to be 0.400 and the significance level (alpha) of the test is 0.050. The data are drawn from populations with standard deviations of 1.000 and 1.000. The null hypothesis is that the experimental treatment effect is inferior to the standard treatment. The study would have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis with a sample size of 188 participants; 130 in the experimental group and 58 in the control group. This calculation allows for about 10% attrition from both groups; this 10% includes those potentially lost to follow-up or not adhering to the treatment protocol.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Baseline Characteristics of the Research Subjects</title><p>There were finally 51 cases in the control group (31 males and 20 females, mean age 53.5&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;11.1) and 115 cases in the experimental group (71 males and 44 females, mean age 54.1&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;12.5; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

It is widely recognized to be caused by impaired functions of pancreatic &#x003b2; and &#x003b1; cells.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> According to a British prospective study, the functions of pancreatic &#x003b2; cells has been decreasing at a rate of 4% to 5% each year in diabetic patients, even 10 to 15 years before the diagnosis was made.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Mohan et al<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> conducted an 18-week clinical trial with a single drug for Asian T2DM patients and found that sitagliptin significantly reduced HbA1c by 1% in T2DM patients. In our study, newly diagnosed T2DM patients with HbA1c &#x0003e; 9% and BMI &#x02265; 25&#x0200a;kg/m<sup>2</sup> were treated either with oral Janumet (the experimental group) or insulin injection (the control group). HbA1c was &#x02264;6.5% in 20.87% of the subjects in the experimental group but only 3.92% of patients in the control group had their HbA1c reduced to that level. HbA1c measurements of 56.52% subjects in the experimental group were &#x02264;7.0%, while for the control group, the percentage was 23.53. The difference of goal achievements might be attributed to the fact that insulin titration was not optimal due to fear of hypoglycemia particularly in patients on a low carbohydrate diet. In contrast, the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin has not been reported to cause hypoglycemia and its FDC does not need a titration period. Metformin activates the AMPK pathway directly and inhibits gluconeogenesis and lipid synthesis. Through the insulin signal transduction pathway, the activation of AMPK will promote glucose uptake, improve IR, promote the synthesis of glycogen, and adjust energy storage and consumption. However, although early use of metformin in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes could reduce HbA1c by 1% to 2%, it fails to prevent the functional decline of pancreatic &#x003b2; cells. When combined with sitagliptin, the hypoglycemic effect is strengthened and also the functions of pancreatic &#x003b2; cells can be preserved and restored.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>Sitagliptin is cleared from the body mainly via the kidneys. Unlike patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, the dosage needs to be reduced in patients with kidney disorders.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In our study the metformin/sitagliptin treatment did not influence kidney and liver functions differently from the metformin/glargine regimen, indicating a good tolerance.</p><p>Few reports have been published on the potential adverse reactions of sitagliptin. While 100&#x0200a;mg sitagliptin could suppress 97% of DPP-4 for up to 24&#x0200a;h, its effects on hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes were relatively weak and its pharmacokinetic characteristics remain unaffected when used in conjunction with other hypoglycemic drugs (e.g., metformin).<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> A therapeutic dose of sitagliptin (100&#x0200a;mg/d) does not increase the risk of malignancy or pancreatitis,<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> nor will it cause gastrointestinal reactions,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> which is in accordance with our data of reduced gas production in the experimental group.</p><p>According to the results from our study, the effect of subcutaneous insulin injection was not as effective as that of Janumet, considering serum HbA1c reduction, quality of life improvement, and the total cost of treatment. With regard to the drug formulation, using oral FDC was simple and convenient, reduced waste, and saved resources.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> A retrospective cohort study showed that FDC improved patients&#x02019; compliance with regard to hypoglycemic treatment.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Compared with free combination therapy, the DPP-4 inhibitors/metformin FDC provided additional hypoglycemic benefits, further reducing HbA1c by 0.25% (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.002).<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>The interpretations of our study are limited by the relatively short study period and the small cohort size of patients from only 2 centers. Also, diabetic complications were not included in the analysis and we did not implement the study as a double-blind trial. A future study will be needed to evaluate the chronic effects of sitagliptin/metformin therapy on T2DM patients from the pharmacoeconomical perspective, and more detailed mechanisms of the drug actions should be investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>For overweight or obese T2DM patients whose serum glycosylated hemoglobin was &#x0003e;9%, oral Janumet (sitagliptin/metformin tablets) combined with low caloric diets helped to maintain glycemic control and to improve significantly the quality of life of patients, without increasing weight or adverse hypoglycemic events. This therapy was also proven to be safe, economical, and convenient.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: &#x003b3;-GT = gamma glutamyl transferase, 2hCP = 2-h postprandial C-peptide, 2h-PBG = 2-h postprandial blood glucose, ALT = alanine aminotransferase, BMI = body mass index, BU = blood urea, CV = cardiovascular, CVD = cardiovascular disease, FBG = fasting blood glucose, FCP = fasting C-peptide, FDC = fixed-dose combination, FPG = fasting plasma glucose, HbA1C = glycated hemoglobin A1C, HDLh = igh-density lipoprotein, HDL-C = high-density cholesterol, HPLC = high-pressure liquid chromatography, IR = insulin resistance, LDLl = ow-density lipoprotein, LDL-C = low-density cholesterol, PPG = postprandial plasma glucose, QLSq = uality of life score, SCr = serum creatinine, STB = serum total bilirubin, T2DM = type 2 diabetic mellitus, TC = total cholesterol, TG = triglyceride, TZD = thiazolidinedione, UA = uric acid, WC = waist circumference</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China 81170738.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>UJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name></person-group>
