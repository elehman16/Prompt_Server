stretching techniques on range of motion (ROM), muscle activation, and balance. [Subjects]
For the present study, 48 adults with hamstring muscle tightness were recruited and
randomly divided into three groups: a static stretching group (n=16), a PNF stretching
group (n=16), a control group (n=16). [Methods] Both of the stretching techniques were
applied to the hamstring once. Active knee extension angle, muscle activation during
maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVC), and static balance were measured before and
after the application of each stretching technique. [Results] Both the static stretching
and the PNF stretching groups showed significant increases in knee extension angle
compared to the control group. However, there were no significant differences in muscle
activation or balance between the groups. [Conclusion] Static stretching and PNF
stretching techniques improved ROM without decrease in muscle activation, but neither of
them exerted statistically significant effects on balance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Muscle activation</kwd><kwd>Stretching</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A reduction in muscular flexibility not only reduces functional level but also causes

in multi-joint muscles which have large functional excursion and a high percentage of fast
twitch muscle fibers, and the hamstring muscle has been reported to be the multi-joint
muscle which is most frequently damaged in the human body<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stretching techniques are the treatments used to improve muscular extensibility to improve
ROM, and can help prevent damage in daily life or sports, reduce muscle pain, and improve

self-stretching, ballistic stretching, PNF (proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation)
stretching, etc<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The most frequently used techniques are the static stretching and
PNF stretching techniques.</p><p>The static stretching technique is the most widely used method that extends the muscle
length by autogenic inhibition exciting the Golgi-tendon organ, and its effects have been
proven by several studies<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The resistance to musculotendinous stretching involves
not only the viscoelastic properties of muscle and connective tissue, but also neurological
reflex and voluntary components of muscular contraction. The PNF stretching technique
increases joint range of motion by performing voluntary muscle contraction and promoting
muscle relaxation before stretching in order to reduce the reflexive components which cause
muscle contraction<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although the effects of both the static stretching and PNF stretching techniques on muscle
extensibility have been proven, their effects on muscle relaxation remain very much open to
debate. A study by Cramer, et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that muscle activity was reduced by autogenic inhibition after applying the static
stretching technique, but in disagreement with theory, several studies have reported that
only muscle length was increased without reduction of muscle activity<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many studies
have compared the static stretching technique with the PNF stretching technique in terms of
muscle extensibility, muscle activity and force generation, but few studies have
demonstrated their effects on persons with hamstring muscle tightness. Also, research about
the effects of stretching techniques the balance is currently insufficient. The intrafusal
fiber, Golgi tendon organ and other proprioceptors perform the roles of detecting body
position and keeping balance. Changes in length and stiffness of muscle tendon units change
the proprioception which detects environmental changes and initiates the corresponding
muscle responses, consequently affecting balance. Static balance measures postural sway in
the standing position. David, et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that the performance of short-term stretching of the hamstrings, quadriceps, and
plantar flexors of normal adults reduced the stiffness of the musculotendinous unit
excessively, causing a temporary reduction in static balance. However, there is a lack of
research on how stretching influences the balance of patients with tight hamstrings. This
study aimed to find out the effects of different types of stretching technique on muscle
extensibility, muscle activity and balance of adults with reduced hamstring muscle
extensibility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This experiment was conducted as randomized controlled trial with a 3&#x000d7;2 (group&#x000d7;measure)

and randomly divided into 3 groups: the control group (n=16), the static stretching group
(n=16), and the PNF hold-relax stretching group (n=16). The subjects were randomly assigned
to the test groups. Sixteen pieces of paper for each group with the group name written on
them were placed in an opaque box, and subjects drew one which determined their group. The
lot drawing was performed as sampling without replacement.</p><p>This study was conducted after receiving approval for all research works including the
research procedure, safety, ethics, etc, from the research ethics committee of Kyungbuk
University. Before the study, sufficient explanation of the procedure was provided to all
the subjects and their written agreement to participation in the research was obtained.</p><p>All stretching techniques were applied to the hamstring just once. In order to ensure the
time between the pre- and post-test periods was kept equal among the groups, the control
group was given 30 seconds break after the pre-test. After the stretching techniques has
been applied, active knee extension angle, muscle activation during maximum voluntary
isometric contraction, and static balance were measured.</p><p>The stretching techniques were applied as follows.</p><p>For the static stretching technique, subjects lay supine in a straight posture on the
treatment table and relaxed. Then, the pelvis and thighs opposite to the lower limb to which
the stretching technique was to be applied were tied with Velcro straps. With the knees
extended and the hip joint bent as much as possible within its range, the hip joints were
bent more until the hamstring muscle was stretched with light, tolerable pain, and kept
there for 30 seconds. After the stretching technique had been applied, active knee extension
angle and maximum voluntary isometric contraction were measured again.</p><p>For the PNF Hold-Relax stretching technique, after active knee extension angle and maximum
voluntary isometric contraction had been measured, the subjects were lay supine in a
straight posture on the treatment table and relaxed. Then, the pelvis and thighs opposite to
the lower limb to which the stretching technique was to be applied were tied with Velcro
straps. With the knees extended, the therapist bent the hip joints as much as possible until
the medial hamstring muscle was stretched with light, tolerable pain. In this state, with
the hip joint extended for stretching of the hamstring muscle, the subjects were instructed
to extend the hip joint and bend the knee to contract the hamstring muscle. The subjects
were instructed to contract the hamstring muscle for 6 seconds while the lower limb was
fixed by resistance exerted to the subject&#x02019;s ankle. After the contraction was complete, the
lower limb was laid down on the table and relaxed for 5 seconds. The subjects were then
instructed to contract the muscles again for 6 seconds while the hamstring muscle was
extended, and relax the muscles for 5 seconds, and then to contract the muscles for 6
seconds again with the hamstring muscle stretched to the maximum. Immediately after the
stretching technique was applied, active knee extension angle and maximum voluntary
isometric contraction were measured again.</p><p>The active knee extension test measures the extensibility of hamstring muscle. While the
subjects are lying supine on a table, a line connecting the apex of the lateral malleolus
with fibular head is drawn. The subjects are then instructed to bend the hip joint to 90&#x000b0;
and extend their knees to the maximum while the pelvis and the lower limb opposite to the
lower limb to be measured are fixed with Velcro straps. Next, the subjects are instructed to
extend their hip joints as much as possible 6 times to prevent the muscle from trembling.
During the final 6th extension, the angle between the line connecting the apex of the
lateral malleolus with the fibular head and the axis rising vertically from the ground is
measured using a manual protractor (360&#x000b0; stainless steel 7518 goniometer, Jamer, USA).
Larger decreases in angle indicate greater hamstring extensibility.</p><p>To measure the muscle activity during maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC test),
the contractions of hamstring muscles were measured with surface EMG (Noromed MES 9000, FA
MyotronicsNoromedInc., Seattle, Washington, USA). With the subject lying face down, the
pelvis and the thigh opposite to the lower limb to be measured were fixed with Velcro
straps. Then, with the ankle fixed so that the knee of the lower limb to be measured was
bent at 30&#x000b0;, resistance was exerted against hip joint flexion. Subjects were instructed to
bend the hip joint with weak force, and the muscle bellies of the hamstring muscles were
disinfected with alcohol cotton. If the EMG signal contained too much noise because of body
hair, the body hair was removed. Ag-Cl bipolar EMG electrodes (Norotrode 20 TM,
Myotronics-Noromed, Inc., WA, USA) were attached to the muscle belly in a direction parallel
to the muscle fibers. After attaching the base electrode to the fibular head, the surface
EMG equipment was connected. With the subjects relaxed, after confirming that the noise
level was below 1&#x000b5;V in an EMG noise test, EMG recording was started.</p><p>In order to measure the muscle activity during the maximum voluntary isometric contraction
that can be generated by the hamstring muscles, the subjects were instructed to repeat
bending the hip joint with maximum force for 5 seconds and relaxing for 20 seconds, and the
surface EMG were recorded. The EMG signals were amplified with a gain of 500 and recorded on
a laptop computer (Sens X22, Samsung, Korea) after A/D conversion at a sampling rate of
1,000 Hz. The recorded EMG signals were then bandpass filtered between 20&#x02013;500 Hz. After
performing data processing such as smoothing, RMS values were calculated of the the EMG
signals from the 3 seconds in the middle of each 5-second contraction. The muscle activity
of maximum voluntary isometric contraction was expressed as the average RMS value of 3
muscle contractions. The muscle activity after applying the stretching technique was
normalized to the value of maximum voluntary isometric contraction (100%) for statistical
analysis<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The static balance pability was evaluated using a force measuring plate (PDM, Multifunction
Force Measuring Plate, Zebris, Germany, 2004). The force measuring plate has a total of 1504
pressure sensors placed at 1-cm intervals on a 32&#x000d7;47&#x02005;cm grid, and measures the pressure of
walking or standing. The range of measurable pressure is 1&#x02013;120 N/cm<sup>2</sup>, with an
accuracy of &#x000b1;5%. Subjects were instructed to stand on the force measuring plate in their
bare feet and place their feet in the most comfortable position. The feet were placed at the
same location for the post test. The arms were held comfortably at the subject&#x02019;s side.
Postural sway was measured for 30 seconds while the subjects started at a circle with a
diameter of 15&#x02005;cm located 3&#x02005;m to the front. The effect of muscle fatigue was minimized by
providing a 3-minute rest between measurements, and after 3 repeated measurements, the
average value was recorded.</p><p>In order to examine the homogeneity of characteristics of each group, differences in age,
height, and weight of subjects in all groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA.</p><p>In order to compare the joint mobility and the maximal voluntary isometric contraction
force of each group before and after applying the stretching techniques, data were analyzed
using two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The Bonferroni post hoc test was used to examine the
differences within each group. In order to examine the significance of differences in the
joint mobility and the maximal voluntary isometric contraction force of each group between
before and after applying the stretching techniques, the paired t-test was performed. Data
were analyzed using the SPSS v12.0 statistical program. All the significance levels used
were &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The characteristics of the subjects of each group, age, height, and weight, had the same

Bandy and Irion stated that applying a stretching technique one time for 30 seconds was the
most effective<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> duration, because the
extensibility was not increased further in applications lasting more than 30 seconds<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, we examined the effects on
the muscle extensibility of applying the static stretching technique and the PNF hold-relax
stretching technique one time for 30 seconds between adults who had hamstring muscle
tightness. Both methods elicited significant increases in knee extension ROM compared with
the control group. A study comparing the long term effects of the static stretching, active
self-stretching, and PNF stretching techniques among adults who had hamstring muscle
tightness reported that only the group receiving the static stretching technique showed a
significant difference from the control group, and that application of the active
self-stretching and PNF stretching techniques 3 times a week, the same schedule as the
static stretching technique, was not sufficient for stretching a contracted hamstring
muscle<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In contrast, several
researchers have stated that the PNF stretching technique is more effective at increasing
mobility than the static stretching technique<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, Decoster et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>stated that it was difficult to determine the most effective
hamstring muscle stretching technique, because all the studies that had measured ROM after
the application of a stretching technique. Our present study did not find significant
differences among the different stretching techniques.</p><p>Neurological changes after applying stretching techniques can be confirmed through
isometric muscle activity<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>, the muscle
activity during muscle stretching<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
the H reflex<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. The effects on muscle
activity of each type of stretching technique were compared in the present study, but the
stretching techniques showed no significant differences in effect. In a study applying the
static stretching technique and the PNF stretching technique to normal adults who had no
limit in joint ROM, both group showed significant decreases in muscle activity, a result
which was explained as being caused by the muscle relaxation effect activating the
self-inhibition mechanism<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Marek et
al.<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that results may differ
with muscle type, and the frequency and duration of application of the stretching technique.
In the present study, stretching techniques were applied to patients who had hamstring
muscle tightness, but only the group receiving the static stretching technique showed a
significant increase in muscle activity. The muscle generates maximum muscular strength at
the proper length. As the sarcomere becomes shorter or longer than the stable length, the
cross-bridge number is reduced, and force generated is reduced<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our present result, showing that hamstring muscle
activity is increased only after applying static stretching technique, significantly
different from the PNF hold &#x02013;relax technique result was not, but we believe this is due to
the increase in muscle length being larger than in the PNF hold-relax stretching
technique.</p><p>Balance is achieved by the interaction between automatic posture reflex and voluntary
motion<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. On an unstable surface, voluntary motions of the body and the
limbs adjusting to postural changes become more important, as the central nervous system
suppresses proactive postural control<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In a study examining postural sway on an unstable surface after the application of the
static stretching technique to adults who had no limit on hamstring muscle extensibility,
postural sway increased more as the detection speed of Golgi-tendon organ and the muscle
spindles became slower because the musculo-tendinous unit was loose after the application of
the stretching technique. Also, it was reported that stretching interfered with the warm-up
effect by reducing the response speed<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, in the present study, unlike previous study findings, stretching did not increase
the postural sway of patients with hamstring shortening; rather, postural sway showed a
decreasing tendency, although it was not statistically significant. This means that
application of stretching can produce the opposite effect depending on the condition of the
subjects, and appropriate workouts need to be conducted according to the subjects&#x02019;
condition, to produce the warm up effect. We consider that the balance effect of stretching
techniques was not observed in this study, because the frequency and duration of stretching
were insufficient. We conjecture the postural sway after stretching was small, because the
state of balance was not measured with the eyes closed, or in an unstable state, conditions
under which subjects rely more on proprioceptive sense. In the future, studies examining the
effects of stretching on proprioception and the balance of patients with hamstring
shortening, by measuring postural sway with eyes closed after stretching will be necessary.
Also, since only the short term effects on muscle extensibility, muscle activity and balance
of patients with hamstring muscle tightness were examined in this study, it will be
necessary to study the long term effects of applying stretching techniques for patients with
hamstring muscle shortening.</p><p>Based on the results of this study, the application of the static stretching technique or
the PNF stretching technique for shortened hamstring muscles is effective at increasing
muscle extensibility without reducing muscle activity, since no significant difference was
found between these two techniques. Also, unlike the findings of previous studies which
applied stretching techniques to normal adults, postural sway was not increased after the
application of stretching to patients with hamstring shortening. The result of this study
should provide useful data for improving the functional state of several diseases which
cause hamstring muscle tightness.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Bandy</surname><given-names>WD</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanders</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group>: Therapeutic Exercise: Techniques for Intervention.
