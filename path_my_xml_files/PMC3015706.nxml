Accordingly, developing the necessary technical expertise for laparoscopic surgery is an essential component of residency training. Although laparoscopy can provide distinct advantages for the patient, including decreased length of hospitalization, decreased analgesic requirement, and a shortened postoperative convalescence, one concern has been whether laparoscopic techniques should be learned solely in the operating room.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref></sup> The operative theater as the exclusive venue for the mastery of basic laparoscopic skills is less than efficient and is cost ineffective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> Experience has shown that only those who become comfortable with the laparoscopic environment are able to directly focus their attention on the surgery itself and provide optimal management for the patient and improve surgical outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup> It is unfortunate that, unlike athletics or music which are practiced before an actual performance is ever undertaken, development of surgical expertise has traditionally occurred entirely in the operating room in a manner that can best be described as &#x0201c;on-the-job.&#x0201d;</p><p>In the world of professional aviation, pilots rigorously hone their proficiencies with the aid of the flight simulator. Similarly, mechanical and computer-based laparoscopic simulators have been developed to meet the expanding challenges of reducing operative risk while controlling cost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> For the novice operator, training with laparoscopic simulators provides significant improvement in skill levels over a relatively short period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></sup> Moreover, the surgical laparoscopic simulator can be a practical tool in identifying those residents who need additional surgical instruction, and it affords safe, hands-on remediation, and provides a means of certifying surgical proficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup></p><p>With the above goals in mind, we embarked on a brief pilot study to assess the influence of an elementary laparoscopy exercise on the subsequent performance of obstetrics and gynecology residents at different levels of training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Groups</title><p>The study was conducted at The Brooklyn Hospital Center in 2003. Twelve residents, 3 per each of 4 postgraduate-years (PGY), from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, participated in the study exercises. Twelve third-year medical students also took part to essentially function as a control, because in contrast to residents none of these individuals had any previous experience with laparoscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Laparoscopy Laboratory</title><p>A simplified &#x0201c;poor man's&#x0201d; laparoscopy chamber simulating the abdominal cavity was assembled from 2 large plastic delivery basins held together rim-to-rim with 3 large clamp-type paper clips <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>)</bold>. Two laparoscopic ports, 5 mm and 12 mm, were inserted into the roof of the chamber. A handheld laparoscope with a miniature digital video camera on its tip (Digi Pen-II, Dual Mode USB Camera, Sharper Image, USA) was inserted through the 12-mm port. The camera was connected via the USB cable to a laptop computer serving as the laparoscopy monitor <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A)</bold>. A 5-mm grasper (Ethicon EndoSurgery, Cincinnati, OH) was inserted through the 5-mm port. A glass 7.5-cm-tall bud vase with neck diameter of 2.5cm and a standard 10-cm-diameter Petri dish were affixed 11cm apart to the bottom of the laparoscopic chamber with adhesive-backed Velcro <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A inset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B)</bold>. Thirty polygonal-shaped tablets (Natalcare Plus, prenatal multivitamin/mineral tablets, Ethex Corporation, St. Louis, MO) were arranged to cover the bottom of the Petri dish. The exercise consisted of transferring tablets, one at a time, under laparoscopic visualization from point A (Petri dish) to point B (bud vase) with the 5-mm grasper <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B)</bold>. The chamber was illuminated with a fixed light source. As in the actual laparoscopy setup, our setup required 2-hand coordination: one hand operating the scope, the other the laparoscopic grasper.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Experimental Setup. <bold>Figure 1A</bold> shows study participant performing a laparoscopic exercise. The upper left insert shows the chamber with the lid removed. <bold>Figure 1B</bold> consists of 6 successive frames showing grasping, lifting, and transferring the tablet from the Petri dish to the bud vase.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jsls-10-3-297-g01"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Rehearsal, Warm-up, and Follow-up Exercises</title><p>Because grasping, lifting, and transferring of the polygonal-shaped slippery tablets with a 5-mm laparoscopic grasper has proven to be very challenging, the participants were allowed to familiarize themselves with the experimental setup during 5 minutes of rehearsal, transferring the tablets from petri dish to bud vase under direct visualization with the lid of the laparoscopic chamber removed. Following the rehearsal, each participant performed 2 laparoscopic exercises; a warm-up (baseline) and a follow-up exercise conducted subsequent to a 5-minute respite. Each participant was allotted 10 minutes to transfer as many tablets as possible. Both warm-up and follow-up exercises were timed. The elapsed time (seconds) for each of the participants to complete the above task was divided by the number of tablets transferred from point A to point B and expressed as an elapsed time quotient (seconds/tablets). For those who did not complete the task, ie, transferred less than 30 tablets in the prescribed 10 minutes, an alternate score expressing the actual number of tablets transferred during the 10-minute period was assigned. Overall improvement was expressed as the percentage difference (warm-up - follow-up)/warm-up x 100) between exercises. All results are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Exercise scores and pertinent information regarding postgraduate standing, undergraduate background (technical or liberal arts), and vocational activities were entered into a PC Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Corp, Redman, Washington). Statistical analysis was conducted using Analyse-it statistical software for Excel (Analyse-it Software, Ltd., Leeds, England, UK). Independent sample <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare warm-up verses follow-up between residents and medical students, while paired sample <italic>t</italic> tests were conducted to assess overall proficiency improvement within the 2 groups. Additionally, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to determine the influence of level of postgraduate training on laparoscopic proficiency. Statistical significance was determined at 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Laparoscopic proficiency scores, ie, the time needed for the task to be completed, as reflected by reductions in the mean seconds/tablet measurements of the follow-up exercises, indicated that both residents and third-year medical students benefited from the warm-up simulations.

The traditional approach in developing surgical proficiency has been one of didactic interchange between the preceptor and apprentice and &#x0201c;on-the-job training.&#x0201d; The advent of minimally invasive surgical techniques, possessing significantly steeper learning curves has placed greater demands on the physician in training in mastering the surgical skills necessary in a remote 2-dimensional operative environment. Clearly, laparoscopic training using simulated tasks on a video-simulator improves the operative performance. Previous studies have shown that basic skills achieved by systematic training with laparoscopic simulators can be transferred to the operating room, suggesting that surgical curricula should contain laparoscopic skills training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref></sup> Intensive repetitive training improves video hand-eye coordination, which in turn translates into improved operative performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup></p><p>Contrary to studies demonstrating a significant correlation between PGY levels and training proficiency,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup> we found no such distinctions in performance between resident standing, nor did technical background (or lack thereof) or computer skills present a definitive advantage. However, our rudimentary laparoscopic exercise did uncover slight divergences in levels of residency training and exercise score proficiencies, in that the more junior residents benefited the greatest from warm-up practice activity. This was further underscored by the similar results witnessed of the third-year medical students in comparison with their senior counterparts. Interestingly, the best (8.73 sec/ tablet) and the worst (25 sec/tablet) exercise scores were attained by a medical student and a chief resident, respectively, suggesting the contribution of individual aptitude. Such observations also may be attributable to the presence of latent iniquitous habits developed and carried over by some of the more advanced study participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Although the fundamental exercise of point-to-point transference of tablets does not provide the fidelity of a living tissue environment, laparoscopic operative simulations afford a cost-effective, risk-free adjunct to a more conventional hands-on training approach. The study did demonstrate, however, that a brief warm-up laparoscopic exercise, as performed in our &#x0201c;poor man's laparoscopic surgical simulator,&#x0201d; can significantly improve the subsequent performance of both the novice operator or more advanced surgical practitioner, regardless of their previous experience and exposure to endoscopic surgical technique. Clinically, the reduction of operative duration and subsequent patient risk alone would no doubt reduce intraoperative morbidity and mortality.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge Mary Ann Riccardi, AA, for her help during the preparation of this manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References:</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
