However, for moderate alcohol consumption there are no controlled studies showing this association. Also, the mood effects of consuming alcohol combined with food are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of moderate alcohol combined with a meal on ambiance-induced mood states. Furthermore effects on autonomic nervous system activity were measured to explore physiological mechanisms that may be involved in changes of mood state.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a crossover design 28 women (age 18&#x02013;45 y, BMI 18.5&#x02013;27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were randomly allocated to 4 conditions in which they received 3 glasses of sparkling white wine (30 g alcohol) or alcohol-free sparkling white wine while having dinner in a room with either a pleasant or unpleasant created ambiance. Subjects filled out questionnaires (B-BAES, POMS and postprandial wellness questionnaire) at different times. Skin conductance and heart rate variability were measured continuously.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Moderate alcohol consumption increased happiness scores in the unpleasant, but not in the pleasant ambiance. Alcohol consumption increased happiness and stimulation feelings within 1 hour and increased sedative feelings and sleepiness for 2.5 hour.

Motivation for moderate alcohol consumption may vary from enhancing pleasure to reducing tension <xref rid="pone.0086199-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086199-Cooper2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Mood and emotions are distinct phenomena, although the two are closely related. Whereas emotions are of short duration and often directed towards an object, moods are generally lasting longer and not object-related. Mood comprises a mixture of hedonic (pleasure-displeasure) and arousal (sleepy-activated) values <xref rid="pone.0086199-Russell1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>The effect of moderate alcohol consumption on mood may depend on several interacting factors, including the rise or decline of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) <xref rid="pone.0086199-Tucker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0086199-Hendler1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, the pre-drinking mood state of the drinker <xref rid="pone.0086199-Russell2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and factors such as the social context of drinking <xref rid="pone.0086199-Warren1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086199-Sher1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and expectancy of mood effects <xref rid="pone.0086199-Levenson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086199-McCollam1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Alcohol has been shown to change mood in a biphasic pattern. During rising BACs alcohol has stimulating effects, reported by feelings of euphoria and elation, while during declining BACs alcohol has sedative effects, reported by relaxation and sleepiness <xref rid="pone.0086199-Tucker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0086199-Hendler1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In Western countries alcohol is often consumed with a meal. Food consumption may also affect mood. Previous studies showed an increased calmness and sleepiness after food intake <xref rid="pone.0086199-Gibson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0086199-Boelsma1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Furthermore, food consumption may influence the mood effects of alcohol because it delays gastric emptying and alcohol absorption, resulting in a lower peak BAC <xref rid="pone.0086199-Gentry1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086199-Eckardt1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Thus, the combination of food and alcohol consumption may affect mood differently from that of alcohol consumption only. To date, only two studies investigated the mood effects of combined food and alcohol consumption, and their results were inconsistent <xref rid="pone.0086199-Lloyd1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086199-Markus1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Lloyd and Rogers (1997) found that alcohol with a meal improved mood by increasing confidence and decreasing tension and confusion, while Markus et al. (2004) did not find any effect on mood.</p><p>Furthermore, the pre-drinking mood state has been indicated to play an important role in the mood effects of alcohol <xref rid="pone.0086199-Russell2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086199-McCollam1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, the effects of different pre-drinking moods on postprandial mood changes have not yet been compared in an intervention study. The most accurate method to measure mood is by self-report of feelings as mood is a subjective state. Nevertheless, specific physiological parameters associated with mood changes are increasingly being used in studies generally to validate subjective outcomes or to explore physiological mechanisms involved in mood regulation. However, for yet another reason this may be highly relevant, as incorporating the physiological dynamics underlying both mood effects and pharmacological activities of psychotropic substances like alcohol may be instrumental to further unravel the effects of such enhancers on mood. With respect to alcohol, the relevant physiological parameters are likely to include measures of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity as moderate alcohol consumption has been shown to increase the activity of the sympathetic division of the ANS (being related to emotional arousal), and to decrease the activity of the parasympathetic division of the ANS, associated with relaxation <xref rid="pone.0086199-Levenson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086199-Romanowicz1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0086199-Kreibig1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the biphasic effects of moderate alcohol consumption with a meal on ambiance-induced mood, as measured by subjective responses and ANS activity. The secondary aim was to study the association between the effects of moderate alcohol consumption on subjective responses of mood and on ANS activity. We hypothesized that moderate alcohol consumption with a meal would amplify the pre-drinking mood state, resulting in a more positive mood in a positive induced mood state and in a more negative mood in a negative induced mood state. Furthermore, the induced mood was expected to influence the effect of alcohol on ANS activity, specifically by decreasing sympathetic outflow and increasing parasympathetic outflow in a positive induced mood and opposite effects in a negative induced mood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study was conducted at TNO (The Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research) in Zeist, The Netherlands, and was performed according to the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.

In addition, they were informed that the alcohol content of the beverages could vary per intervention day. Subjects were blinded to the alcohol intervention. They were instructed to refrain from drinking alcohol on the evening preceding each test day, to eat their standard breakfast and lunch on standard times on each test day and to refrain from eating and drinking anything except water 2 hours before testing. After connecting the electrodes for skin conductance and electrocardiography (ECG) measurements, a baseline measurement was performed for 2 min in a seated position. From that moment onwards, skin conductance and ECG were collected continuously until the end of the study day. Subjects relaxed for at least 15 min in a room where soft music was played before they went to the test rooms with either a pleasant or an unpleasant ambiance. In these rooms, subjects filled out computer questionnaires about their mood. Afterwards, they were asked to consume their first glass of sparkling white wine or alcohol-free white wine within 5 min. This moment is considered t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0. Immediately following their wine consumption the participants were served a meal consisting of a macaroni dish (2004 kJ, Apetito B.V., Denekamp, The Netherlands) with two more glasses of wine. The meal and 2 glasses of wine had to be finished in 15 min. BAC was measured with a breathalyzer (Alcotest 7410, Dr&#x000e4;ger Nederland, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands) before the first drink and 30 min, 60 min, 120 min and 150 min afterwards. Mood questionnaires were filled out before the first drink and at 20 min, 50 min, 110 and 140 min after. After the last questionnaire, a second baseline (recovery) measurement of 2 min was carried out for skin conductance and ECG.</p><p>Minor changes were made in the study procedure after the second study day to reduce potential stress from e.g. number of blood collections. These changes were approved by the Medical Ethics Committee METOPP.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Mood induction by meal ambiance</title><p>Rooms with a pleasant or an unpleasant meal ambiance were created by environmental factors as lighting, music, cleanness, decoration and a film scene. The pleasant ambiance room was colourfully decorated, light was soft, and music was playing. The unpleasant ambiance was created by having very bright lighting, no music, a filled dustbin next to the table, no decoration and plastic cutlery and serving dish. Ambient temperature was similar in both rooms. The ambiances were enhanced by showing the participants either a happy or sad film scene from the animation films &#x02018;Bambi&#x02019; (Walt Disney, 1942) and &#x02018;The Lion King&#x02019; (Walt Disney, 1994). The scenes were approximately 2.5 min long and were shown during the first glass of wine or alcohol-free wine. The happy scenes were either the scene of &#x02018;Bambi on the ice&#x02019; or the Lion King scene of &#x02018;hakuna matata&#x02019;.

Mean skin conductance level was calculated from 2 min time frames. The same frames were used for calculation of the ECG time-domain derivatives.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Heart rate variability parameters</title><p>Heart rate and heart rate variability parameters were measured using continuous ECG monitoring. Three electrodes were attached on the upper body for the ECG measurement (pre-cordial lead, sampling rate 512 Hz).</p><p>From the original ECG time series, inter beat intervals were calculated from R-R intervals. These are the intervals between two successive R-spikes of the QRS-complex in the ECG. Based on the inter beat intervals, the heart rate and root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) were calculated. RMSSD is a time-domain measure that reflects the short-term variation of the inter beat intervals and is strongly related to parasympathetic nervous system activity <xref rid="pone.0086199-Brownley1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086199-Goedhart1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In addition, frequency-domain measurements were determined from a power spectral density analysis computed by a 1024 point Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) on the inter beat intervals. The following frequency-domain measurements were calculated: low frequency power (LF power, 0.04&#x02013;0.15 Hz), high frequency power (HF power, 0.15&#x02013;0.40 Hz) and the LF:HF ratio. HF power is an index of parasympathetic nervous system activity and strongly related to RMSSD. Both are mainly influenced by vagal activity. Heart rate variability analysis was performed according to the Task Force Guidelines <xref rid="pone.0086199-Task1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Time frames of 6 min were selected at time points when the questionnaires were filled out (4 time frames at &#x02212;5 min, 25 min, 55 min and 115 min) to be able to compare the outcomes of the questionnaires with the physiological responses. Each 6 min time frame was subdivided in 2 min time frames for calculation of skin conductance, heart rate and the time-domain heart rate variability parameter RMSSD. Inter beat intervals were manually checked and segments with ectopic beats were not used for analysis. As FFT's mathematically require longer time series (e.g. as compared to time domain based parameters like RMSSD), heart rate variability parameters quantified within the frequency domain were calculated from the 6 min time frames. Consequently, skin conductance level, heart rate and RMSSD were calculated from 2 min time frames, whereas LF power, HF power and LF:HF ratio were calculated from 6 min time frames.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using the SAS statistical software package (SAS version 8; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). All variables were compared between interventions with a mixed analysis of variance model that included the fixed factors alcohol (alcohol vs. alcohol-free), ambiance (pleasant vs. unpleasant ambiance), time and the interaction between alcohol and ambiance, time and alcohol, time and ambiance, and time, alcohol and ambiance. The factors subject and subject by period were added to the model as random factors. A post hoc Tukey-Kramer test was used if an intervention effect occurred, to correct for multiple testing. Pearson correlations were calculated within one of the four conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086199-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

First, alcohol did not amplify ambiance-induced mood, but it improved mood in the unpleasant ambiance as shown by increased scores for feelings of happiness. Second, parameters for ANS activity were influenced by alcohol consumption, but not by ambiance-induced mood, except for some minor changes in skin conductance. Although no effects of pre-drinking mood state were found on ANS activity, ANS parameters were associated to subjective feelings of high or low arousal after alcohol consumption. This indicates that ANS parameters can be used as objective measures of the arousal dimension of mood.</p><p>We hypothesized that alcohol would amplify the ambiance-induced mood, but the opposite was found; in a more negative mood state, created by an unpleasant ambiance, moderate alcohol consumption with a meal increased self-reported happiness feelings. In the pleasant ambiance mood was not further improved by alcohol. Alcohol did not affect any other mood scales that were influenced by ambiance. With the exception of happiness, alcohol and ambiance influenced different mood scales.</p><p>We successfully induced a positive and negative mood state by creating rooms with either a pleasant or an unpleasant ambiance. In the pleasant ambiance, subjects scored higher on pleasantness and relaxation and lower on depression and tension than in the unpleasant ambiance. This indicates that subjects were indeed in a better mood in the pleasant ambiance than in the unpleasant ambiance. This is in accordance with previous research showing that mood declines when there is no color, and when light is too bright, similar to the conditions of the unpleasant ambiance in our study <xref rid="pone.0086199-Kller1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The mood effects of ambiance were present as long as the subjects were in the rooms, which was almost 3 hours. Other mood induction methods used previously, such as images, music, film clips and personalized recall, generally affect mood for a much shorter period <xref rid="pone.0086199-Rottenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086199-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0086199-Philippot1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Therefore, the mood induction by ambiance used in this study may be more useful for intervention studies in which a longer mood induction is preferred, such as experiments on food intake and eating behavior. Ambiance has been shown previously to influence eating behavior. This is probably caused by mood changes, although mood effects were not evaluated in these studies <xref rid="pone.0086199-Lindman1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0086199-Wansink1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>Moderate alcohol consumption with a meal resulted in biphasic mood effects. During the first hour after wine consumption subjects reported higher happiness and stimulation and lower calmness and mental alertness than after consumption of alcohol-free wine. During the first hour following alcohol consumption also sedative feelings were increased, but these effects remained elevated until the last measurement. This biphasic pattern differs from studies in which alcohol is consumed without food in the early-late afternoon. Those studies found that sedative effects arose on the descending limb of the BAC curve, while we observed sedative effects directly after consumption <xref rid="pone.0086199-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086199-Holdstock1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086199-King2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. However, Addicot et al. (2007) also observed sedative effects before BAC levels started to decline <xref rid="pone.0086199-Addicott1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The earlier onset of sedative feelings in the present study might be due to an increase in tiredness caused by the food intake. Indeed, in the alcohol-free condition, fatigue scores were increasing and vigor scores were decreasing after the meal. Lloyd &#x00026; Rogers (1997) and Markus et al. (2004) also measured the influence of combined alcohol and food intake on mood <xref rid="pone.0086199-Lloyd1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086199-Markus1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Lloyd &#x00026; Rogers (1997) observed no effects of moderate alcohol consumption on elation, energy and tiredness, which is in contrast to our findings. An explanation may be the lower number of subjects in the study of Lloyd &#x00026; Rogers (1997) <xref rid="pone.0086199-Lloyd1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Markus et al. (2004) did not find any mood effects of a moderate dose of alcohol (40 g) with an evening meal. However, they measured mood only once, 2 h after consumption <xref rid="pone.0086199-Markus1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Therefore, the study designs of both studies may not have had enough power to detect differences.</p><p>Motives to drink a moderate amount of alcohol are mostly to enhance mood or for social reasons, but with heavy alcohol consumption motives as coping with stress or negative mood also occur frequently. Although in the present study mood effects of moderate alcohol consumption were measured, we realize that coping motives in heavy alcohol consumption are related to problem drinking and addiction <xref rid="pone.0086199-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086199-Cooper2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>The second hypothesis was that alcohol consumption in a positive pre-drinking mood would cause higher heart rate variability and lower skin conductance than in a negative pre-drinking mood. This hypothesis, however, is not confirmed by our results, as we did not find interaction effects of alcohol and ambiance on ANS activity.</p><p>Ambiance only had a small influence on ANS activity. Skin conductance was further declined 2.5 h after consumption in the pleasant ambiance compared to the unpleasant ambiance, but heart rate variability parameters were not affected by ambiance. The small influence of ambiance on ANS activity may be due to the fact that varying ambiances resulted in mood changes. In contrast to emotional changes, mood changes are suggested to have no influence on ANS activity, because mood is not related to an object and no action from the body is required <xref rid="pone.0086199-Kreibig1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Moderate alcohol consumption influenced ANS activity. Compared to the situation in which no alcohol was consumed, alcohol increased skin conductance within the first hour, which indicates a short-term increase in sympathetic activity. On the other hand, alcohol consumption decreased heart rate variability (RMSSD and HF power), indicating a decrease in parasympathetic tone and vagal withdrawal. As a result, LF:HF ratio and heart rate, indices of sympathovagal balance, were increased after alcohol consumption.</p><p>These results are in accordance with previous research on the effect of alcohol on heart rate variability <xref rid="pone.0086199-Levenson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086199-Romanowicz1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0086199-Spaak2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Skin conductance was also increased after alcohol consumption in a study by Levenson et al (1980) <xref rid="pone.0086199-Levenson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, Stritzke et al (1995) found an attenuated skin conductance response after alcohol consumption when subjects watched either pleasant or unpleasant pictures inducing arousal <xref rid="pone.0086199-Stritzke2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. In contrast to previous studies, in the present study alcohol was combined with food consumption. Autonomic activity plays an important role in energy balance and thermoregulation. Sympathetic stimulation increases energy metabolism and thermogenesis and reduces food intake <xref rid="pone.0086199-Bray1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086199-Messina1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In the present study, energy metabolism was not measured and food intake was standardized. However, the distinct short-term increase in sympathetic outflow could have caused an increase in energy metabolism and energy expenditure. This is in line with a study by Addicott et al. (2007), which showed that moderate alcohol consumption increases physical activity during rising BACs. Surprisingly, when sympathetic tone was returned to normal values, parasympathetic tone stayed decreased and sympathovagal balance was not restored 2 hours after consumption as shown by elevated levels of the LF:HF ratio an heart rate. However, heart rate was recorded until 2.5 hour after consumption and at this time its levels were recovered. Whether this 2 hours increase in sympathovagal balance is related to long-term effects is not known. Epidemiological studies found inconsistent results on the association between chronic moderate alcohol consumption and heart rate variability <xref rid="pone.0086199-Janszky1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0086199-Ryan1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. An acute increase in sympathovagal balance is also seen during physical activity and mental stress <xref rid="pone.0086199-Malliani1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Furthermore, previous studies showed that even a meal increased sympathovagal balance for 1 or 2 hours due to a continuous inhibition of parasympathetic activity <xref rid="pone.0086199-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086199-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Therefore, we suggest that the acute increase in sympathovagal balance after combined food and alcohol consumption indicates an activated physiological state of the body, which may be generated to restore homeostasis.</p><p>ANS activity was found to be related to the arousal dimension of mood. The increased sympathetic tone was related to increased happiness and stimulation and decreased calmness and fatigue. This indicates that sympathetic activity was related to increased arousal and can be used as an objective measure of the arousal dimension of mood. The reduced parasympathetic tone was related to decreased mental alertness and increased sedation, suggesting this was caused by a central effect of alcohol. These associations are not in line with the idea that mood states, in contrast to emotions, are not related to ANS activity <xref rid="pone.0086199-Kreibig1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, Matthews et al. (1990) also found a relation between skin conductance and self-report of the arousal dimension of mood in subjects measured prior to an intelligence test <xref rid="pone.0086199-Matthews1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.</p><p>Strengths of the study are the randomized crossover design and the controlled study conditions. However, the study design also has some limitations that warrant consideration. We did not measure the mood effects of a meal separately from the alcohol effects. Therefore we cannot disentangle the alcohol and meal effects on mood. Second, although the alcohol intervention was blinded, the subjects might have noticed the alcohol content of the beverages. A confounding effect of expectancy in the observed mood effects can therefore not be excluded. Third, mood was measured in a laboratory setting and the physiological measurements may have influenced the mood of the subjects. However, we tried to interfere as little as possible with the physiological measurements. The subjects did not notice much of the autonomic nervous system measurements as they were carrying a small ambulatory device, which all electrodes from the ECG and skin conductance were connected to, so they could move freely in the rooms.</p><p>The study was carried out in women and the generalizability of the results to men may not be directly possible because men and women showed different mood effects of a meal in a previous study <xref rid="pone.0086199-Wells2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Furthermore, subjects were eating and drinking alone in this study. Social interaction has been shown to influence mood effects of alcohol and therefore the results may not be generalizable to food and alcohol consumption in a social setting <xref rid="pone.0086199-Doty1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086199-Kirkpatrick1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>.</p><p>To conclude, mood inductions and autonomic nervous system parameters may be useful to evaluate mood changes by nutritional interventions. Moderate alcohol consumption elevates happiness in an unpleasant ambiance. However, drinking alcohol during a pleasant mood results in an equally positive mood state. Consuming alcohol with a meal does not result in different mood changes than alcohol consumption alone, although sedative feelings may have an earlier onset.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0086199.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
