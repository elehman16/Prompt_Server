<bold>Background:</bold> It is not clear whether light plays any role in determining menstrual cycles or ovulation in women. However, light is used as a treatment for some medical conditions related to rhythm, most notably seasonal affective disorder. In this study, the researchers wanted to examine the role of light in influencing the menstrual cycle. In the trial reported here, 22 women with lengthened menstrual cycles were provided with a light box that emitted either bright light or dim light, and the women were asked to use the light box for a defined period each day for one menstrual cycle. The study had a crossover design, where women would receive either bright or dim light for one cycle, then another cycle without the light box, and finally a cycle with either bright or dim light, whichever they did not receive first. Outcomes assessed in the trial included measurements of the blood levels of certain hormones. Specifically, the researchers looked at three hormones that determine the reproductive cycle (lutenizing hormone [LH], follicle stimulating hormone [FSH], and prolactin); these are produced by a region of the brain that is controlled by the hypothalamus, a gland that is directly responsive to light. Additionally, ultrasound scans were used to check for ovulation during each cycle. The trial was carried out in winter in Novosibirsk, a Russian city.</p><p>
<bold>What the trial shows:</bold> When the researchers compared hormone levels between the &#x0201c;bright light&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;dim light&#x0201d; phases of the study, they found statistically significant increases in levels of LH, FSH, and prolactin in the blood. Ovulation was more likely in the &#x0201c;bright light&#x0201d; phase of the study as compared to the &#x0201c;dim light&#x0201d; phase. However, levels of two other hormones, thyroid stimulating hormone, and estradiol, were not significantly different when comparing the &#x0201c;bright&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;dim&#x0201d; cycles.</p><p>
<bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> In this trial the use of a crossover design enabled each woman to act as her own control, thereby reducing the number of participants that were needed in the trial. A further strength in this study was the use of ultrasound scans to allow the researchers to pinpoint ovulation in the participants; similar studies have not tried to examine the effects of light both on reproductive hormones and ovulation. A weakness of the design is that participants were assigned to receive either dim light first or bright light first using alternation, not true randomization. Therefore blinding was not possible and the researchers recruiting participants would have known in advance what intervention each participant would receive first. Other weaknesses include the limited number of participants in this study, and the nature of the participant population, all of whom had lengthened menstrual cycles and were living at fairly northerly latitude.</p><p>
<bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> This study adds data suggesting that in women with lengthened menstrual cycles, ovulation can be stimulated by bright light. However, this finding would need to be replicated in a larger sample of women and it is not yet clear whether bright light will have the same effect on ovulation in women outside northerly latitudes and with average-length menstrual cycles.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Danilenko KV, Samoilova EA (2007) Stimulatory effect of morning bright light on reproductive hormones and ovulation: Results of a controlled crossover trial.

Forty years ago it was asserted that light might regulate the menstrual cycle and ovulation [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A series of six studies&#x02014;one in the Boston area, four in San Diego, and one in Novosibirsk (1965&#x02013;1995)&#x02014;have shown that the menstrual cycle shortened in women with long menstrual cycles after bedside light administered overnight around the days of presumed ovulation [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Two subsequent studies found an increased rate of ovulation determined with a home dip-stick test detecting an ovulatory surge of LH in urine ([<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], Putilov et al., unpublished data]. Additional evidence came from a group of patients with seasonal affective disorder who received conventional morning bright light therapy or dawn simulation for a week starting within 0&#x02013;13 days after menstruation onset. This resulted in a shorter menstrual cycle by 1.2 days on average, and the effect was not correlated with the depression improvement [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The above studies were not accompanied by the hormonal measurements that might elicit the mechanisms underlying the cycle-shortening effect of light. Surprisingly, there has been little investigation in humans into the effects of light on the two principal hormones regulating the menstrual cycle&#x02014;follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)&#x02014;compared with other hypophyseal hormones and melatonin. These studies showed an increase of LH and/or FSH, in men or women, following bright light 500 to 3,000 lux [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to answer conclusively whether light can influence menstrual cycle and ovulation, and to determine the underlying hormonal changes taking place. The design combined several approaches used in previous studies and advanced some of them. For example, ultrasound scans were introduced as a method to objectively document ovulation. Bright light, during wakefulness was used since it has also been shown to shorten the menstrual cycle [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], does not disturb sleep (as dim overnight lights might) and is better studied (in terms of neuroendocrine effects). The dark season and the hour immediately following wakening were chosen as the exposure time since light stimulus is most effective when contrasted with low levels of light in the preceding period (e.g., [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). Women with slightly lengthened menstrual cycles were selected with a view to shortening the cycle, i.e., a sort of treatment since in woman with normal cycles this shortening could be undesirable [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. On the other hand, women with very long menstrual cycles (mean &#x0003e;42 d) are only slightly responsive to light exposure [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], suggesting that significant hormonal abnormalities are not subject to a relatively subtle intervention such as light therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>The study was performed in Novosibirsk (55&#x000b0;N), in three consecutive years 2003&#x02013;2006, between October and April (the shortest day is 7 h). Test participants were recruited via advertisements in a local newspaper and a patient database of the gynaecologist (EAS). The advertisement was as follows: &#x0201c;Women with lengthened menstrual cycles (30&#x02013;38 days) are invited to participate in a study. Ultrasound and hormonal investigations will be conducted free of charge&#x0201d;. Respondents provided dates of menstruation onset over the past year and suitable candidates were invited for clinical interview. During the interview with the investigators (both are clinicians), they received a detailed description of the study, completed a questionnaire concerning their general health and answered some medical questions from the clinicians. The inclusion criteria required that the majority of menstrual cycles, especially the last two baseline cycles, were free from any medication known to interfere with hormone release; the absence of clinically evident endocrine abnormalities; good general health; a normal sleep-wake regimen; and no transmeridian travel two months prior to the study.</p><p>After meeting the inclusion criteria, the candidates signed the consent form if they were willing to participate. The most common motive for participation was long-standing difficulty in conceiving and/or a physician's recommendation for a hormonal investigation, which is expensive. The consent included the statement: &#x0201c;The agreement provides the participant with free testing and is offered on a mutually beneficial basis: the participants receive information regarding their reproductive system, whilst the clinicians are able to investigate the effects of light&#x0201d;. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Internal Medicine SB RAMS.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Protocol</title><p>The study lasted for two menstrual cycles separated by an off-protocol episode of at least one menstrual cycle. Bright light was administered during one experimental cycle, dim light during the other (placebo-controlled, crossover, counterbalanced order design). Light treatment lasted for a week at home and was preceded by the day of baseline investigations and followed by the day of follow-up investigation. Both the baseline and follow-up investigations were planned to be performed in follicular phase before ovulation, because the dominant follicle ruptures and the hormonal profile changes very considerably on ovulation and this might confound consistency of our results, especially if not all cycles are ovulatory. On the other hand, light exposure is most effective when administered around the days of presumed ovulation [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, the approximate day for entering the study was calculated as minimal cycle length (for a particular woman) minus 14 d (usual duration of the luteal phase) and minus 7 d (duration of the light treatment). Participants came to a medical centre in the afternoon to give 5 ml of 3-h fasted venous blood and to pass an ultrasound examination. They took a light device and a diary back home to start daily light exposure the next morning, and returned a week later (on the day of the last light exposure) for the follow-up examination. For simplicity, baseline and follow-up examination days are referred to in the text as &#x0201c;day 7&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;day 14&#x0201d;. Ultrasound scans were conducted as required to document ovulation and participants also recorded post-awakening rectal temperature daily in their diary to pinpoint the date.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>As in study [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], Sunray2-Max box (Outside In) was used to provide bright white light of intensity 4,300 lux. The lamps have a phosphor type 835 with a correlated colour temperature of 3,500 K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pctr-0020007-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The participant was instructed to sit at a distance of 41 cm facing the screen of the box for 45 min shortly after waking. It was not necessary to look at the screen all the time, just to allow light to freely enter both eyes. Dim light (placebo control) was of normal room intensity less than 100 lux at 41 cm from a domestic 1-tube fluorescent fitting. After each week of light intervention, the participant was invited to comment on their experience of using light. No specific monitoring of adverse events was done (e.g. eye examination) because the light is known to be a low-risk intervention [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><fig id="pctr-0020007-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Spectral Composition of the Bright Light</title><p>The figure shows a spectral power distribution of the light emitted from a Sunray2-Max box (Outside In).

Serum was assayed for concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin (PRL), LH, FSH by immunoluminometric assay (ILMA), and for estradiol (E2) by ELISA. Reagent ILMA kits were obtained from Immunotech (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.beckmancoulter.com/products/pr_immunology.asp">http://www.beckmancoulter.com/products/pr_immunology.asp</ext-link>), and ELISA kits from DRG (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.drg-diagnostics.de">http://www.drg-diagnostics.de</ext-link>). The samples from each individual were assayed in the same run, using one kit, to avoid interassay variability. The sensitivity of the assay and maximal intra-assay variations within the normal range of hormone were: 0.03 mU/l and 6.2% for TSH, 0.26 ng/ml and 3.4% for PRL, 0.2 U/l and 5.6% for LH, 0.2 U/l and 2.9% for FSH, 9.7 pg/ml and 6.8% for E2. Based on the literature, TSH and PRL are secreted in a rhythmic fashion with an increase at night-time and relatively stable values during an afternoon trough, whereas LH, FSH, and E2 have no distinct 24-h variations (e.g., [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). Blood was taken in the afternoon in order to exclude any confounding effect on the results of any phase shift of the hormone's circadian rhythm by repeated light stimuli. Since LH shows pulsatile secretion during the day (e.g., [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]), a half-day urine sample was collected in a subset of participants, to be analysed in the event of near-significant results on serum LH.</p><p>Ultrasound examination was performed using a linear/sector ultrasonic compound scanner SSD-500 (Aloka [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aloka.com/">http://www.aloka.com/</ext-link>]) with 3.5-MHz transabdominal and 5-MHz transvaginal convex probes. Follicle diameter, ovary volume, and endometrium thickness were estimated and the scan images/results printed. Follicle growth was determined as the difference in diameter of the maximal (dominant) follicle on day 14 and maximal follicle in the same ovary on day 7. The disappearance of a dominant follicle in subsequent scans indicated that ovulation had occurred. The presence of free fluid behind the uteri helped to show ovulation had occurred recently, and an increase in echo signal from the endometrium confirmed the transition from preovulatory to postovulatory phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample Size</title><p>No formal sample size calculation was done.

With our crossover design, we aimed to have at least 15 participants complete the study, targeting 20&#x02013;25 to either obtain a definitive conclusion within two years, or possibly to halt the study after one year if interim analysis of the results showed no significance. In fact, the study period was extended to three years because of operational problems.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Randomization</title><p>Entering the study was determined by participants' menstrual cycle onset and, therefore, was sequential and not dependent on investigators.

The change of TSH and E2 secretions was not significantly different between two conditions.</p><p>This is the first study to focus on the effect of light on the ovulatory process with concomitant measurement of several hormones to understand the underlying mechanism. It is clear that the increased rate of ovulation following bright light exposure is a consequence of faster follicle maturation. Follicle maturation, in turn, is determined by the complex interrelated changes in the secretion of pituitary-ovarian hormones. The neuroanatomical basis for the effect of light may include the novel melanopsin-based photoreceptors in the eye conveying information via the retinohypothalamic tract (separate from the optic nerve) to the biological clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (reviewed in [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). There are likely to be numerous other links from the hypothalamus, yet the pathway to the pineal gland&#x02014;secreting the darkness neurohormone melatonin&#x02014;is the only one well studied. However, contrary to animal findings, there is no solid evidence that melatonin plays a significant role in the modulation of the human reproductive function (summarized in [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). Light may act directly on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis as it might for the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The neuroendocrine mechanism involved in the stimulatory effect of light may be different from those regulating the monthly increase of LH and FSH during the follicular phase. To illustrate this, in Japanese quail barbiturate anaesthesia, which blocks an LH surge during ovulatory cycle, did not block the preovulatory-like increase of LH induced by light [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalisability</title><p>The effects of light discussed here should not be generalized to women with normal or very long/irregular menstrual cycles (as these groups are likely to have different endocrinology from that of the study participants), or to the summer season and Southern locations (both providing bright rather than dark conditions).</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overall Evidence</title><p>The literature search was done via our own database of publications on the topic, PubMed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?DB=pubmed">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?DB=pubmed</ext-link>), and local libraries, with e-mail inquiries to the authors on specific questions, if necessary. Only four previous experiments have investigated the effect of artificial light on the reproductive hormones LH, FSH, and E2 in humans, and those results are in line with ours. In a crossover, placebo-controlled study of LH excretion, the 24-h LH level was increased after morning bright light 1,000 lux administered to 11 healthy men between 05:00 and 06:00 for 5 d [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Miyauchi et al. [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] investigated the effect of an acute light stimulus (3,000 lux presented between 22:40 and 24:00) on five women in their follicular phases and found an increase of LH and FSH compared to prestimulus levels 21:30&#x02013;22:40. In the reference group of six participants without light, there was no change in hormone concentrations. In a subsequent study [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] the serum concentration of FSH was increased at 02:00 (<italic>n</italic> = 17), but not at 22:00 following light stimulus of 500&#x02013;800 lux presented from 17:30 to 02:00; the change in LH did not reach a significance threshold (the authors suggested this may be because of LH pulsatility). Graham et al. [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] found no change in all-night E2 levels in 22 women exposed to bright light 5,200 lux from 21:00 to 01:00. The changes in reproductive hormones resemble a natural increased pituitary&#x02013;ovarian axis activity in spring found in one [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] but not all studies performed in Finland [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>TSH secretion is generally rigidly coupled to artificial light exposure (e.g., [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]) as was the case in our study. The findings on PRL in healthy participants are not consistent. In two studies, plasma PRL concentrations were increased, either during evening bright light [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or after morning light exposure [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In others, PRL levels were unaffected by night light [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and also after daily light exposure [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In some studies, PRL levels were suppressed by light at night [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>The low rate of ovulation (27%) in the studied group is not surprising as menstrual cycles of over 35 days are associated with low rates of conception in a significant number of women [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We did not find a significant shortening of the menstrual cycle following light exposure. Whilst this was also the case in the last menstrual cycle study of the San Diego group [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], in previous studies the shortening effect had been shown consistently [<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020007-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
