Patients received folinic acid (200 mg m-2) intravenously over 2 h followed by a loading dose of intra-arterial 5-FU (400 mg m-2) over 15 min, then 5-FU (1600 mg m-2) by intra-arterial infusion over the following 22 h. This was repeated on day 2 and the whole schedule was repeated every 2 weeks. Response was assessed after six treatments. The median follow-up was 17 months. Overall response rate was 46% with 8% complete response. Estimated median survival is 19 months. Site of progression was the liver alone in 55%, liver and lung in another 16% and 29% in other sites. Eight patients experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicity. The response rate of this regimen compares favourably with reported trials of intra-arterial FUDR, and our schedule is currently being compared with a similar schedule of intravenous 5-FU and folinic acid in a randomized Medical Research Council trial (CR05).</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00174-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1390" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00174-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1391" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00174-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1392" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00174-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1393" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
