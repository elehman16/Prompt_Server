World Health Organization (WHO) data from 60 countries showed a 12&#x000a0;month prevalence of depressive episodes of 3.2% in patients without comorbidities and from 9.3 to 23.0% in those suffering from chronic healthcare problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The most commonly offered interventions include psychological treatment and antidepressant drugs. The WHO predicts that depression will become the leading burden of disease by 2030 and it has already become the number one reason for years lost to disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Some patients experience partial or no benefit of psychological interventions or pharmacotherapy, or have experienced or are concerned about side effects of antidepressants. Some of these consult homeopaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Homeopaths provide a combination of consultations and prescription of homeopathic medicines, guided by underlying basic homeopathy principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Treating &#x0201c;like with like&#x0201d; is the core principle, stating that substances causing certain symptoms in healthy persons, may cure those same symptoms in those who are ill. There is considerable debate around the use of homeopathy, which has a 12-month prevalence of 3.9% (Relton C, Cooper K, Viksveen P, Fibert P, Harris P, Thomas KJ. Prevalence of homeopathy use by the general population worldwide: a systematic review. Homeopathy. Forthcoming 2017 (under review)), in particular the highly diluted homeopathic medicines, which are produced through serial dilution and succussion (shaking) to reduce the risk of side effects. Depression is one of the conditions homeopaths are most commonly consulted for [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. An early systematic review found limited evidence available to assess the effectiveness and safety of homeopathy in depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Since then, results of two placebo-controlled trials have been published, suggesting homeopathic medicines may be non-inferior to an antidepressant and superior to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although placebo-controlled trials may be used to assess the efficacy of medications, they are less suitable to assess interventions in &#x0201c;real world&#x0201d; practice. Pragmatic trials assessing the effectiveness of the &#x0201c;whole treatment package&#x0201d; of interventions, including consultations and medication, may be of greater relevance to patients, clinicians and decision makers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Goldacre suggested unblinded trials comparing visits to a homeopathy clinic against a General Practitioner&#x02019;s (GP&#x02019;s) treatment as usual might be the way forward for homeopathy research, as this is of more interest to patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This is the first pragmatic randomised controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of treatment provided by homeopaths for depressed patients.</p><p id="Par28">The primary objective of this trial was to assess the clinical effectiveness of the offer of adjunctive treatment provided by homeopaths for patients with self-reported unipolar depression in addition to usual care, compared to usual care alone. The secondary objectives were to assess the effectiveness of received treatment. The acceptability and the safety of the intervention were also assessed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par29">This pragmatic randomised controlled trial used the &#x0201c;cohort multiple randomised controlled trial&#x0201d; (cmRCT) design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. One third of all patients with self-reported depression who were eligible for participation were randomly selected to receive an offer of treatment provided by homeopaths as an adjunct to usual care. The remaining two thirds served as a control group receiving no offer of treatment and continuing treatment as usual. Participants were recruited through the Yorkshire Health Study, a population-based longitudinal observational cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Ethics approval was obtained from the National Regional Ethics Service (REC reference 12/YH/0379) and the protocol was published prior to trial start (ISRCTN02484593) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Data are reported in line with Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Recruitment</title><p id="Par30">Patients in the Yorkshire Health Study cohort, who had been recruited through 43 GPs in South Yorkshire, had previously provided information on their state of health through a health questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A mood and health screening questionnaire was sent to all those who had previously reported suffering from long-standing depression or feeling moderately or extremely anxious or depressed. All adults (age 18&#x02013;85 years) who responded to this questionnaire and who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in the trial. Criteria for self-reported depression included scoring at least 10 points on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), including at least 2 points on question 1 (little interest/pleasure in doing things) or question 2 (feeling down, depressed or hopeless). PHQ-9 is based on the depression criteria of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (DSM-V). It has been compared to standard screening criteria and has been found to have a high degree of validity, reliability, sensitivity and specificity and it is considered a useful screening tool with a cutoff score for major depressive disorder of 10 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Exclusion criteria were self-reported: Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, bipolar disorder, organic brain damage, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders, other psychotic disorders, or antisocial personality disorder; having received treatment by a homeopath over the past 3&#x000a0;months; currently being involved in other health research; or being unable to understand study questionnaires and accompanying information due to reduced intellectual capacity, illiteracy or English language skills. Patients were recruited from 15 September 2013 to 7 February 2014 (randomisation 9 December 2013).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Random selection and consent</title><p id="Par31">One third of the patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were randomly selected to receive an offer of treatment by a homeopath. Random selection was carried out by a statistician not otherwise involved in the trial, using a computer software program, at three time points (9 December 2013, 14 January 2014 and 7 February 2014) depending on when patients returned their screening questionnaire. A simple randomisation process was applied (no block/stratification randomisation) at a 1:2 ratio. Only patients&#x02019; research ID numbers were provided for the random selection process. Patients in the cohort had consented to be contacted again and for their data to be used to assess the benefits of health interventions. Information about the intervention was sent to patients randomly selected to receive the offer of treatment and written informed consent was obtained from those accepting the offer, which included consenting to continue standard medication as prescribed by their GP/specialist.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par32">Other than for the random selection process, no blinding was used due to the pragmatic nature of the research question &#x0201c;Is treatment by a homeopath effective for self-reported depression?&#x0201d; No blinding of assessment (statistical analyses) was used, as group allocation would become obvious due to the 1:2 randomisation ratio.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial groups</title><p id="Par33">The intervention was provided by seven homeopaths in South Yorkshire. As this was a pragmatic trial, practitioners were instructed to practise as they usually do, and no restrictions were put on the length/frequency of consultations or medicines they prescribed. They were, however, provided additional training and guidelines for reporting risks and adverse events. Treatment was offered to individual patients for up to 9&#x000a0;months, in three integrated health clinics in Barnsley, Doncaster and Sheffield, and in a medical centre in Rotherham. All patients were free to start or continue any other treatment during the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="Par34">The primary outcome was the self-report PHQ-9 measure at 6&#x000a0;months. The PHQ-9 is sensitive to change and useful for assessing patients with various medical comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The secondary outcome measures were PHQ-9 at 12&#x000a0;months; and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) outcome measure at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The GAD-7 has a high degree of reliability and validity for measuring anxiety in the general population and in heterogeneous groups of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Both the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 are reported as continuous scores. Two secondary outcomes included in the study protocol were removed in order to reduce participant burden and one (body mass index (BMI)) was removed as there was no past research suggesting changes in scores could be expected. Patients were followed up in the time period from 9 December 2013 to 7 February 2015 (individual patients for 12&#x000a0;months).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par35">The trial was designed to test the effectiveness of an offer of treatment provided by homeopaths as an adjunct to usual care (offer group), compared to usual care alone (no offer group). The effect size used for the sample size calculation was 0.35. Due to the lack of previous pragmatic trials in this field, the effect size was chosen under the assumption that a small to moderate effect size should be the minimum threshold level for recommending the intervention as an adjunct to usual care. The significance level (alpha error) was 0.05 and the power 80%. The questionnaire non-response rate was estimated to be 40%. Using an unequal randomisation ratio, this gave a sample size of 485 patients, with 162 in the offer group and 323 in the no offer group. A &#x0201c;rolling recruitment&#x0201d; method was used, including patients until a cutoff date for inclusion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical methods</title><p id="Par36">Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was used to assess the effectiveness of the offer of treatment provided by a homeopath as an adjunct to usual care (offer group), compared to usual care alone (no offer group), for all patients with analysable data. Patients remained in the group they were randomly allocated to, irrespective of whether they received the intervention or not. However, patients who were found post randomisation not to be eligible for participation (not fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria) were excluded from the analysis.</p><p id="Par37">A general linear model (GLM) was used for the primary analysis, comparing the mean depression (PHQ-9) scores at 6&#x000a0;months post randomisation in the offer group and no offer groups, and controlling for baseline characteristics. Baseline characteristics were selected using linear regression as part of a hierarchical model testing the effect of 11 characteristics considered to potentially influence depression scores. The 11 characteristics tested were selected on the basis of the literature on depression research and the opinion of the trial researchers and practitioners. Characteristics with a <italic>p</italic> value of at least 0.2 were included in the model.</p><p id="Par38">As the intervention was therapist-based, there could be clustering or correlation of patients&#x02019; outcomes and treatment offered by particular practitioners. To allow for this, mean PHQ-9 scores were assessed using generalised estimating equations (GEE) using an exchangeable correlation to estimate the regression coefficients. Participants in the control group were treated as one cluster. The exchangeable correlation assumed that participant outcomes within each cluster (practitioner group) had the same correlation.</p><p id="Par39">At 12&#x000a0;months post randomisation, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was applied comparing mean outcomes in the offer and no offer groups, including outcomes at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months, and controlling for baseline characteristics. The influence of baseline characteristics was tested as for 6-month outcomes. Similar approaches were used to assess anxiety (GAD-7) scores at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. All statistical exploratory tests were two-tailed with alpha set to 0.05. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in PHQ-9 scores was also calculated for all comparisons.</p><p id="Par40">ITT analyses &#x0201c;water down&#x0201d; any potential effect of interventions in trials with low acceptance or compliance rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This is likely to be the case in trials using the cmRCT design, as patients in the offer group are only informed about the intervention after being included in the trial, and a proportion are likely to not accept the offer of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Moreover, trials in depression are known to have particular challenges with recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It was therefore probable that a significant proportion of patients would not take up the offer of treatment. Per-protocol analyses, which are often used by researchers to assess the effectiveness of treatment received, carry a high risk of bias. Instead, complier average causal effect (CACE) analyses have been recommended to take into account non-compliance in RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In CACE analyses, outcomes in patients who take up the offer of treatment are compared to outcomes in the no offer group of patients who would have taken up the offer had they received it. In this trial, instrumental variables (IV) analysis was used, as this type of CACE-analysis takes into account patients&#x02019; baseline characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Missing data</title><p id="Par41">Four approaches for dealing with missing data were used: no imputation for missing data, multiple imputation, regression imputation and last observation carried forward. Multiple imputation was selected as the primary method, as it was expected to provide more conservative results than no imputation for missing data. Little&#x02019;s missing completely at random (MCAR) test did not suggest any systematic patterns in missing data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Effect size</title><p id="Par42">The standardized effect size was calculated by dividing the difference in the change of the estimated marginal mean depression (PHQ-9) scores between the offer and no offer groups from baseline to 6&#x000a0;months, by the pooled standard deviation of baseline PHQ-9 scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Similar approaches were used for secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Assessment of acceptability and safety</title><p id="Par43">The acceptability of the intervention was assessed by calculating the acceptance rate in patients receiving the offer of treatment. The safety of treatment was assessed by considering the number and nature of adverse events and potential risks (suicide, self-harm, causing harm to others, significant mental deterioration) reported by patients and practitioners and identified through qualitative interviews carried out by the first researcher. Two researchers, independently of each other, assessed the severity and causality of all reported adverse events. For most adverse events (19/24) the researchers&#x02019; assessments corresponded. All discrepancies in assessments were resolved through discussion. The severity of adverse events was assessed using the common terminology criteria for adverse events. The WHO and Uppsala Monitoring Centre guidelines were used for assessment of causality of adverse events.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Recruitment, random selection and questionnaire response</title><p id="Par44">At the time of recruitment, the Yorkshire Health Study cohort included 22,179 patients who had consented to being contacted again. A total of 5740 patients who had previously reported long-standing depression or feeling moderately or extremely anxious or depressed were sent a screening questionnaire (15 September 2013). Out of these, 2214 (38.6%) returned a completed questionnaire (7 February 2014), with 566 fulfilling the inclusion criteria and 185 randomly selected to receive the offer of treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Consolidated standards of reporting trials (CONSORT) flow-diagram: recruitment, randomisation and flow of patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2040_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

At 6&#x000a0;months, statistically significant differences (&#x02264;0.05) were found in 5 of 20 baseline characteristics (age, employment status, deprivation score, existence of more than three long-standing conditions and the proportion of patients reporting whether they were using antidepressants), but none were considered likely to significantly influence 6-month outcomes. At 12&#x000a0;months, the only statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics included lower likelihood of non-responders in the offer group reporting the time of onset of their depression and lower likelihood of reporting whether they had used antidepressants in the past.

The statistical analysis plan for the trial stated that a standardized effect size would be used for assessing the clinical importance of the results and these results suggest a small clinical effect of the offer of treatment and a moderate effect of treatment received by patients. However, there is some evidence to suggest that the threshold level for the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for PHQ-9 is a reduction of 5 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], which is more than the score detected in this trial. Although wide confidence intervals preclude any firm conclusions from being drawn, these results warrant further research into this intervention for depressed patients for three reasons.</p><p id="Par65">First, existing interventions for depression are also mostly associated with small effect sizes, e.g. anti-depressants and psychological interventions with small to moderate effect sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Although some trials of psychotherapeutic interventions suggest moderate to large effect sizes, most have unknown or high risk of bias, and only smaller effects are seen when controlling for unpublished trials or assessing higher quality studies with larger sample sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par66">Second, the results of this trial must be seen in light of the fact that the majority of patients suffered from long-standing depression and several comorbidities, and they are therefore harder to treat and have a poorer prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par67">Third, although this trial was not powered to detect side-effects, no evidence suggested the treatment was unsafe. Antidepressants are commonly associated with risk of unwanted side-effects, some of which may be severe and under-reported, and some argue that the harms of antidepressants may outweigh the benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">The trial over-recruited within 5&#x000a0;months, a good result when seen in light of the fact that trials often struggle to reach recruitment goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It was anticipated that a large proportion of patients would decline the offer of treatment as this was not a treatment-seeking population &#x02013; thus, patients were unaware of the possibility of being offered the intervention before trial start in this trial within a cohort design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Potential non-acceptance of an offer of treatment is a specific feature of the cmRCT design that warrants particular attention when interpreting trial results. Regular ITT analyses represent the effect of an &#x0201c;offer&#x0201d; of treatment, although we do not suggest there is an effect simply of being offered the intervention. ITT analyses will &#x0201c;water down&#x0201d; any potential effect of interventions in cmRCT trials with low acceptance or compliance rates. Therefore, IV analysis should be applied to test the effectiveness of the received intervention. Compared to &#x0201c;regular&#x0201d; RCTs, the use of the cmRCT design provides the additional benefit of testing the acceptability of the intervention. Treatment uptake in this particular trial was good, given that this was not a clinical-treatment-seeking population and the controversy surrounding homeopathy in the UK over the past few years.</p><p id="Par69">This was the first full trial of any intervention using the cmRCT design. The benefits and challenges of using this design of trials within a cohort (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.twics.global/">http://www.twics.global</ext-link>) included full and fast recruitment, low attrition and recruitment of a population reasonably similar to the population of patients who self-report chronic depression (Viksveen P, Relton C, Nicholl J. Benefits and challenges of using the &#x0201c;cohort multiple randomised controlled trial&#x0201d; design for testing an intervention for depression. Trials. Forthcoming 2017 (accepted)).</p><p id="Par70">A limitation of this trial was a lower 6-month and 12-month questionnaire response rate in patients who were randomly selected to be offered the intervention, but who did not take up the offer. There was, however, no evidence to suggest that any baseline characteristics were likely to significantly affect outcomes, so statistical analyses of outcomes could be carried out with limited risk of significant influence of known potential confounding due to differences in response rates. Another limitation of this research was the lack of blinding of the researcher who collected questionnaire responses and carried out statistical analyses. Questionnaires were, however, completed by patients at home, thereby avoiding any undue research influence on patients, and data management was checked by two other researchers.</p><p id="Par71">This trial was not designed to answer the question of whether or not homeopathic medicines are effective in treating depression, but whether treatment provided by homeopaths for patients with self-reported depression is effective. This treatment typically includes an initial session lasting from one to two hours involving taking history, clinical examination, discussion of treatment options, and prescription of homeopathic medicines, followed by up to ten sessions at monthly intervals to review progress and adjust treatments. The pragmatic nature of this trial; with recruitment of patients from a large population-based health cohort, wide inclusion criteria and encouraging practitioners to practise as they normally do, increased the generalisability of results to the general population of patients suffering from long-standing self-reported depression who take up an offer of treatment provided by a homeopath. Research questions that need further consideration if results of this trial were to be reproduced include an understanding of the mechanism of action, the effect of homeopathic medicines and of the homeopath-patient interaction, and indirect effects that may influence outcomes (e.g. changes in patients&#x02019; medication).</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par72">An offer of treatment provided by homeopaths for patients with self-reported depression was associated with a small treatment effect over a time period of 6 to 12&#x000a0;months, whereas a moderate effect was found in patients who received treatment. However, wide confidence intervals preclude any firm conclusions from being drawn. Further research should be conducted in order to see if these findings can be replicated, and to determine the safety of this adjunctive treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec28"><p>
