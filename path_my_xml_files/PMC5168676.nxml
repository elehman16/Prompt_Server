However, 70% of patients cannot receive the complete sequence because of a postoperative complication or a decrease in functional and nutritional reserves. Recently, a new concept appeared in digestive surgery: prehabilitation. This interventional process consists of patient preparation, between surgical consultation and surgery, and is based on 3 components: (1) physical management, (2) nutritional care and (3) psychological care. Prehabilitation should decrease postoperative complications and improve nutritional and physical status during the preoperative and postoperative periods. Therefore, it is becoming essential to evaluate the effect of prehabilitation, compared to conventional care, on the percentage of patients reaching the complete oncological treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The PREHAB trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of prehabilitation compared to conventional care, in patients with gastro-oesophageal cancer with perioperative chemotherapy. This trial is a prospective, randomised, controlled, open-blind and interventional study in 4 centres. Patients (n=60 per group) will be randomly assigned for management with either prehabilitation or conventional care. The primary outcome is the percentage of patients reaching the complete oncological treatment decided in a multidisciplinary tumour board. The secondary outcomes are the postoperative morbidity, disease-free survival, overall survival, feasibility of the protocol, length of stay, variation of the functional reserve after the preoperative chemotherapy (defined by the VO<sub>2peak</sub>, ventilatory threshold and 6-min walk test), preoperative and postoperative nutritional status, preoperative anxiety, quality of life, 30-day and 90-day mortality and cumulative dose of cytotoxic treatment received.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study was approved by an independent medical ethics committee (IRB00008526, CPP Sud-Est VI, Clermont-Ferrand, France) and by the competent French authority (ANSM, Saint Denis, France) and registered on <italic>Clinicaltrial.gov</italic>.

The efficacy of this strategy has been demonstrated in two randomised studies.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> It reduces tumour size before surgery, treats micrometastases and evaluates chemosensitivity. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were significantly improved with perioperative chemotherapy compared to surgery alone. However, the limitation of these studies is that among all patients requiring chemotherapy, almost 70% of patients did not receive the complete sequence. This sequence is defined by the administration of two to four cycles before and two to four cycles after the surgery, according to the protocol. The major cause of absence or impossibility of realisation of postoperative chemotherapy was the presence of postoperative complication, postoperative serious asthenia and impaired nutritional and physical status.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Poor physical condition assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing, reflecting a reduced physiological reserve, is predictive of postoperative complications.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Physical training, even during a short period and on a various population, is beneficial in improving physical condition, cardiopulmonary function and muscular mass of the patient.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;8</xref> Prehabilitation over a 6-week period between pre-surgical clinic appointment and surgery decreases postoperative morbidity and the hospital stay in cardiovascular surgery, but no study has ever been performed in patients presenting with gastric or oesophageal cancer.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref></p><p>Prehabilitation revolves around three axes: (1) physical training based on initial cardiopulmonary exercise testing (VO<sub>2peak</sub>, ventilatory threshold (VT) and 6&#x02005;min walk test (6MWT)), three times by week, supervised by a physical therapist; (2) nutritional care to ensure the compliance of the nutrition programme and adapt the nutritional management based on protein and energy needs and on the level of spontaneous oral intake; and (3) psychological treatment by a psychologist to reduce preoperative anxiety. To the best of our knowledge, no study has ever focused on gastro-oesophageal cancer. The benefit of prehabilitation in this cancer may be particularly important because (1) this surgery is associated with a high 90-day morbidity (40%, especially respiratory) and 90-day mortality (5%), (2) the physical and nutritional status of these patients is often precarious (cancer cachexia, gastro-oesophageal obstruction) and (3) the need to preoperative chemotherapy declines physical reserves and is associated with a lengthening of the time between presurgery clinic appointment and surgery of more than 3&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Also, we hypothesise that, in this parallel and non-inferiority study, a physical training, personalised nutritional support and psychologist global management would results in an increase of numbers of patients receiving their full cancer treatment, by a decrease of postoperative complications and an increase of postoperative nutritional status. The aim of this study was to compare the percentage of patients reaching the complete oncological treatment previously decided in a multidisciplinary tumour board in the group with prehabilitation to the group with conventional care, in patients with gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study setting</title><p>The present study is a prospective, randomised, controlled, open and multicentric phase III trial that compares prehabilitation (Prehab group) versus conventional care (control group) in patients presenting with gastric and low oesophageal adenocarcinoma, treated by perioperative chemotherapy.

Patients cannot be included in the study for one of the following criteria: &#x0003c;18&#x02005;years of age, need for radiochemotherapy, treated for another cancer within 5&#x02005;years, except basal cell skin carcinoma or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, presenting with cognitive disorders or major disability making impossible to understand the study and sign the informed consent, or being breastfeeding or pregnant. Finally, patients already included in another clinical trial, or estimated by the investigator to not be able to be compliant with the criteria of the study, or with legal incapacity (person deprived of liberty or subject under guardianship) will not be enrolled in this study. Guidelines regarding stopping participation are: withdrawal of patient consent, non-compliance of the patient, adverse event and by decision of the investigator. In case of withdrawal from the study, the patient will be followed up and managed normally in the digestive surgery department. The exclusion period during which the patient cannot participate in another clinical trial is 15&#x02005;days before inclusion and 0&#x02005;days after the end of the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Interventions</title><p>After the first visit to his surgeon, the patient will be presented to the multidisciplinary tumour board to validate the inclusion criteria and to schedule the number of cycles of preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy. After this step, a second consultation with the surgeon will take place to verify all inclusion and exclusion criteria and perform the randomisation. For the two groups, an initial (before chemotherapy) and final (1-week before the surgery) evaluation will be performed. The evaluation includes an exercise capacity evaluation by (1) an incremental symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test on a cycloergometer according to international recommendations in order to determine the VO<sub>2peak</sub>, and the ventilator threshold (VT) and (2) a 6&#x02005;min walk distance (6MWT) performed according to the ATS recommendations.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

Patients will be recruited, treated and followed up at the digestive surgery department of the University Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand (France), Lille (France), Lyon (France) and Rennes (France). Then, the multidisciplinary tumour board will check all the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the PREHAB trial will be proposed by surgeons to patients with gastric or oesophageal adenocarcinoma and with concomitant perioperative chemotherapy. Patients will be informed of the trial protocol and, on acceptance, will be randomised in the &#x02018;Prehab&#x02019; group or the control group by the surgeon or the oncologist. Randomisation will be carried out using a dedicated centralised telephone system and accessible round the clock. The randomisation sequence will be generated by a biostatistician using random blocks and stratification as a function of the centres and type of cancer (&#x00153;sophagus or stomach). The trial will be open blinded because of the procedures employed and with an objective primary end point. The patient will be informed of the randomisation arm throughout the trial. The only criteria, which will be recorded, to discontinue or, or modifying allocated interventions for a given trial participant is the participant request.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical considerations</title><sec id="s2f1"><title>Estimation of sample size</title><p>According to previous works, we estimated the percentage of patients in each group, realising the full perioperative oncological treatment around 30%.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> A sample size of 56 patients by randomised group would provide 90% statistical power to detect an absolute difference of 30% (30% vs 60%) for a two-sided &#x003b1; level of 0.05. Finally, a total of 60 patients by group will be considered. An interim analysis is planned after enrolment of the first 60 patients using the Lan and DeMets, O'Brien-Fleming method (East software, Cytel, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA). The type I error is fixed at 0.003 for this interim analysis. The time schedule of enrolment has been estimated at 18&#x02005;months.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis will be conducted on intention to treat (ITT) using the Stata software, V.13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). A two-sided p value of &#x0003c;0.05 will be considered to indicate statistical significance (except interim analysis). Baseline characteristics will be presented for each randomised group as the mean&#x000b1;SD or the median (IQR) according to the statistical distribution for continuous data, and as the number of patients and associated percentages for categorical parameters. Comparisons between independent groups will be analysed using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for categorical variables (notably unplanned readmission and primary outcome: percentage of patients realising the full perioperative oncological treatment) and Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney&#x02019;s test for quantitative parameters (notably weight loss, body mass index, albumin, body impedance, length of stay, VO<sub>2peak</sub>, VT, 6MWT, depressive and anxious symptoms evaluated using HADS, quality of Life according to EQ-5D). Normality will be studied by the Shapiro-Wilk test and homoscedasticity using the Fisher-Snedecor test. The analysis of the primary outcome will be complemented by multivariate analysis using the generalised linear mixed model (logistic for a dichotomous dependent variable) to take into account (1) fixed effects covariates retained according to univariate analysis results and clinical relevance and (2) random effects (between and within centre and surgeon variabilities). Censored data such as OS or event-free survival will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared (1) by log-rank test in univariate situation and (2) using the Cox proportional hazard model in the multivariate context. Regarding the analysis of repeated-measures, random-effect models (linear or generalised linear) will be considered to study the fixed-effects group, time-points evaluation and interaction &#x02018;group&#x000d7; time&#x02019;, taking into account between-participant and within-participant variability.</p><p>In the prehab group, a dose&#x02013;response study will be proposed to assess (1) the impact of the number of prehabilitation sessions really realised and (2) the compliance prehabilitation care (dietary and nutritional management). Particular focus will be placed on loss to follow-up. A study with the abandonment considered as censored data will be proposed using the Kaplan-Meier estimation. If the frequency of missing data is &#x0003e;5%, we will perform additional analyses using imputation methods.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Approval</title><p>In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and French regulations on clinical trials, the study was presented to an independent ethics committee, the &#x02018;Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes Sud Est 6&#x02019; (reference: AU1228, IRB00008526, Clermont-Ferrand, France).
