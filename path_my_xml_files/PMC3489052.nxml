This effect may be used to reduce workload on the heart and hence oxygen demands, so that the drug is indicated for secondary prevention of myocardial infarction, adjunctive therapy in patients with stable chronic heart failure, and for the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dddt-6-311">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dddt-6-311">2</xref> In addition, &#x003b2;1-selective blockers prevent the release of renin, a hormone produced by the kidneys that causes constriction of blood vessels. Receptor selectivity decreases with daily doses of 20 mg or greater, at which bisoprolol works against &#x003b2;2-adrenergic receptors of the lungs and vascular smooth muscle. Unlike propranolol and pindolol, bisoprolol does not exhibit membrane-stabilizing or sympathomimetic activity. Bisoprolol possesses a single chiral center and is administered as a racemic mixture. Only the <italic>S</italic>(&#x02212;) enantiomer exhibits significant &#x003b2;-blocking activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dddt-6-311">1</xref> In oral formulations, bisoprolol, which has a structural formula described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dddt-6-311">Figure 1</xref>, is given as bisoprolol fumarate or bisoprolol hemifumarate ([C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>31</sub>NO<sub>4</sub>]<sub>2</sub> &#x000b7; C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, molecular weight of 766.98).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-dddt-6-311">3</xref></p><p>Following oral administration, bisoprolol is almost completely absorbed and undergoes minimal first-pass metabolism (less than 20%), resulting in an oral biovailability of about 90%. The plasma protein binding is approximately 30%, with distribution volume of 3.5 L/kg. Mean peak plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) values range from 16 ng/mL at 5 mg doses to 70 ng/mL at 20 mg doses; this occurs within 2&#x02013;4 hours with 5&#x02013;20 mg dose of bisoprolol fumarate. The plasma elimination half-life (t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub>) is 9&#x02013;12 hours, resulting in a 24-hour duration of action after once-daily dosing. The kinetics of bisoprolol are linear and independent of age. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of the two enantiomers are similar. Bisoprolol is excreted by renal and nonrenal pathways, of which 50% is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 in liver to three inactive metabolites. Metabolism of the drug by CYP2D6 is not clinically significant. The known metabolites are labile and have no known pharmacologic activity. Approximately half of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the feces.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dddt-6-311">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-dddt-6-311">3</xref></p><p>The present study evaluated the bioavailability of two different oral bisoprolol film-coated tablet formulations following single dosing in healthy adult subjects in order to prove the bioequivalence between both preparations.

In the morning (approximately 6 am) of the dosing day (day 1), after an overnight fast, a predose pharmacokinetic blood sample was taken. Right afterwards, the study drug (one film-coated tablet of the test drug or the reference drug) was given at 7 am with 200 mL water.</p><p>The date and the time of taking each sample were recorded. Lunch and dinner were provided 4 hours and 10 hours after drug administration, respectively. The amount of food and water intake and physical activity for each individual subject were standardized during the sampling days. Xanthine-containing food or beverages and fruit juices were not allowed for 24 hours before and during the entire sampling days.</p><p>From each subject, venous blood samples (10 mL) were drawn immediately before taking the drug (control), and 5 mL each at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hours after dosing. One week after the first dosing (ie, washout period), the same procedure was repeated with the alternate drug. The blood samples collected at each time point from all subjects were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 minutes to separate the plasma, and then the plasma was transferred to a clean tube. All plasma samples were stored at &#x02264;&#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until assayed.
