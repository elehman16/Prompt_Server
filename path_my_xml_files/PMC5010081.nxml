This post hoc analysis aimed to determine if an individual&#x02019;s reversibility, when treated as a continuous variable, could predict his/her future response to two short-acting bronchodilators: albuterol and ipratropium. The analysis was completed using data from a 4-week, randomized, open-label, two-period crossover study (NCT01691482; GSK study DB2114956). Patients received albuterol (doses: UK =4&#x000d7;100 &#x003bc;g/puff; US =4&#x000d7;90 &#x003bc;g/puff) followed 1 hour later by ipratropium (4&#x000d7;20 &#x003bc;g/puff) or vice versa during treatment Period 1. The order of treatments was reversed during Period 2. Predefined efficacy end points included pre- and post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second. The correlation coefficient between bronchodilator response on Days 1 and 10 was investigated, as well as the correlation between treatment response on Day 1 and the mean treatment response on Days 5&#x02013;10, for each individual patient. Bronchodilator response to albuterol on Day 1 was strongly correlated with that on Day 10 (<italic>r</italic>=0.64; n=53). The correlation coefficient of bronchodilator treatment response on Day 1 and Days 5&#x02013;10 was 0.78 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001; n=53) and 0.76 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001; n=54) for albuterol and ipratropium, respectively. A single measurement of the initial bronchodilator response to albuterol or ipratropium was, therefore, highly correlated with the subsequent mean bronchodilator response over 5&#x02013;10 days, demonstrating its potential usefulness for future treatment decisions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>bronchodilator

bronchodilator reversibility should not be included in diagnostic criteria for COPD.<xref rid="b2-copd-11-2035" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, bronchodilator reversibility is still measured in many research studies and clinical trials to characterize patients, and is used routinely in clinical practice as the post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> is used for diagnosis of COPD.<xref

Initial exploratory post hoc analyses examined the correlation coefficient of FEV<sub>1</sub> response between Day 1 and Day 10. The mean within-patient difference in FEV<sub>1</sub> response (including the proportion of patients exhibiting differences of &#x0003c;100, &#x02265;100 to &#x0003c;150, &#x02265;150 to &#x0003c;200, and &#x02265;200 mL) between these days was also calculated. The correlation coefficient of bronchodilator treatment response on Day 1 and the mean treatment response on Days 5&#x02013;10, for each individual patient, were also investigated. Additional post hoc analyses included the following: 1) the correlation coefficient of the mean treatment response for Days 1&#x02013;2 and Days 1&#x02013;3 with the mean response during Days 5&#x02013;10, for each individual patient; and 2) the stability of each individual patient&#x02019;s status as reversible or nonreversible on Day 1 compared with Day 10. Reversibility was defined as an increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> of &#x02265;12% and &#x02265;200 mL following administration of albuterol or ipratropium.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Time-dependent bronchodilator responses to albuterol or ipratropium were assessed by correlation coefficient analyses. The pairwise linear correlation coefficients of FEV<sub>1</sub> at pre-dose (0 hour) and 1 hour post-dose were computed by treatment and by day to assess the individual effect of albuterol or ipratropium over time. These post hoc analyses did not take study period into consideration.</p><p>The overall analysis population was defined as all patients who were randomized and completed pre- and post-bronchodilator assessments for at least 17 visits, with no more than 3 consecutive missing days.

One patient in the intent-to-treat population was excluded from the efficacy population due to missing study visits for more than 3 consecutive days; therefore, data from 55 patients were analyzed. Baseline characteristics of the patients have been previously published.<xref rid="b14-copd-11-2035" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Briefly, patients had a mean age of 60.3 years (standard deviation [SD]: 7.42 years) and a mean predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> post-albuterol at screening of 51.33% (SD: 9.87%). The mean FEV<sub>1</sub> reversibility at the screening visit was 193 mL (SD: 188 mL), and the mean percentage reversibility was 19.54% (SD: 17.39%). Twenty-six (46%) patients were considered reversible (defined as an increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> of &#x02265;12% and &#x02265;200 mL following administration of albuterol) at screening, and 30 (54%) were nonreversible.</p><p>The correlation coefficient of individual bronchodilator treatment response (change in FEV<sub>1</sub> from 0 to 1 hour post-dose) to albuterol on Day 1 with that on Day 10 was 0.64 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-copd-11-2035">Figure 1</xref>). The mean response to albuterol was 261 mL on Day 1 and 237 mL on Day 10, with a mean within-patient difference (Day 1 vs Day 10) of 47 mL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-copd-11-2035">Table 1</xref>). The mean response to ipratropium was 253 mL on Day 1 and 241 mL on Day 10, with a mean within-patient difference (Day 1 vs Day 10) of 27 mL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-copd-11-2035">Table 1</xref>). There was wide variability in the mean FEV<sub>1</sub> responses to both treatments, as demonstrated by the associated SD values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-copd-11-2035">Table 1</xref>). Out of 53 patients who received albuterol on Day 1 and Day 10, 31 (58%) had a response to albuterol on Day 10 that was &#x0003c;100 mL different to their response on Day 1; a similar proportion of patients (n=28; 52%) met this criterion for ipratropium at Day 10 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-copd-11-2035">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The correlation coefficient of bronchodilator treatment response on Day 1 and the mean of Days 5&#x02013;10 was 0.78 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and 0.76 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) for albuterol and ipratropium, respectively. The correlation coefficient of bronchodilator treatment response over the means of Days 1&#x02013;2 (0.85 and 0.81 for albuterol and ipratropium, respectively) and Days 1&#x02013;3 (0.88 and 0.84) with the means of Days 5&#x02013;10 increased (compared with Day 1 and Days 5&#x02013;10) for both bronchodilators.</p><p>At Day 10, 42 out of 53 (79%) patients receiving albuterol had not changed their reversibility status (defined as an increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> of &#x02265;12% and &#x02265;200 mL following administration of albuterol or ipratropium) from Day 1 (reversible at both days: n=24 [45%]; nonreversible at both days: n=18 [34%]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-copd-11-2035">Figure 2</xref>). For ipratropium, at Day 10, 37 out of 54 (69%) patients had not changed their status from Day 1 (reversible at both days: n=25 [46%]; nonreversible at both days: n=12 [22%]). Patients who had a change in reversibility status tended to have FEV<sub>1</sub> values clustered around the cut-off point used to define reversibility in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-copd-11-2035">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>There was substantial variability of the FEV<sub>1</sub> response to albuterol and ipratropium between patients. However, the mean within-patient difference in response to albuterol or ipratropium between Days 1 and 10 was relatively small: 47 mL and 27 mL, respectively. The bronchodilator response on Day 1 showed a good correlation with the response on Day 10 (<italic>r</italic>=0.64) which improved when the average response on subsequent occasions (Days 5&#x02013;10) was used. Overall, these results suggest that the short-term repeatability of bronchodilator reversibility tests is generally good with stable responses being observed for most measurements. This was supported by the observation that the majority of patients did not change reversibility status between Day 1 and Day 10.</p><p>As might be expected, those patients who changed reversibility status in this study had values clustered around the binary cut-off point for reversibility. Previous studies have reported varying proportions of patients changing reversibility status, dependent on the criteria employed: 75%&#x02013;79% by Hanania et al,<xref rid="b6-copd-11-2035" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> 38% and 52% by Calverley et al,<xref rid="b9-copd-11-2035" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and 11% and 18% by Albert et al.<xref rid="b12-copd-11-2035" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The different proportions reported across these studies could be due to a variety of factors, including the exclusion of patients with a higher magnitude of response,<xref rid="b9-copd-11-2035" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> the use of different cut-off points,<xref rid="b6-copd-11-2035" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b9-copd-11-2035" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> the use of long-acting bronchodilators within the trials, and potential variability due to spirometric procedures between centers. In order to limit any spirometric measurement variations, this study was conducted in two centers specializing in spirometric measurements.</p><p>The issues with selecting a cut-off point can be illustrated with the data from a large study.<xref rid="b11-copd-11-2035" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In this study, the mean response in FEV<sub>1</sub> to albuterol was 164&#x02013;177 mL but with SD values of 138&#x02013;150 mL. This implied that 68% of patients (the percent of patients in any normal population who are within one SD of the mean<xref rid="b15-copd-11-2035" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) were &#x0003c;138&#x02013;150 mL from the mean response.<xref rid="b11-copd-11-2035" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> It should therefore be no surprise that a large number of patients when retested would cross any arbitrary boundary (eg, 200 mL) near the mean value of this distribution due solely to the error inherent in the measurement of FEV<sub>1</sub>. Three previous studies that tested different cut-off points for bronchodilator response found that all criteria produced inconsistent results.<xref rid="b6-copd-11-2035" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b9-copd-11-2035" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b12-copd-11-2035" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Consequently, the Global initiative of chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines no longer recommend the use of reversibility for diagnosis of COPD or for prediction of future clinical outcomes.<xref rid="b2-copd-11-2035" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> As our study results support the findings of Calverley et al,<xref rid="b9-copd-11-2035" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> we suggest that future studies investigating the association of bronchodilator response with clinical outcomes should include bronchodilator response as a continuous, not dichotomized, variable.</p><p>This study had limitations. It was a post hoc analysis of data from an exploratory study, and as such should be treated with a degree of caution, but given that the correlations seen were statistically significant to a very high degree and other components of the analysis were purely descriptive, the findings warrant consideration and further investigation. A drawback of the study was its short duration. Long-term studies are required to determine if these findings are transferable over longer time frames.</p><p>Overall, we believe our study shows that bronchodilator responsiveness is a consistent variable within an individual patient over the short term, but highly variable between patients. With the measurement error inherent in spirometry in routine clinical practice, or even across multiple centers in large studies, we are cautious of suggesting that measuring a spirometric response may predict an individual&#x02019;s likelihood of achieving sustained benefit from bronchodilators. However, the results presented in this study do suggest that accurate measures of bronchodilation may be able to predict future response at the individual level over the short term.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1-copd-11-2035"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of the study design.</p><p><bold>Notes:</bold> *Drugs administered immediately after spirometry.
