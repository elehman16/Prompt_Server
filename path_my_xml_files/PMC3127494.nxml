Thus GFOBT has low sensitivity for advanced neoplasia of around 20% and as low as 13% in one study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C9">9</xref></sup> and in clinical trials half of cancers are missed by biennial stool testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C10">10</xref></sup> The chance of an individual benefiting from screening through prevention of death from CRC is estimated at 1 in 862.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C11">11</xref></sup> No overall mortality advantage has been shown in those screened, and is unlikely to be, as the screening trials target a disease that contributes a lifetime risk of only 3% to all-cause mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C11">11</xref></sup> and screening seeks only to reduce this risk in those already with precursor lesions or cancer arising in the screened age group. Assuming no untoward consequences of the screening intervention, this amounts to less than 1/2% mortality reduction (16% of 3%). No study has been powered to detect such small reductions in mortality. Furthermore the risk of a serious adverse effect such as haemorrhage or perforation in those undergoing colonoscopy, of whom only 10% will have cancer, is around 1 in 150.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C13">13</xref></sup> The current advice leaflet inviting UK subjects to partake in the CRC screening programme focuses on population benefit but does not place CRC mortality in the context of all-cause mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C12">12</xref></sup> and the absence of this and other patient-focused data lays the CRC programme open to the same adverse publicity surrounding the UK breast cancer screening programme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C14">14</xref></sup> A Cochrane review of trials of decision aids showed that decision aids enhanced risk perceptions and the effect was stronger when probabilities were expressed quantitatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C15">15</xref></sup> In this study we have compared the attitudes to screening of a control cohort, given the standard NHS information leaflet, to the attitudes of an intervention group given the same information leaflet but enhanced with numerical data expressed in natural frequency format, percentages, information on prolongation of life and pictograms all aimed at the risks and benefits to the individual rather than the population as it is on the individual that the burden of decision-making falls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s3"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>The study was conducted in 2008 shortly before the introduction of CRC screening in our area. Subjects were recruited from patients between the age of 60 and 69 attending non-gastroenterology hospital medical clinics and patients attending two GP surgeries. Subjects were excluded if they presented with or had gastroenterological problems, had previous colon cancer, terminal or advanced disease with limited life expectancy, or previously had a colonoscopy.</p><p>Those consenting to take part were randomized to receive one of two information packs using computer-generated pseudo-random numbers, uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 with allocation determined by whether the number was less than or greater than 0.5. Information packs were concealed in these randomly numbered plain envelopes with researchers and study coordinators blinded to their contents. The control group received the standard NHS information leaflet given to subjects invited to take part in CRC screening including the six summary points contained in the leaflet (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="SHORTS-11-030F1">1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C12">12</xref></sup> The intervention group were given the same information but with the summary points augmented with numerical information taken from the four randomized studies of CRC screening and a meta-analysis of all studies (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="SHORTS-11-030F2">2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C11">11</xref></sup> and supplemented with pictorial information to illustrate three of the six summary points. The enhanced information pack was based on Paling's risk charts and was tested and refined on a group of 30 subjects before starting the trial. A format of events per 10,000 subjects was used to illustrate with the same denominator low frequency events such as complications of colonoscopy and high frequency events such as overall mortality at 12 years. The intervention pack contained two additional numerical facts not present in the summary of the standard pack: (1) &#x02018;nine out of ten patients with positive occult blood tests do not have cancer&#x02019;; and (2) &#x02018;screening does not affect overall mortality&#x02019;. The overall mortality figures were illustrated with a pictogram (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="SHORTS-11-030F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="SHORTS-11-030F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Information shown to the control group, as in the standard NHS information pack</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SHORTS-11-03001"/></fig><p>Subjects were asked to read the information leaflets at home and return a questionnaire asking, on the basis of the information received, whether or not they would wish to be screened for CRC and which of the summary points had most influenced their decision. For each summary point subjects were asked whether this made them: &#x02018;definitely want to be screened&#x02019;; &#x02018;want to be screened&#x02019;; &#x02018;not want to be screened&#x02019;; or &#x02018;definitely not want to be screened&#x02019;. Free-text comments were invited. The questionnaire included questions on demographic data and co-morbidities and subjects were asked their attitude to screening in general. Those failing to return questionnaires within three weeks were sent one reminder.</p><p>One-quarter of subjects returning their questionnaire were chosen at random to be interviewed by telephone. The interviewer went through the questionnaire point by point, grading for each point whether that points had been understood fully, partially or not at all. In addition, control subjects were given by telephone the same numerical information that had been given to the intervention group and asked whether having these figures at the onset would have helped their decision-making process or altered their final decision.</p><p>We had assumed that, as in national studies, there would be a 50% acceptance of screening and so would need 120 subjects in each group to give an 85% probability of detecting a 20% difference between the two groups, with a two-sided test at the 5% level. Statistical analysis of differences between proportions was carried out using the two-tailed chi-squared test without the Yates correction.

Thus a significant difference in impact of the summary points was seen when numerical information was given; in four of the summary points moving subjects away from screening and in one point towards screening. Seventy-three percent of those interviewed by telephone in the control group felt the numerical information given to the intervention group would have been useful and would have aided their decision-making and over half of the intervention group found the pictograms very or quite helpful.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title><p>There are possible caveats surrounding this study. First, the increased number of subjects in the intervention group with a family history of bowel cancer could have biased the intervention group towards screening and so lessened the potential negative impact of the numerical information they were given. Excluding all patients with a family history of CRC reduced the percentage wishing to be screened to 90.1% in the control group and 80.1% in the intervention group but the difference between control and intervention groups did not reach statistical significance (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 3.84, <italic>P</italic> = 0.05). Second, although not significant, there was a trend to increased co-morbidity in the control group which could have affected their attitude to screening and without a larger sample size we cannot exclude this possibility. Finally, we chose to recruit our subjects from non-gastroenterological hospital outpatient clinics and GP surgeries. These subjects may already be health-seekers and more likely to be in favour of screening and therefore may not be representative of all 60&#x02013;70-year-olds. Nevertheless the comparison between the two groups stands and many 60&#x02013;70-year-olds do attend clinics regularly.</p><p>The meta-analysis of CRC screening by Moayyedi showed the relative risk of non-CRC death in the screened group to be 1.02 (1.00&#x02013;1.04, <italic>P</italic> = 0.015),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C11">11</xref></sup> this increase exactly balancing the reduced risk of CRC death in the screened group. &#x02018;Mortality substitution&#x02019; in the screened group was also supported by Whynes <italic>et al.</italic> in their analysis of deaths in the Nottingham Trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C16">16</xref></sup> Furthermore Moayyedi's meta-analysis found 16% of those in whom cancer was diagnosed by screening died within 2 years of unrelated causes or postoperative complications and so may have been disadvantaged by earlier diagnosis. We were surprised that including data on all cause mortality in our study was not viewed negatively; indeed 68% said this numerical information still made them want to be screened. Fear of mortality from a specific illness or event, particularly cancer, may be a stronger drive to screening than concern about all-cause mortality or mortality from non-specified events.</p></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies</title><p>The recent study by Smith <italic>et al.</italic> on the use of decision aids in CRC screening has also made use of natural frequencies and diagrams.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C17">17</xref></sup> They showed a reduction in screening participation in the intervention group, but their study differs from ours in that its focus was on adults with low education and literacy standards and subjects were not given figures on all cause mortality. Our study suggests that all-cause mortality figures need not be withheld from information leaflets for fear of reducing uptake of CRC in the community.</p><p>The number wishing to be screened in our control group (85%) is higher than the figure of 56% presenting for screening in the first round of the UK CRC programme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C18">18</xref></sup> However the figure of 56% for uptake of CRC screening matches our questionnaire return rate of 54%. We speculate that those returning questionnaires on CRC screening may be those who would be more likely to comply with real-life screening programmes. This is supported in our study by the 83% returning the questionnaire who said they were generally positive about screening with only 2.7% overall against screening (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="SHORTS-11-030TB1">1</xref>) and 95.4% said they &#x02018;attend their GP surgery for &#x0201c;check-ups&#x0201d; when invited&#x02019;. An alternative explanation is that subjects faced with a hypothetical questionnaire respond more positively than when faced with the reality of obtaining and testing their own stool and the anxiety of dealing with a possible positive result.</p></sec><sec id="s5d"><title>Meaning of the study: possible mechanisms and implications for clinicians or policymakers</title><p>The difficult question is how best to frame the numerical information on screening. Natural frequencies, as used in our study, and absolute risk reduction are of relevance to the individual and should be used in preference to relative risk reduction and population-based figures as it is the individual not the population that must decide whether to be screened.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C19">19</xref></sup> In their review, Edwards <italic>et al.</italic> suggest that providing visual aids and graphically representing information increase the effectiveness of risk communication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C20">20</xref></sup> We chose to illustrate numerical facts using pictograms based on Paling's risk charts and have used events per 10,000 so that all events can be viewed against a common denominator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C1">1</xref></sup> Can we be sure even so that the subjects understood the information presented? In the intervention group all but one subject had full understanding of the numerical information and pictograms when interviewed by telephone and Smith's study shows that even in those with low education and literacy standards the use of pictograms and numerical data improved understanding. Sixty-two percent of our group found the pictograms helpful or very helpful. Their wider use in a standardized format may allow easier quantification of risk/benefit for this as well as other health interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C21">21</xref></sup></p><p>Our study shows that the provision of numerical data is welcomed and aids informed decision without any overall impact on attitude to screening. Similar results were seen in a study by Mathieu <italic>et al.</italic> with visual decision aids to help decision-making for breast cancer screening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C22">22</xref></sup> Even if such data reduce uptake of screening they should be included according to J&#x000f8;rgensen, and rightly so, because concern for uptake should never overrule concern for informed consent. This contrasts with the view of the director of the NHS cancer screening programme who responded to a call to include numerical data in the breast cancer screening leaflet by saying: &#x02018;putting too much numerical information meant women just put the leaflet down&#x02019;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C23">23</xref></sup></p><p>All screening programmes carry a side-effect burden of over-diagnosis and increased levels of anxiety. An invitation for faecal occult blood testing itself causes anxiety in 50% of subjects which is severe in 5% even in those not called for colonoscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C24">24</xref></sup> and in the CRC programme there are the potential risks and discomfort of bowel preparation and colonoscopy in those with positive faecal occult blood tests. The standard CRC leaflet does give numbers for colonoscopy complications which in terms of total numbers in the screened population are small but not insignificant to those needing colonoscopy. However the leaflet gives little other patient-focused figures and in particular no mention of lack of overall mortality benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C12">12</xref></sup> Those responsible for promoting screening programmes are currently those who provide the information to subjects and, as emphasized by J&#x000f8;rgensen, therein lies a conflict of interest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="SHORTS-11-030C14">14</xref></sup> High participation rates are essential to ensure the population benefits of screening. Information on the small absolute risk reduction achieved by screening and the lack of evidence of overall mortality reduction could deter subjects from participating. Our study shows that this may not be the case. The numerical and pictorial information was welcomed by most subjects and had no overall effect on their desire to be screened.</p><p>In conclusion, our study suggests that providing numerical information, enhanced pictorially, and focusing on the individual's risks and benefits could enhance the credibility of the screening programme without reducing the numbers screened.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>DECLARATIONS</title><sec id="s6a"><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared</p></sec><sec id="s6b"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded using the County Durham and Darlington Hospitals Foundation Trusts Gastroenterology Research Fund, account number 4037 Eros code CF 9121.
