This observer-blind, randomized Phase III trial assessed the immunogenicity and safety of the MF59-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine FLUAD&#x000ae; (aTIV) and a non-adjuvanted TIV, in healthy children (aged 6 to &#x0003c;72&#x000a0;months) from 3 centers in Mexico, during the 2014&#x02013;2015 season. The primary objectives were to assess the non-inferiority of aTIV to TIV, measured by geometric mean titers (GMTs), and the safety of aTIV and TIV. Seroconversion was one of several secondary objectives. In total, 287 children were enrolled. The non-inferiority criteria for GMTs and seroconversion were met for aTIV for all 3 vaccine strains. Lower bounds of the 95% confidence intervals for all 3 aTIV:TIV vaccine ratios were &#x0003e;2, showing that the immunogenicity of aTIV was superior to that of TIV for all 3 strains. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were experienced more frequently with aTIV than TIV by younger children (aged 6 to &#x0003c;36&#x000a0;months), but were more frequent with TIV than aTIV in older children (aged 36 to &#x0003c;72&#x000a0;months) who had been vaccinated previously. More unsolicited AEs were associated with aTIV than the TIV. All AEs were of mild or moderate severity. No deaths, serious AEs, or AEs leading to premature withdrawal were reported. Overall, aTIV was highly immunogenic and was well tolerated in healthy children 6 to &#x0003c;72&#x000a0;months of age. These results indicate that aTIV may be a beneficial addition to national pediatric vaccination programs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>adjuvant</kwd><kwd>immunogenicity</kwd><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>MF59</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd><kwd>trivalent influenza vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="6"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="29"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza is a serious disease as it can lead to severe morbidity and mortality in at-risk groups such as children.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Children experience the highest attack rates for influenza<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> and while infections can be self-limiting in many cases, the risk of hospitalization is increased in this population compared with healthy adults.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Children can also disseminate influenza in households and the community as they shed virus for longer periods than adults, leading to influenza infections in others, including those at-risk (e.g. older adults [aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years], those with co-morbidities, and younger children).<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3,4</sup></xref></p><p>Influenza was one of the top 10 causes of death in Mexico in 2014 and therefore it is considered a public health priority.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> In 2013, there were 4480 cases of confirmed influenza across all age groups, which led to 314 deaths, the majority of whom were vulnerable or at-risk.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> An assessment of those hospitalized for influenza-like illness in Mexico City confirmed influenza A/H3N2 and B in 25 and 29% respectively, of those aged &#x02264;18&#x000a0;years.

</p><p>At 21&#x000a0;days after the last vaccination, the seroconversion rate following vaccination with aTIV met the non-inferiority criteria for all 3 virus strains in the overall population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). When analyzed by age, the seroconversion rate was greater for aTIV than for TIV in all 3 groups, for all 3 strains. The difference between the 2 vaccines was particularly pronounced for the B strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0004">Table&#x000a0;4</xref>). The proportion of children achieving HI titers &#x02265;40, and the more stringent HI titer assessments, &#x02265;110, and &#x02265;330, 21&#x000a0;days after the last vaccination was higher for aTIV than for TIV, for all 3 virus strains and the 95% CIs did not overlap for the A(H1N1) and B strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). When immunogenicity for the aTIV was analyzed separately in children who were vaccine-na&#x000ef;ve (not received &#x02265;2 doses of seasonal influenza vaccine since 1 July 2010) and non-na&#x000ef;ve (received &#x02265;2 doses of seasonal influenza vaccine since 1 July 2010), vaccine status appeared to have little effect on the response for all 3 strains. GMTs for the aTIV were of a similar magnitude for the 2 groups, with larger geometric mean ratios (GMRs) for the vaccine-na&#x000ef;ve than for the non-na&#x000ef;ve group. For the aTIV, the proportion of children achieving HI titers &#x02265;40, &#x02265;110, and &#x02265;330 was also similar for vaccine-na&#x000ef;ve and non-na&#x000ef;ve, for all 3 strains and at all 3 thresholds. For the TIV, vaccine status did appear to influence GMTs as they were higher for the non-na&#x000ef;ve than for the na&#x000ef;ve group. GMRs varied by strain for the TIV; the GMR was larger for the non-na&#x000ef;ve than for the na&#x000ef;ve group for the A(H1N1) strain, while the reverse was true for the A(H3N2) strain. The GMRs were strain similar for the 2 groups for the B strain. For the TIV, the proportion of children achieving HI titers &#x02265;40, &#x02265;110, and &#x02265;330 was higher in the non-na&#x000ef;ve than in the na&#x000ef;ve group for all 3 strains. These differences were particularly pronounced at the highest threshold for A(H1N1) and A(H3N2).

In vaccine-na&#x000ef;ve children aged 6 to &#x0003c;36&#x000a0;months severe solicited systemic reactions were reported for 3 who received aTIV (irritability n = 1 and diarrhea n = 2) and 5 who received TIV (persistent crying, vomiting, diarrhea, all n = 1 and irritability n = 2). Severe solicited systemic reactions were reported for 2 non-na&#x000ef;ve children aged 36 to &#x0003c;72&#x000a0;months only (chills and myalgia, both n = 1) and both had received aTIV. No severe systemic reactions were reported for non-na&#x000ef;ve children aged 6 to &#x0003c;36&#x000a0;months or for vaccine-na&#x000ef;ve children aged 36 to &#x0003c;72&#x000a0;months.</p><p>The rate of unsolicited AEs reported for children (aged 6 to &#x0003c;72&#x000a0;months) was of a similar magnitude for aTIV and TIV, in both those who were vaccination-na&#x000ef;ve (45% and 38%, respectively) and those who were non-na&#x000ef;ve (14% and 9%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0006">Table&#x000a0;6</xref>). The most commonly reported unsolicited AE was nasopharyngitis for aTIV (22%) and pharyngitis (14%) for TIV, in vaccine-na&#x000ef;ve children. In non-na&#x000ef;ve children nasopharyngitis was the most commonly reported unsolicited AE for both aTIV and TIV (both 3%). The proportion of children that experienced medically attended AEs (MAAEs) was comparable between the vaccine groups for both the na&#x000ef;ve and non-na&#x000ef;ve groups, with far fewer being reported by non-na&#x000ef;ve children (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0006">Table&#x000a0;6</xref>).

The magnitude of the GMT ratios shows that the aTIV has a superior immune response than that of TIV against all 3 virus strains tested. These findings support those of previous studies of aTIV in children that have shown higher immune responses, compared with TIV.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11,12</sup></xref> These findings are unlikely to be due to differences between the 2 brands of vaccine as they contained the same antigens at the same concentrations and similar excipients, as well as being administered in the same way. Therefore, it is most likely to be the inclusion of the MF59 adjuvant in the vaccine that improved the immune response of the aTIV compared with the TIV.</p><p>While efficacy of the adjuvanted vaccine has been shown previously, with a relative efficacy versus TIV of 75% (95% CI: 55&#x02013;87)<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> the superiority of the adjuvanted vaccine over non-adjuvanted vaccines has not been demonstrated before. Although 2 previous studies assessing aTIV in young children have shown high immune responses, neither have shown superiority of aTIV over TIV.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11,12</sup></xref> One study<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> failed to meet the pre-specified criteria to show superiority, which required GMT and seroconversion rates to reach statistical significance: although the superiority criteria for GMT were met, those for seroconversion were not. The second study<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> could not demonstrate superiority as this was not prospectively included in the study design. Nonetheless, the consistently higher GMTs reported with aTIV in both studies, against both homologous and heterologous influenza strains, and the superior immunogenicity of aTIV compared with TIV in the present study underscore the immunologic benefit derived from the MF59 adjuvant.</p><p>In this study, HI titers were higher in the aTIV group than the TIV group, for &#x02265;40, &#x02265;110, and &#x02265;330 thresholds, and for all 3 strains. Assessment of HI titers &#x02265;110 and &#x02265;330 is important because the use of HI &#x02265;40 as a correlate of protection is based on studies in adults and has been shown to be inappropriate for evaluating responses in children, based on antibody titers against H3N2.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Antibody titers of &#x02265;110 for H3N2 have been shown to predict a 50% clinical protection rate, which is similar to the rate for titers of &#x02265;40 in adults. However, the &#x02265;330 cutoff was shown to predict an 80% clinical protection rate for H3N2, which may offer a public health benefit.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref></p><p>The robust immunogenicity demonstrated by the aTIV is important for the pediatric population as children tend to have a poor response to non-adjuvanted TIV while experiencing the highest attack rates for influenza and a high burden of morbidity.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,4</sup></xref> In Mexico, the H1N1 and H3N2 strains are known to be endemic and were identified as the predominant circulating strains during the 2013&#x02013;2014 winter.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Furthermore, a recent sero-analysis has shown that, despite high transmission rates of A(H1N1) during the 2009 pandemic in Mexico, a large proportion of the population, including children, have no or low levels of A(H1N1)pdm09 neutralizing antibodies, and so they remain susceptible to infection.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Together these findings illustrate the need for a vaccine that induces a strong immune response in children. In Mexico, the influenza vaccination program is based on the use of TIVs, therefore the aTIV assessed in this study may be a useful addition as it has shown superior immunogenicity to a TIV.</p><p>Cross-reactive immune responses can also be beneficial in children when vaccine strains and circulating viruses are mismatched. Heterologous responses were not assessed in the study reported here, but it is highly likely that the pattern of increased cross-reactive responses elicited by the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine, as reported in other prior pediatric studies,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11,12</sup></xref> could also have occurred in the children included in this study.</p><p>The results from this study show that the aTIV was well tolerated, supporting inclusion of this vaccine in pediatric seasonal influenza vaccination programs. The proportions of children experiencing solicited AEs were higher for aTIV than they were for TIV, but no AEs led to withdrawal from the study.

The study is small and there were few older children (aged 36&#x02013;&#x0003c;72&#x000a0;months) in the vaccine-na&#x000ef;ve group, making sub-analyses of this population challenging. However, this is to be expected as most children will have received at least 1 vaccination by this age, and so it is reflective of the prevailing clinical practice. In addition, many children were excluded from immunogenicity study analyses owing to non-compliance with the blood draw schedule. This non-compliance was an unavoidable consequence of a concurrent national vaccination campaign, which was initiated by the government after more than half the subjects in this study had been enrolled. Assessment of the immune responses against heterologous strains in this population would also have provided useful additional data describing the breadth of immunogenicity of these vaccines. One strength of this study is that the inclusion and analysis of both vaccine-na&#x000ef;ve and non-na&#x000ef;ve children makes it more reflective of actual clinical practice. The randomized, controlled, observer-blind design of the study has allowed robust analysis of the data and hence clear conclusions to be drawn.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s0004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The aTIV was highly immunogenic and well tolerated in healthy children in Mexico.

Seroconversion was defined as HI &#x02265;40 subject with a pre-vaccination HI titer &#x0003c;10; a minimum 4-fold increase HI titer for children with a pre-vaccination HI titer &#x02265;10, on Day 22 for non-na&#x000ef;ve children or Day 50 for na&#x000ef;ve children.

Non-inferiority of seroconversion for aTIV compared with TIV would be shown if the lower limit of the 95% CI around the difference in seroconversion rates between aTIV and TIV was higher than &#x02212;10%. If non-inferiority of GMT ratios 21&#x000a0;days after the last vaccination was demonstrated, then &#x0201c;higher non-inferiority&#x0201d;/superiority was tested. The superiority margin would be increased by 0.01 unit (on the log scale) and superiority would be demonstrated if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI was at least equal to the margin. Sample size was calculated based on data from previous studies. A single test with 126 children in each vaccine group has a power of 92% for H1N1 and &#x0003e;99% for H3N2 and B strains.
