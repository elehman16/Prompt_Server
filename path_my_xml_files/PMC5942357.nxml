delivery is an attractive route by which to deliver drugs to lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). GSK3008348 is a potent and selective small molecule being developed as the first inhaled inhibitor of the &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;6 integrin for the treatment of IPF. The phase 1 first-time-in-human clinical trial (NCT02612051) presented here was designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of single doses of GSK3008348 in healthy participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Single ascending doses of GSK3008348 were administered to three cohorts of eight healthy participants in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-period crossover design. Safety, tolerability and PK were assessed after single doses of 1&#x02013;3000&#x000a0;mcg given by nebulisation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">A total of 29 participants were enrolled and received at least one dose of study treatment. There were no serious adverse events (AE) reported in any participant. No trends or clinically important differences were noted in the incidence or intensity of AEs or other safety assessments. Maximum plasma concentrations of GSK3008348 were generally attained within approximately 30&#x000a0;min after start of nebulisation, with geometric mean terminal elimination half-lives ranging from 7.95 to 10.2&#x000a0;h. Exposures, as measured by area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), were dose proportional across all doses where estimates were possible (100&#x02013;3000&#x000a0;mcg). Dose normalised geometric mean C<sub>max</sub> increased with dose up to 3000&#x000a0;mcg. This supra proportionality was relatively modest, with a less than 3-fold increase over the range from 30 to 3000&#x000a0;mcg. The reason(s) for this observation are currently not known but may be due to slower absorption at the lowest doses. All exposures were within the exposure margins set by the non-clinical toxicity studies and so this is not expected to have any impact on safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">In summary, GSK3008348 was well tolerated at single doses up to 3000&#x000a0;mcg in healthy participants, and its PK profile was dose proportional at potentially clinically relevant doses (300&#x02013;3000&#x000a0;mcg). These findings support further development of GSK3008348 as a novel inhaled treatment option for IPF.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1007/s00228-018-2435-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>GSK3008348</kwd><kwd>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</kwd><kwd>Pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>Safety</kwd><kwd>Integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;6 inhibitor</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>GSK</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia with unknown aetiology, associated with a&#x000a0;histological appearance of usual interstitial pneumonia. IPF progresses in a relentless and often insidious manner and is lethal, with median survival ranging from 2 to 4&#x000a0;years and a 5-year survival range of 20&#x02013;30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There are two disease-modifying treatments currently available to patients: pirfenidone and nintedanib. Both are oral anti-fibrotic therapies that demonstrate a reduction in the rate of decline in lung function (forced vital capacity, FVC) over 1&#x000a0;year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Pirfenidone is associated with phototoxicity, and both pirfenidone and nintedanib cause significant gastrointestinal effects, resulting in discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs) in approximately 30% of patients treated with pirfenidone and 20% of patients treated with nintedanib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Development of new treatments for IPF has focussed on targets that drive fibrogenesis. It is likely that for maximal efficacy, a new medicine must reach the distal areas of the lung where fibrosis occurs. Aerosol-driven direct lung exposure combined with systemic drug availability may maximise the potential of a drug to reach all areas of the lung over a sustained period at lower doses than other routes of administration. GSK3008348 is a small molecule inhibitor of alpha-v beta-6 (&#x003b1;v&#x003b2;6) integrin and represents the first inhaled compound in this class. The &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;6 integrin plays a key role in the activation of transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF&#x003b2;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] that is hypothesised to be central in the development of IPF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;6 is significantly upregulated in IPF lung tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and localised to damaged epithelial sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Levels are also prognostic, with increased levels of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;6 observed in patients with rapidly progressing IPF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, the &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;6 integrin is an attractive therapeutic target for IPF with the advantage of inhibiting disease-specific activation of TGF&#x003b2; via &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;6, while limiting the potential for toxicological effects that may be associated with direct inhibition of TGF&#x003b2;, that includes heart valve lesions and physeal dysplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">GSK3008348 demonstrates selectivity for &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;6 and binds to the integrin with high affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It has been shown to inhibit the activation of TGF&#x003b2; with a prolonged duration of action in non-clinical in vitro and in vivo studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. On delivery by nebulisation directly to the lungs, GSK3008348 is anticipated to bind to &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;6 on the damaged epithelium and reduce TGF&#x003b2; activation, thereby limiting the ability of TGF&#x003b2; to promote collagen production and halting or slowing the progression of fibrosis. The study presented here was designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of single doses of GSK3008348 in healthy participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par8">This was a first-time-in-human, randomised, double-blind, single ascending-dose study of nebulised GSK3008348 (NCT02612051). GSK3008348 was formulated as a solution, administered via nebulisation over approximately 10&#x000a0;min using a Philips Respironics Inno Spire Delux Nebuliser with a Philips side stream mouthpiece. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants in the study.</p><p id="Par9">Two cohorts of eight healthy participants each were randomised 3:1 to receive GSK3008348 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) or placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) in each period of a 4-period crossover. Within each cohort, participants were randomised to receive up to three ascending doses of GSK3008348 and one of placebo. In case it was necessary to repeat any doses to obtain more PK or safety data, a third cohort with the same design was also included in the study. Sentinel dosing was used throughout: on day 1, two subjects were dosed one active and one placebo, the remaining subjects in the dosing group were dosed the following day. Once each dose group had been completed, there was a blinded review of the safety and PK before proceeding to the next dose (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study Schematic showing cohorts and doses in mcg. Participant numbers for illustrative purposes only, 5 additional subjects were recruited and dosed to replace participants that did not complete all dosing periods</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="228_2018_2435_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par10">In each period, participants were admitted to the clinical unit before dosing and were discharged 48&#x000a0;h after their dose. There was a washout period of at least 6&#x000a0;days between doses. This was based on non-clinical PK observations predicting an effective half-life of less than 12&#x000a0;h and human in vitro studies indicating a modestly extended pharmacodynamic effect. GSK3008348 demonstrates a receptor dissociation half-life of ~&#x02009;9&#x000a0;h and induces rapid internalisation of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;6 (minutes) followed by a slow return of the integrin to the cell surface (hours) due to integrin degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Non-clinical PK studies demonstrated rapid absorption of the drug from the lung into the systemic circulation with no evidence of significant lung retention. After the final dose, there was a follow-up period for 7&#x02013;14&#x000a0;days.</p><p id="Par11">Cohort 1 received 1, 3, 10, and 30&#x000a0;mcg GSK3008348, and cohort 2 received 100, 300, 1000, and 3000&#x000a0;mcg GSK3008348. Cohort 3 received a repeat of the highest dose levels, 1000 and 3000&#x000a0;mcg GSK3008348, to obtain additional information on safety and PK. The 1&#x000a0;mcg starting dose of GSK3008348 was predicted to engage approximately 15% of the &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;6 in healthy lungs at lung peak concentrations, and the free systemic concentrations were predicted to be below the K<sub>D</sub> at maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>). This was a deliberately conservative approach given the novel mechanism. Dose escalation was continued, using half log steps, to a maximum of 3000&#x000a0;mcg in order to explore sustained higher occupancies (predicted &#x0003e;&#x02009;90%) where downstream biomarker modulation and efficacy may be expected based on pre-clinical evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, 3000&#x000a0;mcg was the maximum dose supported by non-clinical toxicological studies. No systemic toxicity was identified at all doses tested in the 4-week inhalation toxicity studies. The human systemic exposures achieved across the dose range were within the systemic nonclinical safety margins.</p><p id="Par12">The objectives of the study were achieved after the first two dosing periods in cohort 3; therefore, the study was terminated and the final two dosing periods in cohort 3 were not required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study participants</title><p id="Par13">Healthy male or female participants aged &#x02265;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years, with body weight &#x02265;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;kg and body mass index &#x02265;&#x02009;19.0&#x02013;&#x02264;&#x02009;35.0&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, were eligible to participate in the study.

Current treatments reduce the rate of decline in lung function, but do not stop progression of IPF altogether. Blockade of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;6 integrin represents an attractive anti-fibrotic drug mechanism, with a body of evidence to suggest that it plays a central role in the activation of TGF&#x003b2; and the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. By virtue of its restricted expression, &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;6 represents a more targeted approach to modulating the process of fibrogenesis that results in the laying down of fibrotic tissue in the lung. This has the potential to confer advantages compared with approaches that seek to achieve a more generalised blockade of TGF&#x003b2;, which has been shown to have negative side effects given TGF&#x003b2;&#x02019;s role in a variety of normal physiological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, in vitro experiments suggest that pirfenidone and nintedanib have limited effects on &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;6 integrin-mediated TGF&#x003b2; activation, indicating that targeting this pathway has the potential to provide mechanistic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These observations also suggest that this approach could be attractive as an add-on therapy to either pirfenidone or nintedanib, as part of a multi-faceted approach to arrest fibrosis, the importance of which has been extensively discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">GSK3008348 is the first compound in the &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;6 integrin class to be administered via the inhaled route. In addition to &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;6 integrin being an attractive mechanism to target localised TGF&#x003b2; activation in areas of fibrotic lung, delivery of GSK3008348 via inhalation may confer additional advantages compared with oral and intravenous routes of administration. Aerosol-driven direct lung exposure combined with systemic drug availability may maximise the potential of a drug to reach all areas of the lung over a sustained period at lower doses than other routes of administration.</p><p id="Par31">The results from this first-time-in-human, single ascending-dose study provide support for the continued development of GSK3008348 as an inhaled therapy for the treatment of IPF. Safety data collected in the study suggest that GSK3008348 was well tolerated in healthy participants at doses up to 3000&#x000a0;mcg. Importantly, inhalation of GSK3008348 was not associated with local or systemic adverse effects, demonstrating that the inhaled route is a viable one that can be used in future patient studies.</p><p id="Par32">The PK profile for single doses of GSK3008348 was successfully characterised, indicating maximal concentrations at approximately 30&#x000a0;min post-start of nebulisation and geometric mean terminal T<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> ranging from 7.95 to 10.2&#x000a0;h. Increases in systemic exposure, defined by the area under the concentration curve, were dose proportional. There was a clear trend for the dose normalised geometric mean C<sub>max</sub> to increase with doses up to 3000&#x000a0;mcg. The increase was relatively modest, with a less than 3-fold increase over the range from 30 to 3000&#x000a0;mcg and may have been due to a slower absorption from the lung at the lowest doses. The implication of the observed PK profile suggests that a twice daily dosing regimen may be efficacious (assuming that lung exposures parallel those in the systemic circulation). An investigational study to determine levels of target engagement in the lung is ongoing and will be utilised to further refine potential dosing regimens (NCT03069989).</p><p id="Par33">It is expected, based on recent comparative observations of the PK of nebulised salbutamol in healthy participants and patients with IPF (unpublished data), that nebulised GSK3008348 would have a similar PK profile in patients with IPF to that observed in the healthy participants in the current study.</p><p id="Par34">Results from this study therefore support the progression of GSK3008348 to the next stage of clinical development. Establishing the safety profile of repeated doses is a key next step, as is investigating the effects of single doses of GSK3008348 on target engagement in patients with IPF (NCT03069989).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par35">This study has demonstrated that GSK3008348, an &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;6 integrin inhibitor administered as an inhaled solution, was well tolerated, and systemic exposure was linear at doses of 300&#x02013;3000&#x000a0;mcg.
