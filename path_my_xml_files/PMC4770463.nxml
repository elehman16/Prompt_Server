Remifentanil is a synthetic narcotic/analgesic agent with a short duration effect and decreases the risk of apnea during recovery. Bispectral index system (BIS) is a new noninvasive technique for the evaluation of the depth of sedation. The aim of present clinical trial was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of intravenous sedation with propofol/midazolam/remifentanil (PMR) in comparison to propofol/midazolam/ketamine (PMK) for dental procedures in children 3-7 years of age.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In this clinical trial, 32 healthy uncooperative children who were candidates for dental treatments under sedation were randomly divided into two groups. Intravenous sedation was induced with PMR in one group and with PMK in the other group. After injection and during procedure BIS index, heart rate and respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation was evaluated every 5 min. After the procedure, recovery time was measured. Data were analyzed with ANOVA, Friedman, Wilcoxon, and <italic>t</italic>-test.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The BIS value was significantly low in ketamin group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003) but respiratory rates and heart rates were same in both groups with no statistical difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.884, <italic>P</italic> = 0.775). The recovery time was significantly shorter in remifentanil group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.008 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.003).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>It can be concluded that intravenous sedation technique with PMR combination induces effective and safe sedation, with less pain and more forgetfulness and a shorter recovery time for children 3-7 years of age during dental procedures.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Bispectral index</kwd><kwd>ketamine</kwd><kwd>midazolam</kwd><kwd>propofol</kwd><kwd>remifentanil</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Intravenous sedation is the second most comfortable, effective, and the safest technique after inhalation sedation; however, the technique should be used only by trained personnel.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Sedative techniques do not involve intubation, contrasting general anesthesia and the recovery period is short.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] There are basically two techniques available for intravenous sedation: Use of only one medication, which is usually benzodiazepine and a combination of several medicines.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In sedation, it is of the utmost importance to achieve analgesia. Due to the limitations of the use of local anesthetic agents such as overdose and reaching the toxic levels of medications, proper analgesic agents should be used in combination with sedative agents.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The most commonly medications used in sedation are ketamine, midazolam, and propofol.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Ketamine has an analgesic effect but may cause complications during recovery, including severe listlessness, nausea, delirium, nystagmus, and severe muscle spasms. It is contraindicated in patients with a history of convulsions.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In contrast, propofol does not have an analgesic effect but may increase the risk of respiratory depression, body irritation, crying, and coughing during the procedure and anxiety during recovery, with no nausea.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Midazolam has no analgesic effect but may induce forgetfulness after the procedure.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Remifentanil is a synthetic narcotic/analgesic agent with a strong analgesic effect which decreases the risk of apnea during recovery; however, it has a short duration of effect.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Since it results in minor changes in cardiac waves and leads to rapid recovery, remifentanil is a good choice for cardiac and debilitated patients.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Bispectral index system (BIS) is a new noninvasive technique for the evaluation of the depth of sedation and may be a proper technique for evaluation of children undergoing a sedative technique.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The electroencephalography (EEG) device reports the waves numerically in a range of 0-100, in which 100 indicates full consciousness and a value between 60 and 90 indicates adequate sedation.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] These values should be in the range of 40-60 in general anesthesia, 60-70 in profound sedation, and 70-90 in moderate sedation.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] There are only a few studies available on intravenous sedation of children for dental procedures.

Remifentanil is a new medication and its combination with midazolam increases forgetfulness after the procedure compared to midazolam alone.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Further studies are needed to determine the best combination of drugs for sedation in children.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The present study was undertaken to evaluate and compare the efficacy of a combination of propofol/midazolam/ketamine (PMK) with that of a combination of propofol/midazolam/remifentanil (PMR) in sedating children during dental procedures by means of BIS technique.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>In the present prospective, double-blind clinical trial a total of 32 uncooperative children (one or two negatives based on Frankel behavioral rating scale[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]), aged 3-7, who referred to Department of Hospital Dentistry in Isfahan Dental School selected randomly. The inclusion criteria were healthy children who had no specific systemic disease and were in the category I of the American Society of Anesthesiology. At the time of sedation, children did not have a common cold or any airway problems. Patients with extraction or who needed dental work time more than 45 min were excluded. The sample size in each group was 16 subjects at a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80% (&#x003b1; = 0.05, &#x003b2; = 0.20), using the below formula.

To our knowledge, there are a limited number of studies have compared the two drugs, remifentanil and ketamine (alone or in combination with other drugs). Several studies have shown that incorporation of remifentanil shortens the recovery time, consistent with the results of the present study.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>However, Moerman concluded that the addition of remifentanil to propofol during spontaneous ventilation had no benefits compared with the use of propofol alone. Although the addition of remifentanil resulted in a dose reduction of propofol, using propofol alone accompany with less recovery time and better patient satisfaction.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, there were no significant differences in heart rates and respiratory rates between the two groups. Several studies have been conducted about side effects of remifentanil or other opioids. However, there are many discrepancies in results. For example, one study reported that the side effects of remifentanil were not more than nonopioid drugs.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] While others demonstrated that complications such as breathing and conscious reduction were observed in the use of remifentanil.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The combination of remifentanil with midazolam increases forgetfulness after the procedure compared to midazolam alone.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] It seems that PMR combination had more satisfactory results than propofol/remifentanil.</p><p>BIS scores in the PMK group were lower at all the time intervals than those in the PMR group, and more profound sedation had been achieved in the PMK group. The results of the present study were somewhat close to other studies such as Kramer <italic>et al</italic>. who compared the sedative effect of the combinations of remifentanil/propofol and ketamine/propofol. They found that both groups had the same respiratory and cardiac complications; however, the duration of sedative effect and the time of recovery for the ketamine group were significantly higher than remifentanil.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Moreover, Berkenbosch <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the combination of remifentanil and propofol had a well sedative effect and fast recovery with no serious side effects.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] The most commonly technique to evaluate the depth of sedation is to assess clinical signs such as patient movement and response to verbal and physical stimuli which principally depend on the patient's personal reports and are considered an indirect indicator of the effect of medications on the brain.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Although EEG is one of the most straightforward techniques to evaluate brain activity during sedation, this technique is difficult and costly. BIS is a new noninvasive technique for the evaluation of the depth of sedation and might be a proper technique for evaluation of children undergoing a sedative technique.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Studies have shown that a BIS score &#x02265;60 indicates an appropriate depth of sedation, with no possibility of accidental awakening during the procedure,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] which was also shown in the present study. In the remifentanil group, the subjects were in a profound sedation state at different time intervals; however, in the ketamine groups, the subjects were in general anesthesia state at all the intervals. Such a situation might be explained by the fact that the individual physiologic responses of children to a fixed dose are different. In other words, despite the use of a fixed dose for sedation, some children go into general anesthesia and the results of the present study showed that such a possibility is definitely higher with ketamine compared to remifentanil. Therefore, ketamine and remifentanil should be used for general anesthesia and deep sedation in the presence of proper tools under monitoring. Since there were no side effects, such as respiratory muscles spasms, apnea during recovery and laryngeal ulcers due to the absence of intubation, in the sedation technique compared to general anesthesia technique, more extensive a comprehensive studies are suggested to evaluate intravenous sedation techniques for dental procedures. The administration of PMK for general anesthesia and PMR for sedation purposes could be suggested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>It can be concluded that intravenous sedation technique with a combination of midazolam, propofol, and remifentanil induces effective and safe sedation, with less pain and more forgetfulness and a less recovery time for children 3-7 years of age during dental procedures.</p><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Torabinejad Dental Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Conflicts of interest:</title><p>No one of those who were involved in conception, designing, planning, running trial, interpretation, drafting manuscript and submission are funded or supported by any manufacturer or any other related affairs organization.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like acknowledge to the staff at the Department of Hospital Dentistry in School of Dentistry, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.
