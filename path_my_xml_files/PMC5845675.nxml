The use of polyol-sweetened gum is believed to benefit oral health through stimulation of salivary flow and impacting oral pathogenic bacteria. Maltitol is often used as sweetener in food products. This study aimed to establish the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of frequent consumption of maltitol-sweetened chewing gum on the dental plaque microbiota in healthy volunteers and to establish the cellular and molecular effects by <italic>in vitro</italic> cultivation and transcriptional analysis.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> An intervention study was performed in 153 volunteers, randomly assigned to three groups (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl">www.trialregister.nl</ext-link>; NTR4165). One group was requested to use maltitol gum five times daily, one group used gum-base, and the third group did not use chewing gum. At day 0 and day 28, 24 h-accumulated supragingival plaque was collected at the lingual sites of the lower jaw and the buccal sites of the upper jaw and analyzed by 16S ribosomal rRNA gene sequencing. At day 42, 2 weeks after completion of the study, lower-jaw samples were collected and analyzed. The upper buccal plaque microbiota composition had lower bacterial levels and higher relative abundances of (facultative) aerobic species compared to the lower lingual sites. There was no difference in bacterial community structure between any of the three study groups (PERMANOVA). Significant lower abundance of several bacterial phylotypes was found in maltitol gum group compared to the gum-base group, including <italic>Actinomyces massiliensis</italic> HOT 852 and <italic>Lautropia mirabilis</italic> HOT 022. Cultivation studies confirmed growth inhibition of <italic>A. massiliensis</italic> and <italic>A. johnsonii</italic> by maltitol at levels of 1% and higher. Transcriptome analysis of <italic>A. massiliensis</italic> revealed that exposure to maltitol resulted in changes in the expression of genes linked to osmoregulation, biofilm formation, and central carbon metabolism.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The results showed that chewing itself only marginally impacted the plaque microbiota composition. Use of maltitol-sweetened gum lowered abundance of several bacterial species. Importantly, the species impacted play a key role in the early formation of dental biofilms. Further studies are required to establish if frequent use of maltitol gum impacts early dental-plaque biofilm development.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>oral health</kwd><kwd>oral biofilm</kwd><kwd>supragingival plaque</kwd><kwd>microbiota</kwd><kwd>maltitol</kwd><kwd>polyol</kwd><kwd><italic>Actinomyces</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Ministerie van Economische Zaken<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003195</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">060.17070_151207</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="53"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The oral cavity is a complex ecosystem, harboring one of the most diverse microbial populations found in the human body (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Human Microbiome Project Consortium</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Within the mouth, distinct niches can be discerned, characterized by unique biochemical and physical properties, which is reflected in the microbial community structures that occupy these various niches (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Duckworth, 2006</xref>). Over 700 species have been identified spanning more than 20 phyla (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Zaura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Dewhirst et al., 2010</xref>). Microorganisms residing in the mouth are required to form biofilms and firmly attach to the various surfaces provided. This includes soft mucosal tissues of the gums, cheeks, and tongue and the hard tissues of the teeth. Oral biofilms have been shown to form intricate multispecies structures occasionally described as <italic>corn cobs</italic>, <italic>hedgehogs</italic>, or <italic>cauliflowers</italic>, providing optimal biochemical conditions for the different members within, protecting against abiotic conditions and allowing an optimal concerted metabolism (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mark Welch et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Surface attachment, nutrient availability, and biophysical properties (e.g., oxygen and pH levels) appear to be the main driving forces in the selection of microbial populations (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Proctor and Relman, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Zaura et al., 2017</xref>). Dysbiotic shifts in the composition of the commensal microbiota have been proposed as the underlying cause in the onset and progression of oral diseases, including dental caries and gingival inflammatory diseases (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Sanz et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The use of sugar-free chewing gum as an adjunct to tooth brushing provides a small but significant reduction in plaque scores (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Keukenmeester et al., 2013</xref>). Chewing gum has also been shown to have beneficial effects in the prevention of dental caries by increasing the flow of saliva (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Dodds, 2012</xref>). Sugar-free chewing gum is often sweetened by polyol sugars such as xylitol, sorbitol, maltitol, and erythritol (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Livesey, 2003</xref>). Unlike regular sugars, polyol alcohols cannot be used by oral bacteria for fermentation, are not metabolized to organic acids, and thus do not contribute to tooth decay (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Matsuo, 1973</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Van Loveren, 2004</xref>).</p><p>It has been demonstrated both <italic>in vivo</italic> as well as <italic>in vitro</italic> that xylitol and sorbitol inhibit the growth of a number of cariogenic bacteria, including <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus sobrinus</italic> (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Soderling et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Thabuis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Haghgoo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Makinen, 2016</xref>). The mechanism of action is assumed to be due to an accumulation of the sugar alcohol within the cell upon uptake, resulting in the formation of a toxic sugar-phosphate (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Trahan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Miyasawa-Hori et al., 2006</xref>). The effects of polyol-sweetened gums on the healthy oral microbiota have not been established.</p><p>This study aims to establish the effects of frequent consumption of maltitol-sweetened chewing gum on the supragingival plaque microbiota composition and to gain insights in the effects of maltitol at a molecular and cellular level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Ethical Aspects</title><p>This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the ethical review board of the Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam. The protocol was independently reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Medical Centre Amsterdam under number MEC NL45518.018.13 and registered at the Dutch Trial Register (NTR4165). All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The clinical study was conducted approximating Good Clinical Practice (GCP) as laid out in the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH). The study was scheduled and executed from September&#x02013;December 2013 at the Department of Periodontology at the Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam, Netherlands. Participants were recruited from a database that contained individuals from universities in and around Amsterdam who had subscribed as being potentially interested in participating in clinical research. Flyers, posters, and advertisements were used to attract additional participants. Those participants who responded were informed about the research by a recruitment letter sent by e-mail. All voluntary participants were informed about the outline, purpose, and duration of the study. Subsequently, participants had time to consider whether they wished to be involved and undergo screening. Participants were asked to read and sign the informed consent form, and they received a signed copy for their records.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and Allocation Concealment</title><p>This study had a parallel single-blind (examiner) design with three randomly assigned groups. It was designed to evaluate the effect of the frequent use of maltitol chewing gum during 28 days on the supragingival microbiota. Block randomization was performed by the study coordinator using true random numbers, which were generated by sampling and processing a source of entropy outside the computer<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup>. The principal investigator was responsible for allocation concealment. No stratification was applied.</p><p>The examiners were blinded to the treatment randomizations, and records of earlier examinations were not available at each re-examination. Instruction took place in an area separate from the examiners by the coordinator. The randomization code was kept in a sealed envelope that was not accessible to the examiners. Participants were firmly instructed not to reveal their product assignment to the examiners.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>For the present study, 153 systemically healthy participants were recruited from non-dental students. The inclusion criteria were being &#x02265;18&#x02013;45 years of age, non-smokers (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Lie et al., 1998</xref>), possessing at least 20 natural teeth (minimum of five evaluable teeth per quadrant), and being considered systemically healthy as assessed by a medical questionnaire.

Additional exclusion criteria were orthodontic appliances, removable (partial) dentures, night guards, oral and/or peri-oral piercings, apparent oral lesions, use of antibiotics in the preceding 2 months, pregnancy and breast feeding. Eligible participants did not use any interdental device as part of their daily oral hygiene procedure and had not participated in a clinical trial in the previous 30 days.</p><p>After meeting all study-entrance criteria, participants were considered eligible for the study and scheduled for the two appointments (each visit at the same time on the same day of the week).</p></sec><sec><title>Study Products and Procedures</title><p>The products were provided and their use was individually instructed by one and the same study coordinator. Standardized instructions were given to the participants. In the 15 days preceding the first appointment (day 1), participants were asked to refrain from using any kind of polyol-containing food products, including chewing gum and lozenges. From the screening visit onward, participants were instructed to brush twice daily (morning and evening) in their customary manner with a standard toothbrush and standard toothpaste as provided (Tubes of 75 ml with 1450 ppm sodium fluoride; HEMA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> toothpaste, HEMA B.V., Netherlands). Furthermore, they were instructed not to use any interdental cleaning device or a mouthwash during the trial period. At day 1 subjects were instructed to comply with the following instructions adapted according to their group assignment (maltitol test gum, gum base, or no gum).</p><p>Instructions for maltitol gum use were to chew 10 pieces of gum daily, 2 pieces at the same time, 5 times daily for 10 min (Maltitol chewing gum provided by Roquette Fr&#x000e8;res). Instructions for gum base use were to chew 5 pieces of gum daily, 5 times daily, 1 piece for 10 min (gum base provided by Roquette Fr&#x000e8;res). In both the maltitol gum and gum-base groups, volunteers were instructed to use gum after breakfast, lunch, dinner in the afternoon, and before going to bed.</p><p>All three groups were requested to refrain from brushing for 24 h before each appointment while the gum groups were asked to continue their chewing assignment. Participants were obliged to note in a customized calendar the moment of brushing and, if applicable, the moment of chewing gum intake.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Collection and Processing</title><p>At day 0, 28, and 42, upper-buccal and lower-lingual supragingival plaque was collected scraping the surfaces of molars, premolars, cuspid, and incisors with a sterile Teflon spatula from two randomly chosen contra-lateral quadrants (one in the upper jaw, one in the lower jaw). Sampling was performed by the same examiner during the study (EJCM). Plaque was transferred to an Eppendorf vial with 50 &#x003bc;l RNAprotect solution, spun down using a microcentrifuge and stored on ice until transport to the laboratory and then stored at -80&#x000b0;C until further processing for DNA extraction.</p></sec><sec><title>Microbiota Analysis</title><p>For DNA isolation, plaque samples were thawed on ice and lysed by bead beating (Mini-BeadBeater-24; BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK, United States) for 2 min at 2100 oscillations/min in the presence of 300 &#x003bc;l of lysis buffer (Mag Mini DNA Isolation Kit; LGC Ltd., United Kingdom), 500 &#x003bc;L zirconium beads (0.1 mm; BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK, United States) and 500 &#x003bc;L phenol saturated with 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl and 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0 (Sigma). After centrifugation, DNA was extracted using the Mag Mini DNA Isolation Kit (LGC Ltd., United Kingdom) in accordance with the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.</p><p>To determine the amount of bacterial DNA, a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed using primers <italic>16Suni-I-F</italic> CGA AAG CGT GGG GAG CAA A, <italic>16Suni-I-R</italic> GTT CGT ACT CCC CAG GCG G, and 6-FAM MGB probe ATT AGA TAC CCT GGT AGT CCA that are specific for the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. In the reaction, 1 &#x003bc;l of a 10-fold diluted DNA sample is added to 24 &#x003bc;l of a mixture of primers and RT PCR master mix (Diagenode, Seraing, B) and is analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 7500 RT PCR system during 40 cycles of denaturation at 95.0&#x000b0;C for 15 s and annealing/elongation at 60.0&#x000b0;C for 1 min. A standard curve was established by analysis of a pooled DNA sample serially diluted at 1 ng, 100 pg, 10 pg, 1 pg, 100 fg, 10 fg, and 1 fg per &#x003bc;l as well as a negative control. After conversion of the <italic>C</italic>t values to DNA quantities, the number of cells was estimated by accounting for the elution volume used after DNA extraction (60 &#x003bc;l) and assuming that 1000 fg of DNA was equivalent to 447.4 cells, i.e., a genome size of 2 Mb.</p><p>For 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region, 1 ng of DNA was amplified as described by <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Kozich et al.

Following recruitment and a standardized run-in phase, volunteers were divided into three groups. One group that was requested to use five times daily maltitol gum. The second group used gum base. The third group did not use any chewing gum. Throughout the run-in phase and the intervention study, volunteers were provided a standardized toothbrush and toothpaste and were requested to refrain from using any kind of polyol containing food products, including chewing gum and lozenges. During the study, eight participants reported adverse events. Four cases were unrelated to the study products, three possibly related (gastro-intestinal complaints or pain due to chewing on the occlusal lesion), and one was related as an undiagnosed flatulence and itch ever since using the study products.</p></sec><sec><title>Total Bacterial Load in Dental Plaque</title><p>Supragingival plaque was collected from two randomly chosen contra-lateral quadrants (one in the upper jaw and one in the lower jaw). At baseline (day 0) and at day 28, the lower jaw lingual and the upper jaw buccal surfaces of molars and premolars were sampled using a sterile Teflon spatula. The lower jaw supragingival plaque was also sampled at day 42, 2 weeks after completion of the intervention. After extraction of DNA, the total bacterial load was determined by 16S rDNA qPCR. Results are shown in <bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>. The bacterial density of the lingual plaque samples of the lower jaw was found to be higher than that of the buccal plaque samples of the upper jaw. The bacterial load of the lower jaw lingual plaque samples at baseline was on average 6.80 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> (&#x003c3; 6.53 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup>) cells and for the upper jaw buccal plaque was on average 1.22 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> (&#x003c3; 9.21 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>) cells. There was no significant change in the total bacterial load of the lower jaw lingual plaque in any of the three study groups when comparing baseline with the day 28 samples. For the upper-jaw buccal plaque samples, however, a significant decrease in bacterial load was observed of &#x0223c;80% for all three groups, showing no significant difference between groups. A moderate-to-strong correlation (Pearson correlation &#x003c1; = 0.66) was found in the total bacterial load of lower-jaw lingual plaque samples of the participants when comparing the baseline with the day-28 samples.

In total, 9,717,143 sequences remained after quality filtering and even sampling. The lower-jaw lingual plaque microbiota had a small but statistically significant higher diversity index as compared to that of the upper-jaw buccal plaque samples.

We noted a transcriptional differences in a number of genes encoding proteins in metabolism. Among the genes with higher expression, two genes were identified encoding members of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). The first (ORF 1337) annotated as a PTS beta-glucoside transporter subunit IIABC, was adjacent and in the same reading orientation of another upregulated gene encoding an alpha,alpha-phosphotrehalase (ORF 1338). In addition, increased transcription levels were found for a second PTS beta-glucoside transporter subunit IIBCA encoding gene (ORF 1035). Directly upstream of this PTS gene and in the same reading orientation, two significantly upregulated genes were found: the first, ORF 1036, encoding a small transmembrane protein, and the second, ORF 1037, encoding an inorganic phosphate transporter. Lower expression was also found for a number of genes related to metabolic functions.

Several genes encoding glycine/betaine transporters showed differential expression levels.

In the study, buccal plaque of the upper-jaw molars was studied independently from plaque collected at the lingual sites of lower jaw molars. While samples from the same individuals were taken at the same time point, the upper-jaw buccal and lower-jaw lingual microbiota displayed a difference. The bacterial levels determined in the lower lingual plaque samples were higher than in the upper buccal samples. Also, the upper buccal and lower lingual plaque microbiota displayed clear compositional differences. While the upper buccal microbiota was dominated by aerotolerant saccharolytic species, the lower lingual plaque was dominated by anaerobic proteolytic species. The anatomical differences between the sites are likely to affect the local physicochemical conditions. Lower jaw lingual surfaces indeed have been demonstrated to have greater accumulations of both hard and soft deposits and more bleeding on probing than other areas of the mouth. The direct vicinity of buccal mucus of the upper buccal plaque samples may promote saccharolytic properties of the plaque biofilm. Likewise, the lower lingual surfaces may be exposed to saliva more directly and for a longer duration, resulting in higher pH values and an excess of nutrients. Sugar measurements following the intake of sugar-containing food products indeed have revealed a non-uniform distribution of sugar in the mouth, with particularly low concentrations at the lingual surfaces of the lower incisors and the buccal surfaces of the upper molars (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Macpherson and Dawes, 1994</xref>). Clearance was also most rapid from these sites.</p><p>Another source for differences in plaque abundance and composition may be due to differences in abrasive forces experienced between these sites. The differences in microbiota composition of supragingival plaque at different anatomical sites has received little attention in microbiota studies, often lacking specific information on the sites selected for sampling or occasionally pooling both lingual and buccal plaque samples (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Keijser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Utter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We found a moderate-to-strong correlation in the plaque abundance of the lower lingual plaque samples when comparing samples taken at day 0 with those taken at day 28. This correlation may relate to previously described properties of &#x0201c;heavy&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;light&#x0201d; plaque formers (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Simonsson et al., 1987</xref>). We did not find such correlation for the upper buccal plaque levels, nor did we observe this when comparing bacterial levels between upper-buccal and lower-lingual plaque. Whether these differences relate to previously reported differences in bacterial aggregation between whole and parotid saliva and between individuals characterized as &#x0201c;light&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;heavy&#x0201d; plaque formers is unclear (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Carl&#x000e9;n et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>During the course of the study, we noted a significant shift in the plaque microbiota, being most pronounced for the upper buccal samples. We noted a significant decline in the bacterial levels in upper buccal samples taken at day 28 as well as a number of microbial changes, including a decline in <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> and <italic>Leptotrichia</italic> species. This suggests the presence of more mature plaque samples at the start of the study compared to those harvested at day 28. This shift was observed irrespective of the group regimen the participants were assigned to. The cause of these differences is not clear. The time of sampling was standardized and performed in the morning by the same examiner. All volunteers were instructed not to brush teeth for 24 h and the duration of plaque accumulation was recorded for each participant in relation to the moment of their clinical visit. It should be noted that all volunteers received a standardized toothbrush and toothpaste upon the start of the study. It cannot be ruled out that the changes in upper buccal plaque abundance and plaque microbiota composition may have been caused by improved dental cleaning efficiency effectuated by the standardized brush and toothpaste. In addition, improved oral hygiene by participants following inclusion in clinical studies has also been described (Hawthorne effect) (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">McCarney et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>By comparing the control group with the gum-base group, we could show that chewing gum five times daily for 28 days had a very minor effect on the composition of the dental plaque microbiota. Statistically significant differences were detected in the abundance of phylotypes between the control group and the gum base group but the differences in abundance levels between the groups were generally small and not always observed in both gum base and maltitol gum groups. In a randomized controlled study with a 3-week duration using a split-mouth model regarding experimental gingivitis, it was shown that in circumstances where regular brushing is performed, no effect of chewing gum was observed on bleeding and plaque scores. In the absence of brushing, chewing xylitol or maltitol gum provided a significant inhibitory effect on gingivitis scores compared to chewing gum base. The difference when compared to the group not using gum was not significant (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Keukenmeester et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Maltitol-sweetened gum in the presented study had a very specific effect on a small number of members of the supragingival plaque ecosystem. The strongest effects of maltitol-sweetened gum were observed for <italic>A. masiliensis</italic> and <italic>Lautropia mirabilis</italic> in the lower lingual plaque microbiota. Interestingly, the relative abundance <italic>A. masiliensis</italic> was still lower at day 42, 2 weeks after completion of the intervention. In a recent study, the effects of frequent consumption of maltitol gum during 2 weeks on the interproximal plaque microbiota (dental plaque between teeth) was examined by 454 pyrosequencing (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Prosdocimi et al., 2017</xref>). The study involved a group of 20 healthy control subjects and 40 subjects with active caries. In line with our results, this study showed that 2 weeks of maltitol gum or gum base had little impact on the microbiota composition as a whole. The study did demonstrate a decline in the relative abundance of a number of <italic>Actinomyces</italic> species. It is important to note that the taxa impacted in this work differed from those identified in our study. It is unclear whether this relates the differences between the niches samples (interproximal plaque or supragingival plaque), or to differences in sequencing platform. Previous studies have revealed dramatic differences in the distribution of that bacteria that differ by as little as a single rRNA nucleotide across habitats of the oral ecosystem. It is unfortunate that in the study of <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Prosdocimi et al. (2017)</xref>, interproximal plaque samples of multiple elements from both the upper and lower jaw were pooled, impairing the ability to reveal potential differences between anatomical sites. By <italic>in vitro</italic> cultivation, we could indeed demonstrate that the growth of <italic>A. massiliensis</italic> and <italic>A. johnsonii</italic> is impacted by maltitol. Full growth inhibition was achieved at a concentration of 1%. For the other <italic>Actinomyces</italic> species tested, no or minimal growth inhibition was observed at this level. Transcriptional studies provided insight in the response of <italic>A. massiliensis</italic> biofilms upon exposure to 2% maltitol. While the levels of maltitol applied was prohibitory for growth, the bacterial response was relatively small. First of all, exposure to maltitol effectuated a number of metabolic changes. Increased transcription was found in two genes annotated as PTS beta-glycoside transporters. Lower expression was observed for a number of genes for enzymes that play a central role in carbon metabolism, potentially impacting glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathways, and the citric acid cycle. It is unclear what the possible role of these beta-glucoside PTS glycoside genes is in the uptake of maltitol in <italic>Actinomyces</italic>, and the possible involvement of the alpha,alpha-phosphotrehalase located adjacent to one of the identified PTS genes and of which the expression was elevated as well. The co expression of the transporters and hydrolases may allow for hydrolysis of maltitol upon uptake yielding (phospho-)glucose and sorbitol. This resembles systems identified in other bacterial species, also showing overlapping functions between trehalose uptake and hydrolysis with maltitol (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ampomah et al., 2013</xref>). While glucose would be readily available for metabolism, fermentation of sorbitol in <italic>A. viscosus</italic> and <italic>A. naeslundii</italic> would involve a sorbitol-specific NAD(P)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase, converting the released sorbitol into fructose (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Kalfas et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al., 1994</xref>). It is noteworthy that while the gene is present on the genome of a number of <italic>Actinomyces</italic> species, translated BLAST analysis suggested that the gene is absent in <italic>A. massiliensis</italic> (data not shown). Future studies are required to establish possible metabolic differences in maltitol and sorbitol fermentation between <italic>Actinomyces</italic> species.</p><p>We also noted significant changes in the expression of genes of which the products are involved in osmotic regulation. We found lower expression levels of a gene cluster encoding a glycine betaine ABC transporter and a gene for the small conductance mechanosensitive ion channel (MscS). This coincided with higher expression levels of a BCCT family betaine/carnitine transporter. The transport of organic solutes such as glycine betaine is central in bacterial osmoregulation. We also detected increased expression of a gene encoding a polysaccharide deacetylase, which in Bacillus species has been shown to play a role in osmotic stability and cell-shape maintenance (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Arnaouteli et al., 2015</xref>). The changed expression levels of osmoregulation-associated proteins may reflect adaptations to changing osmotic conditions. At the same time, the transcriptional changes observed also imply a shift from an ATP-driven process for solute import to one driven by a transmembrane gradient and may perhaps also reflect cellular adaptation to ATP depletion.</p><p>A third process that emerged from analysis of the transcriptional response following maltitol exposure relates to lower expression levels of surface associated aggregation proteins such as fimbriae. As <italic>A. massiliensis</italic> growth appears to be impaired in the presence of maltitol, changes in cellular adhesion may perhaps relate to a shift from biofilms toward planktonic growth. While the transcriptional response upon maltitol exposure may provide indications toward the molecular impact of the polyol on metabolism and osmotic regulation of <italic>Actinomyces</italic> biofilms, further studies are required to establish these.</p><p>The clinical significance of these findings is unclear. Little is known of the role of <italic>Lautropia mirabilis</italic> in the supragingival biofilm or its relation with disease. Structural studies have suggested that <italic>Lautropia mirabilis</italic> forms specific cauliflower-like structures within the multispecies biofilm but its role in plaque biofilm formation is not well understood. <italic>Actinomyces</italic> species have been studied extensively (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kononen and Wade, 2015</xref>). Various <italic>Actinomyces</italic> species, have been implicated in (root) caries (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Brailsford et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Tanner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kononen and Wade, 2015</xref>). <italic>Actinomyces</italic> species are primary colonizers and have a prominent role in the supragingival biofilm structure (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mark Welch et al., 2016</xref>). Although <italic>A. massiliensis</italic> is a dominant <italic>Actinomyces</italic> species within the lower-lingual plaque microbiota, we only detected limited impact on the lower lingual plaque microbiota composition in volunteers after 24 h of plaque accumulation. Given the impact of maltitol on prominent members of species that act as primary colonizers of supragingival dental surfaces, it seems worthwhile to investigate the possible effects on the early dental plaque microbiota development.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has shown that daily use of chewing gum in healthy individuals has little impact on the supragingival plaque microbiota composition. Frequent use of maltitol gum resulted in selective inhibition of a number of bacterial members of the supragingival plaque microbiota, some of which are recognized as early colonizers of dental surfaces. To what extent this influences the dynamics of dental plaque accumulation, the functional properties of the plaque biofilm or the impact this has on clinical parameters of oral health remains to be established.</p></sec><sec><title>Availability of Data and Materials</title><p>The 16S ribosomal sequence and RNA-seq datasets generated and analyzed during the current study will become publicly available in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) upon acceptation of the paper. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>BK, DS, FvdW, and CT designed the experiments and wrote the study protocols.
