Patients often lack an understanding of the potential risks and benefits of ESAs, despite government mandated education on this topic. Decision aids are tools commonly used to discuss important information in health care settings. To address this knowledge gap, we designed this study to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel ESA decision aid at promoting informed shared decision making (ISDM) between patients and providers related to ESA use for CKD- and ESRD-related anemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Using the principles of informed shared decision making theory, we designed and piloted an ESA decision aid intended to increase CKD and ESRD patient understanding of the potential risks and benefits of ESAs. Informed by the findings during development, the ESA decision aid was modified and finalized for testing. We will perform a randomized clinical trial to assess if administration of the ESA decision aid improves patient understanding of the risks and benefits of ESA use compared to control patients receiving standard care. Participants with either CKD or ESRD and who are receiving ESAs will be eligible for participation. The primary outcome is patients&#x02019; score on the Patient Anemia Knowledge in Kidney Disease (PAKKD) survey assessed at enrollment and 3&#x000a0;months after. Secondary outcomes include decisional conflict related to ESAs, and patient satisfaction with provider communication.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The Anemia Risk Communication for patients with Kidney Disease (ARC-KD) study will assess the effectiveness of a novel ESA decision aid to improve patient understanding of ESA use to manage CKD- and ESRD-related anemia. This decision aid is the first resource targeted to improve patient understanding of anemia management in the kidney health context. With the increasing options available for anemia management, this will serve as an important foundation to evolve in the future to optimize anemia-related shared decision making.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01992926?term=NCT01992926&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01992926</ext-link>.

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have been used for the past two decades to treat the complications of anemia in patients with kidney disease. The inability of ESAs to improve patient-reported outcomes, such as fatigue, in clinical trials has cast doubt on the potential benefits of ESAs relative to their risks, which include a near doubling of risk for stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In March 2010, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the administration of medication guides to patients receiving ESAs to improve their understanding of the potential risks and benefits of ESA treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Unfortunately, these basic tools may not adequately educate patients thoroughly about the risks and benefits of ESA therapy. Even patients with kidney disease who frequently visit their nephrologists have knowledge deficits about their disease and the role of the kidney in anemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This is likely in part because communication is difficult from both the patient and the physician perspectives, and this is amplified when discussing possible risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Informed shared decision making (ISDM) has emerged as a leading evidence- based theory that, when applied successfully, can improve patient-provider communications surrounding health risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Best-practice ISDM requires the provider to initiate conversations by introducing the concept of patient choice, describe the options of care available to patients, often by employing a decision aid, and help patients better define their preferences to make good health care decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The Ottawa Decision Support Framework, an evidence-based set of guidelines used in the development and evaluation of over 30 empirically derived decision aids, also requires that the ISDM process be critically evaluated for quality and its impact on health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Decision aids developed by systematically applying ISDM theory can help to reinforce consistent application of ISDM principles during the health care decision making process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we sought to develop and evaluate a decision aid for ESA therapy to be administered to ESRD and CKD patient populations. We hypothesized that the use of an ESA decision aid that follows the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and adheres to expert opinion for optimizing communication with low health literacy and numeracy patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] will increase patient knowledge of anemia in kidney disease, reduce patient uncertainty related to ESA use, and increase overall patient care satisfaction. We also hypothesize that these effects might be enhanced for vulnerable patient populations, who stand to benefit from these improvements the most [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods and study design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design summary</title><p>The Anemia Risk Communication for patients with Kidney Disease (ARC-KD) study is a two-phase study to design, test, and optimize a novel decision aid to improve ISDM and patient understanding regarding the use of ESAs for treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In Phase 1, we designed, revised, and usability-tested a one-page ISDM-informed ESA decision aid intervention.

We focused our search on papers that described theories of ISDM in medical practice using the Ottawa Decision Support Framework. We also reviewed examples of high quality decision aids in the Decision Aid Library Inventory (DALI) available online via the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This search revealed limited research and resources describing kidney-specific decision aids and none describing anemia management decision aids, kidney health related or otherwise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Importantly, however, we did find evidence that the application of ISDM principles to patient-provider communications can improve health knowledge and outcomes in CKD and ESRD patient populations, including in patient sub-populations with low health literacy and numeracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>This search led us to consider the IPDAS quality domains as guiding principles when developing the ESA decision aid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

On its face, the systematically developed (IPDAS criterion 1) draft ESA decision aid contained sections that required the patient and provider to set shared goals (IPDAS criterion 6) (Section 1); encouraged the patient to engage interactively with the aid to facilitate individual consideration of acceptable treatment risk vs. quality of life benefits (IPDAS criteria 4) (Sections 2 and 6); helped the patient learn basic facts about anemia (IPDAS criteria 2, 9 and 11) (Sections 1&#x02013;3); helped the patient understand the probability-based risks and benefits of ESAs to treat anemia and the resulting potential impacts on quality of life (IPDAS criterion 3) (Sections 4 and 5); and allotted space for the patient to make a care related decision regarding whether or not to use ESAs (when trial data is evaluated, will contribute toward achieving IPDAS criterion 12) (Section 6). Additionally, the ESA decision aid used plain language and was drafted at a seventh grade reading level to facilitate comprehension of the aid by all patients, including those with low health literacy (IPDAS criteria 10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In total, the draft ESA decision aid met 9 of the 12 quality domains from the 2006 IPDAS decision aid checklist.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Draft ESA Decision Aid.

Though the aid does not state it, no conflict of interest exists for any person who developed the decision aid. Lastly, because our trial planned to deliver the decision aid in person for research purposes, it was not made available online.</p><p>To further evaluate the quality of the draft ESA decision aid, we engaged patients and providers to review the usefulness and accessibility of the tool, in accordance with recent decision aid best practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A convenience sample of 18 nephrology medical providers and 39 patients with kidney disease at Vanderbilt University Medical Center provided feedback on the draft ESA decision aid.

No compensation was given to participants.</p><p>Patients and providers independently reviewed printed copies of the ESA decision aid and completed a 17-question survey to provide feedback about the design and usefulness of the ESA decision aid at promoting informed shared decision making. Results from the surveys were compiled and used to revise the ESA decision aid.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Phase 1b: revision of the ESA decision aid</title><p>Review and analysis of the survey feedback showed approximately half of patients and providers alike felt significant revisions to Sections 1, 2 and 4 of the draft decision aid were warranted. In Section 1 (presentation of healthy hemoglobin levels), patients described the inclusion of hemoglobin values for &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; patients without kidney disease as stigmatizing. Generally, patients reported they found the graphs in Sections 1 and 2 (presentation of target hemoglobin levels for patients with kidney disease) to be more confusing than the informational sections of the decision aid. Likewise, providers predicted that such confusion about graphical interpretation may occur among patients. In response to this feedback, we revised Sections 1 and 2 of the decision aid to only include graphs containing pictorial representations of hemoglobin levels observed in CKD and ESRD patients (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Revised ESA Decision Aid.

Section 1 explains the mechanism for how and why ESAs are used to treat anemia in kidney disease patients. Section 2 raises patient awareness of their current hemoglobin level and encourages them to set a new goal hemoglobin level with their providers. Section 3 presents the benefits of ESAs, while Section 4 presents the risks. Section 5 contains additional information to help patients understand the impact of their decision to use ESAs on downstream treatment options related to broader kidney health outcomes.

Evaluation of the secondary analyses of provider communication satisfaction, health decisional certainty and perceived self-efficacy in patient-provider communications and patient kidney care will be similarly measured and analyzed using the Communication Assessment Tool (CAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and Perceived Efficacy in Patient-Physician Interactions (PEPPI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] surveys, respectively. Baseline pre-visit variables will be compared between the study arms to assess the successfulness of randomization including gender, age, education and race, using median and interquartile ranges for continuous variables and frequencies and proportion for categorical variables to ensure homogeneity. Chi-squared tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon-rank sum test for continuous variables will be used to assess the differences in baseline data between intervention and control. We will use linear regression models to compare the change in the PAKKD anemia knowledge scores from baseline to post-visit and baseline to 3&#x000a0;months post intervention between the study arms. Baseline pre-visit values of the outcome variable will be included as a model covariate in linear regression analysis to compare changes from baseline pre-visit. Lastly, planned exploratory analyses include performing logistic regression analysis to assess association between the likelihood of achieving or maintaining hemoglobin targets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Sample size and power</title><p>We are aware of no other previous studies examining the effectiveness of a shared decision-making intervention designed for the use of ESAs in CKD or ESRD. Based upon previous experience of using a brief educational worksheet to improve general kidney knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], we estimate a possible doubling or tripling improvement in the odds of improved kidney health knowledge. For the primary outcome of the PAKKD anemia knowledge score (range: 0&#x02013;100&#x000a0;%), preliminary data have showed a mean (standard deviation) improvement of 59&#x000a0;% (20&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Using a <italic>t</italic>-test for independent samples, the calculated minimum detectable difference is 11&#x000a0;% (59&#x000a0;% in control, 70&#x000a0;% in intervention), showing 19&#x000a0;% relative improvement in anemia knowledge score with 80&#x000a0;% power at a 2-sided significance level. For the purposes of this study, the proposed sample size of 100 participants should be adequate and informative.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><p>It has been acknowledged from multiple levels of care and governance that communication of risk and proper use for ESAs in the treatment of anemia in CKD and ESRD is an area of concern that must be addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We designed the Anemia Risk Communication for patients with Kidney Disease (ARC-KD) trial to create and evaluate the effectiveness of a novel ESA decision aid to assist CKD and ESRD patients and providers in deciding whether or not to use ESAs to manage anemia related to underlying kidney disease. Well-designed decision aids have been shown in randomized controlled trials to improve health knowledge, lower decisional conflict, and promote accurate risk perceptions for patients living with a variety of complex health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Decision aids well-designed to address barriers to ISDM for vulnerable patient populations, such as patients with limited health literacy, have been shown to improve patient knowledge. In diabetics, such aids have even been implicated in achieving tighter glycemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. After study completion we will make the decision aid available via the internet for review by the public and use by health professionals.</p><p>Our study will make advances in a clinically important, but understudied, area of kidney disease care. It will also allow us to assess whether this ESA decision aid is associated with higher patient knowledge of anemia, as well as their satisfaction and certainty regarding their decision to use ESAs. By using the ISDM approach to improving patient understanding of the risks associated with ESA use in CKD, we hope to mitigate barriers to effective patient-provider communication such as low health literacy, and develop a resource for providers to use cooperatively with their patients. Patient feedback on the utility of the revised ESA decision aid indicated kidney disease patients who have only recently started receiving anemia treatment may receive the maximum benefit from the implementation of the decision aid tool. Interestingly, patient feedback also suggested the tool could be useful in explaining the impact of anemia to family members. Importantly, as the pharmacologic options for treatment of anemia in kidney disease expand in the future, a kidney-specific anemia therapy decision aid may become a required component of optimized patient-centered care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ARC-KD, the anemia risk communication for patients with kidney disease study; CAT, communication assessment tool; CKD, chronic kidney disease; DALI, decision aid library inventory; DCS, decisional conflict scale; ESA, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents; ESRD, end stage renal disease; FDA, food and drug administration; IPDAS, international patient decision aid standards; ISDM, informed shared decision making; PAKKD, patient anemia knowledge in kidney disease; PEPPI, perceived efficacy in patient-physician interactions</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This research was supported by NIH R03DK93852, R01DK103935 (Cavanaugh) and P30DK079341-05S1.
