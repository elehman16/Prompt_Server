Patients in the trifluridine/tipiracil group had longer durations for most of these events than those in the placebo group but the durations occupied a lower proportion of the total treatment period (with the exception of nausea/vomiting). Notably, only 4% of patients in the trifluridine/tipiracil group discontinued the study due to AEs (vs 2% in the placebo group).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p><p>Our analysis has some limitations. It is not a direct assessment of patients&#x02019; QoL in the RECOURSE trial. However, in the absence of a direct assessment, it adds useful information to the trial findings. One limitation is that hypothetical thresholds were defined for utility coefficients; coefficients were not directly elicited from patients. However, the analysis was not highly sensitive to the coefficient used, in that large variations in the coefficients assigned to the TOX and REL states produce a range of only approximately 0.5 months from minimum to maximum quality-adjusted survival (ie, from 1.28 to 1.73 months). Another limitation is that the analysis did not include all grade 3/4 AEs from the RECOURSE trial but was restricted to those that could be expected to have an impact on QoL. Other AEs were assumed not to affect QoL. On the other hand,&#x000a0;this did not result in a large number of AEs being excluded. The only non-laboratory grade 3/4 AEs listed in the primary study publication that were not included were abdominal pain (reported in 2% of treated and 4% of placebo patients) and stomatitis (reported in&#x000a0;&#x0003c;1% of treated patients).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, the analysis does not take into account the impact of grade 1 and 2 AEs on QoL. Grade 1 and 2 AEs were reported at markedly higher frequencies than grade 3/4 AEs in both study groups, and occurred at higher frequencies in the treated group than the placebo group. Although lower-grade AEs are classed as less severe, they may have an impact on patients&#x02019; QoL, particularly if experienced over a long duration.</p><p>The decision on whether to undertake further chemotherapy following progression after more than one previous line of treatment for mCRC is a complex one for both patients and physicians, and involves weighing potential benefits against potential risks. Potential risks of harm to QoL have been suggested from continuing chemotherapy as patients approach the end of life, even in those with good PS.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Furthermore, gains in OS in the setting of salvage therapy for pretreated mCRC are generally small. However, Price noted that the clinical relevance of relatively small gains in survival might be clearer if they are combined with true gains in symptom control.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Taken together, the QTWiST analysis and the additional findings on PS provide reassurance about the favourable benefit/risk profile of trifluridine/tipiracil in patients with mCRC who progressed on previous therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Quality-adjusted survival showed clinically meaningful improvement in patients treated with trifluridine/tipiracil compared with placebo in pretreated mCRC.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Assistance with drafting of the manuscript was provided by Scinopsis (Frejus, France), funded by Servier.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors contributed to the collection of the data, interpretation of the results, the preparation of the manuscript and approved the decision to submit.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This study was funded by Taiho and Institute de Recherches Internationales Servier.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> JT reports consulting/advisory fees from Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Celgene, Chugai, Imclone Systems Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Merck &#x00026; Co., Merck Serono, Millennium, Novartis, F.
