Patients with heart disease often suffer from sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction has a negative impact on quality of life and well-being in persons with heart disease, and sexual dysfunction is associated with anxiety and depression. Treatment and care possibilities seem to be lacking. Studies indicate that non-pharmacological interventions such as exercise training and psychoeducation possess the potential of reducing sexual dysfunction in patients with heart disease. The CopenHeartSF trial will investigate the effect of a comprehensive sexual rehabilitation programme versus usual care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>CopenHeartSF is an investigator-initiated randomised clinical superiority trial with blinded outcome assessment, with 1:1 central randomisation to sexual rehabilitation plus usual care versus usual care alone. Based on sample size calculations, 154 male patients with impaired sexual function due to implantable cardioverter defibrillator or ischaemic heart disease will be included from two university hospitals in Denmark. All patients receive usual care and patients allocated to the experimental intervention group follow a 12-week sexual rehabilitation programme consisting of an individualised exercise programme and psychoeducative consultation with a specially trained nurse. The primary outcome is sexual function measured by the International Index of Erectile Function. The secondary outcome measure is psychosocial adjustment to illness by the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale, sexual domain. A number of explorative analyses will also be conducted.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>CopenHeartSF is approved by the regional ethics committee (no H-4-2012-168) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (no 2007-58-0015) and is performed in accordance with good clinical practice and the Declaration of Helsinki in its latest form.</p></sec><sec><title>Registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01796353.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CARDIOLOGY</kwd><kwd>REHABILITATION MEDICINE</kwd><kwd>SEXUAL MEDICINE</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The study has been designed to meet the criteria for high quality in non-pharmacological randomised clinical trial with central randomisation, multicentre participation and blinded assessment and analysis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We are aware of the subjective nature of the self-reported primary outcome (International Index of Erectile Function).

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Patients with cardiovascular disease have an increased prevalence of sexual dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3 R4 R5">3&#x02013;5</xref> The causes of sexual dysfunction can be related to physical changes due to the disease, mental changes or adverse reactions to drugs and other interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> Male sexual dysfunction is divided into sexual interest/desire disorders, ejaculation and orgasmic dysfunctions and erectile dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> The most common disorder is erectile dysfunction, defined as the persistent inability to obtain or maintain an erection which enables satisfying sexual activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> Erectile dysfunction is associated with age, but can also be triggered by organic as well as psychogenic conditions and is often related to vascular disease such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Studies including 33&#x02005;451 males estimate that erectile dysfunction in varying degrees exists in 52% of all men, and that age is the most common variable associated with erectile dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3 R4 R5">3&#x02013;5</xref> The probability of complete erectile dysfunction in cardiovascular patients is 39% compared to 10% in the total population when adjusting for age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> this is rarely practiced.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> The consensus or practice on how or where patients with heart disease and sexual dysfunction should be treated is lacking, however, some guidelines about the prescription of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors exist.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> The PDE-5 inhibitors have an overall success rate of 50&#x02013;80% of those treated among patients with cardiovascular disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> PDE-5 inhibitors are generally safe. Linking PDE-5 inhibitors to cardiac events, large randomised trials and a meta-analysis suggest that they are not associated with an increase in myocardial infarction or cardiac events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> In patients with heart disease and no effect of PDE-5 inhibitors, or where PDE-5 inhibitors are contraindicated because of treatment with nitrates, there seems to be no consensus on what treatment should be offered for sexual dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Non-pharmacological treatment potentials</title><p>Non-pharmacological interventions possess potential in reducing sexual dysfunction. Lifestyle factors such as cigarette smoking, hyperlipidaemia and a sedentary lifestyle all predict erectile dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> and these are the same risk factors that predict coronary artery disease. A recent meta-analysis of six randomised trials with 740 patients with no known heart disease, showed that lifestyle modifications such as physical exercise and pharmacotherapy for cardiovascular risk factors were associated with a significant improvement in erectile function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> Furthermore, a randomised trial investigating the effect of exercise training 3&#x02005;h/week or more in patients with no heart disease showed a significant result in improving the person's erectile function compared with controls with no exercise training.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> We hypothesise that these lifestyle modifications can also improve sexual dysfunction in patients with already established heart disease. A systematic literature search showed five randomised clinical trials which examine the effect of physical exercise on sexual dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35 R36 R37 R38 R39">35&#x02013;39</xref> Overall, 591 patients with heart disease were included and the effect was significant in three of the five trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37 R38 R39">37&#x02013;39</xref> However, the trials are characterised as being of small sample sizes, using non-validated tools and mainly focusing on the time before patients return to sexual activity and not on the ability and quality of the sexual performance. Randomised trials that address the psychological aspects of sexual dysfunction are limited in patients with heart disease. However, one randomised trial testing the effect of sexual therapy showed some promising trends when it comes to improving the frequency and quality of sexual activity in male patients postcardiac event beyond the usual cardiac rehabilitation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> However, due to the limited power of the sample in this trial, it did not allow the detection of significant effects. The role of pelvic floor exercises as a treatment of erectile dysfunction is not tested on patients with heart disease, but in the general population 40&#x02013;47% had regained normal erectile function after 3&#x02013;4&#x02005;months of training the pelvic floor muscles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref> As the condition of sexual dysfunction often includes both physical and psychological components, it is plausible to believe that patients with heart disease and sexual dysfunction benefit from a comprehensive rehabilitation intervention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>

Sexual rehabilitation in this trial is defined as: a time-bound planned process with clear goals and means. Sexual rehabilitation is a process where several actors, including the patient, are working towards regaining improved sexual functioning and coping ability according to their sexual function. The comprehensive sexual rehabilitation programme contains a physical exercise component, including training of the pelvic floor and a psychoeducational component.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>The physical components</title><sec id="s3c1"><title>Physical exercise</title><p>The goal of physical exercise is to achieve an improvement in the patient&#x02019;s physical work capacity, and to eliminate the fear and uncertainty the patient may feel in relation to sexual activity as a form of physical activity. The physical exercise intervention is based on The European Society of Cardiology recommendations for physical activity for cardiovascular patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref> The European Society of Cardiology recommends that all adults promote and maintain their fitness, muscle strength, flexibility and bone health several hours a week. Training must be of high intensity and of 30&#x02005;min duration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref> Furthermore, the intervention is supported by European recommendations for physical training in cardiac patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref> and has been tested in two large rehabilitation trials, COPE-ICD and DANREHAB.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref> A professional physiotherapist with specific knowledge of cardiac rehabilitation initiates the physical exercise programme. Together with the patient, the physiotherapist plans and prepares a physical exercise protocol, taking into account the patient&#x02019;s clinical condition and physical abilities. Sixty minutes is allocated for the initial consultation and preparation of individual training protocol, including pelvic floor exercise instructions.</p><p>Physical exercise is initiated at a physiotherapist-supervised setting at the Heart Centre, Rigshospitalet. Using wireless electrodes integrated into t-shirts (Corus-Fit, CardioCardio and Corus Exercise Assistant, V.2.0.16, Finland) potential cardiac arrhythmias, ECG abnormalities such as ST segment changes, T wave alterations, atrial or ventricular arrhythmias and training intensity levels are monitored. The training is initiated with two to three mandatory exercise sessions at Rigshospitalet. Subsequently, the patients can choose to continue the intensive physical exercise regimen either at Rigshospitalet, or at a local CopenHeart-certified facility, supervised by physiotherapists, or as supervised home-based training. Supervised home-based physical training has previously shown similar results to hospital-based training.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref> This finding has been confirmed in a Danish setting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></p><p>One session is structured with 10&#x02005;min warm-up bicycling, 20&#x02005;min bicycling with increased intensity (cardiovascular training), 20&#x02005;min strength exercises and 10&#x02005;min stretching and cool-down period. The warm-up session is performed at the intensity of 11&#x02013;12 on the Borg scale.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref> The 20&#x02005;min cardiovascular training is performed as interval training. Each session is divided into three sections. Each section contains an intensity of 13&#x02013;17 on the Borg scale and time limit (2&#x02013;15&#x02005;min) varying between each section; the second section with longest and highest intensity. A cool-down period of 5&#x02005;min is included after 20&#x02005;min of cardiovascular training. The strength and strength-related exercises primarily target lower body muscles, and comprise the following four exercises: (1) heel rise performed by repetitions of maximal flexion from standing position; (2) step-up by using a step bench of 27&#x02005;cm; (3) leg press standardised, starting with 90&#x000b0; flexion, hyperextension not accepted; (4) 90&#x000b0; pull-down performed in a cable machine to target abdominal muscles. For step-ups and heel-rises, weight load is calculated as a percentage of body weight (5&#x02013;20%) and increased throughout the 12&#x02005;weeks. Load for leg press is estimated from repetition maximum (RM) testing and increases from 60% to 70% of 1 RM during 12&#x02005;weeks of training. All exercises are initiated by 2&#x000d7;12 repetitions and increased through the programme according to standard guidelines for strength training.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></p><p>To achieve cardiovascular adjustment the training begins with a warming-up period and ends with a cool-down period. This cardiovascular adjustment has been shown to reduce the risk of ischaemia and arrhythmia in connection to physical exercise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref> Participants must mainly exercise in an upright position to decrease left ventricular filling pressure and risk of ischaemia or heart-failure-triggered ventricular arrhythmias.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3c2"><title>Pelvic floor exercise</title><p>The bulbocavernosus muscle and the ischiocavernosus muscle, two superficial pelvic floor muscles, are active during erection and enhance rigidity. The bulbocavernosus muscle encircles 33&#x02013;50% of the base of the penis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> The pelvic floor training regimen is inspired by Dorey <italic>et al</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref> who have developed a training regimen for male patients for use in randomised clinical trials. The regiment is developed and tested in a different patient population, and we have therefore modified it to fit cardiovascular patients. Patients are instructed in pelvic floor exercises by a skilled physiotherapist. Patients are instructed to perform their pelvic floor exercises twice daily. Studies showed that a few strong or maximum contractions are more effective when it comes to gaining muscle hypertrophy than several less strong contractions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref> Patients are instructed to tighten their pelvic floor muscles as strongly as possible (as if to prevent flatus from escaping) three times when lying, three times when sitting and three times when standing. The duration of the contraction is up to 10&#x02005;s each, and patients are informed to have a 10&#x02005;s break between each contraction. The physiotherapist instructs the patients on how to contract the bulbocavernosus and ischiocavernosus muscles. In order to ensure that the right muscles are involved, attention is placed on the ability to lift the scrotum and retract the penis. To obtain some degree of pelvic floor muscle endurance, the patients are encouraged to tighten the pelvic floor muscles when walking.</p><p>To encourage adherence and monitor compliance pulse watches (Polar watch) with extended memory and exercise training logs are handed out. A training log contains information about physical exercise as well as pelvic floor exercise. At the end of the intervention the training log and the pulse watch are returned and compliance and intensity level are coded independently.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>The psychoeducational components</title><p>The goal of the psychoeducative intervention is that the patient learns to interpret and react to relevant physical and psychological symptoms, learns to cope with anxiety and fear, including strategies to manage depressive symptoms and the ability to be sexually active without fear.</p><p>A specially trained nurse is responsible for the psychoeducative intervention. The intervention takes a theoretical basis of the patient-centred approach where the emphasis is on support and education. The conversations are based on a holistic view of the patient and focus on the handling of life and managing sexual dysfunction. The intervention is targeted at the modifiable parameters that are reported to affect sexual dysfunction. The psychoeducative intervention is inspired by RR Parse's<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref> &#x02018;Human Becoming Practice Methodologies&#x02019; three dimensions which can be described as (1) discuss and give meaning to the past, present and future; (2) explore and discuss events and opportunities and (3) pursue imagined possibilities. According to this theory, there are three ways to alter its perceived health: creative ideas, see, hear and feel how a situation could be if it was lived in a different way; recognising personal patterns and value priorities and shed light on the paradoxes by looking at incongruence in a situation and change the view of reality. The nurse is &#x02018;truly present&#x02019; in the process through discussion, quiet contemplation and reflection. The psychoeducative intervention plus physical exercise was tested in the COPE-ICD trial, with positive effects on psychological well-being (mental health) and the general health subscale of the Short Form-36.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref> The nurse is trained in the psychoeducative conversation through teaching and supervision of nurses who have experience with the &#x02018;Human Becoming Practice Methodology&#x02019; from the COPE-ICD trial. It is based on the theoretical literature that forms the basis for understanding the processes of practice methodology and existing specialty specific knowledge about heart disease, related symptoms and sexology. The supervisor observes and provides feedback in relation to the methods and goals of the conversation. The emphasis is on openness in the interviews and on the nurse&#x02019;s ability to: be silently present while the patient talks, ask questions that encourage reflection, let the patient find answers and solutions and contribute with knowledge, provide advice and guidance when requested and relevant. The training of the nurse takes place prior to the intervention. In practice the intervention will be handled by one nurse with several years of experience working with cardiac patients and trained in sexology. The sexology experience is gained in a 2-week intensive course on basic and clinical sexology including training in sexual therapy. Supervision from a sexologist is available during the intervention. The nurse will conduct consultations with patients individually, and patients are informed that they are welcome to bring spouses/relatives. The consultation will take place in a quiet room in an outpatient setting and last for 45&#x02005;min. An inspirational guide will form the basis for the consultations. The guide consists of several elements and issues (medical, psychosocial, educational and sexual) that work as inspiration (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>).

Use of PDE-5 inhibitors will be monitored in both intervention groups. To assess outcome measures, patients in the control group will be asked to complete questionnaires on equal terms with participants in the experimental group.

Each PAIS/PAIS-SR item is rated on a 4-point (0 through 3) scale of adjustment, with higher ratings indicating poorer adjustment status. The sexual relationship domain evaluates shifts in the quality of sexual relations due to the current illness or treatment. It consists of six items and the total score ranges from 0 to 18. Low scores indicate good adjustment, and high scores indicate poor adjustment.</p></sec><sec id="s3f3"><title>Exploratory outcomes</title><p>A more extensive evaluation of physical, psychological and demographic status over time will be performed.

Patients will be selected consecutively. Patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator are required to have the device implanted more than 1&#x02005;year prior to inclusion and patients with ischaemic heart disease 1&#x02005;year from event and backward. The 1&#x02005;year limit has been set so that patients are past their rehabilitation if any is provided. Patients will receive the IIEF questionnaire<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref> by mail including a stamped return envelope. Patients with a score &#x02264;25, the accepted cut-off score<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref> on the initial screening, are invited to attend a preliminary interview with the offer to participate in a randomised clinical trial targeting sexual problems. The participant information is sent to the patient along with the invitation. This gives the patient an opportunity to read the material in advance and to prepare possible questions. At the initial interview/meeting it is determined whether the patient meets the criteria for participating in the trial. If patients are suited and want to participate they will be randomised to a comprehensive sexual rehabilitation programme plus usual care versus usual care alone. Stratification will be according to patient group (patients with ischaemic heart disease or implantable cardioverter defibrillator) and age (&#x02264;59 or &#x02265;60&#x02005;years) and randomised 1:1 to the experimental group or the control group. Randomisation will be performed centrally by the trial coordination centre, Copenhagen Trial Unit, according to a computer-generated allocation sequence with a variable block size concealed from the investigators. Allocation to the intervention groups is carried out when the investigator calls the Copenhagen Trial Unit. Relevant information (personal identification number, strata, etc) is typed into a computer system, and then the participant will be allocated to an intervention group and awarded a four-digit randomisation number. The investigator then informs the patient of the result and on how to proceed by letter. Thus, neither investigators nor patients or relatives can influence to which group the patients are allocated. For both groups, follow-up assessment will take place after 12&#x02005;weeks (only physical evaluation), 16&#x02005;weeks and 6&#x02005;months. Questionnaires will be completed electronically in the questionnaire system Enalyzer with &#x02018;single user&#x02019;, which meets the data legislation for logging. At inclusion, the trial participant will receive an email with a link to a website through which questionnaires can be completed. The email contains a login and password for the trial participant&#x02019;s personal access. The participant has the opportunity to go through the website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.copenheart.org">http://www.copenheart.org</ext-link> and enter with the login and password. If patients do not complete the questionnaire electronically, the material can be sent in paper form and an independent trial personnel then enters the responses into the database. Thus data management is handled independently from the researchers who interpret the data. All data are stored electronically in a coded database, and in an independent spread sheet, only accessible for the CopenHeart group. The recruitment process will continue until the number of 154 has been reached.</p></sec><sec id="s3j"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="s3j1"><title>Analysis of primary and secondary outcomes</title><p>The analysis will be performed according to the intention-to-treat analysis with two-sided significance tests at the 0.05 level. Both outcomes (and outcomes subjected to exploratory analyses) will be analysed using the same procedure. First, we will test if there is an immediate effect of the intervention on the outcome and/or a difference in the response to the intervention between the two patient groups (patients with ischaemic heart disease and patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillator) using model 1 below.

The term dI:G stands for interaction between the two covariates I and G. If the term bI is significant (the coefficient b differs significantly from 0) there is an effect of the intervention common for the two patient groups (ischaemic patients and patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillator). If the term dI:G is significant there is an additional effect of the intervention in one of the two patient groups; thus a subgroup analysis is warranted. In the analysis of the data the univariate general linear model is used. The analysis of the primary outcome is the primary analysis. The subgroup analysis and the analysis of the secondary and of other outcomes should be considered exploratory.</p><p><italic>Model 2</italic> In the analysis of follow-up data the time T (Y is measured 16&#x02005;weeks and 6&#x02005;months following randomisation) is included and the mixed model for repeated measures is used.

If in addition gI:T:G is significant this added trend differs between the two patient groups (patients with ischaemic heart disease and patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillator).

The range of potential bias in case the missing values should not be random is assessed by doing two imputations (1) imputing missing outcome value in one group by minimum value found in the material and missing outcome value in the other group by maximum value found in material and (2) vice versa. Then in each case an unadjusted analysis is performed to estimate the parameter of interest.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The trial complies with the latest Declaration of Helsinki and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01796353).

Trial participants are free to withdraw their informed consent at any time and be treated according to the departments&#x02019; standard treatment procedures. A patient will be withdrawn from the trial if the trial participant withdraws his consent and will, in connection therewith, be informed that termination of the trial will have no implications for his future treatment. Patients who leave the trial will be politely asked for permission to continue to collect data and to use already collected data. If the patient gives permission, he will be included in the final analysis. Only if the patient refuses use of already collected data, will all data relating to him be destroyed. All patient data will be handled and stored in accordance with Danish Data Protection Agency rules and patients are ensured anonymity. The trial will be conducted according to the Act No. 593 of 14 June 2011 on Act on Research Ethics Review of Health Research Projects. The investigator will immediately notify the regional ethics committee if, within the interventions period, there occur serious adverse events, serious adverse reactions or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions. The report will be accompanied by comments on possible implications for the trial, and notification will be made within 7&#x02005;days after the investigator has knowledge of the event. The trial has no data monitoring committee however an internal monitor will perform random checks to see if the trial staff work according to the protocol. No risks are anticipated to occur during the sexual rehabilitation programme. As far as we know, there is no previous risk associated with nursing consultations. If the nurse, during the consultation, identifies a need for further consultations with professionals, she will encourage the participant to seek help from the general practitioner, psychologist or in their usual outpatient setting. Risks associated with exercise training and testing are sudden cardiac death associated with ventricular arrhythmias, acute myocardial infarction, and in patients with chronic heart failure, pulmonary oedema and deterioration in left ventricular function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref> The last is only found in one study from 1988<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref> and has not subsequently been demonstrated in larger studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref> In a recent French study of more than 25&#x02005;000 patients with ischaemic heart disease, one-third with chronic heart failure found the risk of cardiac complications at 1:8500 exercise testing and 1:50&#x02005;000 patient exercise hours.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref> Increasing exercise intensity and age are risk indicators. Therefore, the training intensity will be conducted as moderate high intensity (less than 80% of VO<sub>2</sub> max). To achieve cardiovascular adjustment exercise training as well as testing begins with a warming-up period and ends with a cool-down period, with a gradual downward adjustment of exercise intensity and HR, rather than an abrupt end. This cardiovascular adjustment has been shown to reduce the risk of ischaemia and arrhythmia in connection with physical exercise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref> Participants must mainly exercise in an upright position to decrease left ventricular filling pressure and risk of ischaemia or heart failure triggered ventricular arrhythmias. When these precautions are respected, exercise training as well as exercise testing are considered to possess a low risk for the participants. There is, as far as we know, no previously known risk associated with pelvic floor exercise. Testing or examination of the pelvic floor may be associated with discomfort for the participants but is not considered to be associated with any risk.
