The gas exchange measurement (GEM; GEM Nutrition Ltd) and the ECAL (Health Professional Solutions) are alternative measuring systems. The aim of this study was to compare the ECAL and GEM with Deltatrac for measures of RMR and the GEM to the Deltatrac for measures of diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT). Twenty healthy participants were tested on test day 1 (T1) and test day 2 (T2). RMR was measured in a randomised order for 30&#x000a0;min on the Deltatrac, the GEM and the ECAL. Following this, a 1553&#x000a0;kJ meal was consumed and DIT was measured on the Deltatrac and the GEM in alternating 15&#x000a0;min intervals for 4&#x000a0;h. The GEM reported consistently higher values than the Deltatrac for V<sub>O2</sub>, V<sub>CO2</sub>, RMR and fat oxidation (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;005). The ECAL was significantly higher than the Deltatrac for measures of VO<sub>2</sub>, RMR, carbohydrate oxidation (T2) and respiratory quotient and fat oxidation (T1, T2) (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;05). There were no significant differences within repeated RMR measures on the ECAL, the GEM or the Deltatrac. DIT measures were consistently higher on the GEM (T1) (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;005); however, there were no significant differences between repeated measures. The findings suggest that while the GEM and the ECAL were not accurate alternatives to the Deltatrac, they may be reliable for repeated measures.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>RMR</kwd><kwd>Diet-induced thermogenesis</kwd><kwd>GEM</kwd><kwd>ECAL</kwd><kwd>Deltatrac</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbreviations"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>CHO, carbohydrate</kwd><kwd>DIT, diet-induced thermogenesis</kwd><kwd>EE, energy expenditure</kwd><kwd>GEM, gas exchange measurement</kwd><kwd>MCT, medium-chain TAG</kwd><kwd>RQ, respiratory quotient</kwd><kwd>T1, test day 1</kwd><kwd>T2, test day 2</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="4"/><ref-count count="40"/><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Indirect calorimetry is a method used to estimate RMR and diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) from measurements of V<sub>O2</sub> and carbon dioxide production (V<sub>CO2</sub>)<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. RMR can account for 45&#x02013;70&#x000a0;% of daily total energy expenditure (EE) and DIT about 10&#x000a0;%, based on consuming a variety of foods<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Measures of EE are fundamental to nutritional assessments in clinical and research settings. The use of indirect calorimetry provides more accurate measures compared with predictive equations which have been reported to over or under estimate in some populations<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. However, indirect calorimeters are expensive therefore these equations remain in use in a number of clinical settings.</p><p>In a clinical setting the precision of measurements on indirect calorimeters is critical as these data are primarily used for determining the energy requirements of patients to prevent under or over feeding<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. In a research or weight-loss setting users often measure differences in metabolic rate over time<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> or following an intervention<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. In these circumstances, the accuracy of repeated measures on the same machine (i.e. repeatability) is of upmost importance.</p><p>For over 24 years the Deltatrac&#x02122; II Metabolic Monitor (Datex-Ohmeda Inc.) has been considered the standard reference tool in indirect calorimetry. It has been validated <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> for use in clinical and research settings<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> and is therefore often used as a comparison in many validation studies<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Now that the Deltatrac is no longer commercially available there is increasing interest in alternative indirect calorimeters<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. An attractive alternative to the Deltatrac would be less expensive and require minimal technical expertise for maintenance and use. Furthermore, mobile indirect calorimeters are appealing to wider audiences who require greater accuracy in the field and a machine that can be easily transported. Numerous studies have compared indirect calorimeters against the Deltatrac using both portable and hooded versions for measures of RMR<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, and to a lesser extent, DIT<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Conclusions have been conflicting with some studies reporting agreement between methods<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> and other studies rejecting agreement<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Making comparisons between machines can be problematic due to differences in how measures are collected, in particular, between the portable calorimeters and the hooded canopies. Indirect calorimeters that use a ventilated hood such as the Deltatrac are often set to generate data from V<sub>O2</sub> and V<sub>CO2</sub> samples at 1&#x000a0;min intervals. In contrast, other calorimeters, such as the Cosmed K4 b<sup>2</sup> are able to perform a measurement on every breath<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Measures collected also vary between machines, with some calorimeters such as the MedGem RMR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Microlife), collecting V<sub>O2</sub> and subsequently calculating V<sub>CO2</sub> using an assumed value of 0&#x000b7;85 for the respiratory quotient (RQ). Consistently, most machines use a modified Weir equation to calculate RMR<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A potential replacement for the Deltatrac is the gas exchange measurement (GEM, GEM Nutrition Ltd). Similar to the Deltatrac, the GEM is an open circuit indirect calorimeter using a ventilated hood. A clear plastic hemispherical canopy is placed over the participant's head and the exhaled air is drawn through a Nafion tube into a mixing chamber. Here, it is diluted with the room air before V<sub>O2</sub> and V<sub>CO2</sub> sensors collect a sample. In contrast to the Deltatrac, which assumes a constant flow of air, the GEM measures the actual flow rate through the hood, which can be varied in the range of 20 to 80&#x000a0;litres/min. Like the Deltatrac, the GEM measures V<sub>O2</sub> using a paramagnetic oxygen sensor and V<sub>CO2</sub> using an IR sensor. Data on the GEM are also reported at 1&#x000a0;min intervals.</p><p>A potential portative replacement to the Deltatrac is the ECAL (Health Professional Solutions). The ECAL is a novel open circuit portable indirect calorimeter that measures both V<sub>O2</sub> and V<sub>CO2</sub> using a small mixing chamber. The ECAL was primarily designed to be used by health professionals and therefore is low maintenance and requires little technical expertise. The machine uses a proprietary mouth piece (patent pending) and nose clip. V<sub>O2</sub> is measured using a galvanic fuel cell oxygen analyser. V<sub>CO2</sub> is measured using a patented ultra-low power V<sub>CO2</sub> analyser which uses light emitting diode and detector technology in a novel non-dispersive near IR absorption sensor. Data on the ECAL are reported for each breath cycle.</p><p>The present study had two main outcomes. The first was to compare two new indirect calorimeters (the ECAL and GEM) with the Deltatrac for measures of RMR. The second was to compare the GEM with the Deltatrac for measures of DIT. To our knowledge this was the first study to compare RMR measures from the ECAL and the GEM to the Deltatrac, and, the first study to compare the GEM to the Deltatrac for measures of DIT.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Methods</title><p>The present study was a randomised, crossover study with repeated measures on two different days within a 2-week time period.</p><sec id="sec1-1" sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty healthy participants (four males and sixteen females) were recruited for the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab01">Table 1</xref>) by means of advertisements displayed throughout Oxford Brookes University and classified advertisements on a local website.

Pressure was measured then adjusted to match ambient air pressure as reported in the daily weather forecast. Measurements were collected using a ventilated hood and artefact suppression was switched off.

Calibrations were performed before each use, when the machine was left idle for more than 20&#x000a0;min, and after every 2&#x000a0;h of continuous use (as per the manufacturer's recommendation). Gas was calibrated using standard calibration gases (Boc) to 1&#x000a0;% CO<sub>2</sub> and 20&#x000a0;% O<sub>2</sub>.

Body weight and percentage body fat were collected using the Tanita BC-418 MA (Tanita UK Ltd). Height was measured to the nearest centimetre using a stadiometer (Seca Ltd). Participants were rested in a supine position for 30&#x000a0;min during which their blood pressure was checked using a digital blood pressure monitor (A&#x00026;D UA-767).</p><p>During RMR and DIT testing, participants were requested to minimise movements and remain awake throughout the measurement period. Participants could read or watch films on a laptop which, if required, was positioned on a small table sat over the bed. The Deltatrac and GEM measurements were collected with the participant in a supine position. ECAL measurements were collected with the participant in a semi-reclined position with a cushion supporting the mouthpiece connector, so it was not necessary for the participant to hold it. Participants were allowed to remove the mouthpiece momentarily during testing if they needed to swallow but were told to replace it as soon as possible. Temporary removal of the ECAL mouthpiece creates an abnormal airflow and consequently those data are not recorded. Room temperature was maintained throughout at between 22 and 24&#x000b0;C and blankets were available on request. All measurements were taken by the same trained investigator.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-7"><title>Energy expenditure</title><p>RMR was determined by the Deltatrac, GEM and ECAL indirect calorimeters. The order of machines was randomly allocated on each test day using a random-order generator (Oxford Brookes University).

DIT is related to meal size and 4&#x000a0;h has been reported as an adequate amount of time for 78&#x000a0;% of the DIT to be measured, increasing to 90&#x000a0;% in meals less than 3343&#x000a0;kJ<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>.

The averages of the remaining 10&#x000a0;min of data were used for analysis. DIT was calculated as the increase in EE above RMR values for 4&#x000a0;h after meal intake.

The strength of relations was determined using Pearson's correlation coefficient and Bland Altman plots were used to determine agreement of machines compared with the Deltatrac. The 95&#x000a0;% limits of agreement were calculated as the mean difference plus or minus two standard deviations of the differences, within which 95&#x000a0;% of differences between measurements by the two methods are expected to lie.</p><p>For DIT measures, an average time point for each 30&#x000a0;min period on the same machine was calculated.

The CCMExpress<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> face mask underestimated by a small non-significant amount; however, as with the ECAL, there was high variability and it was rejected based on wide limits of agreement (21 (<sc>sd</sc> 841) kJ/d (LOA &#x02212;1661 and 1703&#x000a0;kJ/d))<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. The VO2000 facemask (Medgraphics) was the only machine accepted based on measures coming within 5&#x000a0;% of those on the Deltatrac<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. The majority of comparison studies tend to use the MedGem RMR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, a portable calorimeter that uses a mouthpiece to measure VO<sub>2</sub>; however, they report mixed conclusions<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Frankenfield &#x00026; Coleman<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> reported that of eight portable calorimeter studies only two studies reported agreement to the Deltatrac, both reporting that this was based on there being low, non-significant differences between the machines<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Of two validation studies comparing DIT measures from a hood and a mouthpiece to the Deltatrac, both concluded agreement between methods<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Blond <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> found agreement based on the magnitude of DIT (as a % of TEE) of 4&#x000b7;9 (<sc>sd</sc> 1&#x000b7;9) % on the Deltatrac and 4&#x000b7;9 (<sc>sd</sc> 2&#x000b7;0) % on the Quark<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, the present study saw a comparable magnitude of DIT values between the GEM (T1, T2) and the Deltatrac (T2) ranging from 11&#x000b7;4 (<sc>sd</sc> 5&#x000b7;0) to 11&#x000b7;9 (<sc>sd</sc> 4&#x000b7;0) %. This was higher than the theoretical magnitude of DIT, which is estimated at 7&#x02013;9&#x000a0;% of EE<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> despite the present study having a lower-energy content meal (1553&#x000a0;kJ <italic>v.</italic> 2872&#x000a0;kJ). The addition of MCT to the meal may explain some of this extra energy and has been shown to increase EE by about 9&#x000b7;4&#x000a0;% when used in these quantities<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. St-Onge <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> used a 2510&#x000a0;kJ meal in their validation of the MedGem, which, despite a large over estimation by the MedGem of DIT measures (1448&#x000a0;kJ/d) they accepted as an accurate alternative to the Deltatrac based on a finding of no bias between measures of post-prandial EE (the mean of all EE measures after meal consumption).</p><p>Conflicting results between studies may be, in part, down to differences in study design. Some studies do not include a repeated measure<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> or use healthy participants in a non-fasted state<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Comparisons made under non-standardised conditions make it even harder to determine if the variation is due to physiological factors or machine variation<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, some studies reject new methods without defining what an acceptable variation from the old method would be<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Setting limits for acceptable variation between indirect calorimeters is subjective, nevertheless, studies should at least provide a rationale for the basis of their conclusions.</p><p>Expectations for machines to agree are confounded by the variation that exists not only biologically within individuals, but also between the function and design of the machines. The adaptability of the mouthpiece allows it to be used in a wide range of settings, however, increased levels of discomfort, changes in breathing patterns and the energy cost of being in an upright position are suggested as some of the reasons for the increased values commonly observed in mouthpiece measures<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Using a facemask may have improved on some of these factors, however, as the ECAL was designed to be used with a mouthpiece the manufacturer's protocol was followed. Compher <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> summarised that the additional cost of a mouthpiece is about 293&#x000a0;kJ. This value is not consistent with the differences observed in the present study of 459&#x000a0;kJ (T1) and 1064&#x000a0;kJ (T2) suggesting the differences were due to additional factors. A mouthpiece can introduce the potential for leakages if the participant does not form a complete seal around it; however, the results gave no indication of this. Additionally, all participants successfully completed 30&#x000a0;min with relative ease.</p><p>When comparisons between indirect calorimeters and an established reference standard are made it is not possible to be certain which machine is reporting accurately, therefore, agreement of methods is measured with the assumption that the reference standard is accurate. Inaccessibility to new parts meant it was not possible to perform monthly methanol burns on the Deltatrac as a way to measure the accuracy of readings. Furthermore, the Deltatrac is an old machine and poor consistency between RQ values on repeated measures were observed, implying the possibility that the Deltatrac may not be a reliable reference, a conclusion also suggested in another, recent study<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. It may be possible to compare trends between machines as the magnitude of difference should in theory be similar even if the values themselves are not (as observed on the GEM in the present study). Another, more consistent measure of a machine's validity is its reliability of repeated measures. Whether measuring individuals for research purposes or for health, it is the consistency of the machine that will enable changes over time to be measured. If the reliability of a machine cannot be proven this would suggest that agreement between methods is likely to be poor too<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, for every validation study both accuracy and repeatability should be measured (and regularly checked). However, studies that include both are limited. This is surprising as acceptable differences in repeated measures of RMR within the same individual are well established in the literature, with the Deltatrac variation reported to be within 5&#x000a0;%<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. In a systematic review by Compher <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> they conclude that day-to-day subject variation ranges from 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;% over a 24&#x000a0;h period increasing to about 10&#x000a0;% when measured over weeks or months. When the present study calculated the mean difference on an individual level it found that overall mean differences in RMR on the GEM were 6&#x000b7;9 and 5&#x000b7;4&#x000a0;% on the Deltatrac. This was slightly above the 5&#x000a0;% observed in previous Deltatrac studies<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> but within the 10&#x000a0;% variation observed in other studies of a similar length<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. When the individual data was analysed further it was found that 50&#x000a0;% of measures on the GEM and 60&#x000a0;% of measures on the Deltatrac were within 5&#x000a0;%, increasing to 75 and 90&#x000a0;% respectively within 10&#x000a0;%.</p><p>A variation study comparing intra-individual variation of a portable calorimeter, the MOXUS Modular V<sub>O2</sub> mouthpiece (AEL Technologies), to the Deltatrac was investigated by Roffey <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. They concluded that after 5&#x000a0;d of separate testing the CV of the MOXUS was 7&#x000b7;3 (<sc>sd</sc> 2&#x000b7;3) % <italic>v.</italic> 5&#x000b7;3 (<sc>sd</sc> 1&#x000b7;2) % on the Deltatrac. The present study found the CV of the ECAL to be 11&#x000b7;2 (<sc>sd</sc> 12&#x000b7;1) %, however, if one participant was excluded this came down to 8&#x000b7;9 (<sc>sd</sc> 6&#x000b7;5) %. When analyses of the individual differences on the ECAL were made it was found that 40&#x000a0;% of participants had repeated RMR measures within 10&#x000a0;%. Two other mouthpiece studies that looked at individual values reported 43&#x000a0;% of measures coming within 5&#x000a0;%<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> and 80&#x000a0;% of measures coming within 10&#x000a0;%<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Fewer studies measured DIT repeatability. A recent study by Ruddick-Collins <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the day-to-day variability of DIT measurements were high, with CV typically in the range of 15&#x02013;29&#x000a0;% although in one study it was as high as 42&#x000a0;%. Despite the present study observing non-significant differences between DIT measures, CV on the Deltatrac was 36 and 30&#x000a0;% on the GEM. These values were similar to Ruddick-Collins <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> who reported a CV of 29&#x000a0;% in measurements lasting 4&#x000a0;h. It was unclear why CV values were so high. DIT calculations were based on RMR which, although produced much lower CV values, does introduce additional error into the calculation. Some studies have used a fixed RMR value in an attempt to overcome this issue with some seeing an improvement in measures and others not<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Despite using standardised methods, DIT is relatively small compared with RMR and therefore very sensitive to the noise associated with boredom, fidgeting and restlessness<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. There may also have been an effect of familiarisation with the machines and procedures on the second day of testing which could explain some of the variation<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although the ECAL was designed for measuring RMR over a 10&#x000a0;min period, in the present study data were collected from subjects for 30&#x000a0;min to ensure consistency of protocol. To investigate the effect this may have had on the results the first 10&#x000a0;min were analysed separately (data not shown); however, there was no indication of any significant differences compared with the findings reported using the 20&#x000a0;min data. Towards the end of the study it emerged that RQ values on the ECAL had dropped below 0&#x000b7;70 on the final six sessions which is below physiological normal<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. The ECAL was designed for health professionals assuming little technical expertise therefore the facility to perform a methanol burn are presently not included. Investigations by the researchers and manufacturers were unable to identify the cause of this therefore all subjects were included in the final analysis. Results excluding these participants were analysed separately (data not shown) and as expected, RQ values were no longer significantly different to the Deltatrac. There was also an improvement in repeatability measures with a CV of 8&#x000b7;1&#x000a0;%. The manufacturer is presently investigating the issue.</p><p>One limitation of the present study was the uneven number of male and female participants therefore the data between these two groups was not analysed separately. Some intra-individual variation can potentially be reduced by taking simultaneous measures; however, this was not attempted in the present study as there have been conflicting results using this method<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. During DIT measures an attempt to correct for this was made by swapping the hood every 15&#x000a0;min, however, we cannot be sure whether this may have contributed to the restlessness of the participant although excluding the first 5&#x000a0;min of data should have controlled for this.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study found that the GEM and the ECAL were not accurate alternatives to the Deltatrac; however, it cannot be discounted that the Deltatrac itself may not have been a reliable comparison. This finding highlights the importance of improving the rigour of measures collected in comparison and validation studies<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. The differences observed between machines support recommendations by previous studies that machines should not be used inter-changeably<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study recommends that all validation studies include a measure of repeatability as there is a greater consensus on intra-individual variation within the literature. Based on these measures the GEM can be advocated as a reliable alternative to the Deltatrac. The ECAL CV was within acceptable ranges (once data were excluded); however, technical issues with the machine demonstrated by the decreased RQ values suggest further research may be needed to ensure its repeatability can be maintained.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge financial support from Oxford Brookes University.
