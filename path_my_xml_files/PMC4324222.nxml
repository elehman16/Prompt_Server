The threat of a new pandemic persists as novel avian influenza A strains continue to emerge with the ability to induce high mortality (but, to date, limited transmissibility) in humans. These antigenically distinct influenza viruses are categorized, based on phylogenetic characterization and sequence homology of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene, into clades. In the United States, a key component of pandemic preparedness is the National Prepandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile [<xref rid="OFU091C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which currently contains 4 H5N1 avian influenza strain vaccines (clade 1, A/Vietnam/1203/2004; clade 2.1.3, A/Indonesia/05/2005; clade 2.2, A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/1A/2005; and clade 2.3.4, A/Anhui/1/2005). The rationale behind the stockpile is that a vaccine made from pre-pandemic subtype virus would provide partial cross-protection through immunologic priming [<xref rid="OFU091C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], thereby benefiting first responders and other high-risk or priority groups before a better-matched vaccine against the pandemic strain becomes available. Because vaccines comprising H5N1 and other avian pandemic strains have had poor immunogenicity in unprimed populations [<xref rid="OFU091C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="OFU091C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], 2 immune-enhancing adjuvants have been included in the stockpile (AS03 and MF59). The AS03 adjuvant is a proprietary oil-in-water emulsion product, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, which has been in advanced clinical development for use with a number of seasonal, 2009 pandemic A(H1N1), and pandemic-potential avian influenza (eg, H5N1 and H7N9) virus vaccines. Nonetheless, the optimal strategy for use of pandemic vaccine with adjuvants is incompletely elucidated.</p><p>Given the urgent time frame for vaccine development once an influenza pandemic is declared, it is likely that several manufacturers would be tasked to produce both vaccines and adjuvants sufficient to protect the global population. Maximum flexibility could be realized by pairing vaccines and adjuvants postmanufacture. To assess the feasibility of this approach, we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated influenza A(H5N1) virus vaccine administered alone or in combination with AS03 adjuvant, formulated at the point of care.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Vaccine</title><p>The investigational subvirion inactivated monovalent vaccine was manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur from clade 2.1.3 influenza A(H5N1) (A/Indonesia/05/2005) PR8-IBCDC-RG2 virus, and provided in multidose vials containing either 20 &#x000b5;g/mL or 60 &#x000b5;g/mL HA, as determined by single radial immunodiffusion. Sterile phosphate-buffered saline, provided in single-use vials, was used as diluent. AS03 adjuvant, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, is a proprietary oil-in-water emulsion containing DL-&#x003b1;-tocopherol, squalene, and Tween 80 in 10-dose vials. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) provided the vaccine and adjuvant from the National Prepandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile. All doses of vaccine with or without adjuvant were mixed just prior to administration in the investigational pharmacy at each site.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Design</title><p>Subjects were enrolled at 4 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)&#x02013;sponsored Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units from May through August 2011 (University of Maryland School of Medicine, Group Health Research Institute, Vanderbilt University, and Baylor College of Medicine). The study was approved by the institutional review boards for each clinical site and conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment. Eligible persons were healthy men and nonpregnant women aged 18&#x02013;49 years who were screened for the absence of chronic illnesses and had an erythrocyte sedimentation rate &#x0003c;30 mm/hour. (Enrollment criteria are described in NCT01317758 and the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ofid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ofid/ofu091/-/DC1">Supplementary Material.</ext-link>)</p><p>Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either adjuvanted or unadjuvanted vaccine, then randomized into 1 of 3 groups (1:1:1) to receive 2 intramuscular doses of vaccine, spaced 21 days apart, at 3.75, 7.5, or 15 &#x000b5;g of HA. Dilution of vaccine and mixture with adjuvant, when indicated, was performed by an unblinded pharmacist and administered by an unblinded vaccinator, neither of whom were involved in clinical evaluations. Subjects were observed for 20 minutes after each vaccination to detect adverse events (AEs). For the next 8 days, they recorded a daily oral temperature and the occurrence of injection site (pain, tenderness, erythema, and induration) and systemic reactions (feverishness, chills, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, and nausea). Interim AEs were collected 2 days after each vaccination by telephone and on days 8, 29, and 42 at the clinic. On days 81, 141, 201, and 386, subjects were interviewed to capture serious AEs (SAEs) and new-onset chronic medical conditions. Clinical safety hematology and chemistry laboratory values were collected before and 8 days after each vaccination. Subjects graded the severity of their symptoms as mild (no interference with normal activities), moderate (some interference with normal activities), or severe (prevented normal activities). Clinical signs and abnormal laboratory values were graded using predefined criteria. Serum was collected on days 0 (prevaccination), 8, 21 (before second vaccination), 29, and 42 for assessment of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralization (MN) antibody responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Laboratory Assays</title><p>In additional to the conventional HAI assay, the MN assay was also performed because it is a functional antibody assay and because there is no correlate of protection for avian influenza viruses. The HAI and MN responses were measured at a central laboratory (Southern Research, Birmingham, Alabama) as previously described [<xref rid="OFU091C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="OFU091C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] against the homologous A/Indonesia/05/2005 reassortant virus (primary immunogenicity endpoint) as well as 4 heterologous antigenically drifted reassortant H5N1 strains: A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (clade 1), A/Anhui/1/2005 (clade 2.3.4), A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 (clade 2.2.1), and A/Hubei/1/2010 (clade 2.3.2.1).

The primary immunological endpoints were the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of HAI antibody, the proportion of subjects achieving an HAI titer of &#x02265;1:40 (seroprotective titer), and the frequency of &#x02265;4-fold increases in HAI antibody (seroconversion) to A/Indonesia/05/2005 in each group 21 days after receipt of the second vaccination (day 42). Secondary immunological endpoints included the MN responses to these 3 parameters. Exploratory immunological endpoints included the HAI and MN responses (to these same parameters) to the 4 heterologous H5N1 strains.</p><p>AEs were analyzed using the most severe grade assigned, dichotomizing into a binary variable (none vs mild or moderate or severe). Comparisons between groups were made using Fisher exact test, and estimates of group differences are reported using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.</p><p>For immunological endpoints, GMTs were analyzed on a logarithmic scale, with 95% confidence interval calculated using the normal approximation, and then converted back to the original scale. General linear models with adjuvant as a fixed effect, dose as a continuous variable, and the interaction of the 2, were fit to the log-transformed titer data to examine the dose response for both HAI and MN. Models were fit separately for day 42 and day 21. Separate logistic regression models were used to examine the dose-response relationship at day 42 and day 21 for the seroprotection and seroconversion endpoints. All reported <italic>P</italic> values are 2-sided.</p><p>Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.2).

Both local and systemic reactions were more common following adjuvanted vaccine than following nonadjuvanted vaccine. Although severe grade reactions were rare, 15 of the 16 subjects who reported them received adjuvant vaccine. Malaise and headache were the most common systemic reactions, and tenderness and pain were the most common injection site reactions. All reactions were self-limited and resolved within several days.

This is approximately 12 times the dose of each HA antigen contained in seasonal influenza vaccines and would have limited utility in a pandemic setting where vaccine quantities are limited and mass vaccination of large populations is required. Aluminum salt&#x02013;based adjuvants combined with H5 vaccines afforded little if any enhancement of the immune response [<xref rid="OFU091C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFU091C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These disappointing results prompted a search for novel adjuvants and delivery systems. A major advance was the finding that 2 doses of an H5N1 influenza vaccine containing AS03 with as little as 3.8 &#x000b5;g of HA antigen elicited HAI antibody responses &#x02265;1:40 to a homologous A/Vietnam/1194/2004 [<xref rid="OFU091C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] clade 1 virus and an A/Indonesia/05/2005 clade 2.1 virus [<xref rid="OFU091C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] in at least 80% of adults. Nonetheless, questions remain about the ability to provide sufficient amounts of adjuvanted vaccine in a timely fashion to protect the global population against an emerging influenza pandemic.</p><p>To this end, US HHS BARDA contracted with vaccine and adjuvant manufacturers to ensure the production of at least 150 million doses of a pandemic influenza vaccine. Furthermore, companies provided their proprietary adjuvants for government-sponsored, independent evaluations with influenza vaccines from other manufacturers [<xref rid="OFU091C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This strategy was intended to provide proprietary adjuvants quickly and for use in combination with pandemic antigens produced by other manufacturers [<xref rid="OFU091C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our findings strongly support that stockpiled AS03 adjuvant combined with candidate pandemic vaccines are highly immunogenic. Within 8 days after the second dose (day 29), &#x0003e;90% of subjects achieved seroprotective antibody levels. Although a single dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine elicited seroprotective responses in only one-third of subjects, mathematical models predict a significant reduction in attack rates even with low-efficacy pandemic vaccines [<xref rid="OFU091C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Our study was not designed to fully evaluate the timing and stability of the mixing of vaccine antigen and adjuvant&#x02014;that is, our mix-and-match strategy was administered within 8 hours of preparation. A similar study among adults &#x02265;50 years of age would be important.</p><p>The AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine used in this study elicited immune responses to the homologous viral strain, irrespective of HA dosage, that approached or exceeded the response needed to support US Food and Drug Administration licensure of pandemic inactivated influenza vaccine product for use in young adults [<xref rid="OFU091C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, only 3.75 &#x000b5;g of HA per dose was sufficient to achieve this benchmark, allowing the National Stockpile to have 24 times more doses available than if 90-&#x000b5;g doses were required. Peak antibody titers were observed as early as 8 days following the second dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine. This rapid (anamnestic) response to the second dose is likely the result of robust immunologic priming elicited by the first dose, leading to the speculation that the immunization schedule resulted in the induction of strong immunologic memory, a correlate of enduring protection [<xref rid="OFU091C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="OFU091C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Immunologic measurements 6 and 12 months after the second vaccination will be performed to test this hypothesis. Moreover, we hypothesize that T-cell priming that may occur even in the absence of serological responses is capable of limiting viral replication and thereby ameliorate disease severity, viral shedding, and presumably transmission [<xref rid="OFU091C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Phylogenic and antigenic analyses of the HA antigen of H5N1 viruses collected since 1997 indicates the evolution into different sublineages or clades [<xref rid="OFU091C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The ability of a pandemic vaccine to induce cross-clade responses is fundamental to the ability to provide immunologic priming to a population while awaiting manufacture of a vaccine that matches the emergent pandemic strain. Although it is unlikely that a single dose that elicits cross-clade seroprotective responses in &#x02264;13% of recipients will prevent infection, the rapid response following the second dose is noteworthy; remarkably, 2 doses of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, using the 3.75-&#x000b5;g dosage, resulted in seroprotective HAI responses on day 29 in 57% of subjects for A/Anhui/1/2005, 58% for A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005, 48% for A/Vietnam/1203/2004, and 34% for A/Hubei/1/2010. Our results are consistent with prior studies involving naive subjects who received an A/Indonesia/05/2005-based inactivated vaccine and AS03 adjuvant and developed robust cross-clade antibodies elicited against clade 1 (A/Vietnam/1194/2004), clade 2.2 (A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005), and clade 2.3.4 (A/Anhui/1/2005) viruses [<xref rid="OFU091C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="OFU091C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFU091C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In our study, there was also a clear dose-response curve with adjuvanted vaccine, generally resulting in the strongest cross-clade responses with the highest dosage evaluated (15 &#x000b5;g).</p><p>The laboratory assays were performed in an independent laboratory with extensive prior experience measuring immune responses to avian influenza strains. However, the results between the HAI and MN assays did not always closely correlate. The MN assay is generally a substantially more sensitive means of detecting antibodies to H5N1 viruses [<xref rid="OFU091C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. On the other hand, the MN assay has not been internationally standardized and surrogate endpoints that correlate with protection have not yet been defined [<xref rid="OFU091C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. According to amino acid sequence analysis of the HA region of our selected H5N1 viruses, the results of the MN assay more closely resembled the antigenic distance predicted; the relationship is: A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (closest to the reference), then A/Vietnam/1203/2004, then A/Anhui/1/2005, and lastly A/Hubei/1/2010 (the most antigenically distant strain).</p><p>The vaccines were well tolerated and, in general, adverse effects were transient in nature. Nonetheless, there was clearly more reactogenicity involving both injection site and systemic events when the vaccine contained AS03 adjuvant. We did not observe any new-onset medical conditions or cases of narcolepsy, although recent evidence suggests that the occurrence of narcolepsy may be related to antigenic mimicry involving H1 HA epitopes and not based on adjuvant exposure alone [<xref rid="OFU091C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We are mindful that concerns about increased adverse effects with the use of AS03, real or perceived, could impact public acceptability of vaccination, especially when public perception of disease risk is low.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated the feasibility of a strategy in which proprietary adjuvants available in the US National Prepandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile could be combined with pandemic avian antigens produced by other manufacturers [<xref rid="OFU091C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This approach has the potential to substantially increase the supply of effective vaccine and to add flexibility and speed to the responses available for controlling an emerging influenza pandemic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ofid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ofid/ofu091/-/DC1">Supplementary material</ext-link> is available online at <italic>Open Forum Infectious Diseases</italic> (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://OpenForumInfectiousDiseases.oxfordjournals.org/">http://OpenForumInfectiousDiseases.oxfordjournals.org/</uri>).</p>
