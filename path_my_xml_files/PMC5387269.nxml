There are randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different sedative protocols for dental procedures; however, the evidence for superiority of one form over another is weak. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of intranasally administered ketamine plus midazolam for the dental treatment of children.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We have designed a three-armed, parallel RCT to assess intranasal sedation using ketamine/midazolam in terms of the following measures: efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Two- to 6-year-old healthy children, referred for dental treatment in a dental sedation center in Brazil due to uncooperative behavior and requiring restorative dental procedures, will be recruited. Each child will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups: A &#x02013; Intranasal administration of ketamine (4.0&#x000a0;mg/kg, maximum 100&#x000a0;mg) and midazolam (0.2&#x000a0;mg/kg, maximum 5.0&#x000a0;mg); B &#x02013; Oral administration of ketamine (4.0&#x000a0;mg/kg, maximum 100&#x000a0;mg) and midazolam (0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg, maximum 20&#x000a0;mg); and C &#x02013; Oral administration of midazolam (1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg, maximum 20&#x000a0;mg). The primary outcome is the child&#x02019;s behavior assessed through an observational scale using digital videos of the restorative dental treatment under sedation. The secondary outcomes are as follows: acceptance of sedative administration; memory of intraoperative events; the child&#x02019;s stress; adverse events; the child&#x02019;s pain during the procedure; the parent&#x02019;s, dentists&#x02019;, and child&#x02019;s perceptions of sedation; and economic analysis. Measures will be taken at baseline and drug administration and during and after the dental procedure. The necessary sample size was estimated to be 84 children after a blinded interim analysis of the first 30 cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will provide data that can substantially add to science and pediatric dentistry as it examines the effect of sedative regimes from different perspectives (outcomes).</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02447289">NCT02447289</ext-link>.

Consequently, that group of patients are more likely to be referred for a dental sedation appointment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] or general anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Conscious sedation is a form of advanced behavior guidance technique, which is indicated for uncooperative or fearful/anxious children due to a lack of psychological, emotional or mental maturity or a physical or medical disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This pharmacological approach aims to enhance the patient&#x02019;s physical comfort and safety and to control anxiety and behavior, as well as to allow for the completion of the procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published demonstrating the efficacy of conscious sedation in pediatric dentistry, but evidence on this topic, though still weak, points to the efficacy of midazolam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Our research group has conducted investigations aiming to find the most beneficial sedative protocol for young children undergoing dental treatment. In one of these studies, children under 36&#x000a0;months displayed more cooperative behavior after oral administration of midazolam (0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg) plus ketamine (3.0&#x000a0;mg/kg) compared to either oral midazolam (1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg) or no sedative agent (placebo) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, we concluded that, for young children, it might be advisable to combine ketamine with midazolam to provide better results in pediatric dental sedation.</p><p>The research concerning intranasal procedural sedation has been highlighted due to its faster onset of action and recovery time and less discomfort and cost compared to other routes of sedative administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In line with the aforementioned efficacy of orally administered ketamine/midazolam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], we did a search in PubMed and found only one study in pediatric dentistry that used intranasally administered ketamine plus midazolam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Based on a crossover design with 45 children aged 2&#x02013;6 years, that study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] revealed high success rates for intranasal sedation as follows: ketamine (6.0&#x000a0;mg/kg) &#x02013; 89%; midazolam and ketamine (0.2&#x000a0;mg/kg and 4.0&#x000a0;mg/kg) &#x02013; 84%; and midazolam (0.3&#x000a0;mg/kg) &#x02013; 69%. In the medical pediatric field, the combination of ketamine and midazolam to perform gastric aspirates has been successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, there is a lack of RCTs investigating the intranasal route to deliver ketamine-midazolam in procedural sedation.</p><p>Pediatric dental sedation outcomes have primarily been assessed through children&#x02019;s behavior during the procedure, but the assessment of other &#x0201c;core variables,&#x0201d; including baseline anxiety, completion of treatment, and patient satisfaction or preference, is advisable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, there are other assessments that can be beneficial for the evaluation of sedation success if performed using a systematic method. Given the lack of evidence on which a sedative regimen is more effective for pediatric dental patients and the requirement for more well-designed studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the development of a RCT on pediatric dental sedation comprising multiple assessments is timely.

</p><p>Thus, the overall aim of this paper is to present the methodology of a RCT to investigate the efficacy of intranasally administered ketamine plus midazolam compared to the same drugs administered orally and to a control sedative (orally administered midazolam only). The specific aims are to investigate the following outcomes: the children&#x02019;s behavior during the dental sedation procedure (primary outcome); the acceptance of the sedative administration; the pain and memory of intraoperative events; the children&#x02019;s, parents&#x02019;, and dentists&#x02019; perceptions of sedation and stress; the occurrence of adverse events during and after sedative administration; and the economic analysis of the three sedative regimes.</p><p>The primary hypothesis is that the combination of ketamine and midazolam, administered intranasally, is more efficacious when compared to the same combination or midazolam only administered orally as measured by the child&#x02019;s behavior according to the Ohio State University Behavioral Rating Scale (OSUBRS). Sedation is considered efficacious if quiet behavior (OSUBRS score 1) occurs at or above 60% of the session length.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Ethical approval was granted by the Research Ethics Committee of the Universidade Federal de Goi&#x000e1;s (UFG), Brazil (protocol #857.066, 12 November 2014).

If changes are required at any stage of the study, the alterations will be recorded in the protocol in the Clinical Trials database and reported to the Ethics Committee. Informed consent will be sought from the parents of the children. The process of obtaining informed consent will consist of the reading aloud of consent by a research participant sitting next to at least one of the child&#x02019;s parents; after reading the Consent Form (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), the researcher will encourage the parent to ask any remaining questions; when the parent feels able to make a decision (in the same or in another session), they will be asked about the decision to participate. As there are data that will be collected from parents and dentists, they will also be invited to participate and, if in agreement, they will sign a specific Consent Form (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Participants can withdraw from the study at any time, and withdrawal from the study will not affect their dental care in the dental school.

A Data Monitoring Committee and external auditing are not required by local standards, because this trial is small, has a short duration and known risks.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Discussion</title><p>The conception of this protocol was based on the following two main goals: to determine a suitable sedative regime for young children undergoing dental treatment and to minimize the biases that have been identified in this type of study, such as lack of a baseline measurement of child&#x02019;s anxiety and the use of supplemental nitrous oxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Additionally, we attempted to control for the type of dental procedure to be performed and limit the children&#x02019;s age range, among other variables. In addition, we will scrutinize the sedation success according to multiple variables and not only the children&#x02019;s behavior, occurrence of adverse events or completion of the dental treatment. These major points deserve further discussion henceforward.</p><p>The goal of the dental sedation for children of 1&#x02013;6 years old is often solely to complete the treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but our interest is to accomplish the procedure in the most comfortable way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This explains why we have chosen several outcomes to assess the success of the dental sedation. We had to select one primary outcome that follows the majority of the RCTs on this topic, namely, child behavior. However, we had to propose a new way to assess successful child behavior in an attempt to translate the results of this protocol to a better practice and understanding of the conscious sedation outcomes. Therefore, we chose a valid measure, the OSUBRS, which has been shown to increase the chance of more precise data than scales such as Houpt and Venham for research purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It is well known that the lack of a standard behavior assessment scale for trials on pediatric sedation makes it difficult to compare studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but the OSUBRS is one of the most widely used behavior assessment scales for pediatric dental sedation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], which could favor pooling data in a systematic review. Based on continuous OSUBRS evaluation, we considered that completion of the restorative dental treatment (one tooth) with the child remaining quiet for more than 60% of the duration of the session would represent a satisfactory outcome because they are young, in the preoperational stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and might not be able to cooperate for the whole session even if sedated. There are studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] that determine that sedation is successful if it is possible to complete the treatment, regardless of the children&#x02019;s physical restraint, crying, and struggling.</p><p>We also included the occurrence of pain during the drug administration and the dental sedation because the ability to effectively control pain is a crucial aspect of pediatric dentistry. Additionally, we cannot consider a sedative regime successful if it is related to worrisome adverse events, which should be systematically assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>In addition, if we consider that conscious sedation may not be successful in pediatric dentistry, we need to know if children will remember if they cry/move/struggle during the dental sedation to prevent the induction of trauma. Our research team has developed a systematic review regarding the memory effects of sedative drugs in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]; scientific evidence regarding this issue is necessary.</p><p>We have already found in a crossover trial (oral midazolam versus placebo, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18) that a child&#x02019;s physiological stress response during a sedation appointment, as assessed by salivary cortisol, is not associated with the child&#x02019;s behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Thus, in this RCT, we have planned to verify the cortisol levels in a different study design &#x02013; parallel, larger sample size, midazolam-ketamine combination, and the oral versus the intranasal route. In a crossover design, it is alleged that the second treatment phase depends on the success of the first treatment period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Another point to be assessed in a potentially successful sedation is the perspective of the people involved &#x02013; child, parent, and dentist. &#x0201c;Outcome variables need to be more patient-centered&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, we are investigating the perceptions of the child on the dental sedation session 1&#x000a0;week later as well as the views from the parent who stayed with the child during the procedure and the pediatric dentist who conducted the procedure (quantitative approach). In a qualitative approach, we have already identified that mothers from children sedated for dental treatment self-report stress related to the procedure but are satisfied with this pharmacological method of behavior management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, we have not found a RCT on pediatric dental sedation that examines the children&#x02019;s view of the procedure.</p><p>The other secondary outcome that will allow for a comparison between groups is the sedation costs. It is very important to analyze sedation costs, especially considering public health policies, and these have not received enough attention in pediatric dentistry. In the pediatric ophthalmology field, for example, a cost-effectiveness analysis of clinic-based chloral hydrate sedation versus general anesthesia demonstrated significant savings with sedation but with slightly fewer procedures completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A systematic review updated in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] found no eligible study to compare the morbidity and cost of general anesthesia and sedation for dental treatment in children younger than 18&#x000a0;years.</p><p>To participate in this study, children have to present a negative/definitely negative behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] during the dental examination or in a preliminary session in which restorative treatment is performed without sedation. The rationale for this is to avoid including children with positive behavior who were referred for dental treatment under sedation by a dentist who was not able to guide the children&#x02019;s behavior properly. However, as included children have negative behavior and early childhood caries and many of them require numerous dental procedures, general anesthesia rather than sedation may be the best indication for them. Therefore, one limitation of the present RCT protocol is that we are, in some ways, pushing the limits of sedation indication, although we have restricted the age group involved.</p><p>The experimental group will receive a combination of intranasally administered ketamine and midazolam. In fact, intranasal administration of ketamine combined with midazolam has demonstrated a high success rate for child behavior management during dental treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, that study had a crossover design, and the use of an atomizer is not reported, which may interfere with the effect of the sedatives. Additionally, the proposal to first administer ketamine to potentially provide analgesia and minimize the pain associated with intranasally administered midazolam is innovative, as the analgesic effect of intranasally administered ketamine begins as early as 3&#x000a0;min after administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. We chose oral administration of midazolam alone for the control group because it has been shown to improve children&#x02019;s behavior compared to placebo, according to five heterogeneous studies included in a systematic review, which is the best evidence for a pediatric dental sedation drug, although weak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Blinding is another crucial point for assessing sedation outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and we were able to mask the patient/parent, the dental team and the observers to the intervention groups. To achieve that, we have to provide placebos for the sedative route of administration (intranasal and oral) so that all children receive some substance through the nose and mouth. Furthermore, we planned the same sequence of administration for all groups. Additionally, we will videotape the administration of the drugs and the entire dental procedure so that trained and calibrated observers who are not in the dental sedation office can assess the primary outcome. As far as we know, this rigorous masking has not been consistently provided in other RCTs on pediatric dental sedation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The video recording of the sedative administration and dental procedures is also original. We propose an action camera adapted for the operator&#x02019;s head to allow for a close view of the facial expressions of the children, and then, a valid pain assessment through the FLACC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], which is validated for use with Brazilian children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>All in all, this study protocol has strengths that will allow for better analysis of pediatric dental sedation, with a potential impact on health practice and public and private service. Because there is no new medication for sedation in the pipeline, efforts to define a best possible route of administration and combination of drugs is a real need. In addition, the degree of stimulation experienced by patients in the pediatric dental setting makes it a special challenge. This study emphasizes a new and promising protocol in pediatric dentistry combining a feasible route (intranasal) and synergistic drugs.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Trial status</title><p>This RCT began in June 2015 and the process of recruitment is still ongoing.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec24"><p>
