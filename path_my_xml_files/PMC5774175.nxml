prevention of rotavirus disease may address remaining barriers to global
vaccine implementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Indonesia to evaluate
the efficacy of an oral human neonatal rotavirus vaccine (RV3-BB) to prevent
rotavirus gastroenteritis. Healthy newborns received three doses of RV3-BB
administered in a neonatal schedule at 0-5 days, 8 and 14 weeks or infant
schedule at 8, 14 and 18 weeks, or placebo. Laboratory-confirmed rotavirus
gastroenteritis was graded using a modified Vesikari score. The primary
analysis was efficacy against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis from two
weeks after all doses to 18 months in the combined vaccine group (neonatal
and infant schedule) compared with placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Vaccine efficacy against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis to 18 months was
63% in the combined vaccine group (95% CI 34, 80; p&#x0003c;0.001), 75% in the
neonatal vaccine group (95% confidence interval [CI] 44, 91; p&#x0003c;0.001) and
51% in the infant vaccine group (95% CI 7, 76; p=0.03) in the per protocol
analysis, with similar results in the intention-to-treat analysis. Vaccine
efficacy to 12 months was 94% in the neonatal vaccine group (95%CI 56, 99;
p=0.006). Vaccine take occurred in 78/83 (94%) in the neonatal vaccine group
and 83/84 (99%) in the infant vaccine group. The vaccine was well tolerated,
with similar incidence of adverse events in vaccine and placebo
recipients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>RV3-BB was efficacious, immunogenic and well-tolerated when administered in a

access to a rotavirus vaccine (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Barriers to global implementation include
cost, sub-optimal efficacy in low-income countries and lingering safety concerns
(<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). An oral rotavirus vaccine administered at birth has potential to
address these challenges.</p><p>Rotavirus disease occurs early in life in infants in low-income countries (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). A birth dose rotavirus vaccine would provide
early protection and maximize the opportunity to complete a full vaccine schedule
(<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Birth presents a unique opportunity
that may assist the uptake of an oral vaccine as gastric acid is limited and
environmental enteropathy not yet established (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). As intussusception is rare
in newborns, a birth dose administration may offer a safety advantage (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>RV3-BB vaccine was developed from the human neonatal rotavirus strain, RV3 (G3P[6]),
identified in the stool of asymptomatic infants (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Wild-type infection with RV3 provided protection from severe
gastroenteritis in the first 3 years of life, with strong heterotypic serological
responses to community rotavirus strains (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). RV3 appears to be naturally
attenuated and adapted to the newborn gut, replicating well despite the presence of
maternal antibodies and breastfeeding (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).
RV3-BB vaccine aims to take advantage of the intrinsic characteristics of this novel
strain to target a birth dose vaccination strategy. RV3-BB was well tolerated and
immunogenic when delivered in a neonatal or infant schedule in a phase IIa trial in
New Zealand (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of three doses of
RV3-BB against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis to 18 months of age. Secondary
objectives included assessment of efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of RV3-BB when
delivered in a neonatal schedule (first dose 0-5 days of age), or an infant schedule
(first dose 8-10 weeks of age), compared with placebo, efficacy to 12 months,
against rotavirus gastroenteritis of any severity and all-cause severe
gastroenteritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Trial design and oversight</title><p>This phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 1649
participants was conducted from January 2013 to July 2016 in primary health
centers and hospitals in Central Java and Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Indonesia is a
low-middle income country with an under-5 mortality rate in Yogyakarta and
Central Java of 30-38 per 1000 live births and per capita gross regional product
of USD $2,164-$2,326 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Authors from Murdoch Childrens
Research Institute (MCRI) and Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) designed the trial.
The protocol was approved by the ethics committees of UGM, Royal Children's
Hospital Melbourne and National Agency of Drug and Food Control, Republic of
Indonesia. Use of a placebo was deemed acceptable as rotavirus vaccines are not
implemented in the Indonesian National Immunization Program and cost limits
private purchase (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The study was
conducted in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation Good
Clinical Practice guidelines and monitored by an independent contract research
organization (Quintiles Pty Ltd). The study sponsor was MCRI and Indonesian
sponsor was PT Bio Farma. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board regularly
reviewed safety data. Data management was performed by Biophics, Thailand.
Statistical analysis was conducted by INC Research, Australia and an independent
Statistical Consultant (WR). The National Health and Medical Research Council,
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and PT Bio Farma funded the trial but had no
role in study design, data collection or interpretation, or the decision to
submit for publication. The second and third authors led clinical data
collection. The first author wrote the first draft of the manuscript. All
authors provided review and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data
and analysis, and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol (available at

</p></sec><sec><title>Participants, Randomization and Blinding</title><p>Preliminary written informed consent was obtained from pregnant women prior to
cord blood collection. Final written informed consent was obtained following
birth prior to confirming eligibility. Eligible infants (healthy, full term
babies 0-5 days of age, birth weight of 2.5-4.0 kg) were randomized into one of
three groups (neonatal vaccine group, infant vaccine group, or placebo group) in
a 1:1:1 ratio according to a computer generated code (block size =6) stratified
by province. Investigational product (IP) (RV3-BB or placebo) doses were drawn
into syringes for dispensing by an unblinded pharmacist at the central Pharmacy
in each province. Investigators, study staff, families, monitors, data managers
and statisticians remained blinded throughout the study.</p><p>Participants received four 1ml oral doses of IP according to their treatment
allocation, with doses administered at 0-5 days (IP dose 1), 8-10 weeks (IP dose
2), 14-16 weeks (IP dose 3) and 18-20 weeks of age (IP dose 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1a">Figure 1a</xref>). IP doses 2, 3 and 4 were
preceded by a 2ml dose of antacid solution (Mylanta&#x000ae; Original). Feeding was
withheld for 30 minutes before and after each dose. IP was co-administered at
the same time as vaccines in the Indonesian NIP. Participants were followed by
weekly telephone contacts and monthly visits to 18 months. All participants
received oral polio vaccine, except for a subset of 282 participants included in
the immunogenicity analysis of RV3-BB co-administered with inactivated polio
vaccine.</p><fig id="f1a" orientation="portrait" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="NEJMoa1706804Bines-fig1a"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Vaccine</title><p>RV3-BB clinical trial lots were prepared at Meridian Life Sciences (Memphis, USA)
to a titre of 8.3 - 8.7 x 10<sup>6</sup> FFU/mL in serum free media supplemented
with 10% sucrose. Placebo contained the same media with 10% sucrose and was
visually indistinguishable. Vials were stored at -70&#x000b0;C until thawed within 6
hours prior to administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy</title><p>Severe rotavirus gastroenteritis was defined as rotavirus gastroenteritis with a
modified Vesikari score of &#x02265; 11. Rotavirus gastroenteritis was defined as
gastroenteritis with rotavirus antigen detected in the stool by enzyme
linked-absorbent assay (ProSpecT Rotavirus Microplate Assay; Oxoid Ltd, UK). A
modified Vesikari score was applied where intravenous, naso-gastric rehydration
or 6-hours of supervised oral rehydration was scored as hospitalization, whether
administered within a primary health center or hospital. Gastroenteritis of any
severity, defined as three or more stools looser than normal for that child
within a 24-hour period.</p></sec><sec><title>Vaccine Take and Immunogenicity</title><p>Vaccine take was assessed in the first cohort recruited (n=282). Blood was
collected from the cord (baseline for neonatal schedule comparison), immediately
prior to IP dose 2 (baseline for infant schedule comparison), 28 days after IP
dose 3 and 28 days after IP dose 4. Serum rotavirus immunoglobulin A (IgA)
antibody titers and serum neutralizing antibody titers were measured using
previously described methods (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). RV3-BB shedding in stool was detected
using a rotavirus VP6 specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
assay and confirmed by sequence analysis (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Positive vaccine take was defined as a serum immune response
(&#x02265;3 fold increase in titer from baseline in anti-rotavirus IgA or serum
neutralising antibodies) 28 days following IP administration, or RV3-BB shedding
on days 3-7 following IP administration. Cumulative vaccine take was defined as
a positive vaccine take following IP dose of 1, 2 or 3 for the neonatal vaccine
group, and following IP doses 2, 3 or 4 for the infant vaccine group.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Vital signs were assessed prior to, and in the 30 minutes after IP
administration. Parents reported temperature and solicited gastrointestinal and
systemic symptoms on diary cards for 7 days following each IP dose. All
unsolicited adverse events (AEs) occurring up to 28 days after administration of
IP doses were recorded. Serious AEs (SAEs) were defined as an AE that resulted
in death, new or prolonged hospitalization or considered to be medically
significant or life threatening occurring up to 28 days following the last dose
of IP. Causality and severity grading of AEs were determined by the local
Indonesian investigators.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>The primary efficacy analysis compared the proportion of participants with an
episode of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis from two weeks after IP dose 4 to 18
months in the combined vaccine group (neonatal and infant vaccine schedules)
with that observed in the placebo group in the per protocol (PP) population,
using a Pearson&#x02019;s Chi square test. The PP population included only participants
who received all 4 doses of IP within visit windows. A secondary analysis was
conducted in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (all randomized
participants), comparing events from randomisation to 18 months. Vaccine
efficacy is presented as 1-risk ratio x 100 with its exact 95% confidence
interval based on the Clopper-Pearson method (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Efficacy and vaccine take was assessed for the neonatal vaccine group (from two
weeks after IP dose 3 to 12 and 18 months) and the infant vaccine group (from
two weeks after IP dose 4 to 12 and 18 months). This resulted in two different
presentations of data in the placebo group (denoted neonatal placebo and infant
placebo). For the vaccine take analysis a participant was defined as missing
only if all components of the outcome were missing. A Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curve was
used to estimate the cumulative hazard of a first severe rotavirus
gastroenteritis episode from randomization, with group comparisons via the
logrank test. All statistical tests were two-sided.</p><p>Based on local data we assumed 3% of placebo participants would experience an
episode of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis during the study (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and calculated a sample size of 549 participants in each group
would provide 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of no difference between
the combined vaccine and placebo groups if the true efficacy was 60% (one-sided
test with alpha of 0.1), allowing for 10% non-adherence. We calculated 282
participants were required to reject the null hypothesis of no difference in the
proportion with a positive vaccine take (two-sided test with alpha of 0.05)
assuming 25% of placebo participants would be exposed to rotavirus (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and 50% in each vaccine group would
have a positive vaccine take, allowing for 10% non-adherence.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 1649 newborns randomized, 1640 received at least one dose of IP (safety
population) and 1588 (96%) were followed to 18 months. The primary efficacy analysis

gastroenteritis and was well tolerated. When administered in the neonatal schedule,
RV3-BB had a vaccine efficacy of 94% at 12 months and 75% at 18 months, providing
proof of principle for the use of RV3-BB in a birth dose vaccination schedule. These
results compare very favourably with licensed vaccines studied in similar high
disease burden, low- and low-middle income countries. In a two dose schedule,
Rotarix (Glaxo-SmithKline) had a combined one and two year efficacy of 34% in Malawi
(<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In a three dose schedule, the
combined one and two year efficacy for Rotarix was 42.3% (Malawi)(<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), RotaTeq (Merck) was 17.6 to 63.9% (Mali,
Bangladesh, Vietnam, Ghana, and Kenya) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and Rotavac (Bharat Biotech) was
55.1% (India) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Three doses of Rotasil
(Serum Institute of India) had an efficacy of 66.7% at a mean follow up of 9.8
months of age in Niger (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). If the 75%
protective efficacy for the neonatal schedule of RV3-BB translates into
effectiveness throughout Indonesia, it has the potential to avert an estimated 5,450
deaths, 117,110 hospitalizations and &#x0003e;300,000 outpatient clinic visits each year due
to rotavirus gastroenteritis in children under 5 years (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). </p><p>The concept of a birth dose strategy for vaccination is not new. Birth is an
established immunization time-point in many countries. A neonatal dose was
investigated in the early phase of rotavirus vaccine development but not pursued due
to concerns regarding inadequate immune responses and safety (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The VP4 protein
of human neonatal P[6] strains have specific residues at the basal surface of VP8*
that may allow them to adhere to cell surface receptors in the newborn gut (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). This may provide an advantage for a birth
dose schedule. The P[6] VP4 of RV3-BB may also offer an advantage in Africa and Asia
where the Lewis-negative phenotype is common (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Lewis (FUT3) and secretor (FUT2) genes appear to mediate
susceptibility to rotavirus infection (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).
P[8] rotaviruses only infect individuals who are Lewis-positive and
secretor-positive whereas P[6] rotaviruses infect individuals irrespective of their
Lewis and secretor status (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). This may
explain the high proportion of disease caused by P[6] rotaviruses in Africa and the
lower efficacy of vaccines with a P[8] genotype in these region (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). RV3-BB is currently the only vaccine with
a P[6] VP4. </p><p>Unlike IgG, IgA is not transferred via the placenta, and the newborn may not mount a
significant serum IgA response following the birth dose of an oral vaccine, such as
RV3-BB, despite evidence that the neonatal schedule is efficacious (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Similar dissonance has been demonstrated
with other vaccines administered in the newborn period (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). An equine-like G3P[8] strain was responsible for most
episodes of severe gastroenteritis in this study and reflects the global emergence
of this strain (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Based on the strong
heterotypic serological responses to community strains (G1,G2 dominant) provided by
the parent strain RV3 (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), it is anticipated
that RV3-BB will also offer protection against a range of circulating rotavirus
strain but this could not be assessed in this study.</p><p>Despite the success of rotavirus vaccines remaining challenges to global
implementation need to be overcome if all infants are to be protected against
rotavirus disease. RV3-BB was efficacious, immunogenic and well-tolerated when
administered in a neonatal or infant schedule. In particular, the high protective
efficacy in the neonatal schedule suggests that RV3-BB could make a significant
contribution to the global prevention of rotavirus disease. </p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Appendix</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="NEJMoa1706804Bines_SuppApp.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e825" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would sincerely like to thank the infants and their families for participating in
