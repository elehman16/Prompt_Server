All of the 19 subjects who received MDMA-assisted treatment in the original trial participated in the long-term follow-up (LTFU), with 16 out of 19 completing all of the long-term outcome measures, which were administered from 17 to 74 months after the original study&#x02019;s final MDMA session (mean = 45.4; SD = 17.3). Our primary outcome measure used was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Secondary outcome measures were the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Neuroticism Extroversion Oppenness Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R) Personality Inventory. We also collected a long-term follow-up questionnaire. Results for the 16 CAPS completers showed there were no statistical differences between mean CAPS score at LTFU (mean = 23.7; SD = 22.8) (<italic>t</italic><sub>matched</sub> = 0.1; df = <italic>15</italic>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.91) and the mean CAPS score previously obtained at Study Exit (mean = 24.6, SD = 18.6). On average, subjects maintained statistically and clinically-significant gains in symptom relief, although two of these subjects did relapse. It was promising that we found the majority of these subjects with previously severe PTSD who were unresponsive to existing treatments had symptomatic relief provided by MDMA-assisted psychotherapy that persisted over time, with no subjects reporting harm from participation in the study.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>MDMA</kwd><kwd>post-traumatic stress disorder</kwd><kwd>PTSD</kwd><kwd>psychedelic drugs</kwd><kwd>ecstasy</kwd><kwd>mental health</kwd><kwd>victimization</kwd><kwd>long-term outcome</kwd><kwd>treatment resistance</kwd><kwd>psychotherapy methods</kwd><kwd>pharmacotherapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-0269881112456611"><title>Introduction</title><p>Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) can be a chronic, severely disabling condition causing sustained loss of functionality, accompanied by high rates of medical and psychiatric co-morbidity and risk of suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881112456611">Perkonigg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881112456611">Breslau, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881112456611">Kessler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0269881112456611">Seal et al., 2010</xref>).

Brain imaging studies show there is reduced amygdalar activity after MDMA administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881112456611">Gamma et al., 2000</xref>), plus changes in the response to angry and happy facial expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112456611">Bedi et al., 2009</xref>). Healthy volunteers given MDMA were better able to spot positive facial expressions and found it harder to spot negative ones, when compared with placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881112456611">Hysek et al., 2012</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that MDMA may enhance the therapeutic alliance by increasing the likelihood of detecting positive expressions and finding them rewarding, while at the same time reducing the chance of excessive reactivity to fleeting or unintended expressions of anger or disapproval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269881112456611">Rauch et al., 2006</xref>). These effects may combine to increase the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD, by increasing self-acceptance, promoting interpersonal trust with therapists and catalyzing the effective processing of emotionally-distressing material. Recent investigations also support the potential for MDMA as a treatment for people with PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881112456611">Bouso et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881112456611">Mithoefer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Evaluation of longer-term outcomes, though infrequently reported in the psychiatric literature, may contribute significantly to the understanding and treatment of chronic mental illnesses like PTSD and their associated morbidity and disability. For example, long-term follow-up (LTFU) studies could help to formulate treatment guidelines, permit evaluation of the rates of sustained symptom reduction or remission, predict the need for maintenance treatment, permit the assessment of long-term tolerability and help rule out a placebo response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269881112456611">Price et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>A number of studies have tracked the course of PTSD over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269881112456611">Peleg and Shalev, 2006</xref>), but the evaluations of treatment effects in clinical trials typically has ended within several months after treatment. Only a minority of psychiatric treatment trials have followed people from one-half year up to four years after their initial treatment, using open-label designs to assess the patients after they completed randomized or blinded studies. So far, pharmacotherapy with sertraline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881112456611">Davidson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0269881112456611">Rapaport et al., 2002</xref>) and nefazodone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881112456611">Hertzberg et al., 2002</xref>) show sustained efficacy at LTFU, at one-half and 3&#x02013;4 years, respectively, given continuous drug treatment over these intervals. An investigation of the treatment effects following a 4-month intensive inpatient program of psychotherapy and supportive treatment for PTSD patients revealed that the reduction in symptoms of PTSD had not persisted at 18 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881112456611">Johnson et al., 1996</xref>).

The MDMA-assisted sessions were conducted in a comfor setting, in which participants were encouraged to spend considerable time focused inward without talking, alternated with time spent talking to the therapists. The therapists took a non-directive approach to supporting their subjects in processing trauma-related material. More information concerning the nature of the psychotherapy is found in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881112456611">Mithoefer et al.

Of the eight therapy-only subjects, seven accepted and completed the crossover arm of the study, which resulted in 19 of the 20 study subjects receiving the MDMA-assisted psychotherapy treatment. The one therapy-only subject had recovered from PTSD symptoms with psychotherapy alone, and did not participate in the crossover. As allowed by a protocol amendment, the last eight subjects recruited (five in the double-blind stage and three in the crossover stage) also received a third MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session. This protocol change was sought because of tentative clinical impressions by the investigators that a third session would likely enhance the processing of trauma and the integration process that were essential to the treatment.</p><p>Subjects were mailed an informed consent form and a letter requesting their participation in the LTFU study. All 20 subjects from the initial study were recruited for LTFU and participated in the data collected herein.

This questionnaire is designed to specifically capture the perceived benefit or harm of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy and changes in any areas not addressed by standard outcome measures, such as changes in relationships or creativity. The questionnaire measured the degree (with an ordinal scale of 1-Slight to 5-Large) and persistence (scale of 1-Small to 5-All) of the perceived benefits and/or harms of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD. Additionally, the questionnaire included items addressing participant beliefs concerning the potential benefit of receiving an additional MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session, any psychiatric treatment after the study (whether psychotherapy or psychiatric medications), and their use of &#x0201c;ecstasy&#x0201d; (material represented as containing MDMA) and/or any other illicit psychoactive substances after study participation, plus any perceived changes in cognition after study participation.

These three &#x0201c;CAPS non-completers&#x0201d; did complete the LTFU Questionnaire, where they reported nearly the degree of benefit and the same degree of persistence of benefit as those who had completed the CAPS. Therefore, it may be the case that up to 89% (17/19) of those who received MDMA had long-term improvement in their PTSD symptoms. However, these three &#x0201c;CAPS non-completers&#x0201d; should be assumed to have had higher CAPS scores than the others. An intent-to-treat analysis, that made the assumption that each of these three individuals had relapsed, concluded that 74% (14/19) of these previously treatment-resistant subjects demonstrated meaningful, sustained reductions in their CAPS scores at LTFU.</p><p>At LTFU, two of the subjects who completed the CAPS had relapsed, with CAPS scores above the cutoff (&#x02265;50) that was the original study entry criterion. In other long-term follow-up investigations of PTSD treatment (listed in the introduction), relapse rates range from 0.05&#x02013;41%, so this rate is comparable (from a minimum of 11% of the CAPS completers to a maximum of 26%, in the intent-to-treat analysis).</p><p>The LTFU questionnaire we developed to assess the participants, while not a validated instrument, did shed light on several important points: the apparent lack of risk of substance abuse and of neurocognitive decline, coupled with symptom improvement and other perceived benefits.</p><sec id="section18-0269881112456611"><title>Risk of substance abuse</title><p>The data we obtained about illicit drug use from the LTFU Questionnaire supports the hypothesis that MDMA can be administered in a clinical setting with minimal risk that the subjects will subsequently seek out and self-administer &#x0201c;street ecstasy,&#x0201d; or become dependent on the drug. This is consistent with the comments from many study subjects, who expressed the strong opinion that the therapeutic setting and close follow-up were essential elements of the treatment, and they did not think MDMA should be used without this level of clinical monitoring and therapeutic support. Furthermore, no subject developed a substance abuse problem with any illicit drug after their MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. PTSD is associated with a high incidence of co-morbid substance abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881112456611">Brown and Wolfe, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881112456611">Ford et al., 2007</xref>) and MDMA, as ecstasy (which is a material that may contain other substances in addition to or instead of MDMA), has a history of being a drug of abuse, so our findings were reassuring, though not unexpected: As it is the emotional distress of PTSD that often contributes to the use of intoxicants as an escape or an attempt at self-medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881112456611">Brady et al., 2000b</xref>), when that emotional distress is reduced, as it was with this experimental treatment, it follows that the subject&#x02019;s motivation for drug abuse would be reduced, as well.</p></sec><sec id="section19-0269881112456611"><title>Risk of neurocognitive decline</title><p>Favorable reports about cognitive function, memory, and concentration on the LTFU Questionnaire were consistent with findings from formal measures of cognitive function that were taken before and after psychotherapy with MDMA versus placebo, in the original study. Though reports from actual testing are more reliable than reports of perceived cognitive function, this long-term self-reported evidence is still important, because of the controversy surrounding theories that there are potential risks of neurocognitive decline resulting from MDMA administration, as has been suggested by animal studies and some retrospective studies in recreational drug users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0269881112456611">Thomasius et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881112456611">Kalechstein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881112456611">Laws and Kokkalis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0269881112456611">Zakzanis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881112456611">De Sola Llopis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881112456611">Jager et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0269881112456611">Schilt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112456611">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881112456611">Kish et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0269881112456611">Verbaten, 2010</xref>) and one prospective study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0269881112456611">Schilt et al., 2007</xref>).

The lack of evidence of neurocognitive decline associated with MDMA in our initial study, as well as in the LTFU self-reports are consistent with the most well-controlled studies of recreational ecstasy use and neurocognitive performance, which report largely negative findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881112456611">Halpern et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881112456611">Hoshi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269881112456611">Roiser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881112456611">Bedi and Redman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881112456611">Hanson and Luciana, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881112456611">Halpern et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section20-0269881112456611"><title>Symptom improvement and other benefits reported on our LTFU Questionnaire</title><p>It is notable that no subjects reported any harm from study participation and all of them reported some degree of benefit. Consistent with the investigators&#x02018; clinical observations in the original study, the responses we obtained on the questionnaire indicated that participants often experienced benefits beyond decreased PTSD symptoms. This is not a radical idea; many forms of psychotherapy produce benefits in terms of psychological growth and development that are not limited to improvements in a specific disorder that may have been the original target of therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0269881112456611">Tedeschi and Calhoun, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0269881112456611">Zoellner and Maercker, 2006</xref>). Such benefits may prove to be a particularly prominent and valuable feature of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Some of the areas of benefit that were endorsed on the LTFU Questionnaire, such as an increased self-awareness, improved relationships, an enhanced spiritual life, and more involvement in the community or world, represent effects that are not fully measured by the PTSD symptom scales.</p><p>A sustained improvement in PTSD symptoms documented on the CAPS, plus other benefits reported on the LTFU Questionnaire, have implications regarding one of the limitations of the previous study: the fact that the blinding turned out to be transparent to the investigators and to most of the participants (though not to the independent rater). This problem is inherent in all drug studies, but is particularly challenging to overcome in studies of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, because of the prominent psychoactive effects MDMA has, as well as its effects on blood pressure and pulse rate. Observation of these effects may have contributed to the investigators&#x02019; ability to correctly distinguish MDMA-assisted sessions from therapy-only sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881112456611">Bjorkedal and Flaten, 2011</xref>). In addition, any studies of drug-assisted psychotherapy (rather than of drug effect alone) present particular challenges in distinguishing the drug effects from the effects of psychotherapy with placebo. Nevertheless, if the placebo response is tied to receiving an apparent therapy, the favorable LTFU results we obtained a year or more later in this cohort of previously treatment-resistant subjects would suggest that the strength and duration of symptomatic improvement that we observed is not easily attributable to a placebo response or a spontaneous remission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269881112456611">Price et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881112456611">Benedetti and Amanzio, 2011</xref>), though further studies will be needed to establish this conclusively.</p><p>Additional evidence of the positive MDMA treatment effects is apparent in the types of benefits endorsed by the subjects on the LTFU Questionnaire and its Comments section. While not a substitute for the validated primary outcome measures, this descriptive material provides us with an important context in which the outcome data can be evaluated and understood. The benefits endorsed and described extend beyond the realm of symptom reduction. Many subjects reported deeply meaningful therapeutic experiences and ensuing improvements in their lives. A majority of participants endorsed benefits such as, &#x0201c;increased self-awareness and understanding&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;enhanced spiritual life.&#x0201d; These responses and many of the individual comments on the Questionnaire point to a subjectively authentic process of psychological and spiritual exploration and growth that could logically be expected to facilitate trauma processing and symptom reduction, and to promote healthy psychological development. Improvements of this kind could reasonably be expected to persist for a year or more, as was endorsed by 80% of the subjects, and even to &#x0201c;last and continue to grow,&#x0201d; as endorsed by 40% of subjects. In addition, several participants wrote comments describing an incomplete but ongoing process of improvement, referring to an &#x0201c;ongoing journey&#x0201d; or having &#x0201c;gained tools&#x0201d; while &#x0201c;still struggling in many areas.&#x0201d; Since these comments were usually accompanied by persistently low CAPS scores, we believe that they represent additional evidence for a meaningful, ongoing, therapeutic process that was originally catalyzed by MDMA-assisted psychotherapy and is likely leading to important benefits in addition to PTSD symptom reduction. On the other hand, these comments could be taken to indicate a weakness in the treatment, as evidenced by continued psychological challenges; however, they more likely convey a strength of the treatment, in that it can enhance participants&#x02018; capacity to engage more effectively in their own continued healing and growth.</p></sec><sec id="section21-0269881112456611"><title>Limitations</title><p>There are several limitations of the study design to be taken into account in interpreting our data. Only 16 out of 19 subjects completed the LTFU CAPS or IES-R, though this issue was addressed with the intent-to-treat analysis and with the information gathered from all 19 MDMA subjects who did complete the Questionnaire. While the randomized control group design, along with the crossover arm in the original trial, went a long way toward ruling out the possibility that there was only a placebo response, there was no meaningful control group for our LTFU, because all but one subject ultimately received active treatment in the initial study. Because it is not practical nor ethical to maintain a placebo group for over a year, nor to control for other treatments for that period of time, this limitation is commonly found in LTFU studies. In light of this limitation, it is possible that the favorable results of this LTFU study were caused by resolution of symptoms due to natural history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269881112456611">Price et al., 2008</xref>) or to other variables that were not controlled for after the original 2-month follow-up. An important argument against this is that the cohort was originally screened specifically to have <italic>treatment-refractory</italic> PTSD and their mean duration of symptoms had been more than 19 years.</p><p>The long follow-up period allowed us to identify relapses that would not have been identified within a shorter follow-up period. On the other hand, the longer the time elapsed between the experimental intervention and follow-up, the more likely it is that life events will have intervened and had their own effect on outcome, either positive or negative. The interval between final MDMA-assisted session and LTFU varied considerably because the LTFU was an amendment to the protocol written and approved well after the start of the study, with the first LTFU assessments occurring 5 years after study initiation. While this enabled us to obtain follow-up data at exceptionally long time intervals after treatment, it would have been preferable to have measured long-term data at a fixed interval from each subject&#x02019;s final MDMA session. Ongoing studies of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy now include a long-term follow-up component from the start that will result in far less variation in time of LTFU. In addition, we believe that future versions of the LTFU questionnaire should include questions about significant intervening life events.</p><p>Perhaps the most important factor confounding the attribution of the persistence of therapeutic benefits entirely to our experimental intervention is that at LTFU, 8 of 19 subjects were still in psychotherapy and 12 of 19 were taking psychiatric medicines. Although this did represent a decrease in the use of psychotherapy and psychiatric drugs compared to baseline, it is impossible to know how much these treatments may have influenced the durability of benefits measured at LTFU. The small sample size does not allow for meaningful statistical comparisons between the subjects who continued treatment and those who did not. Although these confounding factors preclude a definite conclusion about the long-term benefits of the experimental treatment, it is noteworthy that the original sample included only participants with PTSD, usually of many years duration, who had already proven resistant to prior therapy and medication. We believe it unlikely that additional medication and/or psychotherapy similar to what they had received prior to entry in our first study would have consistently led to any sustained improvement across the majority of participants, if there had not been some significant lasting therapeutic effect and benefit from our MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions; however, it may well be that, for some participants, ongoing medication and/or psychotherapy were important factors in maintaining remission, analogous to the way antidepressants may be necessary to maintain remission following electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients who had previously been treatment resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0269881112456611">Sackeim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0269881112456611">Sienaert, 2011</xref>).</p><p>There are several other possible explanations for the substantial rates of continued psychotherapy and psychiatric medications at LTFU in those subjects with persistently low CAPS scores: the CAPS could have failed to capture some PTSD symptoms, though presently there is no better instrument to do so; ongoing treatment could have been targeted at a psychopathology other than PTSD, such as other anxiety disorders or persistent or recurrent mood disorders; and medications could have still been prescribed in the absence of an active Axis I disorder or other well-established indication. Alternatively, with the amelioration of their PTSD psychopathology, it may be that participants were undergoing psychotherapy to further their personal growth and self-understanding and/or to support expansion and integration of any therapeutic gains made during MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. The reasons given by subjects for the use of psychiatric medications lend some support to the notion that most drugs were not prescribed for PTSD, but the Questionnaire did not ask for the reasons for ongoing psychotherapy.</p><p>Attempts are under way to further address these limitations and to build upon the results. The authors are currently conducting a study of military veterans with PTSD, using a randomized, three-arm design with low, medium, and full dose MDMA, in order to address the limited effectiveness of the blind in the original study. Steps are also being taken to capture more information about other possible beneficial effects by inclusion of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0269881112456611">Tedeschi and Calhoun, 1996</xref>) and a measure for mystical or transformative experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881112456611">Griffiths et al., 2006</xref>), as well as through collaboration with others who are applying process measures and descriptive analysis to video recordings from these studies.</p><p>The investigators have recently obtained approval for a new proof-of-principle study to determine if one additional open-label MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session can restore prior therapeutic gains in people who had responded well to MDMA-assisted psychotherapy initially, but had relapsed a year or more later. Studies are also being undertaken by MAPS-sponsored researchers at other locations, to determine whether or not these results can be replicated. Valuable data could be generated if additional studies were conducted by independent research teams using the same treatment method described in the Manual; plus in the future, other treatment methods using MDMA should also be tested. Future studies will be needed to finalize the double-blind methodology, assess the magnitude and variance of the treatment&#x02019;s effect if delivered by other co-therapist teams, evaluate whether the method is generalizable across patient populations and different cultures, and address questions about the therapeutic method&#x02019;s mechanism of action, optimal dosing and possible refinements to the method.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section22-0269881112456611"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Over a decade ago, we conceived this study in an attempt to develop and test a novel therapy for PTSD, a clinical condition for which a wider array of effective treatment options has remained a crucial need. Using rigorous scientific methodology, we describe a potentially beneficial new therapeutic modality with support from solid empirical data. Following this promising first step, we now report very long-term outcome results in the original cohort, demonstrating a sustained benefit over time, with no cases of subsequent drug abuse and no reports of neurocognitive decline. These results indicate that there was a favorable long-term risk/benefit ratio for PTSD treatment with just a few doses of pure MDMA administered in a supportive setting, in conjunction with psychotherapy. Should further research validate our initial findings, we predict that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy will become an important treatment option for this very challenging clinical and public health problem.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank the study participants who took time to provide this long-term follow-up data, John H Halpern of McLean Hospital/Harvard Medical School for his helpful comments on a previous version of the manuscript, Charles and Ashley Wile for proofreading, and Sarah Sadler and Mili Ballard for their logistical assistance.</p><p>Clinical trials.gov identifier: NCT00090064.
