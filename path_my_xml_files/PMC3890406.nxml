Eligible Chinese women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (N=236) were randomized to Group M or Group A and received menatetrenone 45 mg/day or alfacalcidol 0.5 &#x003bc;g/day, respectively, for 1 year. Additionally, all patients received calcium 500 mg/day.

After 1 year of treatment, BMD among patients in Group M significantly increased from baseline by 1.2% and 2.7% at the lumbar spine and trochanter, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001); and the percentage increase of BMD in Group A was 2.2% and 1.8%, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). No difference was observed between groups. There were no changes in femoral neck BMD in both groups. Two patients (1.9%, 2/108) in Group M and four patients (3.8%, 4/105) in Group A had new fracture onsets (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). In Group M, OC and ucOC decreased from baseline by 38.7% and 82.3%, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). In Group A, OC and ucOC decreased by 25.8% and 34.8%, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).

A significant increase in BMD by 1.2% and 2.7% at the lumbar spine and trochanter, respectively, from baseline and a significant decrease in OC and ucOC by 38.7% and 82.3%, respectively, from baseline were observed with menatetrenone treatment. Moreover, the safety profile of menatetrenone was similar to alfacalcidol. Being the first clinical trial to investigate the effects of menatetrenone on a Chinese population, the study results could provide a valid clinical basis on treating osteoporosis.</p><p>Since the study involved postmenopausal osteoporotic women (BMD T-score less than &#x02212;2.0), placebo control was not used due to ethical reasons. Alfacalcidol is a recognized drug in treating osteoporosis in the People&#x02019;s Republic of China. Studies in Japan showed no differences in BMD changes between menatetrenone and alfacalcidol in postmenopausal women.<xref rid="b19-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Therefore, alfacalcidol was chosen as a positive drug control to demonstrate the noninferiority of these two drugs. Results showed that menatetrenone 45 mg/day could significantly improve lumbar spine and trochanter BMD after 12 months of treatment. The dose of menatetrenone (45 mg/day) used in this study is the standard dose to treat osteoporosis. As per the primary osteoporosis diagnosis and treatment guidelines of the Chinese Society of Osteoporosis and Bone Mineral Research, the dose of alfacalcidol in treating osteoporosis is 0.5&#x02013;1.0 &#x003bc;g/day.<xref rid="b20-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In order to avoid the side effect of high dose alfacalcidol such as hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria,<xref rid="b21-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> a low dose of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/day alfacalcidol was used in this study. No differences were observed between menatetrenone and alfacalcidol (1.2% versus 2.2% in the lumbar spine, and 2.7% versus 1.8% in the trochanter, respectively) with respect to changes in BMD. However, menatetrenone had more effect on OC and ucOC than alfacalcidol.</p><p>Some randomized controlled trials showed that menatetrenone had only a modest impact or no impact on BMD.<xref rid="b22-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b24-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In the study by Orimo et al,<xref rid="b19-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> there were no differences observed in BMD between menatetrenone 45 mg/day and alfacalcidol 1 &#x003bc;g/day in 24 and 48 weeks. Although menatetrenone has only a modest effect on bone loss, it may have the potential to prevent osteoporotic fractures. Vitamin K deficiency has been reported to contribute to the occurrence of fractures in elderly women, especially hip fractures,<xref rid="b25-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b28-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and it is also a strong predictor of vertebral fractures in patients on hemodialysis.<xref rid="b29-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> A randomized controlled trial suggested that vitamin K2 sustained lumbar BMD and reduced the incidence of vertebral fractures, with a reported reduction of 53% in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis; this rate was similar to the rate reported with treatment with bisphosphonates.<xref rid="b22-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Knapen et al<xref rid="b24-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> indicated that menatetrenone improved the bone strength of the femoral neck by improving femoral neck width and maintaining the indices of compression, bending, and impact strength. These could lead to a decreased incidence of clinical fractures. In the present study, 1.9% of patients experienced a new fracture in Group M during 1 year of treatment, while this proportion was 3.8% in Group A; however, there was no significant difference between the two groups. There was also no difference in new falls between the two groups.</p><p>Menatetrenone is thought to be involved in bone formation as an essential cofactor for &#x003b3;-carboxylation of OC. Rapid conversion of ucOC to carboxylated OC following menatetrenone treatment was confirmed in elderly osteoporotic women with vertebral fractures.<xref rid="b30-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b33-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The present study&#x02019;s results show that OC and ucOC decreased by 38.7% and 82.3%, respectively, compared with baseline. The ucOC/OC ratio also decreased. Another study showed that menatetrenone reduced serum ucOC levels, and a study even showed a decrease in serum ucOC levels after 1 month of therapy.<xref rid="b34-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> However, the results on serum total OC levels are inconsistent. Some studies showed an increase in serum total OC levels,<xref rid="b22-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b24-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> while another showed a decrease in serum total OC levels by vitamin K2 supplementation.<xref rid="b35-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Two explanations can be proposed for this discrepancy: 1) since more OC becomes carboxylated and functional with the improvement of vitamin K2 status, a lesser amount is synthesized and released into circulation; and 2) more functional OC is bound into bones rather than circulating in the blood stream, thus lowering serum total OC levels.<xref rid="b35-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b36-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Studies have showed that ucOC, but not total OC, is a marker predicting hip fracture in elderly women.<xref rid="b25-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b27-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>Menatetrenone tolerability was also evaluated in this study. The safety profile of menatetrenone was similar to alfacalcidol. Adverse events included gastrointestinal symptoms, mild and transient hypercalcemia, leukocytopenia, and abnormalities in liver function. No severe side effects were ever reported before for menatetrenone.<xref rid="b32-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b36-cia-9-121" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Even in this study, menatetrenone was well tolerated by Chinese postmenopausal women. Moreover, the treatment with menatetrenone is a pharmacoeconomically viable option.</p><p>There are some limitations to this study. The sample size was not large enough, and trial duration was not long enough to evaluate the risk of fracture as the primary endpoint. However, results did show important short-term effects in BMD, OC, and ucOC levels, suggesting that these short-term changes should have an impact on the long-term risk of fractures. Also, a food frequency questionnaire was not performed to calculate vitamin K intake. Biochemical markers reflecting bone turnover were not measured. However, changes in BMD directly reflected the balance between bone resorption and bone deposition, and the study results showed that menatetrenone supplementation had a positive impact on BMD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>After 1 year of treatment with menatetrenone, BMD at the lumbar spine and hip were significantly increased in Chinese postmenopausal osteoporotic women, and that effect was comparable to alfacalcidol. These positive changes in BMD were reflected by changes in markers of bone metabolism, and menatetrenone had more effects on these markers. Menatetrenone was well tolerated and safe in the study population. Thus, menatetrenone is an effective and safe choice for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in Chinese women.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was financially supported by Eisai China Inc.
