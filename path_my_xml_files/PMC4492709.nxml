Opioids cause OIC by inhibiting propulsive motor activity of the gastrointestinal tract, primarily via local &#x003bc;-opioid receptors in the plexus myentericus, the complex neural network of the gut.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref></sup> Two strategies have been developed to specifically block local &#x003bc;-opioid receptor activation by opioids: (1) enteral use of centrally acting &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonists with limited systemic absorption and (2) administration of peripherally restricted &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonists.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref></sup> Centrally acting &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonists like naloxone and naltrexone can reverse OIC, but they may also negatively impact opioid analgesic effects because of their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. However, peripherally restricted &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonists have limited access to the central nervous system and therefore relieve OIC without compromising the centrally mediated effects of opioid analgesia.</p><p>Methylnaltrexone (MNTX), a peripherally restricted &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonist and derivative of naltrexone, has restricted ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and antagonizes the undesirable opioid effects on the gut, such as delaying gastric emptying<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and prolonging oral-fecal transit time.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The safety and efficacy of subcutaneous MNTX for inducing a bowel movement in patients with advanced illness and OIC and receiving palliative care have been evaluated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 3 studies.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> These trials were performed using weight-based dosing of MNTX. Compared with weight-based dosing, fixed-dose administration of subcutaneous MNTX can simplify and improve ease of administration for patients and caregivers. Therefore, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) and an open-label extension (OLE) study were conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of fixed-dose subcutaneous MNTX in patients with advanced illness and OIC in a variety of health care situations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s002"><title>Methods</title><p>In the double-blind, multicenter, two-week RCT (study 4000; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00672477), patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive subcutaneous MNTX (8&#x02009;mg or 12&#x02009;mg based on body weight 38&#x02009;kg to &#x0003c;62&#x02009;kg or &#x02265;62&#x02009;kg, respectively) or placebo administered every other day (QOD) in various clinical settings (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, acute care, long-term care, assisted living, home hospice, and skilled nursing facility). After a screening/baseline clinic visit, the treatment phase consisted of three scheduled visits: on day 1 (first dose), day 7 (dose three or four), and day 14 (or early termination). Patients treated with MNTX or placebo who completed the treatment phase of this study could enroll in an OLE study if they met eligibility criteria. Patients not enrolling in the OLE study had a follow-up visit 15 to 21 days after the last dose of the study drug. In the multicenter, 10-week OLE study (study 4001; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00672139), patients received MNTX based on body weight (8&#x02009;mg or 12&#x02009;mg for 38&#x02009;kg to &#x0003c;62&#x02009;kg or &#x02265;62&#x02009;kg, respectively) on an as-needed basis (PRN), but no more than one dose per day. In the OLE study, the baseline visit was followed by treatment phase visits at week 4 and week 10 (or early discontinuation). Patients also had a follow-up visit 15 to 21 days after the administration of last dose of MNTX in the OLE study. The protocol was approved by institutional review boards and ethics committees, and all patients provided written informed consent.</p><sec id="s003"><title>Study population</title><p>Patients eligible for the RCT were &#x02265;18 years of age with advanced illness (defined as a terminal illness [e.g., incurable cancer or other end-stage disease]), had a life expectancy of &#x02265;1 month and OIC (&#x0003c;3 bowel movements in the last week and no bowel movement in 24 hours or no bowel movement in 48 hours), and were receiving stable doses of laxatives and opioids. Patients received opioids on a regular schedule for &#x02265;2 weeks before the first dose of study drug, and a stable opioid regimen was defined as no reduction in opioid dose of &#x02265;50% for &#x02265;3 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Patients with any disease process suggestive of gastrointestinal obstruction or clinically significant active diverticular disease, fecal impaction, peritonitis, bowel surgery &#x02264;10 days before dosing, or fecal ostomy, or with a body weight &#x0003c;38&#x02009;kg were excluded. A stable laxative regimen was required for each patient &#x02265;3 days before the first dose of the study drug and a baseline regimen was continued during the two-week treatment period as appropriate. Patients in the OLE study had similar eligibility requirements as in the RCT, had completed the RCT, and had an anticipated need for treatment of OIC during the 10-week study duration. The baseline laxative regimen administered during the RCT was continued during the 10-week OLE study as necessary. Patients were allowed to use rescue medications or undergo manual disimpaction procedure if needed, but not within four hours before or four hours after receiving a dose of the study drug in both the RCT and OLE study. Prohibited medications in the RCT and OLE study included tegaserod, lubiprostone, opioid antagonists or partial antagonists, and combination opioid and opioid antagonist products.</p></sec><sec id="s004"><title>Measures</title><sec id="s005"><title>Efficacy</title><p>Patients or their caregivers were provided diaries to record information daily on clinically notable bowel movements during the RCT and OLE study; the patients were to return their diaries to the study staff at each study visit. In the RCT, the primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients with a rescue-free bowel movement (RFBM) within four hours after &#x02265;2 of the first 4 doses (i.e., the first week of treatment).

In the RCT, patients rated current pain and worst pain in the preceding four hours (&#x000b1;30 minutes; on a scale of 0 [none] to 10 [worst possible pain]) at baseline, after first dose of study medication (day 1), and after the fourth dose of medication (generally on day 7).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s007"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics.

In the RCT, primary and secondary efficacy endpoint analyses were conducted in the intent-to-treat population. Treatment groups were compared using a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, and baseline body weight (&#x0003c;62&#x02009;kg versus &#x02265;62&#x02009;kg) was considered a major source of variability and was used as the stratification factor for all efficacy analyses in the RCT. The Fisher's exact test was used for primary efficacy endpoint comparisons of treatment groups based on baseline body weight (&#x02264;114&#x02009;kg versus &#x0003e;114&#x02009;kg). For the time-to-event endpoints (e.g., time to first RFBM), distribution of the event times was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The safety population in both the RCT and the OLE study included all patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of the study drug.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s008"><title>Results</title><sec id="s009"><title>Patient disposition and demographics</title><p>In the RCT, of the 237 patients randomized, 230 patients received &#x02265;1 dose of the study drug (116 and 114 patients in the MNTX and placebo groups, respectively; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>).

The study presented here describes results from two phase 4 trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of fixed-dose subcutaneous MNTX to treat OIC in patients with advanced illness. Using baseline weight as a basis for dose selection, the fixed dose used in this study (8&#x02009;mg and 12&#x02009;mg MNTX) resulted in a range of exposures that were similar to the range of exposures observed during a study of 0.15&#x02009;mg/kg in healthy volunteers of varying weight.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In addition, the patients in these two trials were enrolled from a variety of health care settings, thereby providing safety and efficacy information on the use of fixed-dose MNTX in multiple health care situations.</p><p>Similar to the results from the phase 3 trials,<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> fixed-dose MNTX administered QOD during the RCT demonstrated robust efficacy in treating OIC in patients with advanced illness. This patient population did not respond to a standard laxative regimen and continued to have OIC at baseline despite continued laxative use. Significantly superior efficacy was reported with MNTX compared with placebo for the primary and all secondary endpoints assessed in the RCT. The response to MNTX was rapid, with most patients achieving RFBMs within one hour of treatment. The benefit of shorter median times to RFBM with MNTX treatment compared with placebo persisted for all seven double-blind doses in the RCT. Patient baseline weight (&#x0003c;62&#x02009;kg versus &#x02265;62&#x02009;kg) did not substantially affect the efficacy profile of MNTX versus placebo for the relief of OIC. Furthermore, the benefit of fixed doses of MNTX observed in the RCT was durable during the 10 weeks of the OLE study.</p><p>Fixed-dose MNTX demonstrated a favorable safety profile consistent with the approved labeling for this medication during this two-week RCT in patients with advanced illness.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The tolerability profile of MNTX was also favorable in the 10-week OLE study.

Intentional initiative of propulsive peristalsis of the gut during normal bowel movement response induced by MNTX may be perceived as abdominal pain in some patients. SAEs were less common with MNTX than with placebo in this study. Consistent with previous studies in palliative care and noncancer pain, MNTX did not interfere with opioid-induced analgesia,<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> reinforcing the concept of a peripherally restricted action of MNTX.</p><p>A limitation of the study is that the efficacy of fixed-dose MNTX in patients weighing &#x0003c;38&#x02009;kg was not evaluated, because these patients were excluded from the trial. In addition, the RCT treatment phase was limited to a duration of two weeks, although data from the OLE study phase suggest that efficacy was maintained for a longer duration. In conclusion, subcutaneous fixed-dose MNTX administered QOD in the RCT and PRN in the OLE study demonstrated rapid and durable efficacy in the treatment of OIC in patients with advanced illness. The safety profile was favorable with no new safety issues identified with an MNTX dose of up to 12&#x02009;mg/day for up to 12 weeks of treatment.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s013" sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>Technical editorial and medical writing assistance was provided, under the direction of the authors, by Pratibha Hebbar, PhD, Synchrony Medical Communications, LLC, West Chester, Pennsylvania.
