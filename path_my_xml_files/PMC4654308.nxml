While current therapies in MS predominantly target inflammation and reduce relapse rate they have been less effective at preventing long-term disability. The identification and evaluation of effective neuroprotective therapies within a trial paradigm are key unmet needs. Emerging evidence supports amiloride, a licenced diuretic, as a neuroprotective agent in MS through acid sensing ion channel blockade. Optic neuritis (ON) is a common manifestation of MS with correlates of inflammation and neurodegeneration measurable within the visual pathways. Amiloride Clinical Trial In Optic Neuritis (ACTION) will utilise a multimodal approach to assess the neuroprotective efficacy of amiloride in acute ON.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>46 patients will be recruited within 28&#x02005;days from onset of ON visual symptoms and randomised on a 1:1 basis to placebo or amiloride 10&#x02005;mg daily. Double-blinded treatment groups will be balanced for age, sex and visual loss severity by a random-deterministic minimisation algorithm. The primary objective is to demonstrate that amiloride is neuroprotective in ON as assessed by scanning laser polarimetry of the peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness at 6&#x02005;months in the affected eye compared to the unaffected eye at baseline. RNFL in combination with further retinal measures will also be assessed by optical coherence tomography. Secondary outcome measures on brain MRI will include cortical volume, diffusion-weighted imaging, resting state functional MRI, MR spectroscopy and magnetisation transfer ratio. In addition, high and low contrast visual acuity, visual fields, colour vision and electrophysiology will be assessed alongside quality of life measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval was given by the south central Oxford B research ethics committee (REC reference: 13/SC/0022).

It is characterised by inflammatory demyelinating plaques with associated axonal and neuronal damage affecting the central nervous system (CNS). The accumulated impact of neurodegeneration is thought to be the major pathological substrate for disability in MS.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> One of the major unmet needs in MS is for safe, cost-effective therapeutic interventions that prevent neurodegeneration and thereby the development of disability. The natural history of MS is such that disability accrues slowly in the majority of patients and therefore studies examining neuroprotective therapies can be protracted and expensive. Clinical trial paradigms examining acute inflammatory optic neuritis (ON) may help overcome this barrier by demonstrating a &#x02018;proof-of-concept&#x02019; neuroprotective benefit for repurposed or novel therapies.</p><p>Acute inflammatory ON is a common cause of reversible visual loss in young adults in the UK and western world. Patients typically present with painful visual loss that progresses for a maximum of 2&#x02005;weeks and then recovers over the following 2&#x02013;6&#x02005;weeks, with further prolonged recovery of up to a year.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> ON is a common precursor to the development of MS with approximately 50% of patients developing MS within 10&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In addition, 70% of patients with MS will show evidence of optic nerve involvement over time.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The presence of inflammatory demyelination and associated axonal loss in ON parallels the pathophysiology observed in other white matter structures in MS<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> enabling translational research in ON to be applicable to the wider patient group affected by MS.</p><p>The distinct anatomy and function of the optic nerve affords unique ways of studying both structural and functional changes in the CNS during the acute and recovery phases of ON. The retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) is a major site of axonal loss after ON.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Recent advances in retinal imaging allow accurate in vivo estimates of RNFL thickness, with the use of scanning laser polarimetry (GDx) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). High-resolution spectral domain OCT (SD OCT) with segmentation allows precise measurement of specific retinal layers using computerised algorithms and quantitation of both peripapillary and macular RNFL as well as the ganglion cell (GCL) and other retinal layers. Both GDx and SD OCT have recently been employed in neuroprotective trial frameworks<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> allowing neurodegeneration to be quantified in vivo both sensitively and longitudinally.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> Moreover, OCT measures of RNFL loss correlate with clinical outcome measures of visual acuity and disability as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Surrogate markers of neurodegeneration such as MRI measures of cerebral brain atrophy also correlate with RNFL loss.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Thus, ON affords the opportunity to assess the impact of neuroprotective strategies in inflammatory CNS disease.</p><p>Currently there are no therapeutic strategies that have been shown to improve the visual outcome in ON. Oral or intravenous methylprednisolone has been shown to hasten the visual recovery of ON but not to affect the final visual outcome.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Thus, by assessing amiloride, this trial aims to meet the major unmet need for cost-effective, safe, neuroprotective strategies that reduce both axonal loss and disability in ON and by extension to MS.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Translating the basic science</title><p>Recent advances in molecular biology have shed new light on the mechanisms of axonal loss and on potential therapeutic targets in ON and MS.</p><p>While axonal loss in MS is likely to be multifactorial, a key end point is the influx of sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) ions through ion channels and exchangers.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Recent evidence has implicated the Acid Sensing Ion Channel type 1 (ASIC1), capable of fluxing both Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as a mediator of neuronal injury in stroke and more recently in CNS inflammation.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>

In tandem with this, diffusion tensor imaging indices of tissue damage were significantly reduced during the treatment phase in clinically relevant white matter structures suggesting a neuroprotective benefit in patients with MS.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>This converging basic and clinical science strongly supports a role for further testing of amiloride as a novel neuroprotective drug in the treatment of ON and MS.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Objectives and outcome measures</title><p>The Amiloride Clinical Trial in ON (ACTION) incorporates multimodal techniques covering imaging modalities of GDx, OCT and MRI combining with clinical and functional outcomes.</p><sec id="s2a1"><title>Primary objective</title><p>To evaluate the potential neuroprotective efficacy of amiloride in ON through the surrogate measure of retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) measurement.</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Outcome measure</title><p>GDx determined difference in peripapillary RNFL thickness between affected eye at 6&#x02005;months and unaffected fellow eye at baseline.</p><p>In addition secondary outcome measures of the primary objective will be made by assessing GDx derived difference in the affected eye at 12&#x02005;months compared to the baseline unaffected eye, and the same measurements of RNFL will be made using OCT.

We will recruit 46 participants who have either a clinically isolated syndrome of ON, or ON in participants with MS previously unaffected by ON. Participants will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to amiloride or placebo for 5&#x02005;months treatment. The primary outcome measure will be peripapillary RNFL thickness on GDx at 6&#x02005;months compared to unaffected fellow eye at baseline. Secondary outcome measures will be visual outcomes (visual acuity, LCVA, visual field and colour vision), MRI and GDx/OCT measures at baseline, 6 and 12&#x02005;months, PVEP and PERG at baseline and 6&#x02005;months. The 12&#x02005;month measurements will assess if the potential benefit from amiloride is sustained and whether or not a rebound neurodegeneration occurs when off active drug. Placebo treatment identical to amiloride and blinding of both the investigators and participants to treatment is being utilised to minimise bias. We propose to combine longitudinal measurements of RNFL thickness determined by both GDx and OCT to provide evidence of the neuroprotective efficacy of amiloride. This will be supplemented by clinical and electrophysiological outcomes and non-conventional MRI measures. In the treatment arm of the study we will use 10&#x02005;mg of amiloride. This replicates the efficacious and well-tolerated dose used in our preliminary study in primary progressing multiple sclerosis participants, and is consistent with the licenced dose of amiloride.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015009200F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Amiloride Clinical Trial In Optic Neuritis (ACTION) trial visit schedule.

This timeframe has been chosen because longitudinal studies have shown that RNFL loss is greatest within 3&#x02005;months after onset of ON.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Therefore, initiation of therapy as early as possible is likely to positively influence the primary outcome measure; showing that amiloride has a neuroprotective effect. Treatment will be for a 5-month period from randomisation; this will allow a therapeutic efficacy during the early period of the majority of RNFL loss. This allows for a 4&#x02005;week &#x02018;washout&#x02019; period prior to imaging, to ameliorate any potential influence on tissue volume from the diuretic effect of amiloride. Similarly, imaging outcomes incorporating volumetric analyses (MRI, OCT, GDx) will be acquired prior to randomisation to minimise any potential confounding effect of the drug. In addition, MRI prior to randomisation will mitigate potential inclusion of compressive optic neuropathies.</p><p>In current clinical practice some patients may be given a course of oral or intravenous methylprednisolone at the initial presentation of ON. Methylprednisolone has been shown to hasten the recovery of ON, but not change the visual outcome.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Given the systemic side effects of high-dose steroids, this is usually restricted to a small group of patients in whom symptoms are severely restricting their activities of daily living. It has been shown that our primary outcome of RNFL thickness is not affected by administration of methylprednisolone in ON.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The use of methylprednisolone is decided by the treating physician outside the study, and would be recorded in the case report form (CRF). However, because we do not expect it to affect our primary end point it will not affect study inclusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcome measures of neuroprotection in ON being used in the ACTION trial</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>Imaging outcome measures</title><sec id="s2d1a"><title>GDX</title><p>The primary measure of efficacy will be whether participants treated in the acute stage of ON with amiloride show greater preservation of RNFL thickness at 6&#x02005;months compared to a placebo control group. The RNFL is the only retinal structure that is birefringent to a polarised light, therefore a change in the retardance of a polarised light can be measured by GDx and used to reliably infer the thickness of RNFL. The difference in RNFL thickness, as measured by GDx (GDx, Carl Zeiss Meditech) between affected eye at 6&#x02005;months and unaffected fellow eye at baseline will be compared between the amiloride and placebo groups. Quality control of the image capture of GDx will be consistent with previous studies.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Given the heterogeneity in baseline RNFL measurements in control groups, comparison with fellow unaffected eyes has been shown to be more sensitive than comparing with measurements from control groups for detecting RNFL thinning in ON, though both methods show a significant RNFL thinning following ON.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2d1b"><title>Optical coherence tomography</title><p>An additional measure of RNFL will be made using OCT (Spectralis OCT, Heidelberg Engineering). This uses near infra-red light to form a cross-sectional image of the retina. In addition to the RNFL around the optic nerve, OCT allows segmentation of the retinal layers at the macula, providing measurements of macular RNFL, GCL, inner nuclear layer and outer retinal layers. Quality control of the image capture will be in line with published consensus guidelines.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> There is increasing evidence that the GCL at the macula, as identified on this spectral domain OCT, is affected after ON<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and has been shown to be more closely correlated with visual function in MS cohorts<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> than RNFL thickness, which is measured around the optic nerve. This retinal segmentation provides additional information on neurodegeneration in ON and comparison between the two arms of the study will provide further insight into the potential protective effect of amiloride.</p></sec><sec id="s2d1c"><title>MRI</title><sec id="s2d1c1"><title>Conventional MRI</title><p>To enhance the interpretation of the non-conventional MRI measures, T1 and T2-weighted MRI sequences will be acquired and used to assess brain volume and white matter lesions typically found in MS and ON.

This ranges in reports from 1.6% to 16%<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37&#x02013;39</xref> and the conditions involved are also inflammatory (eg, sarcoid ON, chronic relapsing idiopathic optic neuropathy, neuromyelitis optica). Given the ASIC pathway is a downstream mechanism of neurodegeneration in general CNS inflammation, we would not anticipate that amiloride would be detrimental to these groups.</p><p>The clinical course of an atypical ON is such that the diagnosis may not be discriminated from typical ON until after a poor recovery of vision in the initial weeks after ON. In addition, in the case of neuromyelitis optica, the diagnosis can be confirmed following positive antiaquaporin-4 antibody testing. However, this result will not be available until visit 3 (at 4&#x02005;weeks). Once identified, these participants will be removed from the intention-to-treat (ITT) cohort and referred for appropriate care. Other differential diagnoses will remain in the ITT cohort and also be referred for appropriate clinical care. However, should these participants require immunosuppressive treatment they will be removed from the final analysis. We accounted for a 10% rate of atypical ON in our study powering, in addition to removing participants with neuromyelitis optica from the ITT cohort. We would aim to have a much smaller number of residual atypical ON than this, however, given the need for early recruitment necessary for neuroprotection, we recognise the potential for atypical ON to enter the cohort.</p></sec><sec id="s2h3"><title>Ischaemic optic neuropathies</title><p>The age group eligibility criteria for this trial were selected to minimise the potential inclusion of patients with ischaemic optic neuropathies (anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy). While these can be confused with ON at initial diagnosis, they generally differ in their clinical presentation and natural history. Participants subsequently diagnosed with ischaemic optic neuropathy will be removed from the ITT analysis. Moreover, we do not anticipate any harm from amiloride in these groups as animal models of CNS ischaemia, have implicated ASIC1 as an important factor in neuronal injury with blockade providing neuroprotective benefit.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Study procedures</title><p>Study procedures will all take place at the John Radcliffe hospital and the FMRIB centre at the John Radcliffe site.</p><sec id="s2i1"><title>Screening and eligibility assessment</title><p>Participants will be identified at the time of their presentation with ON, by the clinical care team at the trial site (Oxford) or patient identification centres (PIC) and given the participant information leaflet (PIL) at that point.

The randomisation will be performed by study investigators whose access to the software does not allow unblinding. If requested on clinical grounds the decision to unblind will be made by the chief investigator. The randomisation log and unblinding envelopes are held in the John Radcliffe Pharmacy with a 24&#x02005;h on call service. A random-deterministic minimisation algorithm will be used to produce treatment groups balanced for important prognostic factors. The first 10% of participants will be allocated randomly without minimisation to avoid predictability. Subsequently the minimisation algorithm will be applied with an allocation ratio that is not fully deterministic: there will be an 80% bias in favour of allocations that minimise the imbalance.</p><p>The randomisation algorithm will minimise for the following three variables related to prognosis at baseline:

Thirty six participants are required to detect a difference of 7.4&#x02005;&#x003bc;m between groups on the primary outcome (difference in RNFL between affected and unaffected eye). This assumes a SD of 6.6, power of 90% and a 5% significance level. Allowing for a 10% drop out rate this increases to 40. However, as described previously, it is thought that approximately 10% of participants may have atypical ON. Therefore, to ensure that there is enough power to detect this difference in the typical ON subgroup we will need to randomise a total of 46 participants.</p><p>It is likely that patients found to have neuromyelitis optica (NMO) as described above will be given further medications that are potential confounding factors (listed in exclusion criteria) and they will not be included in the main ITT analysis. Therefore, randomisation will continue until a total of 46 participants have been randomised and reached the 4-week point without being diagnosed with NMO. It is thought that a maximum of 8% of participants randomised could have NMO, increasing the possible sample size to 50.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Quality control and quality assurance</title><p>There will be an independent data and safety monitoring committee (DMC) made up of an independent consultant neurologist, an independent consultant ophthalmologist, an independent statistician and the trial statistician.

ACTION is a phase II clinical trial aiming to provide proof of concept that amiloride is neuroprotective in acute inflammatory ON. The trial encompasses a multimodal approach combining structural and functional outcomes with clinical measures enabling the refinement of future trial designs.</p><p>However, the recruitment of acute patients with ON within a short time window to a clinical trial setting can be challenging and requires a high degree of cooperation between clinical and research staff in order to give potential participants the opportunity to take part. Despite this, within the spectrum of CNS structures affected by MS, one of the major values of using ON to assess neuroprotection is that the visual system provides unique opportunities to do so in a timely and efficient manner.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The findings from ACTION will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and at scientific conferences.
