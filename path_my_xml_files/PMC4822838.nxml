Loss of global methylation may lead to chromosomal instability, loss of imprinting, and activation of transposable elements, which lead to disturbances in the genome.[<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The impact of nutrition on epigenome has been increasingly recognized as several nutrients are well known for their impact on DNA methylation, such as folic acid, vitamin B, green tea and alcohol.[<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, the effect of vitamin D on global methylation remains largely unknown. To date, a few studies have looked into the relationship between vitamin D status and global DNA methylation mostly in Caucasian populations and reported mix results.[<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, the effect of vitamin D on global methylation in African Americans remains unexplored.</p><p>Several studies reported a race/ethnic influence on global DNA methylation.[<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, whether vitamin D plays a role in global DNA methylation and whether race/ethnicity plays a role in the relationship between vitamin D status and global methylation remain unclear. Therefore, we first tested our hypothesis that low vitamin D status would be associated with global hypomethylation and this association would be race/ethnicity dependent. To further establish the causal relationship between vitamin D level and global DNA methylation in African Americans, we took advantage of a previously completed randomized placebo controlled trial (RCT) of vitamin D supplementation.

Global DNA methylation level was quantified in 100 ng genomic DNA using leukocyte DNA with the MethylFlash<sup>TM</sup> Methylated DNA Quantification kit (Epigentek, Farmingdale, NY) following manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction. Briefly, the methylated DNA was detected using capture and detection antibodies to 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and then quantified colorimetrically by reading absorbance at 450 nm using Bio-Tek PowerWave HT Microplate Spectrophotometer (biotek, Winooski, VT). The amount of methylated DNA is proportional to the OD intensity measured. Relative quantification was used to calculate percentage of 5-mC (%5-mC) in total leukocyte DNA following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Each sample was run in duplicate. In the vitamin D supplementation trial, the pre- and posttest samples from the same participant were run on the same plate.

Our major findings include: 1) African Americans generally have lower level of global methylation than Caucasians; 2) low 25OHD levels are associated with global hypomethylation in African American individuals; 3) vitamin D3 supplementation increases levels of global DNA methylation in a dose-dependent manner in young African Americans with vitamin D deficiency.</p><p>To date, only a few human studies have been conducted to examine the relationship between vitamin D level and global methylation, and mainly in Caucasian populations. Nair-Shalliker <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] reported that exposure to solar UV radiation was inversely associated with global DNA methylation and this association was not influenced by vitamin D level in healthy adults in South Australia. Chavez Valencia <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] exposed primary human blood mononuclear cells to vitamin D (calcitriol) for up to 120 hours, and measured genome-scale DNA methylation response using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 beadchip and reported no significant DNA methylation changes in response to vitamin D treatment. In a clinical trial conducted by Hubner <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] 50 German subjects (median age 68.0 years) were supplemented with a daily oral dose of B vitamins (500 ug folic acid, 500 ug vitamin B12 and 50 mg vitamin B6), 1200IU vitamin D and 456 mg calcium for one year. Long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) methylation was determined in genomic DNA from blood cells as a surrogate for whole genome methylation. The combined vitamin B and D supplementation had no effect on LINE-1 methylation, especially in subjects with no severe vitamin deficiency.[<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Tapp <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the effects of nutritional factors on age-related DNA methylation in the human rectal mucosa samples and reported a weak positive correlation between vitamin D and LINE-1 methylation.[<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In the present study, we showed that low 25(OH)D is associated with global hypomethylation only in African Americans, not in Caucasians. Moreover, vitamin D3 supplementation increases levels of global DNA methylation in a dose-dependent manner in young African Americans with vitamin D deficiency. The new findings provide further support for our previous observations that vitamin D deficiency is associated with leukocyte DNA methylation changes. Subjects with vitamin D deficiency tend to have reduced levels of DNA methylation of the top 10 differentially methylated CpG sites compared with controls.[<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Leukocytes consist of a mixture of different cell types that all may have a cell-specific epigenome. However, Talens <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] demonstrated that for the large majority of candidate loci, inter-individual differences in the cellular composition of the blood sample did not contribute to the variation observed in DNA methylation or explained only a minor proportion of that variation. In the present study, we did not find correlation between the change in composition of leukocytes (i.e. neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes) and either change in 25(OH)D or change in global DNA methylation suggesting that increased global methylation induced by vitamin D3 supplementation might not be biased by the different composition of leukocytes.</p><p>Racial influence on the methylome has been reported previously. African Americans are generally at hypomethylated state compared to Caucasians.[<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Our cross-sectional LACHY study confirms the previous findings. In the present study, we observed a significant interaction between race and 25(OH)D on global methylation. However this is not unexpected since over 97% of the Caucasians were vitamin D deficient, whereas 66% of African Americans were vitamin D deficient. Whether the difference in global methylation between Caucasians and African Americans were race dependent or vitamin D dependent warrants further investigation. African Americans suffer from disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Altered methylome may be one of underlying mechanisms that explain these health disparities.</p><p>Global genomic hypomethylation is a common epigenetic event in cancer that mostly results from hypomethylation of repetitive DNA elements. Loss of global methylation may lead to chromosomal instability, loss of imprinting, and activation of transposable elements, which lead to disturbances in the genome.[<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The mechanism underlying the effect of vitamin D on global methylation is not well understood. Recent evidence suggests that vitamin D can induce DNA demethylation in the promoter of certain tumor suppressor genes,[<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] while increasing global DNA methylation of LINE-1.[<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Interestingly, the interaction of vitamin D and DNA methylation is mediated by the expression of GADD45 (growth arrest and DNA damage).[<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] GADD45A is one of the enzymes that relieves epigenetic gene silencing by promoting DNA repair and promotes global DNA demethylation.[<xref rid="pone.0152849.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Further research is needed to better understand how vitamin D regulates the epigenome.</p><p>Major strengths in the present study included: 1) Our large cross-sectional cohort with racial diversity allows us to determine the race/ethnic differences in vitamin D and global methylation relation; 2) The dose-responsive RCT of vitamin D supplementation not only allowed us to validate our findings obtained from the cross-sectional study, but also helped to establish causal and dose-response relationships; 3) Only inclusion of African American participants with vitamin D deficiency in the dose-responsive RCT of vitamin D supplementation maximized the chance to detect the biological effect of vitamin D. We acknowledge there are also limitations in the study. First, the sample size in each group of the RCT of vitamin D supplementation was relatively small. Therefore, large RCTs of vitamin D supplementation are needed to validate our findings. Second, we have only analyzed the effect of three major leukocyte cell types (neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes) on the vitamin D-DNA methylation relation, the influence of other subtypes of leukocytes remains unknown and warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Conclusion</title><p>African Americans have lower level of global DNA methylation compared to Caucasians. In addition, low vitamin D level is associated with global hypomethylation in African American individuals, whereas vitamin D supplementation increases global methylation in a dose-responsive manner. The present study provides an important piece of evidence that vitamin D plays a role in epigenetic regulations in humans. Moreover, our study suggests that vitamin D may exert its impact on health disparity through epigenomic regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152849.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Correlation between changes in 5-methylcytosine and 25(OH)D in the 4,000 IU group.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152849.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152849.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><p>Table A.
