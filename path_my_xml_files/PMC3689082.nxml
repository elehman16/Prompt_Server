We evaluated grass allergy immunotherapy tablet (AIT) treatment in North American adults with grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis (AR/C), with/without asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Subjects age 18&#x02013;65 with clinical history of grass pollen&#x02013;induced AR/C, with/without asthma were randomized 1:1 to once-daily 2800 BAU Timothy grass AIT (oral lyophilisate, <italic>Phleum pratense</italic>, 75,000 SQ-T, containing approximately 15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of Phl p 5) or placebo. The AR/C symptom and medication scores were recorded daily. The primary end point was the average AR/C daily symptom score (DSS) during the entire grass pollen season (GPS). Ranked key secondary end points were Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) score, daily medication score (DMS), and percentage of well days, all over entire GPS. Safety was monitored through adverse event reporting.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Efficacy analysis included 289 subjects. Over the entire GPS, mean DSS was 6% lower with AIT versus placebo (5.69 vs. 6.06), but this difference was not statistically significant (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.3475) despite significantly higher immunological response in the grass AIT group. No significant between-group differences were seen for key secondary end points. In general, DSS was high before GPS began and no clear relationship between DSS and grass pollen counts was seen during GPS. In post hoc analysis of subjects with pre-seasonal DSS &#x02264;3, mean DSS and DMS were both significantly lower with grass AIT versus placebo (27%; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0327 and 68%; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0060, respectively). In this subgroup a relationship between DSS and grass pollen counts was observed. Grass AIT was generally well tolerated, with no events of anaphylactic shock or respiratory compromise.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this trial, 2800 BAU grass AIT did not demonstrate significant symptom improvement versus placebo. Lack of relationship between pollen count and symptom score in the study population, and post hoc findings among subjects with low pre-seasonal symptoms, suggest that the symptoms reported in this study were not primarily reflective of the effects of grass pollen exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00421655">NCT00421655</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Allergic rhinitis</kwd><kwd>Allergic conjunctivitis</kwd><kwd>Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis</kwd><kwd>Allergy immunotherapy tablet</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Specific immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>Sublingual immunotherapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In Europe, Timothy grass allergy immunotherapy tablet (AIT) treatment is an approved means of administering immunotherapy sublingually to patients who are sensitized to Timothy and related grass pollens, and it has been approved by regulatory authorities for the disease-modifying treatment of grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis (AR/C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Unlike symptomatic treatment, grass AIT has been shown to provide significant improvements in AR/C symptoms and medication use 2&#x000a0;years after cessation of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Conventional subcutaneous immunotherapy also has disease-modifying potential and has been used for more than a century, but it requires repeated in-office injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and in some cases has been associated with severe anaphylaxis, including fatal reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Sublingual allergy immunotherapy delivered via rapidly dissolving tablets is a relatively new, more convenient treatment modality that appears to be associated with a positive safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Compared with trials for symptomatic AR/C treatments, the design and execution of immunotherapy clinical trials is complex. In pharmacotherapy studies, subjects with AR/C are typically enrolled once their symptoms have reached a predefined level of severity, and the ability of the target agent to reduce symptoms can be observed within hours to days of initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In trials of immunotherapy for seasonal allergies, treatment is initiated weeks or months prior to the onset of pollen season and the associated symptoms, to allow the treatment to modulate the immune system before the season starts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Therefore, subjects are enrolled based on symptoms experienced in previous seasons; however, the severity of symptoms in previous seasons may not be an accurate predictor of upcoming symptoms due to several complicating factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Variable pollen levels, potential exposure to other allergens, pollutant exposure, weather patterns, allergen avoidance measures, disease progression, and methods of allergy testing can all exert effects on the results observed in a trial of seasonal allergy immunotherapy. We evaluated treatment with SCH 697243/MK-7243, a Timothy grass AIT formulation of 2800 bioequivalent allergen units (BAU), in North American adults with grass pollen-induced AR/C with or without asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Demographics and baseline characteristics</title><p>Of the 405 subjects who were screened, 329 subjects were randomized and were included in the safety analysis (76 [19%] subjects were screening failures). The efficacy analysis included 150 placebo-treated subjects and 139 grass AIT&#x02013;treated subjects who completed at least 1 diary entry during the grass pollen season (GPS). In total, 140 (84%) and 136 (83%) subjects in the placebo and grass AIT groups completed the trial, whereas 26 (16%) and 27 (17%) in each group, respectively, withdrew prematurely.

The design of the current study was modeled after a phase 3, placebo-controlled trial of 634 adults with grass pollen-induced AR/C that was conducted in 8 European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In that study, grass AIT initiated an average of 26&#x000a0;weeks prior to the start of the GPS significantly reduced AR/C symptoms and medication use. The efficacy of grass AIT has been demonstrated in 4 phase 2 and 3 trials conducted in European subjects with AR/C due to grass pollen allergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]; 2 large, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies in North American subjects assessed symptoms during the 2009 GPS and found that pre- and co-seasonal treatment with grass AIT was well tolerated and significantly reduced AR/C symptoms and combined symptom and medication score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. As in other trials of grass AIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], there were no cases of anaphylactic shock in the present study; epinephrine was administered to 3 subjects, all of whom experienced symptoms within 10&#x000a0;minutes after the first dose of grass AIT and none of whom showed signs of hypotension.</p><p>Post hoc analyses of the present trial were attempted, to clarify what characteristics of its population or design might have contributed to its failure to achieve the results seen in successful trials of grass AIT. As in &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; conditions, many subjects in the study were sensitized to multiple allergens; approximately 50% of subjects were sensitized to tree pollen, cat hair, and HDM. However, subgroup analysis of subjects without these additional sensitizations also failed to show significant differences between grass AIT and placebo. Further, the proportion of subjects also sensitized to other common allergens in the present trial was similar to those seen in other trials of grass AIT, in which significant treatment effects were seen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A recent pooled analysis of data from 6 such placebo-controlled randomized trials that found that response to grass AIT treatment was similar between subjects sensitized only to grass and subjects sensitized to other common allergens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Given these pieces of evidence, it is considered unlikely that the efficacy of grass AIT was masked by the allergic responses to other common seasonal and perennial allergens.</p><p>However, several lines of evidence give support to the idea that the symptoms reported by subjects in this trial may not have been reflective of the influence of grass pollen exposure. First, the pattern of symptoms during the GPS was unexpected. In the current study, symptom severity and medication use did not show any clear relationship to seasonal pollen exposure. By comparison, symptoms generally mirrored pollen levels in other grass AIT studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], ie, peak symptoms coincided with peak pollen levels. Additionally, subjects in the current trial showed high pre-seasonal symptoms, whereas in other grass AIT trials symptoms were relatively minimal in the pre-seasonal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A post hoc analysis divided subjects into those with low pre-seasonal symptoms (DSS &#x02264;3; 33% of all subjects) and those with high pre-seasonal symptoms (DSS &#x0003e;3; 67% of all subjects). In those with pre-seasonal DSS &#x02264;3, mean DSS and mean DMS were both significantly lower over the GPS in the grass AIT group compared with the placebo group (27%; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0327 and 68%; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0060, respectively). The 27% reduction in symptom scores was similar to the magnitude of the treatment effect seen in other grass AIT trials (18% to 30% reduction in mean DSS relative to placebo), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and as in these trials the symptom scores closely corresponded to pollen exposure. In subjects with pre-season DSS &#x0003e;3, no significant differences between grass AIT and placebo were seen for mean DSS or DMS (p &#x0003e;0.05). Along with the fact that no relationship of symptoms to pollen count was observed in the overall population, this suggests that the symptoms reported in this trial were not primarily reflective of the effects of grass pollen exposure. It is conceivable that subjects were suffering symptoms due to some other unidentified cause, or that some subjects understood poorly the standards by which they were to score their symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter North American trial, grass AIT at a dose of 2800 BAU was not associated with significant improvements in AR/C symptom or medication scores versus placebo over the GPS. These results contrast with the efficacy repeatedly demonstrated in European and 2 other North American trials of grass AIT for the treatment of AR/C. Multiple possibilities have been explored as plausible explanations for the trial failure. Though no firm conclusions can be made, the high pre-seasonal symptoms, lack of a relationship between pollen count and symptom score in the presence of significant immunological response, and the significant results of post hoc analysis excluding subjects with high pre-seasonal scores suggest that the symptoms reported were not primarily reflective of the effects of grass pollen exposure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group multicenter trial conducted at 28 sites in the United States (GT-14; clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00421655).

The tablets were supplied as fast-dissolving, neutral-tasting oral lyophilisates for sublingual application. Excipients included gelatin, mannitol, and sodium hydroxide. Treatment was administered sublingually, preferably in the morning, for at least 8 to 16&#x000a0;weeks before the anticipated start of the GPS and continuing throughout the GPS. Randomization was performed by in blocks by ALK, using the SAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> system for Windows, which generates random assignment of treatment groups to randomization numbers. The randomization list was generated by a trial statistician who was independent of the statistical analyses. A 5-digit subject number was allocated to the subject at the screening visit (visit 1). When a subject was randomized in the trial he/she was always to be assigned the lowest available randomization number. The randomization number was a 4-digit number.</p><p>The first dose of study medication was administered at the study site. Subjects were required to remain at the study site for 20 to 30&#x000a0;minutes after administration of the first dose to monitor for any AEs. Subsequent treatments were self-administered by the subject once daily at home. Eating and drinking were not allowed for 5&#x000a0;minutes after administration. If any significant adverse event such as wheezing, dyspnea, severe oral swelling, or sign of generalized anaphylactic reaction was observed or reported, the investigator was to evaluate the subject to determine whether treatment should be initiated; in such cases the observation period was to be extended for at least an additional 30&#x000a0;minutes, and upon leaving the clinic the subject was instructed to contact the clinic immediately if the reaction reoccurred or a new reaction appeared.</p></sec><sec><title>Study subjects</title><p>Subjects included in the study were 18 to 65&#x000a0;years of age with a clinical history of grass pollen-induced AR/C, with or without asthma, that interfered with daily activities or sleep and was bothersome despite symptomatic treatment during the GPS.

All symptoms were measured as follows: 0, no symptoms; 1, mild symptoms; 2, moderate symptoms; or 3, severe symptoms. Open-label AR/C rescue medication was provided approximately 2&#x000a0;weeks before the start of the GPS to be used in a stepwise sequence once the start of the GPS had been confirmed and subjects reported a total AR/C symptom score &#x02265;6 (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). Asthma medication (for subjects with asthma) was provided as needed and use was recorded; the asthma DMS was composed of the sum of scores for short-acting &#x003b2; antagonist and inhaled corticosteroid use. Subjects were instructed to record their use of rescue medications in the electronic diary. The AR/C DMS was composed of the sum of scores for oral antihistamine and ocular antihistamine use.

Safety assessments also included hematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis testing, physical examination, vital signs, and FEV<sub>1</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample size calculations were based on data from a previous grass AIT trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] in which the mean values and standard deviations (SD) for the symptom score were 2.4 (1.6) for grass AIT and 3.4 (2.2) for placebo. Approximately 150 subjects per group, assuming a 20% dropout rate, would detect a 24% reduction in mean DSS for grass AIT compared with placebo at a 5% significance level and with 90% power. The difference between the grass AIT and placebo groups for DSS, DMS, and percentage of well days was assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), with treatment group as fixed effect and pollen region as random effect. The confidence interval for the relative treatment difference was estimated by bootstrapping using the mean estimates. The weekly overall RQLQ(S) analysis was performed using a repeated measurement ANOVA including treatment group, week, and treatment-by-week interaction as fixed effects, pollen area as a random effect, and adjusting for subject variation. An AR(1) or compound symmetry covariance structure was applied. All efficacy analyses were conducted on the intent-to-treat population based on all randomized subjects who had data available (at least 1 post-treatment diary data entry during the entire GPS, or during peak GPS for end points assessing peak GPS) for analysis. There was no imputation of missing data, and subjects who withdrew prior to the start of the GPS did not contribute to the efficacy analyses. Safety analyses were conducted on all randomized subjects. Differences in the immunological assessments between visits within treatment and differences between treatments at each visit were estimated using a repeated measurement model. The response variable in the model was change from baseline. Treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction, and pollen area were included as fixed effects, and the adjustment for different error variation for each group was performed. IgE and IgG4 values were log10-transformed to obtain approximately normally distributed data. Differences between visits in immunological measurements within each treatment were in addition tested using a Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test; non-parametric tests of differences between treatments were performed using a Wilcoxon test. The principal statistical software used was SAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, version 8.2.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AEs: Adverse events; AIT: Allergy immunotherapy tablet; ANOVA: Analysis of variance; AR(1): Autoregressive covariance model (1); AR/C: Allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis; BAU: Bioequivalent allergen units; DMS: Daily medication score; DSS: daily symptom score; FEV1: Forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;second; GPS: Grass pollen season; HDM: House dust mite; RQLQ(S): Rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire with standardized activities; SD: Standard deviations; VAS: Visual analogue scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Kevin Murphy reports advisory board membership, speaker's bureau participation, and consultancy for Merck.
