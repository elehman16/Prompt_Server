The number of people with self-reported electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS), who complain of various subjective symptoms such as headache, dizziness and fatigue, has also increased. However, the origins of EHS remain unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this double-blind study, two volunteer groups of 17 EHS and 20 non-EHS subjects were simultaneously investigated for physiological changes (heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiration rate), eight subjective symptoms, and perception of RF-EMFs during real and sham exposure sessions. Experiments were conducted using a dummy phone containing a WCDMA module (average power, 24 dBm at 1950&#x02009;MHz; specific absorption rate, 1.57&#x02009;W/kg) within a headset placed on the head for 32&#x02009;min.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>WCDMA RF-EMFs generated no physiological changes or subjective symptoms in either group.

On the basis of limited evidence from both human and animal studies, the World Health Organization has classified RF-EMFs as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A number of people have self-reported electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS), characterized by a variety of non-specific symptoms that differ from individual to individual. Cross-sectional survey studies in different countries have reported that EHS subjects experience non-specific subjective symptoms (e.g., headache, dizziness, fatigue, sleep disorder) associated with EMF exposure: 1.5% in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], 3.2% in California [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and 5% in Switzerland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. For some individuals, the symptoms can have lifestyle-changing consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Although numerous studies have examined the effects of Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) on humans between EHS and non-EHS groups, only a few provocation studies involving WCDMA have simultaneously evaluated physiological changes, subjective symptoms, and EMF perception. Furubayashi et al. measured psychological and cognitive parameters during pre- and post-exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. They also monitored physiological parameters, such as skin temperature, heart rate and local blood flow, and asked participants (EHS and non-EHS women) to report on their subjective perception of EMF emitted by WCDMA devices. They concluded that EHS and non-EHS groups did not differ in their responses to real or sham EMF exposure with respect to any psychological, cognitive, or autonomic parameter.</p><p>Electromagnetic sensibility in the context of subjective symptoms and perception refers to the ability to perceive EMF without necessarily developing non-specific health symptoms attributable to EMF exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Mueller et al. reported no significant differences in the ability to detect EMF between EHS and non-EHS groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In a study by Hietanen et al., in which EHS subjects were examined for their ability to perceive EMF, none of the subjects could distinguish real EMF exposure from sham exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Kwon et al. reported that there was no evidence to indicate that EHS subjects could detect EMF exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, Leitgeb et al. reported that a subset of EHS subjects with significantly increased electromagnetic sensibility could be differentiated from non-EHS groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Therefore, a comprehensive study is necessary to understand whether EHS is actually caused by exposure to RF-EMFs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Because determination of EHS subjects was crucial to this provocation study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], we utilized the EHS screening tool developed by Eltiti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We adopted the following criteria to identify EHS individuals: (1) a total symptom score greater than or equal to 26 out of a maximum score of 228 (57 symptoms, each ranked from 0 for &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d; to 4 for &#x0201c;a great deal&#x0201d;); (2) individuals who explicitly attribute their symptoms to exposure to only 3&#x02009;G mobile phones; and (3) individuals whose current symptoms cannot be explained by a pre-existing chronic illness.</p><p>The experiment was performed as a double-blind study with a total of 45 subjects. Initially, 19 EHS and 26 non-EHS subjects were screened; however, two EHS subjects and six non-EHS subjects were excluded. The two EHS subjects were excluded because they were considered outliers in respiration rate, which was greater than two standard deviations from the median (extreme outlier) or 20 beats per min higher than normal without exposure. In the non-EHS group, one subject was excluded because of some drowsiness and motion artifacts during the experiment; three subjects were excluded because they were outliers with respect to heart rate; and two subjects were eliminated because of abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG). None of the EHS or non-EHS subjects failed to attend the second&#x02009;day after attending the first day. Therefore, data from a total of 37 subjects&#x02014;17 EHS and 20 non-EHS&#x02014;were analyzed in this study.

The WCDMA modules continuously transmitted at a mean output power of 24 dBm at 1950 MHz, which was measured using a wireless communication test set (E5515C, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). The modules were inserted into a dummy phone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and the location of the module was varied to meet the recommended general public specific absorption rate (SAR)<sub>1g</sub> of 1.6 W/kg according to the IEEE Standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The SAR measurements were made with a DASY 4 measurement system (SPEAG, Zurich, Switzerland), and a Twin SAM (specific anthropomorphic mannequin) phantom was filled with head tissue-equivalent liquid (mass density, 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>) as specified by the Federal Communications Commission. The measured dielectric properties of the liquid were &#x003c3;&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.41 S/m and &#x003f5;<sub>r</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;39.7 for the WCDMA frequency range.

Sham and real sessions were conducted as a double-blind test to minimize any test bias resulting from a subject and an experimenter recognizing the operational state of the WCDMA module. The experiment was performed for two days, one day for a real session and a second&#x02009;day for a sham session (or vice versa). No matter which came first, sham or real exposure, the second session was always conducted at approximately the same time of the day as the first session in order to maintain the subjects&#x02019; physiological rhythm.

The sham exposure period was compared with the real exposure period to test whether the subjects could detect the fields. The post-exposure period after sham exposure was compared with the post-exposure period after real exposure to test whether the real exposure influenced the perception of exposure in the post-exposure period.

The same reasoning applies to the significant differences during pre- and post-exposure in both sham and real exposure sessions. These higher percentages in the EHS group during both the sham and real sessions probably resulted from a bias of EHS individuals, who believe they can feel EMF, as described in our previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Therefore, there is no evidence that individuals in the EHS group perceived the radiation emitted by WCDMA mobile phones better than those in the non-EHS group.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Neither the EHS nor the non-EHS group showed significant differences in heart or respiration rate between real and sham exposures or among stages. In the case of LFP/HFP, however, there were significant differences between some stages during both real and sham exposure sessions in both groups. One disadvantage of the LFP/HFP analysis is that it is considerably influenced by stress, which can increase or decrease LFP/HFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Hjortskov et al. reported that psychological stress could result in increased LFP/HFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Nam et al. reported that LFP/HFP monotonically increased at each exposure stage in both EHS and non-EHS groups during 30&#x02009;min of sham exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In a subsequent study, Nam et al. also confirmed that LFP/HFP significantly increased over time in the absence of exposure, an effect the authors attributed to acute sleep deprivation resulting from awakening subjects with a noise when they exhibited drowsiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. An additional potential source of stress was the requirement that subjects not move during a 64&#x02009;min experiment. In fact, the &#x0201c;no-movement&#x0201d; requirement was the factor that drew the most complaints by subjects.</p><p>In the current study, neither the EHS nor non-EHS group showed significant differences in any of the four stages between real and sham sessions for any of the eight symptoms surveyed. Wil&#x000e9;n et al., reported that exposure to RF-EMFs cannot explain perceived mobile phone attributed symptoms in EHS or non-EHS subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Koivisto et al. also reported that RF exposure did not produce any consistent subjective symptoms or sensations such as headache, dizziness, and fatigue in non-EHS subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore, most likely, subjective symptoms resulted from a nocebo effect, meaning adverse symptoms occurred due to negative expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>There were no significant differences in the percentages of perception in either group who believed they were being exposed during pre- or post-exposure periods between real and sham exposures. There were also no significant differences in the perception percentages for either the EHS or non-EHS group during the sham exposure session (pre-exposure, sham exposure, post-exposure). Therefore, our experimental protocol seems minimally biased since we confirmed that there were no delayed effects, no differences in pre-exposure condition, and no difference in the percentage of those who believed they were being exposed among the pre-exposure, sham exposure, and post-exposure periods. With regard to the outliers, we included subjects who were outliers in the analyses and tested again to see whether their inclusion actually changed statistical tests for the physiological variables, symptoms, and perception. These results including the outliers were not significantly different from those excluding the outliers.</p><p>We used the EHS screening tool developed by Eltiti et al. to identify individuals who were sensitivity to RF-EMFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. There is no objective diagnostic criterion for classifying someone as EHS at present. In the future, the statistical weighing of people&#x02019;s self-reported hypersensitivity should substantiate their EHS claim.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In both the EHS and non-EHS groups, there were no significant differences in heart rate, respiration rate, or LFP/HFP between sham and real exposure to a WCDMA module (average power, 24 dBm at 1950 MHz; specific absorption rate, 1.57 W/kg) attached inside a dummy phone for 32 min. There was no association between eight subjective symptoms and RF-EMFs exposure in either group. There was also no indication that EHS subjects could detect exposure. Therefore, considering the physiological data analyzed, the subjective symptoms surveyed, and the percentages of those who believed they were being exposed, no effects were observed in EHS or non-EHS subjects as a result from 32 min of RF radiation emitted by WCDMA mobile phones.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANOVA: Analysis of variance; ECG: Electrocardiogram; EHS: Electromagnetic hypersensitivity; ELF: Extremely low frequency; ERP: Ear reference point; GSM: Global System for Mobile Communications; HFP: High-frequency power; HRV: Heart rate variability; h/d: Hour per day; IEEE: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers; LFP: Low-frequency power; Max: Maximum; Min: Minimum; n: Number; RF-EMFs: Radio frequency-electromagnetic fields; SAR: Specific absorption rate; SD: Standard deviation; WCDMA: Wideband code division multiple access; yr: Year; YUHS: Yonsei University Hospital System; 3G: Third generation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MKK recruited subjects, collected experimental data, and performed statistical analyses.
