The incidence is rising with the worldwide increase in life expectancy. Gradual but progressive calcification of the aortic valves is characteristic of this disease. The initial stage resembles the pathogenesis of aortic atherosclerosis, which is characterized by damage of the basal layers, inflammation, cell infiltration, lipid deposition, and calcification. The presence of osteopontin (OPN) in the aortic valves indicates pathological calcification. Historically, research, genetic, and clinical evidence indicated that prevention of further calcification of the aortic valves, which leads to aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation, can be achieved through understanding the pathogenesis and intervention of degenerative calcific aortic valve disease (DCAVD), as well as by understanding controllable risk factors that may lead to DCAVD [<xref rid="b1-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Recent studies showed that the efficacy of drug treatment of middle- to late-stage valvular calcification is limited. Although surgery is the treatment of choice, it is often accompanied with high risk and complications. Therefore, early treatment of valvular calcification diseases is needed to improve outcome and rehabilitation rate. Animal studies, retrospective studies, and RAAVE studies have shown that statins can slow the progression of DCAVD [<xref rid="b2-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, 2 large prospective studies &#x02013; SALTIRE and SEAS &#x02013; have recently shown that statins do not prevent progression of DCAVD [<xref rid="b3-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These 2 studies had different objectives from the RAAVE study: the objective of the RAAVE study was to review research usually associated with traditional statin indications, while the objective of the SALTIRE and SEAS studies was to assess possible ethics concerns regarding statin use. The RAAVE study and other retrospective studies included traditional statin indications. Therefore, clinical trials suggest that statin therapy delays the progression of DCAVD only in patients with hyperlipidemia. Pathological findings indicated that changes in DCAVD include activation of inflammatory cells, transformation of mature osteocytes, dysfunction of valvular interstitial cells, and alteration of the structure of the extracellular matrix, leading to calcified nodule formation. These findings led us to believe that lipid metabolism may play an essential role in the development and progression of DCAVD.</p><p>Histopathological studies on various stages of DCAVD have shown that disease development is accompanied by irreversible changes in the aortic valves. A number of risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis may also significantly affect the development and progression of DCAVD. Injured endothelial cells may result in lipoprotein deposition within the endothelium, activating the influx of inflammatory cells into the aortic valves. The development of valvular calcification involves multiple factors including lipid oxidation, cell migration in the fibrosa and inflammatory cytokine release, all of which can significantly influence the calcification process. Therefore, lipid metabolism is an important factor in the pathogenesis and development of DCAVD [<xref rid="b5-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In Uygur medicine, the human body is thought to have 4 kinds of body fluid &#x02013; bile liquid substance, blood substance, mucus substance, and Savda Munziq [<xref rid="b6-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] &#x02013; which are present throughout human life, are naturally formed <italic>in vivo</italic>, and play key roles in health and disease. They are continuously consumed and produced in the body and are maintained in a delicate equilibrium. Disease is thought to occur when these 4 body fluids are not in proper balance (changes in quantity and quality). Similarly, the abnormal body fluids consist of 4 components &#x02013; abnormal gallbladder hygroplasm, abnormal blood hygroplasm, abnormal lymphatic temperament, and abnormal Savda, which are present throughout human life, are naturally formed <italic>in vivo</italic>, and play key roles in health and disease. When the 4 abnormal body fluids are not in proper balance (changes in quantity and quality), they may become detrimental to health. ASMq is a mixture of 13 Uighur medicinal herbs: Kiku Ko, celery root, chicory root, moldavica dragonhead seed, fennel flower seed, fennel root bark, camomile, liquorice, citronella, basil fruit, seed of hollyhock, anise fruit, and <italic>Peganum harmala</italic> L [<xref rid="b7-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. According to the Uygur humoral medicine theory, abnormal Savda has a heavy mass and dense texture and easily attaches to the blood vessel wall, thereby resulting in stasis and obstruction and may eventually lead to refractory diseases [<xref rid="b8-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Uygur medical practice has shown that abnormal Savda Munziq (ASMq) significantly affects anti-inflammation and immunomodulation, preventing calcium deposition, and improving blood circulation and anti-platelet aggregation [<xref rid="b9-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Previous reports have demonstrated that ASMq plays a role in regulating blood viscosity, anti-calcium deposition, anti-inflammation, and anti-oxidation. Therefore, we established animal models of degenerative atherosclerotic aortic valve disease to determine whether ASMq delays the progression of DCAVD by affecting the development and underlying mechanisms of the disease.</p><p>Recent studies have provided some evidence that the pathomechanisms of atherosclerosis and DCAVD may be partly similar and include endothelial damage, accumulation of oxidized low-density lipoproteins, infiltration of monocytes, mast cells, and T lymphocytes associated with activation of local and systemic inflammation [<xref rid="b10-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the final step in atherosclerosis is plaque formation in the intima of the blood vessels, while in DCAVD severe calcification of the aortic valve represents the end-stage of the disease [<xref rid="b13-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Enhanced fibro-calcification of the valve leaflets limits their mobility and causes stenosis, which leads to high-pressure gradients through the aortic valve. C-reactive protein (CRP) and Interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) are biomarkers of inflammation with predictive value for cardiac events. Wypasek et al. show that DCAVD patients carrying the CRP rs1205T allele and IL-6R Asp358Ala (A&#x0003e;C, rs2228145) are characterized by more severe aortic valve calcification. They also demonstrated that CRP rs1205 C&#x0003e;T polymorphism minor allele is associated with elevated CRP levels in DCAVD patients [<xref rid="b15-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. DCAVD is an active process involving lipid deposition, chronic inflammation, and progressive calcification. In contrast to the early pathological changes of atherosclerosis, the early pathological changes of DCAVD seldom involve smooth muscle cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Drugs and reagents</title><p>Atorvastatin calcium, lot number L27840, was manufactured by Pfizer (New York, USA).

Through continued study, research, and establishment of various animal models of disease, we have created a new platform to investigate the efficacy of ASMq in treating cardiovascular diseases. Our work has set a solid foundation for the development of Uygur medicine and provided more treatment options for patients with degenerative atherosclerotic aortic valve disease.</p><p>In the current study, we demonstrated that a high-fat diet resulted in significant increase of blood lipid TG, TC, LDL, and HDL levels. Our study indicated that treatment with Atorvastatin (4 mg/kg/d) and ASMq (5.069 g/kg/d) had significant lipid-reducing effects. Pathological examination revealed the presence of aortic valve endothelial cell damage, loss of continuity, and total loss of endothelial cells in group HC. OPN-specific gene expression was demonstrated by the aortic valve interstitial cells. Positive expression of OPN by differentiated osteoblasts may be involved in bone mineralization of the cell [<xref rid="b18-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The presence of subendothelial calcium deposition and infiltration of T lymphocytes, macrophages, and other inflammatory cells may be associated with the inflammatory responses within the aortic valves. Therefore, we suggest that there may be a significant correlation between hyperlipidemia and aortic valve calcification. Our study results are similar to those of other studies [<xref rid="b19-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>We also showed that aortic valve endothelial cell continuity was maintained in group AI and group MI, along with significantly reduced valvular interstitial OPN expression. Because we found no significant calcium deposition or presence of T lymphocytes, macrophages, and other inflammatory cells in group AI and group MI, we speculate that Atorvastatin and ASMq can protect aortic valves by interfering with aortic inflammation induced by a high-fat diet.</p><p>Due to its high resolution, simple operation, and accurate observations of biological surface structures, AFM is widely used in biomedical fields [<xref rid="b21-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-medscimonit-23-4431" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. AFM works by detecting changes of interaction between the probe and sample surface. In our study, we assessed the impact of high-fat diet on structural changes of aortic valve endothelial cells and examined the morphological changes in early stages of DCAVD through AFM analysis of endothelial cells and their surface nanostructures.</p><p>AFM scanning showed that endothelial cells in different parts of the aortic valve were significantly different in their surface structure and alignment. Hyperlipidemia may affect the base region of aortic valves and is therefore an important contributing factor for DCAVD. In this study, observations of the basal, middle and apical regions of the aortic valve were consistent with those reported in a previous study. Therefore, we examined the changes on the surface structures of basal endothelial cells of aortic valves to test our hypothesis.</p><p>Results from 50&#x000d7;50 &#x003bc;m and 500&#x000d7;500 nm AFM scanning revealed that endothelial cells in different anatomical sites of the same aortic valve differed in their cellular alignment and surface nanostructures. Compared to middle and apical aortic valve endothelial cells, basal endothelial cells were more abundant and were arranged more tightly and orderly, with relatively uniform surface bulges. In addition, aortic valve endothelial cell length gradually reduced as the high-fat diet continued, resulting in merging and partial loss of endothelial cells. The number of endothelial cell surface bulges also gradually decreased, along with increased bulge diameter, reduced bulge height, and fusion of bulges into sheets. By comparing the changes in morphology observed via AFM, we conclude that Atorvastatin and ASMq can maintain the basic normal structures of aortic valve endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>ASMq can effectively protect aortic endothelial cells by decreasing blood lipid levels, reducing damage to aortic valve endothelial cells. ASMq therapy can delay the onset of &#x0201c;degenerative&#x0201d; atherosclerotic aortic valve disease and its treatment effects are similar to those of Atorvastatin.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study limitation</title><p>This study has several limitations. First, our group of healthy subjects was rather small. Second, DCAVD and atherosclerosis have similar risk factors associated with age, hypertension, high cholesterol levels, and inflammation regulation, but we did not assess CRP or IL-6 levels in blood. Third, statins affect lipids and inflammation, but we did not measure CRP, IL-6 levels, or inflammatory markers in blood.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn9-medscimonit-23-4431"
