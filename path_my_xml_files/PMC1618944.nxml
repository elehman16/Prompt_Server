reported to be elevated in the oxidative stress involved in
asthmatic patients, and the reaction of nitric oxide (<chem-struct>NO</chem-struct>)
with superoxide anions results in the formation of nitrotyrosine.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of inhaled
steroid treatment on nitrotyrosine levels collected by exhaled
breath condensate (EBC) and on <chem-struct>FeNO</chem-struct>. <italic>Methods.</italic> This
was a single-blind placebo-controlled study. The lung function,

asthmatic children. <italic>Results.</italic> The nitrotyrosine levels
were stable during the placebo period (T0 = 1.16 ng/ml

after the treatment with flunisolide  (T2 = 1.14 ng/ml

reduction in <chem-struct>FeNO</chem-struct> levels was observed after placebo
treatment (T0 = 38.4 ppb versus

decreased significantly being at T3 = 14.9 ppb (T1

chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis
(CF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Different types of airway inflammatory cells,
especially eosinophils, produce more superoxide anions
(<chem-struct>O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup></chem-struct>) and release reactive nitrogen/oxygen
compounds such as <chem-struct>NO</chem-struct> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The reaction of <chem-struct>NO</chem-struct>
and superoxide anions (<chem-struct>O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup></chem-struct>) in the airway results
in the formation of peroxynitrite, a highly reaction oxidative
species, which can nitrate the tyrosine residues of proteins to
form the stable product of nitrotyrosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The formation
of peroxynitrite is now well established in a variety of airway
diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and it has been demonstrated to be capable
to damage pulmonary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and to induce airway
hyperresponsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Exhaled <chem-struct>NO</chem-struct> and a large number of molecules collected by EBC
have been demonstrated to be increased in the airway of asthmatic
patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and they are now established to represent
markers of airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A significant correlation
has been demonstrated between the reduction in <chem-struct>FeNO</chem-struct> levels
and eosinophils markers of inflammation in asthmatic patients
treated with inhaled corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A recent study
suggests that inhaled steroid treatment resulted in a significant
reduction to nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity in the airway
epithelium, lung parenchyma, and inflammatory cells of patients
with asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the effect of
inhaled steroid treatment on nitrotyrosine levels, in comparison
with pulmonary function and airway inflammation in asthma measured
by <chem-struct>FeNO</chem-struct>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects and experimental design</title><p>Ten children (6 males), ranging in age from 6 to 13 years with
a history of mild-to-moderate bronchial asthma, according to the
American Thoracic Society (ATS) definition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and positive
skin prick tests to house dust mite (HDM) were evaluated. All
children were recruited at the Department of Paediatrics,
University of Verona, Verona, Italy. None of the patients had
respiratory infections for at least two months before the
beginning of the study and none of the children had received oral
corticosteroids for at least two months before and after admission
to the study.</p><p>The children did not present any clinically evident asthma
exacerbation. The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee
and both children and their parents gave informed consent.</p><p>This was a single-blind placebo-controlled pilot study. All
asthmatic children received placebo for 8 weeks (T0-T1) and then
after a washout of 8 weeks (T1-T2), inhaled flunisolide (Lunibron
A, Valeas SpA, Milano, Italy; 800 mcg/dose) for further 8
weeks (T2-T3). A final washout period of further 8 weeks without
any treatment concluded the study (T3-T4).</p><p>During the study period the symptoms were recorded daily.
Treatments were administered by the same model or pneumatic
nebulizer (BimboNeb, Markos Mefar SpA, Brescia, Italy), which was
provided to all of the patients.</p><p>Inhaled &#x003b2;2 agonists were allowed to be used as needed.
Neither cromons nor inhaled steroids, other than flunisolide
administered according to the experimental design, were allowed
for the time of the study. None of the children received oral
steroid after admission to the study.</p><p>The evaluations at T0, T1, T2, T3, and T4 consisted in lung
function assessment, measurement of <chem-struct>FeNO</chem-struct>, and collection of EBC.</p></sec><sec><title>EBC collection and measurement</title><p>EBC samples were collected by a condensing device formed by two
glass chambers (Incofar Srl, Modena, Italy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The inner
glass chamber was cooled by means of ice and suspended in a larger
glass chamber. The children were instructed to tidally
breathe by the mouth through a two-way nonrebreathing valve
for 15 min. To minimize salivary contamination the two-way
valve served as a saliva trap, with a 12 cm banded tube
vertically positioned between the mouthpiece and the condenser
while the mouth of the subject remained at a lower position with
respect to the inlet of the device. Children were asked to
periodically swallow their saliva. EBC samples where stored in
sterile tubes at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Nitrotyrosine levels were measured by specific enzyme immunoassay
(EIA) kits (BIOXYTECH Nitrotyrosine&#x02014;EIA; Oxis Research,
Portland, Ore, USA) whose validity in EBC was shown by Hanazawa
et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Lung function and FeNO measurement</title><p>Lung function was measured by a Vitalograph Compact spirometer
(Vitalograph Ltd, Buckingham, UK); FEV<sub>1</sub> and

expressed as percentage of the predicted normal values, according to ATS Guidelines
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p><chem-struct>FeNO</chem-struct> was measured by chemiluminescence analyzer NIOX system
(Aerocrine, Stockolm, Sweden), using a single-breath online method
according to ERS/ATS Guidelines for <chem-struct>FeNO</chem-struct>
measurement in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Children inhaled <chem-struct>NO</chem-struct>-free
air and exhaled through a dynamic flow restrictor with a target
flow of 50 mL/s for at least 6-7 s.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data were expressed as means &#x000b1; standard error of the mean
(X &#x000b1; SEM). The analysis of data showed normal
distribution for all the investigated parameters in our study
population. Differences between the times of the study (T0, T1,
T2, T3, and T4) were performed by analysis of variance (one way RM
ANOVA) and multiple comparison procedures by Bonferroni's
correction. Correlations were evaluated by simple regression test.
A <italic>P</italic> value of &#x0003c; .05 was considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Two children presented an upper respiratory tract infection and

in EBC can reflect airway inflammation in asthma and whether it
was modulated by treatment with inhaled corticosteroids.</p><p>The investigating airway inflammation was mainly based on invasive
methods until the discovery that exhaled nitric oxide can be used
as surrogate marker of airway inflammation, particularly in
childhood asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Exhaled <chem-struct>NO</chem-struct> is now established
as a marker of airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], it has been
demonstrated to be able to predict lung function decline
and to reflect the effect of treatment with anti-inflammatory
agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and also the present study shows a significant
decrease in <chem-struct>FeNO</chem-struct> levels when the children were treated with
inhaled flunisolide.</p><p><chem-struct>FeNO</chem-struct> is, however, a single marker of airway inflammation,
and therefore for a more comprehensive evaluation of the ongoing
processes of inflammation in asthma EBC has been recently proposed
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It has recently been shown that EBC collected from
adult patients contains a wide number of molecules such as
leukotrienes, prostaglandins, albumin and other proteins, such as
cytochines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, a number of mediators
related to <chem-struct>NO</chem-struct> pathway, including nitrite as a metabolite of
nitric oxide, nitrotyrosine, nitrosothiols in
addition to small molecular mediators associated with oxidative
stress, such as hydrogen ions and hydrogen peroxide, have been
detected in EBC samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Nitrotyrosine has been considered to be an indicator of the
involvement of reactive nitrogen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and in the
airway inflammatory epithelium of asthma patients there is a
strong immunoreactivity to nitrotyrosine, suggesting a
pathophysiological role for reactive nitrogen species in
inflammatory lung diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Recently a significant increase in nitrotyrosine levels in EBC has been demonstrated in stable CF patients, compared
with normal subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, nitrotyrosine
concentration in EBC in mild and untreated asthmatic adults was
found to be correlated with exhaled <chem-struct>NO</chem-struct> level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, the results of the present study confirm the
findings of a recent report by Baraldi et al in asthmatic children
failing to show any correlation between <chem-struct>FeNO</chem-struct> and
3-nitrotyrosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, in the present study, it has been demonstrated that
exhaled nitrotyrosine concentrations in EBC was decreased after
inhaled steroid therapy. These data are in agreement with the
observation of Hanazawa et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] suggesting that
nitrotyrosine concentrations in EBC were significantly increased
in steroid-untreated asthmatic patients.</p><p>The data from EBC samples confirm previous observations showing a
direct effect of treatment with inhaled steroid on
nitrotyrosine-mediated immunoreactivity and NO production
in airway epithelium of asthmatic adult patients has
previously been demonstrated in samples obtained by fiberoptic
bronchial biopsies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In addition, intense nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity was
demonstrated in the airway and parenchyma lung of asthma patients
who died of status asthmaticus despite steroid treatment thus
suggesting that status asthmaticus is characterized by a failure
of corticosteroids to control the formation of reactive nitrogen
species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, in this study, a significant increase in
FEF<sub>25&#x02013;75</sub> values during treatment with nebulized
flunisolide was observed, therefore suggesting
an action of this drug on peripheral airways. These data, indeed,
are in agreement with a recent observation by Bergeron et al who
showed that hydrofluoroalkane-flunisolide is associated with a
significant decrease in the expression of &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin in peripheral airways, which
correlated with improvement in peripheral airway function
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>This was a pilot study, the main limitation for which was the
small sample size. However, despite the small number of subjects,
the statistical analysis showed highly significant changes in the
evaluated parameters for the actively treated children. If, on the
one hand, the small number of subjects is likely to reduce the
external validity of the study, on the other hand, the level of
statistical significance reached in such a small sample size
confirms the relevance of changes in the investigational
parameters.</p><p>In summary, this pilot study suggests that nitrotyrosine
concentrations, related to <chem-struct>FeNO</chem-struct> levels, were detectable in
EBC of asthmatic children and were reduced when the children
received corticosteroids treatment. In addition it also provided
evidence that nebulized flunisolide can have an
anti-inflammatory effect which is accompanied by a recovery of
lung function values at the site of peripheral airways.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The authors thank company Valeas SpA, Milano, Italy, for
