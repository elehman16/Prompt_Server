Two rural communities within seven Midwestern states (IN, KS, MI, OH, ND, SD, WI) will be randomly assigned to serve as an intervention or comparison community. Coalitions will complete assessments of their communities, choose from evidence-based approaches, and implement nutrition and physical activity interventions each year to prevent childhood obesity with emphasis on policy, system or environmental changes over four years. Only intervention coalitions will receive community coaching from a trained coach. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, annually and project end using previously validated instruments and include coalition self-assessments, parental perceptions regarding the built environment, community, neighborhood, and early childhood environments, self-reflections from coaches and project staff, ripple effect mapping with coalitions and, final interviews of key stakeholders and coaches.

Four years of age appears to be a critical time in overweight and obesity prevention especially among children with a lower socioeconomic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. An obese four-year-old child has a 20&#x000a0;% likelihood of being an overweight adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Prevention efforts for childhood obesity should be multi-faceted, involving children of all ages throughout all sectors of the environment. Accordingly, the U.S. White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity Report called for multi-sector collaborations to prevent childhood obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The Center for Study of Rural America reports that people in rural areas suffer the highest obesity rates in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The geography and infrastructure of rural areas contribute to problems of poor nutrition and physical inactivity among rural populations. Specifically, children living in rural areas in the U.S. are about 25&#x000a0;% more likely to be overweight or obese than their urban counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. One theory is that children living in rural areas have fewer chances than urban children for physical activity in their daily routine. While most states have obesity prevention plans, few plans seem to focus on the rural population and their special needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The Ecological Model of Childhood Overweight focuses on those characteristics that could affect a child&#x02019;s weight status in relation to the multiple environments surrounding that child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This model examines the combined effects of the community at large, parenting and family factors, and individual factors that impact a child&#x02019;s weight. The Ecological Model considers the larger community in which the child lives. Consensus is building among researchers that the obesity epidemic is driven by the environment, rather than solely by individual factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, a closer examination of the community in regard to childhood obesity prevention is warranted.</p><p>Experience in community development reinforces the conclusion that work in this aspect must be locally conceived, locally led, and consistent with the cultural identity of the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A community coaching approach allows community groups to identify their own strengths, priorities and identity. Thus, community coaches may assist communities with an assessment of their strengths and weaknesses, and then engage the community in investigating new ways of solving their problems. Community coaches help the group strategize and gain commitment to move forward and may help groups use the knowledge and understanding they have gained to take their work to a higher level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. While information and program ideas are widely available on the internet, information alone does not create change. A community coach could help motivate communities to translate research and information into practice.</p><p>To address the issue of childhood obesity in rural communities, a collaborative, multi-state (Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin) effort was formed. Team members include nutrition scientists, community development specialists, and family and youth development specialists from the North Central region of the United States who developed an innovative, integrated research and Extension project. The overall goal of this project is to mobilize capacity in low-income, rural communities to create and sustain an environment and culture of healthy eating and physical activity to prevent childhood obesity in young children.</p><p>The specific project objectives are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Existing health related coalitions in 14 rural U.S. communities (two per state, one as an intervention community and one as a comparison community) will be supported to improve the environment for nutrition and physical activity of 4&#x02010;year&#x02010;old children in their community.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The project team will identify or develop community assessment tools and assemble them into a <italic>Child Ecological Model Assessment Tool Kit.</italic></p></list-item><list-item><p>The project team will create a menu of evidence&#x02010;based or evidence&#x02010;informed educational programs and protocols addressing healthy eating and physical activity for 4&#x02010;year&#x02010;old children from which communities will select.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Community coalitions will create a plan to reduce obesity in their community that is based on the assessment of their community&#x02019;s environment for 4&#x02010;year&#x02010;old children.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Community coalitions will identify and implement at least one local or institutional policy, system or environmental change that will improve nutrition and one that will increase physical activity for 4&#x02010;year&#x02010;old children.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The project team will assess the perceived value that the community coalition members place on the effectiveness of the menu of evidence&#x02010;based or evidence informed educational programs and protocols in improving the environment that sustains healthy eating and promotes physical activity for 4&#x02010;year&#x02010;old children.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The project team will test the main hypothesis that Community Coaching will enhance the capacity of the community in preventing childhood obesity by addressing the needs identified in the assessment and by providing the community coalitions in the intervention community (one per state) with Community Coaches training.</p></list-item></list></p><p>To summarize, existing community health coalitions will assess their environment using an ecological model of childhood overweight and then select evidence-based or evidence-informed approaches to implement over four years to address their community needs. This research will examine the effectiveness of a community coaching model on the ability of a community coalition to address the needs identified to improving the healthy eating and physical activity environment for 4&#x02010;year&#x02010;old children.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The focus of this project is to improve understanding of those factors necessary to mobilize communities to make policy, system or environmental changes aimed at the prevention of childhood obesity within seven North Central U.S. States (IN, KS, MI, ND, OH, SD, WI). Using a quasi-experimental design, the research will examine how building community capacity with a community coaching model in rural, low-income communities contributes to the communities&#x02019; increased ability to prevent childhood obesity. The Ecological Model of Childhood Overweight will serve as the foundation for reviewing characteristics that could affect a child&#x02019;s weight status in relation to the multiple environments surrounding that child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Low-income, rural communities will be recruited to apply for the project from each of the seven participating states. Rural areas will be defined based on the Office of Management and Budget&#x02019;s definition, which delineates an area as rural if there is no presence of a metropolitan statistical area or a core urban area with a population of 50,000 or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Low-income will be defined based on the community&#x02019;s average income rate being below the state&#x02019;s average poverty rate. Other criteria will include that the community has an existing community health coalition and community focus to tackle childhood obesity prevention. Similar-size intervention and comparison communities will be selected from each state. Once selected through an application screening process to ensure that selection criteria are met, communities will be randomly assigned to the intervention or comparison group. Each state will have one intervention and one comparison community. The project sample size (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;14) will be sufficient to detect large effect sizes (d&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.8) with 95&#x000a0;% power for a two-tailed test at alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05 between intervention and comparison communities from pre to post using the community as the main unit of measure and community level variables as the main outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention</title><p>Each community will utilize the efforts of a community health coalition to develop a strategic plan and to implement that plan after completing a series of assessments. Communities will be provided with a &#x0201c;menu&#x0201d; of evidence-based or evidence-informed strategies and a set amount of funding each year ($5000) to implement at least one nutrition and one physical activity intervention annually. The menu of evidence&#x02010;based or evidence&#x02010;informed childhood obesity prevention approaches will be developed by the research team and continually updated and, made available electronically to both intervention and comparison communities. Materials selected will be culturally and ethnically diverse, representing the varied ethnic groups that make up the North Central U.S. region, including Caucasian, Hispanic, Native American, Hmong, and other groups. The menu will include evidence-based nutrition and physical activity curricula, evidence&#x02010;based or evidence&#x02010;informed strategies as well as recommendations from the U.S. White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity Report to the President [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Nutrition interventions will seek to improve the environment within the communities to support an increased intake of fruits and vegetables, increase the variety of vegetables in the diet, or decrease the intakes of foods high in solid fats and added sugars while physical activity interventions will seek to increase the number of children that meet the guidelines for television viewing and computer use, or increased physical activity.</p><p>The intervention communities will also be provided with a part-time community coach for the full length of the project. Responsibilities of the coach will be to guide the coalition in identifying, clarifying, and illuminating local childhood obesity issues, goals, prevention strategies, partners and resources. The comparison communities will not be provided with a coach and on their own will choose and implement nutrition and physical activity approaches throughout the duration of the project.

The main project objective, objective 7 (enhancement of community capacity to prevent childhood obesity by Community Coaching) will be evaluated using a mixed-methods data analysis approach with data from several of the project instruments (CHLI, Active Where?, and CSAS). Descriptive statistics including frequencies and repeated measures ANOVA or corresponding non-parametric tests will be conducted to detect changes between intervention and comparison communities before and after the four year intervention for quantitative data related to policy, systems and environmental change variables using SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc.). Significance will be set at <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05.</p><p>Qualitative data (reflections and interviews) will be analyzed using the classic analysis approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] including constant comparison analysis to generate themes and search for text that inform those themes. Ripple effect mapping will be analyzed through content analysis by categorizing identified community activities and changes into the different levels of the social-ecological model. Dominant emergent themes from the qualitative data will be weaved together with quantitative data to develop a theoretical model representing how communities were impacted by the project.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Study status</title><p>The intervention was implemented within rural communities from 2012&#x02013;2016. The study is currently ongoing with a no-cost funding extension to finalize data collection and begin data analysis of main study outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><p>As a result of the study, a comprehensive childhood obesity prevention <italic>Best Practices Tool Kit</italic> will be developed to assist low&#x02010;income rural communities to 1) assess the environments of their communities as they relate to childhood obesity prevention and 2) learn to use community coaching techniques to help communities assess their strengths, strategize, and implement interventions to prevent childhood obesity.</p><p>Strengths of the study include the involvement of seven U.S. states in a new model (community capacity development using community coaching) of Extension intervention to prevent childhood obesity; a rural community setting; use of an ecological model of childhood overweight to focus on the environment of low&#x02010;income, 4&#x02010;year&#x02010;old children; and involvement of a community coalition to identify their own needs and implement corresponding intervention activities. Having communities choose their own interventions may increase the likelihood of sustainability once the project is complete. Limitations of the study include the inability to control for external factors which may contribute to or deflect from the development of community networks and collaborative local action around the issue of childhood obesity prevention; inability to identify identical communities within each state for comparison purposes and the relatively short time frame in which to measure and expect environmental and policy changes. Lessons learned from this integrated, community-based study will demonstrate an innovative way that Extension can work within communities to drive change especially given the emphasis on Health Extension as the next frontier.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p>Each state has secured the necessary Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval or exemptions as required by their institution. For the main study intervention where the community was the unit of randomization and intervention, approvals were secured by The Ohio State University Behavioral and Social Sciences IRB and the Michigan State University IRB. Study exemptions were secured by the Kansas State University Research Compliance Office, North Dakota State University IRB, Purdue University Human Research Protection Program IRB, South Dakota State University Office of Research Human Subjects Committee and, University of Wisconsin Extension Human Subjects Protection Committee. When outcomes involved assessment or interviews with human subject participants related to the community interventions, informed written consent was obtained (Ohio State University) or information sheets were provided to participants (North Dakota State University) when required by specific institutional IRB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Final raw data files will not be available in a public repository because it is not a requirement of the funding agency.
