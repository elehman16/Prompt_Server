The efficacy of the study drugs was evaluated by counting inflammatory lesions and non&#x02010;inflammatory lesions. Safety was evaluated based on adverse events, local skin tolerability scores and laboratory test values. In total, 458 subjects were included in the efficacy and safety analyses. The total lesion count, the efficacy end&#x02010;point, was similarly changed both in the 2.5% and 5% BPO groups over the course of the study. The median rates of reduction from baseline to week 12 were approximately 65%. Thereafter, the counts were maintained at a reduced level without increasing until week 52. The median rates at week 52 were approximately 80%. Similar trends were observed for inflammatory and non&#x02010;inflammatory lesion counts. Bacteriological evaluation indicated similar distribution of the minimum inhibitory concentration of each of the antibacterial drugs against <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic> between the values at baseline and at week 52, suggesting that long&#x02010;term use did not result in changes in the drug sensitivity. The incidence of adverse events was 84.0% in the 2.5% BPO group and 87.2% in the 5% BPO group. Many of the adverse events occurred within the first month and were mild or moderate in severity and transient. The results suggest that both 2.5% and 5% BPO gels are effective and safe for long&#x02010;term treatment of patients with acne vulgaris.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="jde13741-kwd-0001">acne vulgaris</kwd><kwd id="jde13741-kwd-0002">benzoyl peroxide</kwd><kwd id="jde13741-kwd-0003">long&#x02010;term treatment</kwd><kwd id="jde13741-kwd-0004">open&#x02010;label</kwd><kwd id="jde13741-kwd-0005">randomized study</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="7153"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>component-id</meta-name><meta-value>jde13741</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>June 2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_NLMPMC version:5.1.2 mode:remove_FC converted:26.06.2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group id="jde13741-ntgp-0001"><fn id="jde13741-note-1001"><p>This is a secondary publication of an article originally published in Japanese in the <italic>Journal of Clinical Therapeutics and Medicines</italic> (&#x0201c;An open&#x02010;label, randomized, multicenter, phase III study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of benzoyl peroxide gel in long&#x02010;term use in patients with acne vulgaris&#x0201d;, 2014; 30: 669&#x02013;689).

occurred within a month after initiation of the treatment and 62.0% (284/458) within 3 months. The occurrence dramatically decreased after 3 months, namely, to 13.1% (57/435) at 4&#x02013;6 months, 6.4% (27/421) at 7&#x02013;9 months and 5.9% (24/408) at 10&#x02013;12 months. The incidence of AE with a possible causal relation with the study drug (application site irritation, application site erythema, application site pruritus, application site dryness, skin exfoliation and contact dermatitis) also showed a similar trend (Fig. <xref rid="jde13741-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Some of these AE occurred only after 3 months from the initiation of the treatment, but all of them were local. Reactions observed between 4 and 6 months were xeroderma (three cases), blepharitis, erythema of eyelid, application site urticaria, intertrigo and dry skin (one case each), eyelid exfoliation (one case) between 7 and 9 months, and application site eczema (one case) after 10 months. All of them were mild, except for one case of moderate xeroderma. Among these, erythema of eyelid and eyelid exfoliation resolved spontaneously, and blepharitis, application site urticaria, intertrigo, xeroderma and dry skin recovered by application of moisturizers or topical steroids.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="jde13741-fig-0005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Reduction in the incidence of adverse reaction with a possible causal relation with the study drug over time. The incidence of new adverse events including repetitions that occurred in each period (1 month, 30 days) was graphed, and was represented as white (2.5% benzoyl peroxide [BPO] gel) and black (5% BPO gel) bars. Adverse events included here were irritation, erythema, pruritus and dryness at the application sites, skin exfoliation and contact dermatitis.</p></caption><graphic id="nlm-graphic-9" xlink:href="JDE-44-635-g005"/></fig></sec><sec id="jde13741-sec-0024"><title>Effect of concomitant drugs on the incidence of adverse events</title><p>The incidence rate of AE when patients used concomitant drugs was higher than with BPO monotherapy, namely, 89.9% (311/368) versus 67.8% (61/90). Adapalene, which is indicated for acne, was often used as a concomitant drug. Therefore, we further analyzed cases that used adapalene. The incidence rate of patients with concomitant adapalene use was 91.7% (33/36) in the 2.5% BPO group and 97.3% (36/37) in the 5% BPO group, compared with 82.6% (161/195) and 85.3% (162/190) in patients who received monotherapy with BPO. The incidence rates of AE with a possible causal relation with the study drug in patients with concomitant adapalene use were 66.7% (24/36) in the 2.5% BPO group and 70.3% (26/37) in the 5% BPO group. On the other hand, those in patients without concomitant drug use were 46.2% (90/195) and 52.1% (99/190), respectively.</p></sec><sec id="jde13741-sec-0025"><title>Deaths and other severe or noteworthy adverse events</title><p>There was one case of death in this study, in which a patient in the 2.5% BPO group committed suicide attributed to electrocution. Therefore, a causal relation with the study drug was denied. Other severe AE were reported in four participants: gastric ulcer and pneumothorax in the 2.5% BPO group, and road traffic accident and ulcerative colitis in the 5% BPO group. However, none of these had a causal relation with the study drug.</p><p>The number of patients who discontinued the study due to AE was 19 in total (seven in the 2.5% BPO group and 12 in the 5% BPO group), all of these AE were mild to moderate. In the 2.5% BPO group, contact dermatitis (three cases), application site irritation, application site urticaria, application site erythema and sebaceous gland overactivity (one case each) were observed. A causal relation of these AE with the study drug was not denied, except for sebaceous gland overactivity. In the 5% BPO group, application site irritation and contact dermatitis (three cases each), application site erythema (two cases), and ulcerative colitis, application site pruritus, dermatitis and dermatitis allergic (one case each) were reported. Except for ulcerative colitis, a causal relation between these AE and the study drug was not denied.</p></sec><sec id="jde13741-sec-0026"><title>Evaluation of local skin tolerability scores for scaling and erythema and laboratory test values</title><p>Most patients in both the 2.5% and 5% groups scored 0 throughout the study. Participants with scores for scaling of 1 or 2 were slightly more at weeks 2 and 4 in the 2.5% BPO group and at week 2 in the 5% BPO group than at other evaluation time points.

It has been reported that BPO is effective against <italic>P. acnes</italic> that has developed resistance to antibiotics with long&#x02010;term use.<xref rid="jde13741-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> Therefore, BPO can be used even if patients have antibiotic&#x02010;resistant <italic>P. acnes</italic>.</p><p>The incidence of AE with a possible causal relation with the study drugs was 49.9% (114/231) in the 2.5% group and 55.1% (125/227) in the 5% group. Among these, relatively frequent AE were skin exfoliation, contact dermatitis, application site irritation, application site erythema, application site dryness and application site pruritus. Most of these were mild.</p><p>Adapalene increased the incidence of AE with a possible causal relation with BPO, to 66.7% (24/36) in the 2.5% BPO group and 70.3% (26/37) in the 5% BPO group. It has been reported that the occurrence rate of adverse drug reactions caused by long&#x02010;term use of adapalene was 84.0% (373/444),<xref rid="jde13741-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> indicating that the incidence of AE in concomitant treatment with adapalene and BPO is similar to adapalene monotherapy.</p><p>Investigation of the occurrence of AE revealed that most of them were manifested during the time period from the initiation of the study to 3 months, and that they were especially frequent during the first month, but very few events occurred after 3 months. AE that were observed after 3 months and had a possible causal relation with the study drug were xeroderma, blepharitis, erythema of eyelid, application site urticaria, intertrigo, dry skin, eyelid exfoliation and application site eczema, and they resolved spontaneously or by application of moisturizer or topical steroids. These results suggested that long&#x02010;term use of the study drug is fairly safe.</p><p>In conclusion, we confirmed that 2.5% and 5% BPO gel may be valuable as a treatment for Japanese patients with acne vulgaris.</p></sec><sec id="jde13741-sec-0029"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>Maruho covered all expenses of this study.
