Aggressive lowering of LDL-C has been shown to be beneficial in lowering cardiovascular events,<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> but there remains a need for additional therapies targeting other lipid-related risk factors to address residual cardiovascular disease (CVD). Epidemiological evidence shows that HDL-C levels are inversely correlated with CVD risk<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>; therefore, evacetrapib is being investigated as a potential treatment to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with high-risk vascular disease.</p><p>Food effect studies are used to assess the effects of a meal on the rate and extent of drug absorption when dosed shortly after a meal (fed state) compared to the fasted state.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Studies of evacetrapib&#x02019;s food effect have shown variable results. When a single evacetrapib dose of 100 mg as an earlier tablet formulation was dosed with a low-fat meal, there was no notable change in exposure compared to dosing in the fasted state (Eli Lilly, data on file).<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, when single 200-mg doses as the phase 3 formulation were given after a low-fat or high-fat meal, area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve from 0 to infinity (AUC[0-&#x0221e;]) was 49% and 51% higher, respectively, compared to the fasted state (Eli Lilly, data on file).<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The ongoing phase 3 study uses the same phase 3 formulation but as a 130-mg dose.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The current phase 1 study was conducted to definitively determine the effect of a high-fat meal on evacetrapib exposure when evacetrapib is given as a 130-mg tablet once daily.</p><p>The design of this study adapts the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance for food effect bioavailability studies, which recommend administering a single dose of drug after fasting and shortly following a high-fat, high-calorie meal.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Because of inconsistent results with previous food effect evaluations using the phase 3 formulation and other formulations, the authors wanted to definitively quantify the food effect for the intended dose and phase 3 formulation under conditions that mimic the worst-case scenario during clinical use.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This involved dosing to steady state with and without the high-fat, high-calorie meal recommended in the FDA guidance, although such a meal is not recommended for the intended population of patients with high-risk CVD. Evaluating drug exposure at steady state is atypical for food-effect studies, but it mimics the clinical situation and is therefore a clinically relevant design. In the current study, the phase 3 formulation of evacetrapib was dosed once daily with a high-fat, high-calorie meal each morning because multiple dosing with such meals would create the worst-case scenario for a food effect.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1074248415575153"><title>Method and Material</title><sec id="section3-1074248415575153"><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a randomized, multiple-dose, 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-sequence, open-label, crossover study designed to investigate the effect of a high-fat meal on evacetrapib exposure when dosing evacetrapib as the phase 3 formulation under steady-state conditions (NLM identifier: NCT01810432).<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Patients were randomly allocated to 1 of the 2 treatment sequences in which they received evacetrapib 130 mg/d for 10 days following a 10-hour fast each day, and evacetrapib 130 mg/d for 10 days following a high-fat breakfast each day. The standardized high-fat breakfast conformed to recommendations of the FDA guidance for food-effect studies and consisted of about 800 to 1000 calories with fat comprising about 50% of the caloric content.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>
</p><p>The study adopted a group sequential adaptive design to include an interim analysis to possibly stop the study with a smaller number of patients. An interim analysis was to be performed after at least 30 patients completed both periods, and the study might then be stopped based upon the results of statistical analyses. Alternatively, the sample size was to be reestimated after the interim analysis, and the study was to continue with the new target enrollment.</p><p>For each patient, the study consisted of a screening visit, 2 dosing periods, and a poststudy follow-up examination. All patients were admitted to the clinical research unit on day 1 of both treatment periods. Patients received daily doses of evacetrapib following an overnight fast or following a high-fat breakfast, with the same dietary conditions maintained for 10 days. Based on evacetrapib&#x02019;s apparent terminal elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of about 30 to 50 hours and data from previous clinical trials, 10 days of dosing were expected to be adequate to reach pharmacokinetic steady state. Patients were discharged on day 11. To allow for adequate washout of evacetrapib between dosing periods, there were at least 14 days between the last dose in period 1 and the first dose in period 2. Patients returned for a follow-up examination at least 14 days after the final dose in period 2.</p></sec><sec id="section4-1074248415575153"><title>Study Patients</title><p>Eligible patients included healthy men and women 18 to 65 years of age with a body mass index of 18.0 to 32.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

The least squares (LS) means for each treatment, the difference in LS means, and their 90% repeated confidence intervals (RCIs) were estimated from the ANOVA model and back-transformed from the log scale to provide estimates of the geometric means, the ratio of the geometric means (high-fat meal vs fasted), and their 90% RCIs. A lack of food effect was to be declared if the 90% RCI for AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> was contained within the limits 0.80 to 1.25.

The median difference and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the difference between the dietary states were calculated.</p><p>Pharmacodynamic measures including corrected CETP activity, HDL-C, and LDL-C were summarized by treatment using mean and standard deviation on days 1 and 11. The percentage of change from baseline (day &#x02212;1 for each period) was also summarized by treatment.</p><p>It was determined that a maximum sample size of 74 completing patients would provide at least 90% overall power to demonstrate a lack of food effect, assuming an expected ratio of geometric means equalling 1.10, an intrapatient coefficient of variation of 26.3% for area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC), an overall probability of wrongly declaring lack of food effect of 0.05, and accounting for 1 planned interim analysis. The RCI was used to preserve the overall type I error rate while an interim analysis was conducted to possibly stop the study with a smaller number of patients if a lack of food effect was established or if a food effect was likely present. The interim analysis was to occur after at least 30 patients completed both periods, which was the sample size needed to provide at least 90% power to demonstrate lack of food effect assuming the expected ratios of the geometric means equalled 1.00.

This was a definitive study that used the phase 3 formulation and dose being used in the phase 3 study<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and treated patients once daily to pharmacokinetic steady state to mimic the expected clinical dosing recommendation. As recommended in regulatory guidances, a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast was used to elicit the largest food effect that could be expected. The results showed that such a meal increased evacetrapib exposure, with AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> 44% and 51% higher, respectively, in the fed state than in the fasted state. Changes in HDL-C, LDL-C, and CETP activity were consistent with the higher evacetrapib exposure after the meal. Doses of 130 mg evacetrapib every day were well tolerated with and without food.</p><p>As part of the group sequential adaptive design used in the study, a planned interim analysis was performed using data from the 40 enrolled patients. Based on the statistical analysis using RCIs, a lack of food effect was not established because the 90% RCIs fell outside the no effect range of 0.8 and 1.25. The study was ended based on the prespecified stopping rule #2, rather than continuing to complete up to 74 patients.</p><p>An interesting and somewhat unanticipated aspect of the study results was the large difference in intersubject variability estimates for evacetrapib AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> when dosed after a meal compared to after fasting. The geometric coefficients of variation for AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> were 49% and 73%, respectively, after fasting and 19% and 22%, respectively, after the high-fat meal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1074248415575153">Table 2</xref>). In a previous study, it appeared that variability may have been higher after a single dose than after multiple doses,<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> but the differences were smaller than those observed in this study. The observed decrease in intersubject variability was one of the reasons that multiple dosing was considered for the current study. The most likely explanation for the lower variability after a high-fat meal than after fasting is that the fraction absorbed is higher. While the absolute bioavailability of evacetrapib has not been measured, it is expected that if the fraction absorbed under fasted conditions is high, then further increasing the fraction absorbed (ie, after a high-fat meal) will tend to reduce variability, as fraction absorbed moves closer to 100%.</p><p>The meals given in this study conform to guidances and were expected to elicit the largest food effect; however, this type of meal has more calories and greater fat content than that recommended for the intended patient population with high-risk CVD. Current patient guidelines call for a diet of moderate portions consisting of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and low in fat and cholesterol. The meals given prior to evacetrapib doses in this study had few, if any, of these attributes. Although the effect of food on evacetrapib exposure may be as high with a low-fat meal as with a high-fat meal, this was not tested in the current study. In previous food-effect assessments of evacetrapib, a low-fat meal had a smaller effect than that of a high-fat meal; however, these studies were conducted using single administrations with different doses or formulations and, therefore, were not definitive.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>

The mean estimates of steady state AUC over a dosing interval during treatment with 100, 300, and 600 mg once-daily in that study were 4610, 7570, and 13&#x0200a;700 ng&#x000b7;h/mL, respectively.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Recent pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses show that the effect on HDL-C is not at steady state after 10 days, and that HDL-C levels further increase from 10 days to 12 weeks of treatment with evacetrapib.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In a phase 2 safety and efficacy study A Phase 2 Efficacy and Safety Study of LY2484595 Alone and in Combination with Atorvastatin, Simvastatin, and Rosuvastatin in Patients with Hypercholesterolemia or Low HDL-C (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> Identifier: NCT01105975), HDL-C increased 98% and 132% after 12 weeks of treatment with 100 and 500 mg evacetrapib, respectively.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>

Initial single-dose and multiple-dose studies in normal healthy volunteers evaluating the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of anacetrapib demonstrated significant pharmacokinetic variability following administration in the fed or fasted state.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> These biopharmaceutics studies used the phase 3 formulation in controlled phase 1 studies, administering a standard high-fat breakfast with single doses of 25 to 800 mg anacetrapib<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> or multiple doses of 150 mg anacetrapib,<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1074248415575153" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and demonstrated an approximately 7.5-fold increase in AUC and an approximately 17-fold increase in C<sub>max</sub> relative to the fasted state.
