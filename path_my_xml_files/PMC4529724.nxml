Patients will be eligible for the trial if they have been admitted to a participating ward and are aged 65&#x000a0;years or over. The primary objectives of the study are to provide a preliminary estimate of the effectiveness of the Prevention of Delirium Programme as measured by the incidence of new onset delirium, assess the variability of the incidence of new-onset delirium, estimate the intracluster correlation coefficient and likely cluster size, assess barriers to the delivery of the Prevention of Delirium Programme system of care, assess compliance with the Prevention of Delirium Programme system of care, estimate recruitment and follow-up rates, assess the degree of contamination due to between-ward staff movements, and investigate differences in financial costs and benefits between the Prevention of Delirium Programme system of care and standard practice. Secondary objectives are to investigate differences in the number, severity and length of delirium episodes (including persistent delirium); length of stay in hospital; in-hospital mortality; destination at discharge; health-related quality of life and health resource use; physical and social independence; anxiety and depression; and patient experience.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This feasibility study will be used to gather data to inform the design of a future definitive randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN01187372">ISRCTN01187372</ext-link>.

In the United Kingdom, national policy has identified the improved management of delirium as a priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and national guidelines are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Yet, there is much evidence that delirium represents a largely unrecognised condition affecting older people within health care services internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is also now recognised that health care systems and services frequently have attributes that unintentionally stimulate or aggravate delirium in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Demographic transitions of populations have required health services internationally to address the needs of older people as a priority. The National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom has been slow to recognise that the modern general hospital is increasingly an older person&#x02019;s facility, with over two-thirds of the beds occupied by people older than 65&#x000a0;years of age, many of whom have complex needs requiring multidisciplinary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. General hospitals, however, have poorly developed care systems that are not yet fully aligned to the needs of this vulnerable group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Delirium is the most frequent complication of hospitalisation for older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], with an occurrence in general medical and old age medicine wards of 29&#x02013;64&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The large majority of delirium episodes remain undetected or misdiagnosed by ward teams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Delirium is an unpleasant experience for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The experience of delusions and hallucinations during delirium may be associated with the development of later neuropsychiatric symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The development of delirium is associated with increased mortality rates, functional decline, falls and increased requirement for institutional care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Symptoms of delirium can persist in some patients for up to 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and in-hospital delirium has also been linked with depression after hospital discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p><italic>Persistent delirium</italic> refers to the situation in which the delirium symptoms do not resolve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Dementia is the strongest risk factor for persistent delirium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], but age and comorbidity are additional factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The authors of a systematic review of 18 studies involving 1322 hospital patients older than 50&#x000a0;years of age (mean age, 72&#x02013;89 years; median age, 82&#x000a0;years) with prevalent or incident delirium reported the rates of persistent delirium as 45&#x000a0;%, 33&#x000a0;%, 26&#x000a0;% and 21&#x000a0;% at hospital discharge and 1, 3 and 6&#x000a0;months postdischarge, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Persistent delirium is directly linked to poor outcomes: Each 48&#x000a0;hours spent with delirium is associated with an 11&#x000a0;% increase in mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Perhaps the most important aspect of delirium is that multicomponent non-pharmacological interventions can significantly reduce delirium incidence (odds ratio, 0.47; 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval, 0.38&#x02013;0.58) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Intervention delivery strategies have included additional staff and volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], proactive geriatric consultation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], training family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and sustained education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Not all studies have found a reduction in delirium incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and a high degree of protocol adherence is a critical issue for success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Researchers have primarily examined outcomes in a research context and, with few exceptions, have not addressed how to achieve sustainability in routine care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The main exception has been the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP), which has been widely sustained in routine care outside the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>However, the existing delirium evidence base is sufficiently robust to present a clear opportunity for the NHS to address the necessary professional skills, cultural aspects and service design in such a way as to prevent or attenuate delirium in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There are strong arguments based on international research to suggest that delirium prevention and its improved management should be fundamentally predicated within high-quality care processes for older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], particularly care processes that recognise the specific needs of older people with cognitive impairment. Clinical teams need validated support systems to help them achieve this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Importantly, there is evidence to indicate that multicomponent interventions can improve outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Unfortunately, the NHS does not have routine care systems capable of minimising the impact of this common condition. Consequently, many older patients are currently disadvantaged in terms of outcomes, and considerable additional acute bed days are unnecessarily used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>A multicomponent intervention to prevent delirium was developed as part of a programme of interlinked studies with the aim of improving delirium prevention for older people in hospital and reduce the burden of delirium for the NHS. The development work followed the Medical Research Council framework for complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. First, we convened a development team (consisting of a senior manager, clinicians, matron, nurse consultant, specialist nurse, staff nurse, therapist, manager of the volunteer service, patient representative, care assistant and ward clerk) to review an evidence-based, multicomponent delirium prevention system of care (HELP) previously developed in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This was augmented by up-to-date evidence for delirium prevention from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In this review process, we identified candidate implementation and delivery strategies to produce the Prevention of Delirium Programme (POD) system of care. Second, we performed an implementation pilot in five wards in four NHS hospitals to test the feasibility and acceptability of the POD system of care. Key findings emerged about implementation and delivery, and some modifications of the content and presentation of the POD manuals and associated toolkit were made before implementation in the feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Here we report the protocol for a third study designed to explore preliminary estimates of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the modified version of the POD system of care in older patients at risk of developing delirium. The data obtained from this feasibility study will be used to inform the design of a possible future definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>We aim to conduct a pragmatic, multicentre, cluster randomised, controlled feasibility study to explore the potential effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the POD system of care versus standard care practice in older patients at risk of developing delirium who are admitted to hospital for emergency care.

As patients on a ward receive the allocated treatment, it is not possible to use the patient as the unit of randomisation. It is not known whether treatment contamination might occur between wards owing to staff movement, and therefore this will be investigated by randomising half of the hospitals at the hospital level (control or intervention) and half of the hospitals at the ward level. Randomisation will stratify by ward type (geriatric medicine and orthopaedic trauma) and is a two-stage process which will be performed centrally by the statistician at the Clinical Trials Research Unit (CTRU). Sites will first be randomised 1:1 between site- (i.e., hospital)-level allocation (both wards in the hospital receive the same intervention) and ward-level allocation (each ward in the hospital receives a different intervention). Those sites selected for site-level allocation will then be further randomised 1:1 for both of their wards to receive either POD or control. Wards in those sites selected for ward-level allocation will be randomised 1:1 to receive either POD or control (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Randomisaion overview</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_847_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Training in study procedures</title><p>Research assistants (RAs) will be appointed at each hospital to recruit study participants and perform study procedures.</p><p>Training in the use of the CAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] to detect delirium will be provided by the central trial team in consultation with the instrument developer. The diagnostic version of the CAM has four items: (1) acute onset and fluctuating course, (2) inattention, (3) disorganised thinking and (4) altered consciousness level. A diagnosis of delirium requires positive results for items (1) and (2) and either (3) or (4). Administration of the CAM takes 3&#x02013;5 minutes and is informed by a formal cognitive assessment. In validation studies, researchers have reported a sensitivity range of 94&#x02013;100&#x000a0;% and a specificity range of 90&#x02013;95&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>The RAs, before recruitment, will follow the recommended training procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] by co-assessing up to 10 patients with or without delirium to ensure acceptable inter-rater reliability (IRR).

The RAs will use a standard procedure to undertake the CAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

These interventions directly affect the patient experience of care and include optimising hydration and nutrition, reducing environmental threats (excessive noise, multiple moves), increasing orientation to time and place, improving communicative practices (personally meaningful interaction and cognitive stimulation), supporting and/or encouraging mobility and better management of pain and infection. The implementation process is supported and reinforced through raising awareness and training of staff and volunteers in delirium prevention. Alongside this, staff will be involved in an action-planning cycle of observation and audit of current practice to establish what needs to be put in place to introduce the POD system of care. The principles underpinning POD and the steps in the change process to facilitate action on the intervention are standard and generalisable, although the specific systems or mechanisms are flexible, depending on preexisting practice and local decision-making.</p><p>Wards randomised to the POD system of care will undergo a 6-month implementation period to allow the intervention to be embedded into ward practice before patient recruitment. Local implementation teams, including a study-specific ward nurse, will be convened, and training will be provided in the implementation and delivery of the POD system of care by the central trial team. Progress on implementation will be monitored by the central trial team through regular site visits and telephone and/or email contact and will be tracked through completion of an internal milestone checklist embedded within the POD manual.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Usual-care control group</title><p>Wards randomised to the usual-care control group will continue to deliver care as determined by local policies and practices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Recruitment and consent</title><p>Following a 6-month implementation period for the POD intervention, study participants will be recruited over a 6-month period.

It is strongly associated with adverse outcomes, and the burden to the patient, family, carer and the health care system is considerable. Evidence suggests that delirium can be prevented in more than one-third of patients through modifications to selected risk factors which can be incorporated and delivered within high-quality care processes for elderly patients. NICE demonstrated that such care systems are likely to be cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] and recommended they should be widely deployed in routine care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Our work comprises a sequence of linked studies to develop and evaluate a multicomponent intervention to prevent delirium. The protocol for the ongoing feasibility randomised trial described here has presented some critical implementation challenges, which are described below.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Implementation of the POD system of care</title><p>A key aspect of this study is to implement and sustain a multicomponent system of care across different wards and hospitals. Earlier studies within this programme sought to identify the feasibility and acceptability of the POD system of care and to refine its content before commencing this feasibility study. This also provided insights into the conditions required to inform the site selection processes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Recruitment and retention</title><p>This is a cluster randomised controlled trial, and all participants admitted to a participating ward will receive the POD system of care or usual care. Consent for participation is therefore for the provision of data only. Nonetheless, we anticipate challenges in the identification, recruitment and retention of study participants in a population at risk of fluctuating capacity. We aim to minimise the risk of this through involvement of patient groups in the development of the participant information and recruitment processes and the provision of ongoing training and support to the RAs, obtaining ethical approval to obtain personal or nominated consultee agreement and implementing strategies to maximise data completion (e.g., allowing proxy completion and telephone reminders).</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Reliable assessment of delirium</title><p>CAM is widely used in the clinical research setting to reliably detect delirium and can be used by clinicians without psychiatric training. We propose to implement a prerecruitment training programme to ensure that the RAs are competent and reliable in conducting the CAM assessment, using validated procedures provided by the instrument developer, who is a member of the study team. We will also provide appropriate training manuals and further assess the IRR during the proposed research.</p><p>The findings from the POD study will inform the design and development of a future definitive trial, which could change the way in which care is provided to elderly patients in U.K. hospitals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment completed on 28 February 2015 and the last 3 month follow-up took place on 19 June 2015.
