method to improve the muscular and joint functions and physiological stability of a certain
area, by attaching a tape with elasticity similar to muscle and skin elasticity. In addition
to elite and professional athletes, this method is also used by laypersons<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Kinesio taping provides positional sense through the skin; aligns fascial tissues; lifts
the fascial and soft tissues of the inflamed areas, thereby generating space; provides skin
stimulation aimed at aiding or restricting movement; and moves interstitial fluid into the
lymphatic vessels, helping to remove edema<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, tape applied to the joints and musculoskeletal system
enhances proprioception and muscle activity while reducing pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Contraction and
tone of the muscles are controlled by the nerves; by attaching Kinesio tape, the scattered
nerves regulating the muscles may be better controlled, thereby recovering their original
functions and protecting the muscles<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. By attaching a tape, a space is created
between the skin and fasciae or muscles underneath. In particular, muscular movement drains
the blood or tissue fluid stagnating in the space. As a result, edema or internal hemorrhage
is reduced, which lowers the increased tissue pressure and relieves pressure and pain<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stretching enhances joint range of motion. When movement becomes smooth, excessive burden
is not applied to the muscles or the body, and the pressure on each muscle is reduced,
thereby decreasing the risk of injuries<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, stretching is effective in preventing damage, and conducting stretching as a
cool-down measure before and after exercise is effective in preventing muscle pain and
overuse syndrome, which appears as a result of excessive use<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are different kinds of warm-up exercises, generally divided into static stretching
and dynamic stretching exercises. Static stretching is recommended as a method to improve
performance ability and prevent injuries by statically maintaining maximal joint range of
motion for 10 to 15 seconds manually; most students perform this as a warm-up exercise<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. There has been research done on static and dynamic stretching
methods for flexibility improvement and muscular extension, but little research involved
taping in addition to stretching<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, this study intends to
examine the effects of taping, stretching, and joint exercise on flexibility and hip joint
range of motion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Forty-five college students in their 20s were randomly assigned and equally divided into
three groups, as follows: a stretching group (SG), a taping and exercise group (TEG), and an
exercise group (EG). The subjects were able to understand the purpose of this study and
presented no orthopedic or neurological abnormalities. All participants were told about the
potential risks and about the design of the study, and they provided informed consent for
participation, with the knowledge that they could withdraw at any time. The Ethics Committee
of Namseoul University in Korea also approved the study. The IRB approval number is
Research-NSU-1041479-201511-HR-010. The general characteristics of the study subjects are

Korea) and an electronic goniometer (Patterson Medical, Canada) were used. To ensure that
stretching was applied equivalently, three subjects conducted stretching three times and the
average value was retained. They carried out stretching exercises for 10 times in total. To
note the changes in the subjects, the number of times per minute when muscular changes
increased most effectively were chosen from the set points of 15, 30, and 45 times per
minute.</p><p>While adopting a sitting posture, the subject extended both arms and hands forward, flexed
the body, and then pushed the measurement tube of the flexometer to the maximum extent
possible. The length of the measured plate pushed by the hands was measured twice and
recorded. First, the subject took off his/her shoes, sat, and placed the soles flat in the
opposite position to the flexometer. The innermost edges of the soles were situated within
2&#x02005;cm of the measurement value. Then, the subject extended both hands as slowly as possible
and maintained the position for two seconds. Both hands needed to be in a parallel position
so that neither hand was extended further than the other. Regardless of whether the ends of
the hands were overlapped, they came into contact with the graduated ruler or the measuring
parts. The score was measured when the tips of the hands reached as far as possible. The
better of the scores for two attempts was recorded. For a better record, the head was
lowered between the arms and the subject exhaled when he reached the arrival point.</p><p>The examiner checked whether the subject&#x02019;s knees had been extended, but the participants&#x02019;
knees were not pushed. The examinee was asked to breathe normally, without holding his/her
breath during the test. The goniometer could differ in size according to the measured areas.
Therefore, the researcher needed to be trained in advance on how to use it, and an
appropriate goniometer, suitable for each measured area, needed to be used. During
measurement, sufficient explanation was given to the examinee first, and the examinee was
asked to assume a comfortable position, afterwards. After the measured joint of the subject
was sufficiently exposed, the starting position was determined and recorded. Based on the
anatomical posture, the location of zero degrees was precisely observed, and then the
measurement was taken. All points that could be observed accompanied by measurement were
recorded. Before measurement, the subject rested for 20 minutes, and in a spinal posture, a
fixed ruler was placed in parallel with the trunk and the movable ruler was placed at the
center of the femur. The axis was fixed at the greater trochanter.</p><p>The stretching group concurrently conducted passive stretching of the hamstring muscles and
ankle joint dorsiflexion. The subjects assumed a supine position and the examiner had the
subject conduct ankle joint dorsiflexion and passively stretch the hamstring muscles, as
much as possible and without causing pain. The subject returned to the original position
after the maximal stretch and maintained the posture for 30 seconds; he/she then rested for
10 seconds. The subject repeated this motion six times and measurements were taken
immediately<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The taping and exercise
group carried out taping and exercise as follows: taping was applied to the vastus
lateralis, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius muscle, and medial malleolus using an elastic tape
(width, 5&#x02005;cm). The subject lay in a prone position on a bed and the examiner attached the
tape diagonally to the medial malleolus, starting from the vastus lateralis of both
limbs<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. After attaching the elastic
band, the subject conducted the exercise immediately. The subject sat straight on the mat
and alternately conducted flexion and extension of both limbs in a knee curl position. After
conducting the motion 60 times for 2 minutes, measurement was immediately taken.</p><p>The exercise group sat straight on the mat and alternately conducted flexion and extension
of both limbs in a knee curl position. After conducting the motion 60 times for 2 minutes,
measurement was immediately taken. For analysis of data in this study, the statistical
analysis program SPSS 18.0 for Windows was used. Normality of the data was verified through
the Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test, and then a paired t-test was conducted for the three groups, in
order to examine differences in flexibility and angles before and after the exercise. In
order to compare differences in flexibility and range of motion changes between the two
groups, according to the type of exercise, multivariate analysis of variance was used.
Statistical significance was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A before and after comparison of flexibility according to taping, stretching, and joint

very important for motor performance and physical activities in everyday life<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Maintaining flexibility in all joints is an
important element for smooth graded movements, due to which an easy carried out movement of
the body structures is possible. When there are problems in areas like flexibility, injuries
might occur<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. For maintenance and
improvement of flexibility, different methods, such as diverse stretching and self-exercise,
are in use. This study aimed to examine the effects of taping and stretching on flexibility
and range of motion at the level of the hip joints. Comparison of flexibility and range of
motion according to the interventions revealed that all three groups experienced
statistically significant changes.</p><p>Behm and Chaouachi reported that static stretching improved flexibility without the
accompanying pain and was effective for preventing and alleviating impairments<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, Etnyre and Abraham noted that
static stretching stimulated proprioceptors distributed in the human body, thereby promoting
or increasing neuromuscular system response; this had the effects of improving muscular
relaxation and range of motion, while increasing the length of connective tissues at rest,
and decreasing muscular pain<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. For
improvement in range of motion, and the index for flexibility, different exercise methods
including stretching are in use. Stretching is recommended as an exercise therapy for
increasing joint range of motion<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
main effects of static stretching on flexibility are related with the viscoelasticity of the
tendon and the relaxation of the actin&#x02013;myosin complex, resulting in a temporary lengthening
of muscles and tendons<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study,
increase in hip joint flexibility and range of motion was the result of muscular relaxation,
viscosity of the tendons, and elasticity changes resulting from static stretching.</p><p>Flexibility is the range of motion of a single joint or different joints in combination,
and it greatly affects the efficiency of body movements<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The elements that affect flexibility include the following: 1) the
structures or shapes of joints, flexibility of tendons or ligaments, or the conditions of
the muscles and joints that attach to these joints; and 2) age, gender, and physical
activity. Finally, a lack of exercise has negative effects on flexibility<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. When a muscle contracts, the distance between the origin and
insertion of the muscle is shortened; the cross-sectional area of the muscle belly is
increased; and when it becomes close to the direction of tendon or the skin, it swells; At
this time, when tape is attached to put light pressure on the muscles, tendons, or skin,
fine pressure stimulation on the skin acts on the muscle spindle, Golgi tendon organ, and
cutaneous nerve, relieving muscle tone and reducing pain<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, the
increase in flexibility and joint range of motion in the TEG and EG was triggered by the
increase in elasticity of the fascia through exercise. Physiological effects on the muscle
spindle, tendon organs, and skin nerves generated by the application of tape improved
flexibility and joint range of motions, as well.</p><p>The limitations of this study are that the day-to-day life of the subjects was not
controlled for the study goals and the study sample was limited to college students in their
20s. More research needs to be conducted in order to address these limitations.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>YS</given-names></name><name><surname>Bae</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>Hwang</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The effects of kinesio taping on architecture, strength
