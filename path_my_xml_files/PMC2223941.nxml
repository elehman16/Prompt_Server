Three groups of patients have received (a) nicotinamide alone, given orally in a dose of 80 mg kg(-1) daily with 52.5 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks, (b) carbogen alone, with 50 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks, and (c) carbogen and nicotinamide, with 50-52.5 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks. Ten patients were treated in each group. All patients completed carbogen and radiotherapy as prescribed, but only 45% completed daily nicotinamide over the 4-week treatment period. The end points of this study were acute bowel and bladder morbidity and local control at cystoscopy 6 months after treatment. An expected level of acute bowel and bladder morbidity was seen that reverted to normal in most patients by 12 weeks with no difference between the three treatment groups. Complete response rates at 6 months were seven out of ten (100%) in the nicotinamide alone group, nine out of ten (90%) in the carbogen alone group and seven out of ten (70%) in the carbogen and nicotinamide group. It is concluded that carbogen and nicotinamide may improve the results of daily fractionated radiotherapy in bladder cancer and that further evaluation is required.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00166-0124.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="260" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00166-0125.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="261" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00166-0126.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="262" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00166-0127.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="263" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
