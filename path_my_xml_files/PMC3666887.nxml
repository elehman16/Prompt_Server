The Kaplan-Meier estimates revealed comparable time to event profiles. Only 27% of LY2140023 and 45% of SOC patients completed the 24-week open-label, active treatment phase. Twenty-seven patients (20.8%) in the LY2140023 group and 15 patients (11.5%) in the SOC group discontinued due to lack of efficacy (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;.044). Twenty-three patients (17.7%) in the LY2140023 group and 19 patients (14.5%) in the SOC group discontinued due to adverse events (physician and subject decision combined, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;.505). The incidence of serious adverse events was comparable between groups. LY2140023-treated patients reported significantly more treatment-emergent adverse events of vomiting, agitation, and dyspepsia, while SOC-treated patients reported significantly more akathisia and weight gain. The incidence of treatment-emergent parkinsonism (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;.011) and akathisia (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;.029) was significantly greater in SOC group.

LY2140023 is undergoing testing in clinical trials as a potential treatment for schizophrenia. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (olanzapine) clinical trial (HBBD) over a 4-week treatment period, patients receiving 40&#x000a0;mg twice daily (BID) of LY2140023 demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] total score compared with patients receiving placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The efficacy results in a second, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (olanzapine) clinical trial (HBBI) lasting up to 4&#x000a0;weeks were inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. None of the 4 LY2140023 doses (5&#x000a0;mg, 20&#x000a0;mg, 40&#x000a0;mg, or 80&#x000a0;mg BID) nor the olanzapine dose (15&#x000a0;mg once daily) demonstrated changes different from placebo in the PANSS total score, the primary measure of efficacy. The heightened placebo response in the second phase 2 study likely reduced the ability to detect a significant drug response across the LY2140023 and olanzapine treatment groups.</p><p>The safety results from both 4-week, Phase 2 clinical trials comparing LY2140023 with placebo treatment were generally similar. LY2140023 treatment was generally well-tolerated overall and not associated with elevations in prolactin, extrapyramidal symptoms, or weight. However, in the HBBI study, convulsions were reported in 4 patients treated with LY2140023 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This latter finding identified a potentially increased risk of seizures during treatment with LY2140023, but further study is needed to evaluate any potential relationship to duration of exposure.</p><p>The current study (HBBR) is the first time patients were assigned to long-term treatment with LY2140023. It is important for assessing any potential association between prolonged duration of exposure to LY2140023 and the incidence of convulsions. The primary objective of this study was to assess time to discontinuation due to lack of tolerability among patients with schizophrenia receiving LY2140023 versus those on atypical antipsychotic standard of care (SOC) treatment for up to 24&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Study HBBR was a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, parallel, active-controlled study with an open-label design (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Patients enrolled in this study were male or female, 18 to 65&#x000a0;years of age (inclusive), with a diagnosis of schizophrenia as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders &#x02013; Fourth Edition &#x02013; text revision (DSM-IV-TR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Diagnosis was confirmed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis (SCID), performed by the principal investigator. Patients had at most moderate symptomatology, as reflected by a score &#x02264;4 (moderate) on the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], with prominent negative symptoms defined as symptom score &#x02265;4 on at least 3 items or a score &#x02265;5 on at least 2 items of the PANSS negative subscale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and evidence of functional impairment at study entry. Assessment of &#x0201c;functional impairment&#x0201d; was based on the clinical judgment of the principal investigator. All investigators were trained that functional impairment was a deficiency in the expected tasks of patients as appropriate for a student, homemaker, or worker. Patients were not eligible to participate in the study if they had a history of seizures or additional specified criteria that indicated seizure tendency. All patients gave written informed consent prior to entering the study. The study protocol was approved by appropriate institutional review boards and conducted in accordance with the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was conducted from 2009 through 2010 at 29 centers in 4 countries; the number of patients in each country were: Germany (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10, 3.8%), Mexico (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;48, 18.4%), Russia (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;86, 33.0%), and the United States (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;117, 44.8%).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Study design.</bold> Abbreviations: AP&#x02009;=&#x02009;antipsychotic; ARI&#x02009;=&#x02009;aripiprazole; OLZ&#x02009;=&#x02009;olanzapine; LY&#x02009;=&#x02009;Lilly2140023; RIS&#x02009;=&#x02009;risperidone; SOC&#x02009;=&#x02009;standard of care; vs. = versus.

All results pertain to Study Periods I through III only. Patients were randomized to receive either LY2140023 (20, 40, or 80&#x000a0;mg, BID; target dose&#x02009;=&#x02009;40&#x000a0;mg BID), or SOC (olanzapine [10, 15, or 20&#x000a0;mg, once daily; target&#x02009;=&#x02009;15&#x000a0;mg/day], aripiprazole [10, 20, or 30&#x000a0;mg, once daily; target&#x02009;=&#x02009;20&#x000a0;mg/day], or risperidone [2, 4, or 6&#x000a0;mg, once or twice daily; target&#x02009;=&#x02009;4&#x000a0;mg/day]) treatment. Doses of comparators were based on U.S. labeling. Based upon the available Phase 2 data, an optimal dose of LY2140023 had not yet been identified.</p><p>The treating clinician was free to select which SOC antipsychotic to use for each patient randomly assigned to SOC treatment; the clinician was not permitted to switch a patient to another SOC medication once treatment began. Patients randomized to receive LY2140023 were started at a dose of 40&#x000a0;mg BID. For patients randomized to receive SOC treatment, investigators were instructed to begin patients at doses below the target dose for the first 3&#x000a0;days to minimize the potential for adverse events. Dose adjustments, other than the initial scheduled dose titration, were made only if investigators had concerns about patient safety/tolerability or lack of response. Dose decreases to accommodate investigator concern about a patient&#x02019;s safety or tolerability to study medication could occur at any time, based on the investigator&#x02019;s clinical judgment; only 1 dose decrease was permitted between visits. Dose decreases for patients receiving LY2140023 should be from 80&#x000a0;mg/day to 40&#x000a0;mg/day (with no intermediate dose). Dose increases to potentially improve clinical response could occur no earlier than Visit 6 (Week 3) to ensure sufficient time for patients to respond, and were made only at scheduled visits. Investigators were permitted to increase the dose for LY2140023 patients to 160&#x000a0;mg/day (80&#x000a0;mg BID), with no intermediate dose. Once patients reached the target dose, dose adjustments for patients on comparator medications could occur in the following increments: olanzapine (+/&#x02212; 5&#x000a0;mg/day), aripiprazole (+/&#x02212; 10&#x000a0;mg/day), or risperidone (+/&#x02212; 2&#x000a0;mg/day).</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>The primary objective of this study was to assess time to discontinuation due to lack of tolerability, defined as discontinuation due to adverse events, among patients with schizophrenia receiving LY2140023 versus those on atypical antipsychotic SOC treatment for up to 24&#x000a0;weeks. The classification of discontinuation due to adverse events was based on the site investigator&#x02019;s determination that the primary reason for a patient's early withdrawal from the study was an adverse event.</p><p>The secondary objectives of this study included evaluation of the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of LY2140023 compared with SOC treatment. Safety assessments included the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), neurological changes, vital signs, laboratory changes, and changes in electrocardiographs and electroencephalographs (EEGs). Extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed by the Barnes Akathisia Scale for akathisia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], Simpson-Angus Scale for parkinsonism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale for dyskinetic symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>All patients had an EEG at baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 that were evaluated by a single central neurologist. All EEGs were performed on the same model device utilizing the same software and settings.</p><p>Efficacy was assessed by the PANSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], CGI-S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and the 16-item Negative Symptoms Assessment (NSA-16) scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Raters not directly involved with the patient&#x02019;s treatment were used to assess the PANSS and NSA-16 scales. The raters were blind to the study design, entrance criteria, and treatment assignment; separate raters were used for baseline and endpoint assessments.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>All analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat basis, meaning that data were analyzed by the treatment groups to which patients were randomly assigned, even if the patient did not take the assigned treatment, did not receive the correct treatment, or did not comply with the protocol. No adjustments were made for multiplicity. All treatment comparisons were evaluated based on a 2-sided significance level of 0.05.</p><p>Unless otherwise specified, when an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model or an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used to analyze a continuous efficacy variable, the model contained the main effects of treatment and investigator. Type III sum of squares for the least-squares (LS) means were used for statistical comparison from ANOVA or ANCOVA models.</p><p>For the analyses of change from baseline, only patients with a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline measure were included. Unless otherwise specified, baseline was defined as the last nonmissing observation at or before the randomization visit (Visit 3). Endpoint for Study Period III (24&#x000a0;weeks) was defined as the last nonmissing observation obtained from Visit 4 through Visit 13.</p><p>The primary safety outcome was the time to discontinuation due to adverse events during Study Period III. Kaplan-Meier estimated survival curves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] of time to discontinuation (measured in days) for adverse events were compared between LY2140023 and SOC. The log-rank test was used to compare the LY2140023 and SOC time-to-discontinuation profiles. This study was planned to provide approximately 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.36 in the time to discontinuation due to adverse events over the 24-week active treatment phase of the study.</p><p>Secondary efficacy outcomes for the PANSS total and subscores were analyzed using the mixed-model repeated measures (analysis) model (MMRM), with the fixed categorical effects of treatment, gender, investigator, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariate of baseline score and baseline-by-visit interaction.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Baseline and demographic characteristics</title><p>Patients in the 2 groups did not significantly differ with respect to baseline characteristics (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

The primary analysis showed LY2140023 to be comparable to SOC in time to discontinuation due to lack of tolerability through 24&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in the incidence of SAEs, TEAEs, or adverse events leading to study discontinuation. However, a significantly greater number of patients in the LY2140023 group discontinued from the study due to perceived lack of efficacy compared with those in the SOC group. In addition, time to discontinuation for any reason was significantly shorter for patients in the LY2140023 group than for those on SOC. All treatments in the study were generally well-tolerated.</p><p>The safety findings from this 24-week study were generally consistent with observations from the 2 previous, 4-week clinical trials. In these acute trials, LY2140023-treated patients generally did not differ significantly from placebo-treated patients with regard to prolactin elevation, extrapyramidal symptoms or weight gain, while comparisons between placebo and olanzapine revealed weight gain and limited or no reduction in prolactin in the olanzapine-treated patients. In the current study, LY2140023 treatment was characterized not only by a decrease in mean weight over 24&#x000a0;weeks, as compared with an increase observed with SOC treatment, but also by improvement across various metabolic parameters. LY2140023 was associated with a reduction in akathisia, and with less treatment-emergent akathisia and parkinsonism as compared with SOC treatment. This unique tolerability profile highlights possible advantages of a glutamate-based schizophrenia therapy versus dopaminergic-based therapies.</p><p>The occurrence of convulsions within the 4-week HBBI study identified a potentially increased risk of seizures during treatment with LY2140023, warranting further study following long-term exposure. In the current study, there were 2 patients who experienced convulsive events, 1 patient treated with LY2140023 and a second patient treated with placebo prior to randomization. The overall LY2140023 exposure-adjusted rate of seizures had decreased substantially with the increased compound exposure in the current 24-week HBBR study and in other ongoing studies. Extensive repeat EEG assessments did not demonstrate any abnormal epileptiform-like changes that were frequent nor remarkably different between treatment arms. Study results do not suggest an increased risk of seizures following long-term exposure. Based on results of the current study, the safety profile of LY2140023 appears similar after short- and long-term exposure.</p><p>Efficacy was a secondary endpoint in this study. Improvement on the PANSS total score and most other measures of efficacy over the initial 6 to 8&#x000a0;weeks of treatment did not differ between treatments, while improvement at later time points was significantly greater in the SOC group compared with LY2140023. The mean PANSS visit response results were likely impacted by the rate of early discontinuation and the treatment-group difference in discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. A post hoc analysis of only the patients who had PANSS data at the last visit demonstrated similar improvement in the SOC group and the LY2140023 group, although there were significantly more patients with final visit PANSS scores in the SOC group (data not shown). LY2140023 and SOC had comparable negative symptom improvement over the 24&#x000a0;weeks. Further investigation of the efficacy of LY2140023 in the treatment of schizophrenia utilizing placebo-controlled study is warranted.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study was an open-label study without a placebo treatment arm, preventing definitive conclusions regarding efficacy. This specific design element (that is, open-label) was chosen in order to closely monitor the safety of patients in this initial long-term study. In addition, investigators selected the SOC treatment to be used for each patient in the SOC treatment group, and given the knowledge available for these marketed drugs, SOC treatment may have been optimized by clinicians to a greater extent than for treatment with LY2140023. Normal EEGs were required at baseline, and therefore, any safety results regarding seizures may be limited by this less generalizable population. Similarly, this study focused on moderately ill patients with schizophrenia who had prominent negative symptoms and evidence of functional impairment, and therefore the data are primarily generalizable to patients with a similar symptom profile. Lastly, the overall relatively high discontinuation rate (64%) may limit inference of results on outcome scales.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This was the first clinical study to examine the long-term safety of a metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, a potential new therapeutic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia. LY2140023 was comparable to atypical SOC medications in the primary analysis of time-to-discontinuation due to adverse events, a finding demonstrating that LY2140023 was generally well-tolerated over clinically relevant treatment duration. Similar to previous acute studies, LY2140023 had a distinct safety profile characterized by a low incidence of dopamine-related adverse events and a decrease in mean weight compared with SOC treatment.</p><sec><title>Ethics approvals</title><p>The following institutional review boards provided ethical approval for the study: Med.
