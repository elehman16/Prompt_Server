Currently in UK there are an estimated 50&#x02009;000 new cases of MPE each year.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> This translates to one new case per 1000 population. The incidence of MPE is increasing in an ageing population&#x02014;an extra 100&#x02009;000 cases of cancer are expected per year by 2025.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The majority of patients with MPE develop disabling symptoms, particularly breathlessness and chest pain.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Removal of pleural fluid by intercostal drainage alleviates symptoms, but in the majority, MPE recurs after single drainage (recurrence rate&#x000a0;~100% at 1&#x02009;month).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> To reduce this morbidity, adherence of the pleura (pleurodesis) to prevent fluid accumulation is advocated.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref></p><p>Pleurodesis using sterile talc is the current standard of care for MPE.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Talc creates a chemical injury to the parietal pleura which provokes inflammation and subsequently adheres the inflamed parietal pleural and visceral lung surface, creating a fibrotic seal between the two surfaces which prevents further fluid accumulation. Talc pleurodesis in randomised studies has a success rate of 70%&#x02013;80%,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and is associated with modest equipment cost (~&#x000a3;10 sterile talc, ~&#x000a3;40 chest drain: UK costs, current: June 2017, including value added tax&#x000a0;(VAT)). However, talc pleurodesis requires insertion of a chest drain and thus an in-hospital stay while the drain is in situ. The majority of MPE pleurodeses are conducted using the &#x02018;talc slurry&#x02019; technique, where a drain is percutaneously inserted into the pleural space, all fluid is drained over a 24&#x02013;48-hour period and talc is then administered via the drain into the now dry pleural space. Alternatively, talc may be administered using a thoracoscopic &#x02018;poudrage&#x02019; technique where the pleural space is fully drained with the aid of endoscopic cameras inserted into the pleural space, and talc applied using pressurised gas during the procedure.</p><p>The mean hospital stay following talc slurry pleurodesis is 6 days (SD 4.5) while the mean stay is 4 days (SD 3.5) following poudrage pleurodesis.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Length hospitalisation is related to the time spent in hospital after talc application and with the chest drain in situ. Using current data on the cost of hospital beds/day<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> in the UK (June 2017: including VAT), a 6-day stay for talc pleurodesis is associated with a cost of &#x000a3;1320 in bed day/patient. The overall hospital costs associated with talc pleurodesis are substantial. Assuming conservatively that 50% requires pleurodesis, this equates to 25&#x02009;000 pleurodeses/year, and with an average hospital stay/patient of 6 days, the UK cost in bed days of pleurodesis is &#x000a3;33&#x02009;million/year.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Several attempts have been made to address the optimal timing of talc administration after chest drain insertion, including amount of pleural fluid drained per day and radiographic appearances. A previous study suggests that the optimal timing of talc administration should be determined by the appearance of the chest radiograph.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, there is a paucity of data that addresses when the chest drain should be removed after talc administration, with current UK national guidelines<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> citing only two articles providing expert opinion<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> and two small randomised trials.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> Thus, there are no reliable data to inform the clinician of the optimal timing of drain withdrawal following talc pleurodesis.</p><p>Use of thoracic ultrasound&#x000a0;(TUS) for detection of pleural fluid and to guide pleural interventions is becoming widely available and pleural adherence may be detectable via TUS.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> An observational study has shown that fibrin strands on ultrasound may be associated with higher pleurodesis success,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> inferring that sonographic markers may provide prognostic information. Sonographic evidence of pleural adherence using a lack of the normal &#x02018;lung sliding&#x02019; sign seen when normal visceral lung moves beneath the parietal pleura predicted pleurodesis success in a rabbit animal model of pleurodesis,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> in which absence of lung gliding (pleural adherence) at 14 days postpleurodesis correlated with histological pleural fibrosis score at animal sacrifice. A study (n=10) in humans using the same technique has shown promising results,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> in assessing the success of surgical pleurodesis in spontaneous pneumothorax at 4 weeks. This observation suggests that a TUS scanning protocol for pleurodesis is feasible in humans. However, no previous studies have been made to prospectively assess a TUS pleurodesis protocol in MPE in order to investigate the timing of scanning, or efficacy of the suggested protocol.</p><p>In this trial, bedside use of TUS diagnosis of pleural adherence within 24&#x02013;48&#x02009;hours of talc administration is the novel application proposed, with the primary outcome being reduction of hospital stay. Pilot data from our department assessing 10 patients with MPE suggest pleurodesis may occur within 24&#x02009;hours of talc administration and can be detectable using TUS. Additionally, combination of clinical, radiological and biological variables will be done in order to prospectively develop a predictive score for pleurodesis success and survival in patients with MPE.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>SIMPLE is a multicentre randomised controlled trial designed to evaluate whether use of TUS, in hospitalised patients with MPE before and during the first 24&#x02013;72&#x02009;hours post-talc administration, accurately identifies pleural adherence early in treatment, permitting shorter hospital stay without adversely affecting pleurodesis success. The trial (unblinded and postrandomisation) will also interrogate pleural fluid protein expression profiles to determine factors that permit prediction of pleurodesis success and survival. The trial is sponsored by the University of Oxford and coordinated by the Oxford Respiratory Trials Unit (ORTU), University of Oxford. The trial is registered on the International Standardised Randomised Controlled Trial Registry (ISRCTN16441661) and funded by the Marie Curie Institute. The trial is included in the NIHR Clinical Research Network portfolio (ID: 20343). The trial will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice.</p><p>Participants will be randomised to standard care or TUS guided care.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Standard care: Participants will have either thoracoscopy with talc poudrage or a chest drain with talc slurry. Talc slurry pleurodesis will occur as indicated by radiological results (chest X-ray (CXR) after drainage).

For participants having a chest drain with talc slurry, these will occur prepleurodesis and postpleurodesis (for up to 3 days or until declared fit for discharge). For participants having a thoracoscopy with talc poudrage, these will only occur postpleurodesis (for up to 3 days or until declared fit for discharge) as there is no pretalc period of drainage in thoracoscopies.</p><p>All daily TUS assessments should be recorded on trial clinical report forms (CRF). The information required will include the size of any residual effusion (based on the number of rib spaces where pleural fluid is visible and the maximum depth of the effusion measured in centimetres) and characteristics of this residual fluid including echogenicity and presence of septations. Additional measurements will be taken using B-mode ultrasound specifically assessing and scoring the movement or &#x02018;sliding&#x02019; of the underlying lung in nine specific regions (upper, middle and lower zones in the anterior (mid-clavicular line), lateral (midaxillary line) and posterior chest). Lung sliding will be scored as either present (=1), questionable (=2) or absent (=3) in nine regions, consistent with previous animal studies in this area of practice. This will generate a total pleural adherence score for the hemithorax being assessed.</p><p>TUS imaging will be essential in defining both the time to perform pleurodesis and also the removal of the chest drain. Specifically, pleurodesis with talc slurry will be performed once there is a small effusion on TUS (less than two rib spaces) or the maximum depth of the fluid will be less than 2&#x02009;cm in two out of three basal areas (posterior/midaxillary line/anterior) on TUS. Pleurodesis will be performed as per normal clinical practice proposed by the current BTS guidelines (4&#x02009;g of talc in 50&#x000a0;mL normal saline&#x02014;0.9% with intrapleural local anaesthesia). The drain will be removed postprocedure on the basis of bedside ultrasound appearances: either mean sonographic pleural adherence score of&#x000a0;&#x0003e;20&#x02009;or complete pleural adherence in the midaxillary line region. If after 72&#x02009;hours postpleurodesis there is minimal fluid drainage, good CXR appearance but the lung is sliding on TUS, the participant will be managed as per BTS guidelines (removal of the chest drain) and this will be documented on the CRF.</p><p>Ultrasound still images and video clips (5&#x02013;10&#x02009;s in duration) will be recorded in order to allow verification of the findings, after trial completion, by an independent assessor who will be blinded to the participant&#x02019;s clinical status; this assessor will, as a minimum standard, hold level 1 Royal College of Radiologists accreditation in thoracic ultrasound. All images and video clips will be anonymised for the trial participants and copied to encrypted external hard drives. To ensure no loss of data, images will be transferred at two time points in the trial; discharge and after the 3-month follow-up. All encrypted external hard drives will be couriered to ORTU to be securely stored on the Trust server and then analysed by the independent assessor at the end of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Control (standard care) arm</title><p>For all participants during initial drainage, a daily CXR will be conducted. In the control arm group (standard care), the talc slurry pleurodesis will be administered when the patient meets standard criteria (suitable apposition of lung and chest wall on CXR, less than 250&#x000a0;mL pleural fluid drainage per day as per current BTS guidelines) and will be conducted according to the trial-specific instructions on talc.</p><p>Once talc pleurodesis has been conducted, daily observations will be recorded on the CRFs from the clinical notes. The drain will be removed when the participant meets the objective drain removal criteria, based on current BTS guidelines, and will be recorded on CRFs. For participants treated with talc poudrage via thoracoscopy, the chest drain will be removed based on the same criteria in the guidelines.</p><p>TUS may be used in the non-ultrasound arm if clinically indicated for specific reasons (eg, poor drain output, to assess drain position) as per usual clinical care.

It will be up to the discretion of the treating physician as to whether they still perform pleurodesis.</p><p>If the participant is in the ultrasound arm, the TUS assessment is not feasible and the management of the participant should not be planned according to TUS characteristics. Participants with trapped lung in both arms will be followed up as per protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Visual Assessment Scale scoring</title><p>All participants should document a Visual Assessment Scale&#x000a0;(VAS) score for both thoracic pain and breathlessness during their baseline assessment.

Pleural fluid and blood samples postpleurodesis will be tested to define the biological effects of talc pleurodesis in both arms. Samples will be centrifuged in the ORTU and stored under the Human Tissue Agency licence for future use subject to ethical approval.</p></sec><sec id="s3j"><title>Data management</title><p>CRFs will be completed by the trial team at recruiting centres and sent to the ORTU. Data will then be entered onto the trial database (OpenClinica clinical trials software). Missing data and data queries will be highlighted to the trial teams on a monthly basis.

Withdrawal details should be recorded on the withdrawal/loss to follow-up CRF. In addition, the investigator may discontinue a participant from the trial at any time if the investigator considers it necessary. Withdrawals from the trial should be discussed with the trial clinical coordinator, the chief investigator or their deputy.</p><p>Loss to follow-up will be minimised by diligent liaison with the patient, their oncology team and general practitioner.

Assuming mean efficacy to be 75%, and a non-inferiority margin (delta) of 15%, 262 patients are required to demonstrate non-inferiority (80% power, 2.5% one-sided significance).</p></sec><sec id="s3m"><title>Statistical analysis plan</title><p>A summary of the planned statistical analysis is included here. The primary analysis for each outcome will be by ITT. If a continuous variable is normally distributed, we will use t-tests (or analysis of covariance) to compare the intervention at the optimal dose with the control group, and will present the results by mean difference and the corresponding 95% CI. If a continuous variable is not normally distributed, a non-parametric test will be used for the analysis. For categorical variables including quality of life, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests will be used for comparing treatment groups. P&#x000a0;values will be reported to three decimal places. All tests will be considered statistically significant at the 5% level and all comparative results will be presented as summary statistics with 95%&#x000a0;CIs and reported according to the appropriate Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials extension. All analyses will adjust for minimisation variables and these will be included as covariates in the regression model for each outcome.</p><p>Specific description of statistical methods:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>Hospital stay</italic>: This will be measured from randomisation until discharge using objective criteria.

Sensitivity analyses will be undertaken on the per-protocol population.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Pleurodesis success</italic>: This will be measured using blinded assessment and objective criteria (at 1&#x02009;month and 3 months). Non-inferiority will be assessed against the lower limit of the CI to determine whether it does not cross the prespecified non-inferiority margin. The non-inferiority comparison for pleurodesis success will be based on per-protocol analysis, which is more conservative than the ITT.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Modelling of predictive factors:</italic> At trial completion, analysis of potential predictive factors for successful pleurodesis and survival will occur using standard statistical methods, examining the relationship between outcome (pleurodesis success, patient-reported outcome measures) and factors individually first, then combining into a regression model to assess their independent effects.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Health economic analysis:</italic> An economic evaluation adherent to guidelines for good economic evaluation practice will be undertaken integral to the main trial. A within-trial cost-effectiveness (additional cost per pleurodesis success achieved) and cost-utility analysis (additional cost per quality-adjusted life years gained) will explore the 3-month cost-effectiveness of TUS guided care when compared with standard care, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios being calculated by dividing the difference in healthcare costs by the difference in effects.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="s3n"><title>End of trial</title><p>Trial closure will be when all final sample analyses have been completed or at the discretion of the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) acting on the recommendation of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC).</p></sec><sec id="s3o"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s3o1"><title>Monitoring</title><p>An IDMC will be convened at regular intervals, consisting of members who are independent of the trial investigators.
