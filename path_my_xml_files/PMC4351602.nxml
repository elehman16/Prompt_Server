strength and power on postural control has not been fully explored among different
age strata over sixty. </p></sec><sec><title>OBJECTIVES:</title><p>the aim of the present study was to assess the muscle strength and power of
elderly women in different age groups and determine their correlation with
postural control. </p></sec><sec><title>METHOD:</title><p>eighty women were divided into four groups: the young 18-30 age group (n=20); the
60-64 age group (n=20); the 65-69 age group (n=20); and the 70-74 age group
(n=20). The participants underwent maximum strength (one repetition maximum or
1-RM) and muscle power tests to assess the knee extensor and flexor muscles at
40%, 70%, and 90% 1-RM intensity. The time required by participants to recover
their balance after disturbing their base of support was also assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>the elderly women in the 60-64, 65-69, and 70-74 age groups exhibited similar
muscle strength, power, and postural control (p&#x0003e;0.05); however, these values
were lower than those of the young group (p&#x0003c;0.05) as expected. There was a
correlation between muscle strength and power and the postural control performance
(p&#x0003c;0.05). </p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION:</title><p>despite the age difference, elderly women aged 60 to 74 years exhibited similar
abilities to generate strength and power with their lower limbs, and this ability
could be one factor that explains the similar postural control shown by these
women.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>balance</kwd><kwd>muscle strength</kwd><kwd>older people</kwd><kwd>rehabilitation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="35"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The literature on gerontology clearly demonstrates that the elderly exhibit poorer
balance compared to young individuals<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Nevertheless, a few studies have evaluated
postural control throughout the aging process by analyzing the balance in elderly
individuals from different age groups. The studies that sought to investigate this
subject have reported contradictory results<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Some studies indicate that postural control
performance differs between elderly populations from different age groups<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>

<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, while other studies indicate that such
behavior is similar among elderly individuals in different age strata<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Additionally, the previous studies analyzed a
wide age range (10 years)<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. However, Hofer and Sliwinski<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> suggested that analysis of narrow age-cohort
sample may be more suitable for deriving inferences regarding the interdependence of
aging-related change. Several studies that investigated postural control described the
elderly as all individuals older than 65 years<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and did not take into account possible
differences in motor performance that could occur due to a small age difference (e.g. 5
years). Therefore, the question remains: do elderly individuals in different age strata
actually exhibit similar postural control to support their classification into a single
age group? Analysis of postural control in elderly individuals of small age ranges (5
years) and under different situations of balance maintenance could provide important
information about the behavior of the postural control system throughout the aging
process.</p><p>The biomechanical constraints associated with aging are known to exhibit a strong
correlation with the decline in postural control in the elderly<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. More specifically, elderly individuals are less able to generate
muscle strength and power, and this inability appears to increase postural instability
and the tendency to fall<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Several studies demonstrated a greater
decrease in muscle power than in muscle strength in the elderly population<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. In addition, muscle power compared to muscle
strength was shown to be a better predictor of functional ability and susceptibility to
falls in the elderly<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>.</p><p>To maintain balance after an external disturbance, a rapid generation of muscle force
(muscle power) must be performed to react quickly to threats in order to stabilize the
center of mass<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Johnson and Woollacott<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> revealed that power-trained athletes presented
more effective responses to recovery from a horizontal platform perturbation than
endurance-trained athletes. In a study by Bean et al.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, the authors identified a correlation between the muscle power produced by
the lower limbs and a set of functional tests. The results indicated a significant
correlation between the functional tests and the muscle power generated at an intensity
of 70% of one repetition maximum (1-RM)<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>.
Puthoff and Nielsen<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> identified the strongest
correlation between muscle power and clinical tests at an intensity of 90% of 1-RM<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. In a study by Orr et al.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, elderly men and women were subjected to 20 sessions of muscle
power training at different relative intensities (20%, 50%, and 80% of 1-RM), and the
results indicated that low-intensity (20% of 1-RM) power training promoted the greatest
benefit to postural balance.</p><p>The conclusions of previous studies<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> indicate correlation between muscle power and
postural balance, nevertheless there is no agreement in the literature with respect to
the relative power intensity needed to recover balance after an external disturbance.
Although several studies have demonstrated that the elderly exhibit decreased muscle
strength and power compared to young adults<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, few studies have sought to investigate
whether such abilities differ among elderly individuals in different age groups<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. In a recent study, Pedrero-Chamizo et
al.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> examined 2,412 women older than 65 years
and found that the oldest-old exhibited lower body strength compared to young-old women.
Conversely, the results of the study by El Haber et al.<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> indicated that the isometric strength of the knee extensor muscles was
similar between elderly women in the 61-70 age group and the 71-82 age groups.</p><p>These data demonstrate the scarcity of studies on the influence of age on the motor
performance of elderly women of different ages, as well as the lack of information
concerning the ability of these women to generate muscle strength and, especially,
muscle power. Such information could be useful in the elaboration of exercise programs
designed to improve muscle power at the specific intensity that best achieves the
maintenance of balance and the prevention of falls in the elderly population.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze the ability of elderly
individuals of different ages to produce muscle power at specific relative intensities
and to analyze the correlation of muscle performance with postural control. Differences
were expected to be found between the 60-64 age group and the adjacent 5-year age range
with respect to postural control and muscle power.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Eighty healthy women participated in the study. The participants were recruited from
community and were divided into four groups according to their age strata: young
group (n=20; aged 18 to 30 years), 60-64 group (n=20; aged 60 to 64 years); 65-69
group (n=20; aged 65 to 69 years); and the 70-74 group (n=20; aged 70 to 74 years).
All of the participants signed an informed consent form approved by the local ethics
committee (no. 459/2009, Research Ethics Committee of HC and Faculdade de Medicina de
Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto, Universidade de S&#x000e3;o Paulo (FMRP-USP), Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto, SP, Brazil).
The exclusion criteria included the following: bone fracture or injury in the lower
limbs in the previous six months, vestibular disorder, neuropathy, neurological
disorders or any other musculoskeletal problem affecting the participants' ability to
maintain an upright posture or to sit and rise from a chair.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><p>Data were collected at the Laboratory of Balance Assessment and Rehabilitation
(LARE). After the procedures were explained, the participants were asked to answer
three questionnaires: 1) Brazilian Multidimensional Functional Assessment
Questionnaire (BOMFAQ)<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>; 2) Modified Baecke
Questionnaire for Older Adults<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>; and 3) Falls
questionnaire, used to assess the incidence of falls, fear of falling, and the
circumstances and consequences of falls. A fall was defined as "unintentionally
coming to rest on the ground, the floor or other lower level; excludes coming to rest
against furniture, a wall or other structure"<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. The participants were considered physically active when they reported
performing at least three 30-minute sessions of physical activity per week. These
questionnaires were used to obtain better control of the sociodemographic, physical,
and functional characteristics of the elderly participants, thus were not used for
the young group.</p><p>The strength and power of the knee extensor and flexor muscles were measured using a
flexor/extensor chair. During the assessment of muscle strength and power, the back
of the chair was adjusted so that the participants were able to maintain a hip angle
of 90&#x000ba; and the equipment and knee axes coincided. The leg support was placed above
the ankle joint. The knee extension and flexion movements were performed
unilaterally, and the values obtained for the right lower limb were used for the
purpose of comparison, as the right side was the dominant side reported by 95% of the
participants.</p><p>The concentric strength of the knee extensor and flexor muscles was measured using
the 1-RM test<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. The concentric power of the
knee extensor and flexor muscles was measured at 40%, 70%, and 90% of 1-RM. The
participants were instructed to perform the knee extension or flexion movement as
fast as they were able. Power was calculated as the product of torque and angular
velocity at each instant in time. The highest power value observed (peak power) was
used to describe the muscle power generated by the knee extensors and flexors at each
investigated relative intensity. Each participant performed two attempts at each
investigated intensity, and the arithmetic mean of these two power values was used in
the statistical analysis.</p><p>The performance of the postural control system was measured using a force plate
(Synapsys Posturography System - Synapsys S/A, Marseille, France) with 100 Hz
sampling frequency. The participants stood barefoot on the platform, placing their
feet approximately 10 cm apart according to the manufacturer's instructions. Once a
trial began, the platform moved translationally in the anterior-posterior (AP) and
mediolateral (ML) directions, disrupting the participants' balance. To accomplish AP
translation, the platform moved forward at a speed of 3.0 cm/s and an amplitude of
6.0 cm; after an 8-second interval, it moved backwards at the same speed and
amplitude. To accomplish ML translation, the parameters were the same, but the
platform moved first to the right and subsequently to the left. Each attempt included
six translations and lasted a total of 51.2 seconds. Two trials were conducted for
direction (AP and ML, respectively), the first trial with the participant's eyes open
and the second trial with the participant's eyes closed, for a total of four
attempts. The performance of postural control was the time's measured elapsed between
the onset of the disturbance and the participant's recovery of balance. Balance is
recovered when the center of pressure (CoP) returns to a position between -2 and +2
millimeters from the position held prior to the onset of the balance disruption.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The Shapiro-Wilk's test for normality and the Levene test for homogeneity of variance
indicated that the variables exhibited normality and homogeneity of variance. A pilot
study was conducted to calculate the sample size. We chose the variable Recovery Time
in the AP direction with eyes open to perform the sample size calculation with the
following assumptions: &#x003b1;=0.5; &#x003b2;=0.8; 15% of maximum difference; and standard
deviation = 0.8. The sample size calculation indicated 14 subjects. To investigate
the similarity of the anthropometric and sociodemographic data, six analyses of
variance (ANOVA) were performed using the group as the factor and the age, body mass,
height, body mass index (BMI), functional ability, and physical fitness acting as the
dependent variables. To analyze muscle strength, muscle power, and postural control
performance, multivariate analyses (MANOVA) were performed.</p><p>To analyze the correlation between muscle strength and power and postural control
performance, Pearson's correlation tests were performed. Chi-square (X<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) tests were performed to compare the occurrence
of falls, fear of falling down, and practice of physical activity between groups
(60-64 vs. 65-69 vs. 70-74 age groups).</p><p>Whenever needed, univariate analyses and post hoc tests (Tukey) were used. All of the
statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software (SPSS for Windows, V16.0
- SPSS Inc., USA), and the level of significance was set at 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characteristics of groups</title><p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref> describes the age, anthropometric,

intervals in elderly women allows us to understand the impact of the aging process on
balance in the elderly, a relevant aspect considering that impaired balance increases
the risk of falls.</p><p>The results revealed that the elderly participants in the age ranges of 60-64, 65-69,
and 70-74 years exhibited similar postural control and had similar muscle performance.
The present findings contradict prior studies indicating that postural control
performance differs between elderly populations from different age groups<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>

<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

studies that show no difference among elderly individuals in different age strata<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. However, the previous studies<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> analyzed a wide range of age stratification (10
years) and the present paper focused on smaller age strata (5 years). The preceding
studies that investigated postural control generally described the elderly as all
individuals older than 65 years or termed youngest old (up to 79 years) and oldest old
(80 years and over)<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and did not take into account possible
differences in motor performance that could occur due to a small age difference (5
years). The present results indicated that a range of 5 years of age seems to be
insufficient to produce noticeable changes in the performance of the postural control
system in healthy elderly women.</p><p>The efficiency of the postural control system depends on an intricate relationship
between multiple sensory and motor components<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. Consequently, deficits in any of these
sensory-motor elements can be reflected in the postural control performance. The results
of the present study confirm the fact that elderly women exhibit motor decline, which
was evidenced by the lower muscle strength and power measured by the knee extensors and
flexors compared to the young women, thereby corroborating the results of previous
studies<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. In addition, our findings indicate that
between the ages of 60 and 74 years, the muscle performance was similar. Although the
literature indicate that sarcopenia is related to age<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, in the present age strata samples there were no differences among women
in the age ranges of 60-64, 65-69, and 70-74 years. Moreover, the findings revealed that
elderly women in the 60-64, 65-69, and 70-74 age groups exhibit similar muscle power
regardless of the intensity relative to the maximum load. Assuming that different daily
tasks (e.g. rising from a seat or walking) require production of muscle power at
different relative intensities<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, these results suggested that the elderly
women of the three investigated groups (60-64, 65-69, and 70-74 years) are similarly
adapted to meet such motor demands. These results represent a new finding within
geriatrics and gerontology research; no other study to date has specifically assessed
the relative power of the knee extensor and flexor muscles in elderly women of different
ages.</p><p>With respect to muscle strength, previous studies have demonstrated that the strength of
the lower limbs is similar among elderly women of different ages, which is confirmed by
the present study<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. It is worth stressing that, in the present
study, most (&#x0003e;70%) of the participants in the three groups of elderly women were
physically active. The practice of physical exercise might have contributed to the fact
that the women in the higher age strata (65-69 and 70-74 years) exhibited levels of
muscle strength and power similar to the ones in the lower age stratum (60-64
years)<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>.</p><p>Several studies reported that the muscle strength and power of the lower limbs correlate
with postural control performance and with functional abilities<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>

<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. The studies by Bean et al.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and Orr et al.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, for example, demonstrate that the greater the muscle power of the knee
and hip extensors, the better the postural balance. Therefore, because the elderly women
of the three investigated groups (60-64, 65-69, and 70-74 years old) exhibited the same
ability to generate muscle power, one might expect these groups to exhibit similarities
in postural control performance.</p><p>By means of Pearson's correlation, the present study indicated that the muscle strength
of the knee extensors and flexors and the muscle power of the knee extensor correlated
with the postural control performance. With respect to the relative intensity in which
power was generated (40%, 70%, and 90% of 1-RM), the power of the knee extensors at
moderate (70% of 1-RM) and high (90% of 1-RM) intensity were correlated with balance
maintenance. Similar to the findings by Bean et al.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, our results indicate that the power generated at a moderate relative
intensity (70% of 1-RM) correlates better with balance compared to power generated at a
low (40% of 1-RM) relative intensity. These results suggested that professionals should
increase progressively the load in order to reach the muscle power necessary to recover
to external postural disturbances.</p><p>Although the present study demonstrated that the muscle strength and power of the knee
extensors and flexors correlated with the postural control performance of elderly women
and thus corroborated previous studies<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, such correlation must be interpreted
carefully because the values of the correlation coefficient were low (lower than 0.35).
In a thorough literature review, Orr<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> found that
the evidence for the correlation between muscle strength and power and postural balance
is still limited, suggesting that many intrinsic and still unknown factors might be
associated with variations in postural balance<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>.</p><p>These intrinsic factors may be related to anthropometric characteristics,
sociodemographic conditions, lifestyles, functional abilities, physical fitness, and
history of falls<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. The present study found that the elderly
women in different age groups exhibited similar functional abilities and levels of
physical fitness. In addition, the number of women who reported falls or fears of
falling and who were physically active was similar in all three investigated groups.
However, other intrinsic aspects such as timing of muscle contraction, sequence of
muscle activation, and intersegment coordination were not evaluated. Furthermore, it is
important to emphasize that the elderly included in this study were healthy and active,
but other variables such as comorbidities are playing an important role in normal
aging.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that elderly individuals in the age range
of 60-74 years exhibited similar postural control muscle performance. Moreover, our
results indicate that the power of the knee extensors at moderate (70% of 1-RM) and high
(90% of 1-RM) intensity were correlated with balance maintenance. These results
suggested that professionals should increase progressively the load in order to reach
the muscle power necessary to recover to external postural disturbances.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado de S&#x000e3;o Paulo (FAPESP), S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP,
