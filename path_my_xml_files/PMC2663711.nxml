Patients continued to receive adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every other week for up to 144 weeks of total adalimumab exposure. The first adalimumab exposure occurred at the start of the double-blind lead-in study for patients randomly assigned to receive adalimumab in ADEPT and at the start of the open-label extension study for patients randomly assigned to receive placebo in ADEPT. Patients who received placebo during the lead-in study thus had a duration of adalimumab exposure that was 24 weeks less than patients who received adalimumab during the lead-in study. After 12 weeks in the extension study, patients who did not have a 20% or greater improvement compared with baseline in the tender joint count and the swollen joint count were allowed to increase the adalimumab dosage to 40 mg a week. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), prednisone, and/or DMARD could not be initiated during the extension study but were continued for patients who were receiving these medications at the start of the extension study; tapering of any concomitant medications for the treatment of PsA was allowed after 6 weeks of treatment.</p><p>Descriptions of the clinical efficacy, radiographic efficacy and safety assessments during the open-label extension study were published previously,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> as were HRQOL measures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>For all analyses, the efficacy and safety populations comprise all patients (N &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; 298) who received any dosage of adalimumab in the double-blind portion of ADEPT or in the open-label extension study. Clinical efficacy and safety measures at all time points were analysed and are reported based on the duration of adalimumab exposure, with the exception of radiographic data, which was analysed and is reported from the baseline of ADEPT. For radiographic data, results were analysed and are reported for 144 weeks (&#x0223c;2.75 years) of adalimumab exposure. For patients without a week 144 modified total Sharp score (mTSS), the week 96 mTSS was used to impute the week 144 score. For all other data (eg, clinical assessments of joint and skin disease, HRQOL assessments), results are reported for 104 weeks (2 years) of adalimumab exposure based on available data at the time of this analysis. Only patients with at least 3% body surface area involvement at enrollment in ADEPT were included in the analyses of psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) and dermatology life quality index (DLQI). All data are last observation carried forward (LOCF) unless otherwise noted. For patients whose adalimumab dosage was increased from 40 mg every other week to 40 mg a week, the last observation before dosage increase was carried forward when analysing American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20%, 50% and 70% improvement score responses; PASI 50, PASI 75, PASI 90 and PASI 100 responses; psoriatic arthritis response criteria (PsARC) and the physician&#x02019;s global assessment of psoriasis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study population</title><p>The baseline characteristics of patients who continued adalimumab treatment in the open-label extension study were similar to those of the 313 patients who enrolled in ADEPT.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> In ADEPT, the overall population of treated patients (151 in the adalimumab group and 162 in the placebo group) had mean (SD) baseline scores of 25 (SD 18) for tender joint count, 14 (SD 12) for swollen joint count, 1.0 (SD 6) for health assessment questionnaire disability index (HAQ DI) and 20.8 (SD 40.9) for mTSS.

These differences in mean changes in mTSS from week 48 to week 144 in the two treatment groups suggest that patients treated continuously with adalimumab had less progression of joint damage compared with patients who switched from placebo to adalimumab treatment after week 24.

For the greater progression exhibited in the adalimumab-treated progressor group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ard-68-05-0702-t02">table 2</xref>), it is important to note that the number of patients in this subgroup was small (n &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; 12), and these patients had much more aggressive, erosive disease at baseline (mean mTSS 74.9 (SD 96.4)) compared with the adalimumab-treated non-progressor group (16.1 (SD 31.9); p&#x0003c;0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in any other baseline demographic or clinical characteristics between the adalimumab-treated progressors and non-progressors.

The ADEPT 24-week results established that adalimumab was more efficacious than placebo in treating arthritis and skin disease and inhibiting radiographic progression in PsA, and significantly improved physical function and HRQOL while being well tolerated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> Patients completing ADEPT could enroll in an open-label extension trial, during which they received 40 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week for up to a total of 144 weeks. Interim results from the open-label extension study demonstrated that clinical efficacy, inhibition of radiographic progression and a favourable risk&#x02013;benefit profile of adalimumab were maintained throughout 48 weeks of treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> The analyses reported here establish the clinical efficacy of adalimumab for at least 2 years of treatment and the inhibition of structural progression of PsA for at least 2.75 years of treatment. The favourable risk&#x02013;benefit profile of adalimumab was also sustained during long-term treatment of patients with PsA and is consistent with that of other TNF antagonists.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref></p><p>The inhibition of joint damage previously demonstrated throughout 48 weeks of adalimumab treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> was sustained for 144 weeks of treatment. Among patients originally randomly assigned to receive adalimumab in ADEPT who had no radiographic progression of structural disease at week 48, 84.3% continued without progression to week 144. Patients who switched to adalimumab treatment after 24 weeks of placebo demonstrated inhibition of radiographic progression, as measured by a mean mTSS that was comparable in magnitude to the inhibition of radiographic progression measured in patients who were treated continuously with adalimumab. In addition, placebo-treated patients who had radiographic progression to week 24 of ADEPT had inhibition of progression after switching to adalimumab. These results suggest that treatment delays may contribute to the progression of structural damage in patients with PsA.</p><p>Further analysis of patients with and without radiographic progression from baseline to week 24 of ADEPT demonstrated that the mean increase in mTSS to week 144 for patients originally randomly assigned to receive adalimumab was attributable to those patients who had radiographically defined progression of structural damage from baseline to weeks 24 and 48. This finding suggests that there may be a small subgroup of patients who do not respond to adalimumab despite continued treatment. Additional analyses (data not shown) indicated that there were no clinical responses to adalimumab treatment that correlated with radiographic progression versus non-progression. The 12 adalimumab-treated patients who had radiographic progression during the first 24 weeks of ADEPT continued in the open-label extension to week 144, suggesting a clinical benefit of adalimumab despite structural disease progression.</p><p>In addition to inhibiting radiographic progression in patients with PsA, adalimumab resulted in sustained improvement of joint and skin-related symptoms throughout 2 years of treatment. Improvements in PsARC, dactylitis and enthesitis were maintained between week 48 and week 104. The percentage of patients achieving ACR20 was sustained and the percentages of patients achieving ACR50 and ACR70 increased slightly in 2 years of adalimumab treatment. Improvements in PASI that were seen at week 48 were constant to week 104. Approximately one in five patients achieved and sustained PASI 100 during long-term adalimumab treatment, indicating full clearance of skin signs of psoriasis. This magnitude of improvement in skin disease has not been demonstrated with the use of other TNF antagonists during long-term treatment of PsA. Of the various clinical responses, PASI 50 was found to be a sensitive indicator of reduced radiographic progression in patients with PsA treated with adalimumab for 24 weeks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> Although the trend was still present after 2 years of adalimumab treatment, the correlation between PASI 50 response and reduced radiographic progression was no longer statistically significant. These sustained improvements in joint and skin-related symptoms probably contributed to HRQOL improvements that were maintained throughout 2 years of adalimumab treatment. DLQI scores of 0 to 1 indicate that skin disease has no effect on a patient&#x02019;s quality of life,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and DLQI scores of 0 or 1 were achieved by approximately 60% of patients during long-term adalimumab treatment.</p><p>The safety profile of adalimumab during long-term treatment of PsA was consistent with the safety profile during short-term treatment. There were no clinically meaningful changes in the type and frequency of adverse events compared with 24 or 48 weeks of adalimumab treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> With the exception of a marked decrease in mean C-reactive protein concentrations (a known marker for clinical improvement), changes in laboratory values from weeks 48 to 104 were not clinically significant. There was no indication of an increase in TNF-associated adverse events, including serious infections such as tuberculosis, or in malignancies, demyelination, congestive heart failure and lupus-like syndrome.</p><p>The safety profile of adalimumab demonstrated throughout 2 years of exposure in patients with PsA was consistent with that reported for more than 10 000 patients in RA clinical trials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> and also with the safety profile of the adalimumab postmarketing safety database.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref></p><p>The short-term clinical benefits of adalimumab therapy in patients with PsA are maintained over 2 years of treatment and the ability of adalimumab to inhibit structural progression of the disease is maintained over 2.75 years of treatment. Compared with short-term adalimumab treatment, there were no additional safety concerns during long-term treatment. Overall, adalimumab presents a favourable risk&#x02013;benefit profile in patients with PsA.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the assistance of Marilyn Collicott and Carol Feige for study logistics, Michele Olds for statistical support and Jennifer Dinelli for data management (all of Abbott Laboratories).
