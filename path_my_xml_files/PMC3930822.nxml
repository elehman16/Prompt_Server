Many different uses and properties have been attributed to this plant, mainly as a nutritional supplement and as a water purifier. Its antibacterial activity against different pathogens has been described in different <italic>in vitro</italic> settings. However the potential effect of this plant leaf as a hand washing product has never been studied. The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of this product using an <italic>in vivo</italic> design with healthy volunteers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The hands of fifteen volunteers were artificially contaminated with <italic>Escherichia coli. Moringa oleifera</italic> leaf powder was tested as a hand washing product and was compared with reference non-medicated liquid soap using a cross over design following an adaptation of the European Committee for Standardization protocol (EN 1499). In a second part of tests, the efficacy of the established amount of <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> leaf powder was compared with an inert powder using the same protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Application of 2 and 3&#x000a0;g of dried <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> leaf powder (mean log<sub>10</sub>-reduction: 2.44&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.41 and 2.58&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.34, respectively) was significantly less effective than the reference soap (3.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.27 and 2.99&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.26, respectively; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Application of the same amounts of <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> (2 and 3&#x000a0;g) but using a wet preparation, was also significantly less effective than reference soap (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.003 and p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.02, respectively).

Most of all diarrhoeal deaths of children under five years are in Africa and South East Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The vast majority of diarrheal diseases are caused by bacteria, viruses and protozoa, mainly found in human faeces which are spread from the stool of one person to the mouth of another. Hands can act as a vector for transmission of faecal pathogens, either via direct person-to-person transmission or by contaminating food that is later consumed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Hand washing after defecation and before handling food is therefore a biologically plausible mechanism for interrupting pathogen transmission. Hands are also transmission vectors for respiratory infections, and interventions promoting hand hygiene have been shown to reduce gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses by an average of 31% and 21%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p><italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> is a plant that can grow to 5&#x02013;10 meters in a year and it is cultivated in many countries from South Asia to West and East Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). While it grows best in dry, sandy soil, it tolerates poor soil, including coastal areas. It is a fast-growing, drought-resistant tree that is native to the southern foothills of the Himalayas in northwestern India. Over the past two decades, many reports have appeared in mainstream scientific journals describing the nutritional and medicinal properties of <italic>Moringa oleifera,</italic> including treatment for malaria and intestinal worms, antifungal properties, malnutrition and also as a water purifier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>

This procedure is based on the &#x0201c;post-contamination treatment&#x0201d; of hands, and involves the placement of the test organism (<italic>Escherichia coli (ACTC 25922)</italic>) on the hands of test subjects followed by exposure to the test formulation. These methods are useful in testing the performance of products used in routine hand hygiene in health care centres.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The study was performed in the Medical Microbiology Laboratory of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) from June to July 2012, and was approved by LSHTM Ethics Committee on 19th April 2012.</p><p>Fifteen adult volunteers from LSHTM were selected for the study, and a formal written consent was received from all of them. The volunteers were physically examined to ensure they were healthy with healthy skin. None had skin disorders like eczema, paronychia, scabies, abrasions, lacerations or skin allergy. They all had short fingernails with no artificial nails. They had no history of drug allergy and had not taken any systemic antibiotic in the two weeks prior to the study, which could otherwise impair the efficacy of the product being tested. All forms of jewellery were removed from their hands prior to hand washing, since it had the potential of retaining some bacteria, which could affect the recovery pre and post values.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Moringa oleifeira</italic> preparations</title><p><italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> leaf powder (100% natural) was obtained from LUTOR Ltd.

A dose of 4&#x000a0;g of <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> in wet or dried formulation presented the same efficacy as non-medicated soap.</p><p>Different studies have shown an <italic>in vitro</italic> antibacterial effect from <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> against different bacteria. Peixoto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] evaluated the antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethanolic <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> leaf extracts on the growth of gram-positive and negative bacteria, and they found that some strains of <italic>E. coli, P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. Enteritidis</italic> were resistant to all the <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> preparations but the same extracts were most effective against <italic>S.aureus</italic>, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and <italic>A. caviae</italic>. Other authors found that aqueous and ethanolic <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> leaf extracts were effective against <italic>Salmonella</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]<italic>.</italic> The authors attributed the antibacterial effect to the presence of saponins, tannic, phenolic and alkaloid phytoconstituents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> leaves had been found in other studies to present an important amount of saponins (80&#x000a0;g/kg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Saponins are chemical compounds which have detergent or surfactant properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and this may explain the bacterial reduction when using <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> as a hand washing product.</p><p>In this study we also showed a dose&#x02013;response reduction effect of <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic>, with a dose of 4&#x000a0;g associated with a greater bacterial reduction, comparable with the efficacy of non-medicated soap. These results suggest that when using <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic>, the hands have to be completely full of the powder in order to have the best results. The use of a wet preparation also presented better results than when dried powder was used. This could be explained by the water&#x02019;s effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] in extracting more of the active component of the plant at the moment of hand cleansing. Water is a universal solvent, and other many studies have described its ability to extract plant products with antimicrobial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus the solvents most commonly used for preliminary investigations of antimicrobial activity in plants are methanol, ethanol and water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Different studies have found that mechanical friction applied during hand washing plays a role in removing microorganisms adhering to hands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore we tested whether the effect of <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> leaf powder could be due only to the mechanical friction exerted when rubbing the hands together. For this purpose we compared the effect of 4&#x000a0;g of <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> leaf powder with inert calcium sulphate powder, and observed that although calcium sulphate could reduce bacterial load on hands, the reduction was significantly smaller than obtained using 4&#x000a0;g of <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> or non-medicated soap. These results suggest that <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> has an extra effect due to its active components that cannot be attributed only to the mechanical action of rubbing hands together.</p><p>Many regulatory agencies require hand-wash (except for non-medicated soap) and hand-rub agents used in health care settings to meet certain performance standards when assessed using standardized test protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In Europe, the most commonly used laboratory based <italic>in vivo</italic> methods to test antiseptics are those of the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. EN 1499 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and EN 1500 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] belong to the category of CEN tests designed to evaluate the ability (of hand-wash or hand-rub agents, respectively) to eliminate transient pathogens from health care workers&#x02019; hands. This study followed an adaptation of protocol EN1499 which is designed to test the antimicrobial activity of hand wash agents. According to EN 1449, the mean reduction caused by the test product in the number of viable bacteria has to be significantly higher than that obtained with the reference soap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. 4&#x000a0;g of dried or wet <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> did not pass this criterion, but it met the EN1500 requirement for a hand-rubbing agent, which said that the mean reduction in the numbers of viable bacteria shall not be significantly inferior to that with the reference product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It can be argued that this product could also meet other standards used in different parts of the world. For example, in USA and Canada such formulations are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Health Canada, respectively which refer to the standards of ASTM International [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Thus, a formulation may meet one criterion, but not another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. For example, in a study by Kramer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], various alcohol-based hand-rub gels accepted by ASTM standards failed to pass the European standards. At present, it remains unknown which requirement is the right one or what reduction in microbial release is needed to produce a meaningful reduction in the hand-borne spread of pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In this study we have demonstrated that 4&#x000a0;g of <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> powder has the same effect as non-medicated soap, as both can significantly reduce bacteria counts in artificially contaminated hands. However we suggest this product is more suitable for domestic settings, rather than healthcare settings, where other products have already been demonstrated to be effective and available, and where the use of this powder would be less convenient.</p><p>The challenges of using this product in a domestic setting should be explored. How would users accept using a dried plant to clean their hands? How could the material be made available in specific domestic points where hand hygiene takes place? One possibility would be to place baskets with dried <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> powder and spoons to dispense it, close to crucial places for hand hygiene, for example next to the cooking place and the latrine.</p><p>In this study we have demonstrated the effect of dried <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> leaves in reducing bacteria on hands. It would be very interesting to test the bacterial reduction effect of fresh leaves. The possibility of using fresh leaves could facilitate its use as preparation process would not be necessary, opening up new avenues for its use, for example in open defecation places where Moringa trees are available.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Four grams of <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> powder in dried and wet application had the same effect as non-medicated soap when used for hand washing. <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> could be very useful in places where soap or water is not available, and where this tree grows naturally. It could also be a cheap and healthy hand-washing optional product. Our data have been obtained in a laboratory setting, so the next step will be to try this product in real conditions and study its acceptability and convenience for potential users. <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> formulations should be investigated further in randomized controlled trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>Idea for the research question: SC, BB, BT.
