Proven treatments for CPP are limited and unsatisfactory. The meridian balance method (BM) electroacupuncture (EA) treatment (BMEA + Traditional Chinese Medicine Health Consultation (TCM HC) may be effective for CPP. Previous EA studies have demonstrated an analgesic effect. Large-scale studies on acupuncture for other chronic pain conditions suggest that patient-healthcare provider interaction might play a role in pain reduction. We propose a pilot study to explore the effectiveness of the meridian BMEA treatment in managing women with CPP to inform a future large randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A 3-armed randomised controlled pilot study is proposed with an aim to recruit 30 women with CPP in National Health Service (NHS) Lothian. Randomisation will be to BMEA treatment, TCM HC or standard care (SC). Validated pain, physical and emotional functioning questionnaires will be administered to all participants at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12. Focus group discussions will be conducted when week 12 questionnaires are completed. The primary objective is to determine, recruitment and retention rates. The secondary objectives are to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of the proposed methods of recruitment, randomisation, interventions and assessment tools.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval has been obtained from the Scotland Research Ethics Committee (REC 14/SS/1022).

Although there have been no studies to show that EA enhances the analgesic effect of the meridian BM acupuncture, it is, however, the method of choice for several reasons. Evidence from animal and human studies showed that both MA and EA produce analgesic effect.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> EA appears to be more effective than MA in some painful conditions. To obtain an analgesic effect in EA, the optimum time for the needle stimulation is 20&#x02013;30&#x02005;min with the frequencies set at 2 and 100&#x02005;Hz.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Based on these parameters, it is impractical to be manipulating the acupuncture needles manually for 20&#x02013;30&#x02005;min and also be consistent. With EA one can set both parameters precisely at every treatment. EA may be measured objectively and is easier to control and standardise than MA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>The context and context effects</title><p>There is mounting evidence that acupuncture treatments for chronic pain, such as low back pain,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> shoulder and neck pain,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> are effective. However, a recent individual patient data meta-analysis on the use of acupuncture for chronic pain conditions found a small, statistically significant effect size when compared with sham acupuncture. The effect size was larger and statistically significant when compared with usual care controls.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This would suggest that as well as the specific needling effects, other factors within the context of the acupuncture treatment play a role in reducing pain, such as the characteristics of the healthcare providers and patients, for example, their beliefs and expectations; the provider&#x02013;patient interactions as well as how the treatment is administered.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The effects that result from the complex interactions of such characteristics are known as the context effect.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> This effect was demonstrated in a study of pain management in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, showing that an enhanced provider&#x02013;patient relationship could help alleviate pain. Patients were randomised on to a waiting list (no placebo or interaction with healthcare provider), therapeutic ritual (placebo sham acupuncture with limited interaction) or a supportive relationship (placebo sham acupuncture with enhanced relationship). The supportive relationship produced the most adequate relief of symptoms and enhanced quality of life.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>The proposed pilot study will compare the specific effects of the meridian balanced method (BM) EA needling + the context effects of a Traditional Chinese Medicine Health Consultation (+BMEA+TCM HC), with context effects of a TCM HC (patient&#x02013;healthcare provider interaction) and standard care (SC).

In order not to bias the group discussions, the PI (OTC) who provides the interventions will not be conducting the focus groups.

For example, the PI might notice changes in facial colour or expression when a participant describes how the CPP impacted her life; or a participant who started a treatment intervention apparently agitated but who is looking calmer at the close of the session. Such data can add scope and depth as well as illuminate the different aspects of the interventions and the patient&#x02013;healthcare provider interactions that might not be captured otherwise.

We anticipate potential difficulties in a large RCT in acupuncture for chronic pain, and therefore we have designed this pilot study to evaluate its feasibility.</p><p>Both MA<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and EA<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> are safe when performed by appropriately trained acupuncturists. However, because of some theoretical safety concerns, we have erred on the side of caution to exclude, for example, patients who have a history of seizures or have an implanted pace maker.</p><p>According to Chinese medicine theory, pain results from blocked meridians leading to an imbalance in the system. On the surface of the body is a network of 12 meridians (6 yin and 6 yang) that connect acupuncture points together.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Theoretically, these meridians act as a conduit between the surface of the body and the internal organs. The meridian BM acupuncture treats pain by balancing these meridians, for example, using a &#x02018;healthy&#x02019; yin meridian to balance a &#x02018;blocked&#x02019; yang meridians.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, there are considerable skepticisms and controversies surrounding these theories and the existence as physical entities of acupuncture points and the meridian system. Despite efforts to understand these systems, there are continued disagreements as to what they constitute.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Indeed, the PI (OTC) argues that it is more useful to view these systems as a conceptual framework that guides the clinical practice of acupuncture, rather than to argue if they exist. Tangentially related to this view is work undertaken by Langevin <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> whereby it is hypothesised that acupuncture points and meridians have correspondence to the connective tissue and not as illustrated in Chinese medicine text.</p><p>A survey of the literature indicates that this is the first study to investigate the effectiveness of the meridian BMEA treatment for CPP in women using a mixed-methods approach. The mixed-methods approach utilises validated questionnaires and focus group discussions, field notes and a reflexive diary. Undertaking a mixed-methods approach is one of the strengths of the study because we are examining the feasibility of studying a complex intervention, which involves a number of phenomena, which include: TCM health consult, EA and the context effect. Alongside an understanding of participants&#x02019; perceived benefits or otherwise of the interventions, this methodology will also help us to understand the role of the researcher in the study intervention. The focus group discussions will capture participants&#x02019; subjective experiences of the study intervention.</p><p>It is generally considered that the gold standard in effectiveness of RCTs is the use of a placebo control for the study intervention. However, our pilot study does not employ a placebo (sham acupuncture treatment) for several reasons. A considerable body of evidence from large-scale effectiveness studies has demonstrated that sham acupuncture treatments as controls are problematic. For some chronic pain conditions, the observed effects of acupuncture treatments are larger in usual care controls when compared with sham controls. This might suggest that sham acupuncture treatments have physiological effects, and are thus not inert. Past sham controlled studies have employed techniques such as shallow needling, and needling with a retractable needle or toothpick.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Such techniques create a sensation not dissimilar to light touch which has some data to show that it has physiological effects.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> It is also conceivable and probable that shallow needling and needling with a retractable needle elicit similar physiological effects as deep needling. These sham acupuncture techniques are therefore inappropriate. We feel that until better sham techniques are available, it is prudent to design a study that does not employ a placebo control.</p><p>Context effects such as expectancy<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> treatment rituals<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> or patient&#x02013;provider interactions<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> have been shown to have an impact on the experience of pain. These may have confounded past studies and might explain the small effect sizes when sham acupuncture treatments were compared with true acupuncture treatments. Attempting to separate the context effects of acupuncture treatment from the specific effects of acupuncture needling presents a major challenge in this area of research. In response, we have designed a three arm RCT to address these challenges. The first arm includes acupuncture needling, electro-stimulation (specific effects of needling) and the patient&#x02013;healthcare provider interactions (context effects) via a TCM consult (TCM HC). Group 2, (participants receive only TCM HC) controls for the patient&#x02013;healthcare provider interactions (context effect). Participants in group 3 (SC) will receive the standard NHS care for CPP. Having these two control groups is likely to yield the true effect size of the specific effect of EA needling and the non-specific (context effect) of the patient&#x02013;healthcare provider interactions. We acknowledge that this pilot study is investigating only one aspect of the several context effects of acupuncture treatment. However, we believe that understanding the clinical outcome of the patient&#x02013;healthcare provider relationship will create a critical mass of literature to influence the education of future generations of healthcare professionals. The UK SIGN 136 guideline for the management of chronic pain acknowledged that while preliminary data showed that the nature of such a relationship could influence clinical outcome, there are not enough high-quality studies to recommend widespread training.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> (Management of chronic pain.

Available from URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sign.ac.uk">http://www.sign.ac.uk</ext-link>; accessed March 2015.)</p><p>In assessing the outcome of the interventions, we have chosen validated assessment tools rather than using TCM outcome measures. This is because there are no standardised or validated TCM outcome measures. Arguably, better known validated questionnaires might be more meaningful within a biomedical setting than TCM outcome measures.</p><p>In conclusion, our pilot study protocol will enable us to determine the retention and recruitment rate as well as the patients&#x02019; experience of the study intervention. It will help us gain better insight into the impact of meridian BMEA needling and the patient&#x02013;practitioner relationship on CPP in women.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> OTC; HODC, AWH and MF were involved in research, contribution of original material, editing and approval of final manuscript.
