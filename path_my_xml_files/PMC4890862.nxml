Data on 164 <italic>Preparing for Life</italic> participants who were randomly assigned into an intervention group, involving home visits from pregnancy onwards, or a control group, was used to test the impact of the intervention on Child Behavior Checklist scores at 24-months. Using inverse probability weighting to account for differential attrition, permutation testing to address small sample size, and quantile regression to characterize the distributional impact of the intervention, we found that the few treatment effects were largely concentrated among boys most at risk of developing emotional and behavioral problems. The average treatment effect identified a 13% reduction in the likelihood of falling into the borderline clinical threshold for Total Problems. The interaction and subgroup analysis found that this main effect was driven by boys. The distributional analysis identified a 10-point reduction in the Externalizing Problems score for boys at the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile. No effects were observed for girls or for the continuous measures of Total, Internalizing, and Externalizing problems. These findings suggest that the impact of this prenatally commencing home visiting program may be limited to boys experiencing the most difficulties. Further adoption of the statistical methods applied here may help to improve the internal validity of randomized controlled trials and contribute to the field of evaluation science more generally.</p><p><bold><italic>Trial Registration</italic>:</bold> ISRCTN Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN04631728">ISRCTN04631728</ext-link></p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Northside Partnership</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Doyle</surname><given-names>Orla</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The trial was funded by the Northside Partnership (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://northsidepartnership.ie/">http://northsidepartnership.ie/</ext-link>) through the Irish government's Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Atlantic Philanthropies.

Although early emotional and behavioral difficulties are transient for some children, for others early distress persists and can represent clinically significant disturbances [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While predictions of later severe problems can be made from observational measures at age 3 [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], accumulating evidence now suggests that mental health problems may emerge from infancy and the time around children&#x02019;s second birthday may be a key point of identification [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Compromised socio-emotional skills may affect children&#x02019;s ability to experience, manage, and express emotion, form close and secure relationships, and explore and learn from their environments [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Left unattended, frequent and severe difficulties may be associated with poorer outcomes in adolescence and adulthood including later psychopathology, increased delinquency, relationship instability, unemployment, and lower income [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156397.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Preventing early emotional and behavioral difficulties requires a clear understanding of their causes, which can include genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Environmental risks such as chronic poverty [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], abuse or neglect [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and parental mental health difficulties [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] may undermine parents&#x02019; ability to provide children with sensitive and stimulating relationships and environments. Consequently, the quality of parenting is a key mechanism in the development of internalizing and externalizing difficulties [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Early intervention programs which address these risks have been proposed as a means of promoting emotional and behavioral wellbeing [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Such interventions have been shown to reap benefits across the lifecourse and across multiple outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Given the complexity of factors influencing emotional and behavioral development, adopting a holistic approach to early intervention that targets multiple risk factors may be especially beneficial. In particular, preventative programs which commence antenatally may help to avoid stigmatizion which can arise in later intervention programs.</p><p>Home visiting is one form of early intervention which may improve children&#x02019;s emotional and behavioral health by adopting a preventative and holistic approach. Home visiting is a service delivery strategy shared by programs which otherwise can vary significantly in terms of the type of families served (universal or targeted), the age of the child (pregnancy, birth, or later), service delivery staff (professional or paraprofessional), goals and outcomes (e.g., birth outcomes, immunization, accidents and hospitalization, child maltreatment, parenting practices, and children&#x02019;s physical, socioemotional, and cognitive development) and program content, intensity and duration. Common to all home visiting programs (HVP), however, is the belief that parents mediate outcomes for their children&#x02019;s health and development. Often rooted in Attachment [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], Social Learning [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Ecological [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] theories, the HVP model prioritizes the provision of warm, sensitive and consistent interactions and positive behavior management, which has been implicated in the development of positive behavior [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, shared HVP goals often include enhancing the sensitivity and quality of parenting, promoting parents&#x02019; knowledge of child health and development, and enriching parents&#x02019; abilities to provide stimulating learning environments. Some HVPs also seek to improve families&#x02019; self-sufficiency and reduce the risk for neglect and abuse.</p><p>Families are typically supported in reaching these goals through home visits delivered by trained home visitors on a regular basis. Home visitors&#x02019; training and roles can also vary, although they are often involved in educating families on child health and development, coaching and modelling positive parenting practices, providing emotional and social support, and improving access to community services [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For excellent reviews and detailed information on individual HVPs see [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Deriving reliable inferences about the impact of HVPs on children&#x02019;s emotional and behavioral development is complicated by considerable variability in study findings. A systematic review of HVPs identified some significant positive effects for problem behaviors; yet this finding was based on only three studies [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moreover, a Cochrane review reported that there is insufficient high-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence on the effectiveness of HVPs on children&#x02019;s socio-emotional functioning [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>A number of individual HVPs that meet the strict HomeVee criteria (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://homvee.acf.hhs.gov/Default.aspx">http://homvee.acf.hhs.gov/Default.aspx</ext-link>) identify no impact on emotional and behavioral development at ages 2, 3 or 4 e.g. Nurse Family Partnership [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], Early Head Start [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], Family Check-up [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], Comprehensive Child Development Program [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and Born to Learn [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, there are some exceptions. A Healthy Families Alaska evaluation found a reduction in internalizing and externalizing difficulties as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] at age 2 [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. An Early Head Start study also reported a treatment effect for internalizing and total behavior problems, but not for externalizing problems, at age 3 [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A number of studies of the Family Check Up program also found treatment effects for change and emergence of behavior problems between ages 2 and 4 [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The limited impact of HVPs on child behavior during toddlerhood, the endpoint for many HVP interventions, does not necessarily imply program ineffectiveness, indeed some HVPs which did not identify effects in toddlerhood, saw the emergence of significant differences in middle childhood [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and adolescence [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Critically, comparisons across evaluations of different programs (and amongst different evaluations of the same program model) are complicated by issues of variation with respect to the target group, program context, staff, dosage, service user engagement, program flexibility, and fidelity [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Methodological discrepancies across studies may also explain the lack of consensus regarding the effectiveness of HVPs on emotional and behavioral problems. There are three issues to consider. First, while some experimental HVP studies benefit from large samples [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156397.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], others are constrained by small sample sizes yet utilize large sample test statistics, such as <italic>t</italic> and <italic>F</italic> tests [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156397.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156397.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. These methods may result in biased estimates if the outcome data are skewed. Second, attrition is common in longitudinal trials, and while some HVP studies test for differential attrition [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156397.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], few adequately account for its effect on treatment outcomes. Third, most HVP studies estimate the average treatment effect, yet such methods may conceal effects that occur at specific intervals of the outcome distribution. Techniques such as quantile regressions, which can test whether HVPs are more or less effective for children with different levels of emotional and behavioral difficulties, are commonly used in economics, yet are infrequently applied in developmental science [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>The aims of the present study were twofold. First, to investigate the impact of <italic>Preparing for Life</italic> (<italic>PFL</italic>), a community-based HVP in Ireland, on children&#x02019;s emotional and behavioral development at 24&#x02013;months using a RCT design. <italic>PFL</italic> is a 5-year program that aims to improve children&#x02019;s health and development in disadvantaged communities. The ultimate goal of the program is to improve children&#x02019;s school readiness skills at age 4/5 by intervening during pregnancy and working with families until the children start school. The program adopts a holistic view of school readiness in accordance with best practice which identifies 5 domains of importance&#x02014;physical health and well-being, socio-emotional development, approaches to learning, language development and emergent literacy, and cognition. The present study examines the evolving impact of the program on one of these domains&#x02014;socio-emotional development.</p><p>The second aim of this study is to address recent calls for developmental scientists to subject their findings to rigorous estimation techniques that are robust to alternative specifications [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Specifically, this study utilized methods to counteract some common issues in experimental design which can limit internal validity. The robustness of results derived using traditional methods were tested using an analytic strategy involving inverse probability weighting to address the issue of differential attrition [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and permutation-based hypothesis testing to estimate treatment effects with small sample data [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which is particularly pertinent when conducting subgroup analysis [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Quantile regressions were also used to supplement the average treatment effect approach and to characterize the distributional impact of the intervention. Despite identified gender differences in the emergence of problem behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], few studies have investigated the effectiveness of intervention programs by gender. Thus, an interaction and subgroup analysis was also conducted to address calls by Webster-Stratton [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] to &#x0201c;&#x02026;determine whether there are different behavioral symptoms, developmental pathways, etiological factors, and treatment outcomes for girls and boys&#x0201d; (p. 541).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study reports on baseline and 24&#x02013;month data collected in the first RCT of the <italic>PFL</italic> program. The trial was registered with the ISRCTN register, (unique identifier ISRCTN04631728&#x02014;The evaluation of the <italic>Preparing For Life</italic> early childhood intervention programme, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN04631728">http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN04631728</ext-link>). The trial was registered post-recruitment rather than prospectively as the trial developers were not aware of this requirement for community-based behavioral interventions at the time the trial began in 2008. All study procedures were approved by the UCD Human Research Ethics Committee, the Rotunda Hospital Ethics Committee, and the National Maternity Hospital Ethics Committee and was conducted and reported in conformity with CONSORT guidelines (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156397.s004">S1 Text</xref>: CONSORT Checklist). All participants gave written informed consent before randomization. Information on the design of the trial has been published elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] (also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156397.s005">S2 Text</xref>: Study Protocol).</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Recruitment</title><p>The study enrolled pregnant women from one community in Dublin, Ireland which is classified by the welfare authorities as disadvantaged. The community is characterized by above national average rates of unemployment, school dropout, lone parent households, and public housing. The inclusion criteria included all pregnant women living in the catchment area during the recruitment period, regardless of parity. There were no exclusion criteria. This within-community universal approach was adopted to avoid the stigmatization which may arise in programs with highly selective inclusion criteria. Participation was voluntary and recruitment took place between the 29<sup>th</sup> of January 2008 and the 4<sup>th</sup> of August 2010 through two maternity hospitals and in the community. Recruitment and randomization were conducted by the <italic>PFL</italic> recruitment officer.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The sample size was calculated based on a small effect size (ES, standardized difference between group means) for child school readiness skills as identified by a previous meta-analytic study of home visiting programs [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Specifically, a mean difference between the intervention and control groups of between 2 and 5 points (depending on the study included in the meta-analysis) on cognitive development scores (average standardized ES = 0.184) was expected. Given this effect size, in order to power the study at the 80% level, based on an alpha level of .05 using a two-tailed t-test, a sample size of approximately 117 families per study arm was required.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Randomization</title><p>An unconditional probability randomization procedure was applied and no stratification or block techniques were used. In total, 233 participants were recruited and 115 were assigned to the intervention group and 118 to the control group. To ensure randomization was not compromised, the computerized procedure generated an automatic email which was sent to the <italic>PFL</italic> program manager and the principal investigator and included the participant&#x02019;s assignment condition and identification code. Attempts to reassign participants would trigger a second email highlighting any intentional subversion of the randomization process. The population based recruitment rate was 52% based on the number of live births in the community during the recruitment window. A further 22% of eligible participants were not contactable and a further 26% met the <italic>PFL</italic> recruiter or made contact but did not join the program. To identify whether there were systematic differences between eligible participants and eligible non-participants, a socio-demographic profile survey was conducted with a sample of eligible non-participants (n = 102) when their children were 4 years old. The survey asked participants about their current socio-demographic profile and also their profile when they were pregnant at the time of recruitment. An analysis of this data indicated that the eligible non-participants were of a slightly higher socioeconomic status than the participants who joined the program (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156397.s002">S1 Table</xref> for a description). This suggests that the program was effective in targeting the families most in need of intervention.</p><p>Tests of baseline equivalence between the randomized intervention and control groups using 123 measures found that two groups did not differ on 97% of baseline measures, indicating that the randomization procedure was successful [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Significant differences on the remaining 4 baseline measures suggested that the intervention group had greater knowledge of child development and used more community services, while the control group intended to use more childcare and to start childcare at an earlier age. These differences were small in magnitude and consistent with pure chance. At birth, it emerged there were significantly more boys in the intervention group than in the control group (intervention = 51%; control = 35%).</p><p>Of the 233 recruited and randomly assigned participants, 205 (intervention = 104; control = 101) completed the baseline assessment when they were on average 21.5 weeks pregnant (standard deviation (SD) = 7.5 weeks). A 24&#x02013;month assessment was conducted with 166 participants (intervention = 82; control = 84) when the average child was 24.6 months old (SD = 4.99 weeks). Two participants (intervention = 1; control = 1) were excluded from the final analysis due to missing data on the 24-month outcome.

The program is manualized with respect to the overall content that is delivered from pregnancy until the child starts school. Visits were guided by this manual which included a set of 178 <italic>PFL</italic>-developed Tip Sheets based on pre-existing domestic guidelines and succinctly presented best-practice information on pregnancy, parenting, and child development. While some Tip Sheets addressed topics relating to multiple domains of school readiness (e.g., attachment), the focal topic of the majority of Tip Sheets related to physical health and well-being (n = 105), followed by social competence and emotional maturity (n = 60), approaches to learning (n = 30), language (n = 25), and cognitive skills (n = 22). Note that these figures do not sum to 178 as some Tip Sheets are classified in more than one domain.</p><p>The home visits typically began with a family update and revision of previous goals, followed by the Tip Sheet(s) for that visit, and goal setting for the next visit. Mentors used role play, modelling, demonstration, coaching, discussion, encouragement, and feedback to deliver the intervention. The model prescribed that all families were given the full curriculum of Tip Sheets as an on-going resource, irrespective of visit uptake. The timing of Tip Sheet delivery and use of the <italic>PFL</italic> strategies varied depended on the child&#x02019;s age and the mentor&#x02019;s perception of family need, as well as maternal engagement and learning style. For example, if a particular family already had appropriate dietary patterns in place, the mentors would spend less time on the Tip Sheets related to nutrition; however for other families the mentors may have dedicated multiple visits to the Tip Sheets on nutrition. Thus the program was in keeping with the increasing emphasis on the need for HVPs to offer flexibility with respect to the number, frequency, duration, and focus of visits [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The mentors came from a cross-section of different backgrounds with mainly college degrees in education, social care, and youth studies. Each family was assigned the same mentor over the course of the intervention, where possible. The mentors received extensive training prior to program implementation involving a two-day workshop which covered the mentoring role including the evidence-base for mentoring programs; relationships and activities; outcomes and evaluation; policy and practice alignment; and the <italic>PFL</italic> logic model [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Training also included 21 other relevant courses including child protection, attachment theory, and team building. Fidelity to the intervention was tracked during monthly 2 hour supervision sessions. Qualitative implementation analysis identified mentors&#x02019; self-reported emphasis on and adherence to fidelity as a key component of program effectiveness [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Promotion of emotional and behavioral development</title><p>Children&#x02019;s emotional and behavioral development was a strong component of the program during the pre-birth to age 2 period and the focal topic of approximately 39 Tip Sheets (21.9%). In pregnancy, mothers were encouraged to undertake activities facilitating rest and relaxation and to think about and to talk to their baby. The focus on the maternal-infant relationship continued post-birth through topics such as communication: &#x0201c;<italic>your newborn baby can look at your face for interaction&#x02026;he/she can copy your facial expressions</italic>&#x0201d;. A Tip Sheet on attachment, delivered from pre-birth onwards, promoted a close relationship such as: <italic>&#x0201c;Respond to your baby&#x02019;s crying</italic>, <italic>calmly and consistently</italic>. <italic>This shows your baby that in times of distress</italic>, <italic>you care and can be relied on to be there for him/her&#x0201d;</italic>.

Emotional and behavioral wellbeing was also promoted through topics such as self-regulation and confidence, delivered in the first year, followed by self-awareness, fearfulness, temper tantrums, and sibling relationships, delivered in the second year. For example, the temper tantrums Tip Sheet highlighted that &#x0201c;<italic>A child at this stage must try out his/her parent&#x02019;s limits</italic>, <italic>over and over</italic>, <italic>to understand their rules&#x0201d;</italic> and encouraged parents to use strategies including <italic>&#x0201c;a predictable routine&#x0201d;</italic>. Mentors worked on these topics using role play with the parent, modelling appropriate child interactions, and reinforcement of positive parenting strategies.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Common supports</title><p>Both the intervention and control groups received annual developmental materials including a baby gym, food utensils, safety items, developmental toys and book packs. Participants in both groups were also encouraged to attend public health workshops on stress management and healthy eating which were already taking place in the community, however relatively few <italic>PFL</italic> participants attended these sessions.

The high &#x003b1;&#x02019;s indicated the reliability of the CBCL instrument within this sample. In addition, for each scale the borderline cutoff <italic>T</italic> score &#x0003e; 60 was used to index children with more significant emotional and behavioral problems. Missing data for individual items were imputed using the mean plus a random residual value and was approved by the instrument&#x02019;s developer [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. If more than 8 items were missing, participants were excluded from the analysis (n = 2).</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Analysis</title><p>All analyses were conducted using STATA MP 12. The study adopted an intention-to-treat strategy and two-tailed <italic>p</italic>-values were reported throughout. OLS regression models were estimated for the <italic>T</italic> scores and logistic regressions were estimated for the cutoff scores. Both measures were utilized as previous HVP studies report either the former e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] or the latter e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. To account for potential bias due to differential attrition [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156397.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], an inverse probability weighting (IPW) technique was applied. This involved three steps. First, 116 bivariate t-tests were conducted to examine the individual baseline factors associated with participation in the 24&#x02013;month assessment. The attrition analysis was restricted to participants who completed a baseline assessment. IPW is based on the assumption that the outcome is independent of the missing data pattern, conditional on treatment assignment and observable baseline characteristics. Variables which were statistically significant in the bivariate tests (at the 10% level in a two-tailed test), had no missing data, and were not collinear with any other characteristic were retained. Second, the significant variables were included in a logistic model which was used to calculate the predicted probability of completing the 24&#x02013;month assessment for each participant. Separate logistic models were conducted for the intervention and control groups as differential attrition processes may exist. Third, the inverse of these predicted probabilities were then applied as weights in the outcomes analysis. Applying these weights ensured that a larger weight was given to participants that were underrepresented in the sample due to attrition i.e. those who completed the 24&#x02013;month assessment yet had characteristics which were similar to those who dropped out. One participant who participated in the 24-month assessment, yet did not participate in the baseline assessment, was assigned the average IPW-weight.</p><p>To determine whether the program had differential effects by gender, the above models were re-estimated controlling for treatment status, gender, and an interaction between the two. Any interactions between gender and treatment assignment which trended towards significance were further investigated via subgroup analysis. As the sample size of the subgroup analysis was relatively small, thus increasing the chances that the data were not normally distributed i.e., skewed, the robustness of these results was tested using permutation testing [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This method is advantageous as it does not depend on distributional assumptions and thus is more suitable when the sample size is small. Simulation studies have found that permutation testing performs better than <italic>t</italic> tests, particularly if the degree of skewness is correlated with the size of the treatment effect [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>A permutation test is based on the assumption of exchangeability under the null hypothesis. This means that if the null hypothesis is true i.e., the program has no impact on the children&#x02019;s outcomes, taking random permutations of the treatment indicator by moving participants between the intervention and control groups, does not change the results. Permutation tests work as follows: first, the mean outcomes of the intervention and control groups are compared and a test statistic is calculated. Second, the data are repeatedly shuffled so that the treatment assignment of some participants is switched between groups and a test statistic is calculated each time to examine whether the observed result is likely to occur by chance. Third, the <italic>p</italic>-value for the permutation test is computed by examining the proportion of permutations that have a test statistic more extreme than the observed test statistic. If the proportion is small, we know that the original statistic is an unlikely outcome. Permutation tests based on 100,000 replications were used. A full description of the IPW and permutation methods can be found in these studies [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>Most intervention studies estimate the average treatment effect, however, the magnitude of an effect may vary across the distribution of the outcome. This study used the quantile regression method [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] to examine whether the intervention had heterogeneous effects at different points in the distribution of the continuous CBCL scores. Quantile regression estimates the conditional distribution by dividing the cumulative distribution of the outcome into defined intervals. Importantly, quantile regression makes no assumptions regarding the distribution of the residual, which helps avoid biased estimates if the outcome exhibits skewness, as is the case with the CBCL [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In line with Petscher and Logan [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and also Huston et al. [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] program impacts were estimated at the 10<sup>th</sup>, 25<sup>th</sup>, 50<sup>th</sup> (median), 75<sup>th</sup>, and 90<sup>th</sup> percentiles of CBCL scores, as this provided upper and lower bound points, as well as values corresponding to the interquartile range, yet was not overly specific given the sample size. This allowed us to determine whether the averaged OLS regression results concealed larger impacts at different ends of the distribution. The quantile models were also estimated including gender by treatment status interactions.</p><p>While the OLS, logistic, permutation, and IPW analyses were pre-specified, the quantile analysis was exploratory. As a sensitivity test, all analyses were re-estimated while controlling for the 4 significant differences between the intervention and control groups at baseline.

The Vulnerable Attachment Style Questionnaire (VASQ) measures the respondents' interactions and dependence on other people. Scores above 15 are indicative of depressive disorders. The Adult Adolescent Parenting Inventory (AAPI) measures approaches to parenting and provides an indicator of the endorsement of abuse/neglect. Higher scores indicate a high risk of abuse/neglect. The Pearlin Self-Efficacy scale ranges from zero to four with higher scores indicating higher self-efficacy. The Rosenberg self-esteem scale ranges from zero to 18 with higher scores indicating more maternal self-esteem.

There was a significant gender by treatment status interaction for the Externalizing cutoff, and the Internalizing cutoff trended towards significance, indicating that the program had a larger impact on boys relative to girls.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0156397.t005">Table 5</xref> explored the nature of these interactions by conducting subgroup analysis using logistic regression and permutation testing. Only the cutoff scores were considered as there was no evidence of significant interactions between treatment status and gender for the continuous scores. Again LPM was used for the Total Problems cutoff score for boys. The <italic>p</italic>-values resulting from the logistic regressions and permutation testing were very similar, suggesting that the distributional assumptions imposed by the traditional tests were not overly restrictive for the current sample. Similarly, the unadjusted and IPW-adjusted results were broadly equivalent. Overall, there were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups on the three CBCL cutoff scores for girls. There was a statistically significant effect on the Total Problems cutoff score for boys, such that a lower proportion of boys in the intervention group were classified as being in the cutoff category compared to boys in the control group. There was also a trend towards a lower proportion of boys in the intervention group falling into the Externalizing Problems cutoff category. The effect sizes based on Cramer&#x02019;s Phi were classified as small to medium.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0156397.t005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id

These methods provide greater confidence that the <italic>PFL</italic> treatment effects for emotional and behavioral difficulties at 24 months were limited to boys with the greatest level of problems, while no effects were found for girls. The results were robust to differential attrition, small sample size, and distributional effects. The lack of effects for the continuous measures of total, externalizing, and internalizing problems at 24 months suggests that the intervention was not effective at reducing behavioral problems overall, however it is possible, as seen in other HVPs [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], that effects may emerge later in childhood as children start to exhibit increasing behavioral difficulties.</p><p>There was one main treatment effect which implies that children in the intervention group demonstrated a 13% reduction in the likelihood of falling into the borderline clinical threshold for Total Problems. Further investigation revealed that this effect was comprised of a positive treatment effect for boys with the greatest level of emotional and behavioral difficulties and a counterintuitive negative treatment effect for children exhibiting the lowest levels of externalizing problems. One conceivable explanation for this negative effect is that intervention parents whose children had relatively few behavioral issues may have been made more aware of their child&#x02019;s behavioral profile due to the mentoring. From a practical perspective, this 3 point increase in Externalizing Problems for children with the least behavioral difficulties is unlikely to be substantive for child and family wellbeing. The positive treatment effects identified at the 90<sup>th</sup>, but not at the 75<sup>th</sup>, percentile, corresponds to the treatment effects observed at the CBCL borderline threshold that falls between these two intervals. This demonstrates the added benefit of conducting quantile regressions to uncover treatment effects which may otherwise be concealed using average treatment effect methods.</p><p>Overall the findings are in keeping with the mixed evidence for the effectiveness of HVPs on child emotional and behavioral functioning in toddlerhood. Nonetheless, while the treatment effects were limited for the entire sample, the effects observed for children who did benefit from the intervention represent clinically meaningful differences. A 10-point reduction in the Externalizing Problems score for boys at the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile, which is a full standard deviation, is likely to represent a material improvement in the day-to-day experiences of toddlers and their parents. These effects may be attributed to the emphasis in HVPs on enhancing attachment and parent-child interactions from pregnancy onwards. These mechanisms may have either helped prevent the development of behavior problems or provided parents with appropriate coping strategies in the incident of behavioral problems. That the children most at risk of developing behavioral problems benefitted most from intervention is in keeping with the differential susceptibility model [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] which posits that children who are vulnerable to behavioral difficulties due to genetic or temperamental factors are also more vulnerable to risk factors, and by extension, more likely to thrive in a nurturing environment. The results also accord with Shaw et al&#x02019;s research [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] on low income children, which found that 2 year old boys with the highest disruptive behaviors showed the greatest persistence in behavioral problems at school age, and crucially, persistence was associated with a more &#x02018;rejecting&#x02019; style of parenting behavior.</p><p>While most HVP studies do not analyze gender differences despite calls to the contrary [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], those that do typically find no differences [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As children mature, it appears that girls may derive more benefits from early intervention than boys in relation to cognitive abilities, education, employment, and criminal behavior [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], however a recent study identified long-term health effects for boys [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The literature provides little guidance on how gender interacts with children&#x02019;s differential susceptibility. However, the finding that boys were most at risk in terms of total behavior problems supports previous research demonstrating that preschool boys are more likely to have clinically significant total behavior problems compared to girls [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p><p>Clinically, the identification of preventive interventions that mitigate behavioral disturbances is a key objective for psychology and psychiatry [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. These results provide some support for the hypothesis that intensive HVPs initiated during pregnancy may be an effective vehicle for reducing the incidence of emotional and behavioral problems for boys at age two. Yet the modest nature of the current findings should not be overstated and further research is needed to determine whether the treatment effects identified here are sustained over time and across gender. While the results suggest that the <italic>PFL</italic> intervention had a limited impact on children&#x02019;s development at age 2, it is possible that there may be continued effects as the children develop and progress through the intervention and beyond, as has been demonstrated in other HVPs [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] or equally, that the effects observed here do not persist. Latent class analysis may also be useful in tracking the patterns of early responders and non-responders over future outcome intervals. Until such studies have been conducted, more refined targeting of the <italic>PFL</italic> program remains premature. Indeed, given the holistic nature of HVPs, their antenatal commencement, and the difficulty in anticipating future levels of behavioral need, further targeting is likely to be complex. It is possible that decision flowcharts could be used to guide Tip Sheet administration and sequencing, similar to modular therapies used in clinical settings [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. However, this concept would require development and rigorous assessment.</p><p>As with all single-site community interventions with voluntary recruitment, the results may not be generalizable to other sites or different populations, however the manualized nature of the intervention allows for retesting of the <italic>PFL</italic> program in other settings. The lack of observational data on the quality of implementation is also a significant limitation, although fidelity to the program manual has been noted elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The use of maternal reports of child behaviour, which may be subject to bias, is also noteworthy, especially in experimental trials. Yet parental report is frequently used to assess emotional and behavioral problems in preschool samples and the CBCL offers strong psychometric properties [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Nonetheless, future research should consider the use of a second informer, clinical interview/observation measures, or information on psychological service referral. Another potential issue which may biased the results is contamination or spillover effects across the intervention and control groups. As the intervention was operating in a very small community and participants were randomly assigned at the individual level, it is possible that the intervention group engaged in cross-talk or intentionally or unintentionally shared their parenting materials, information, strategies, or advice which they received from their mentors, with the control group. However, as reported elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], a series of contamination questions devised to measure cross-talk and information flows between the two groups found no evidence that contamination was likely to confound the results.</p><p>One contribution of this study is the use of multiple statistical methods which may have applicability to other experimental trials. The methods applied here may help counteract problems which often arise in RCTs such as differential attrition, small sample size data, and heterogeneous effects. The equivalence of the unweighted and the IPW-weighted results suggest that differential attrition did not materially bias the unweighted findings. This suggests that while some participants did drop out of the study, the types of participants who dropped-out of intervention and control groups were largely similar. However, given the extent to which non-random attrition may undermine internal validity, it is important for RCT studies to test and adjust for its presence [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Similarly, the logistic regression methods and the permutation methods generated similar inferences for the subgroup analysis, implying that the distributional assumptions necessitated by the traditional tests were not overly restrictive. Yet this method may be particularly advantageous in other samples. It is important to note that the use of permutation testing cannot be used to justify a small sample or an unpowered design. Permutation testing addresses the non-normality issue, which is typically more common in small samples. Thus, an appropriately powered study with a small sample and normally distributed data may not benefit from the use of permutation testing. Limitations of the IPW and permutation methods include the need for high computational power and user written code, however, with greater usage, these methods should become easier to implement in existing statistical packages. Finally, it is important to note that the few statistically significant findings may be a result of Type I errors given the number of different tests conducted. However, the various methods also revealed a certain level of consistency across findings, such that in the logistic, permutation, and quantile regressions, the results were restricted to boys within the clinical range.</p><p>Another strength of this study was the move beyond examining the average treatment effect. The ability to identify which part of the distribution is most affected by the intervention may be informative regarding future targeting and program roll-out. However, the use of quantile regression in experimental developmental studies remains new and further work is needed to reach agreed conventions on best practice [<xref rid="pone.0156397.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In addition, the sample size included at different parts of the quantile distribution were relatively small, thus caution should be exercised when interpreting these results.</p><p>In conclusion, this study found some evidence that a prenatally commencing early intervention program had positive effects on the emotional and behavioral functioning for boys experiencing the most difficulties. The wider use of the methods adopted here may help to improve the internal validity of RCTs and consolidate knowledge which has significant translational value for improving child development and mental health. While we acknowledge that addressing these specific methodological issues is not a panacea for the challenges in identifying which HVPs work, for whom and under what conditions, the methods presented here represent a step forward in contributing to the HVP literature, as well as contributing to the field of evaluation science more generally.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156397.s001"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156397.s001.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156397.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Comparison of Participants and Eligible Non-participants at Baseline.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156397.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156397.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><p><bold>Table A)</bold> Impact of <italic>PFL</italic> on emotional and behavioral functioning&#x02014;Main and interaction effects controlling for baseline differences. <bold>Table B)</bold> Impact of <italic>PFL</italic> on emotional and behavioral functioning&#x02014;Treatment effects by gender controlling for baseline differences. <bold>Table C)</bold> Quantile regression results of the distributional impact of <italic>PFL</italic> on emotional and behavioral functioning controlling for baseline differences.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156397.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156397.s004"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156397.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156397.s005"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>Study Protocol.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156397.s005.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to the <italic>PFL</italic> families and intervention staff, and the Expert Advisory Committee.
