Replacing sugar (sucrose) with a suitable substitute to combat dental caries is an option that is wide open. Recent, encouraging studies suggest antimicrobial properties as well as lower cariogenicity of some sugar substitutes such as xylitol. In the beverage field, it is clear that artificial sweeteners formed new products that were additional to the sugar-sweetened products and not competitive with them. Saccharin can substitute for the taste of sugar; lactose or sorbitol for the weight or bulk of sugar; xylitol for both taste and bulk.

The two groups with moderate and poor oral hygiene (<italic>N</italic> = 16) were each divided into two groups of eight to receive either PK<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> gums or xylitol gums during the first 10-day period. After a 10-day washout period, each group received the other type of gum for another 10 days. Saliva samples were collected and tested before and after each stage. It should be noted that 2 participants were excluded from the study due to the administration of antibiotics during the second stage.</p><p>The samples were cultured using blood agar powders (Ceneda Co., Germany). At each stage, the culture medium was prepared by mixing 40 gr blood agar powder with 1 L distilled water. The mixture was then boiled and the resultant clear solution was autoclaved at a temperature of 121&#x000b0;C and a pressure of 15 atm for 15 min. After cooling the sterilized solution down to 45&#x02013;50&#x000b0;C, 50 mL defibrinated sheep blood was added to the medium. The result was a blood agar culture medium containing 5% defibrinated sheep blood. The culture medium was finally transferred to 8-cm plates (Farazbin Co., Tehran, Iran) and the plates were maintained at 4&#x000b0;C until use.</p><p>Mitis Salivarius-Bacitracin Agar (MSBA), (Ceneda Co., Germany) was applied to differentiate between colonies suspected to be <italic>S. mutans</italic> and other colonies formed on blood agar plates. In order to prepare MSBA plates, a mixture of 25 medium powder and 250 mL sterile distilled water was boiled to obtain a clear solution. At the same time, 0.25 g potassium tellurite (measured by a sensitive laboratory scale) was mixed with 25 mL sterile distilled water and the mixture was autoclaved (at 121&#x000b0;C and 15 atm) with the medium solution for 15 min. After sterilization, the containers holding the medium and potassium tellurite were cooled down to 45&#x02013;50&#x000b0;C. The potassium tellurite solution and 0.25 g bacitracin were then added to the medium solution to produce MSBA. The resultant medium was finally moved to 8-cm plates (Farazbin Co., Iran) and kept at 4&#x000b0;C until required for the experiments.</p><p>Sampling and microbial culturing were performed at baseline, after the first and second 10-day periods of gum consumption, and after the washout period. At the time of sampling, the participants were asked rinse their mouths with water immediately after getting up in the morning (before eating breakfast or brushing their teeth). Afterward, 0.5 mL samples of unstimulated saliva were collected in sterile capped tubes (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) and immediately transferred to the microbiology laboratory of Imam Ali Clinic (Tehran, Iran).</p><p>In the laboratory, an inoculating loop was flamed and sterilized. Then, saliva samples were transferred to the blood agar medium using the loop [dilution factor: 10<sup>2</sup> colony-forming units (cfu)/mL]. After placing the plates in a candle jar (containing 5% carbon dioxide), the media were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C. After 24 h, colonies suspected to be <italic>S. mutans</italic> were placed on Petri dishes and Gram staining was performed to confirm the presence of <italic>S. mutans</italic>. A sterile loop was used to move the grown colonies of Streptococcus from the blood agar medium to the MSBA. This process was performed near a flame. The MSBA was then placed in a candle jar and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 h. Colonies of <italic>S. mutans</italic> (dark blue colonies 2&#x02013;3 mm in size) were then observed on the culture medium. When the presence of <italic>S. mutans</italic> was confirmed, the number of <italic>S. mutans</italic> colonies formed on the blood agar medium was counted. The number of CFUs was identified by morphology, counted in a stereomicroscope, and expressed as CFU mL<sup>-1</sup>.

The acid produced following the fermentation of sugar and sugar alcohols by <italic>S. mutans</italic> can destroy tooth enamel and result in dental caries. It, however, cannot ferment xylitol, which contains five carbon atoms. Furthermore, xylitol can inhibit the growth of <italic>S. mutans</italic> by creating an alkaline environment in the mouth. Xylitol is also able to form a complex with calcium. The formation of such complexes in the mouth will promote the remineralization of tooth enamels that have previously lost their minerals.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</p><p>Although Makinen <italic>et al</italic>. reported similar results,[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] our results are more reliable due to the use of a crossover design.

The results confirmed the beneficial role of xylitol in preventing root caries in adults with active decay. We, however, adopted a crossover approach and recorded bacterial counts in two different stages. Despite differences in methodology, our study and that of Ritter's yielded similar results. Nevertheless, our findings might be more accurate because we calculated colony counts after the chewing of both types of gums.</p><p>In contrast to our findings, Duane followed preschool children for 9 months and 21 months and reported lozenges, xylitol/maltitol, and erythritol/maltitol to be ineffective in reducing dental caries.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] This difference can be attributed to the type of intervention and the age group of the participants (18&#x02013;35 years in the present research). In addition, we used a crossover design to determine microbial counts after the chewing of gums.</p><p>The frequency of chewing gums, rather than the exact concentration of xylitol, seems to be the important determinant of reduction in salivary levels of <italic>S. mutans</italic> and tooth decay prevention. In fact, chewing gums should be used at least three times a day to reduce dental caries by 40&#x02013;50%.[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] We followed the same procedure and observed reductions in salivary levels of <italic>S. mutans</italic>. Long-term application of xylitol is believed to inhibit the growth and activity of <italic>S. mutans</italic> and prevent dental caries.</p><p>In the current study, chewing gums (either xylitol or PK<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) could more effectively decrease salivary levels of <italic>S. mutans</italic> in subjects with poor oral hygiene (without usual hygienic measures) than in those with moderate oral hygiene (with usual hygienic measures). In the absence of all usual hygienic measures in the group with poor oral hygiene, chewing gums could dramatically reduce <italic>S. mutans</italic> counts in their saliva. It is also noteworthy that in both groups, xylitol (which did not contain sucrose) was more effective than PK<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (containing sucrose). This finding can be justified by the intrinsic capabilities of sugar substitutes to decrease salivary levels of <italic>S. mutans</italic> and control the acidity of saliva.</p><p>The present study adopted a crossover design. As all subjects were both cases and controls, our results regarding the effects of the intervention (xylitol or PK<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) were more reliable than other, similar studies. To the best of our knowledge, no previous research has ever used this design. Moreover, previous research has generally used higher frequencies of chewing gums or longer periods of follow-up. Considering the significance of lowering salivary levels of <italic>S. mutans</italic> in individuals with poor oral hygiene, we compared the effects of xylitol-containing and conventional chewing gums in people with poor and moderate oral hygiene. We observed both types of gums, especially xylitol, to effectively reduce salivary levels of <italic>S. mutans</italic> in the two groups. This beneficial effect was more noticeable in participants with poor oral hygiene.</p><p>The major limitation of the present study was the lack of exact supervision in the appropriate use of chewing gums.</p><p>Considering the effects of xylitol in decreasing dental plaques, further studies are recommended to assess the effects of this polyol on periodontal diseases. Researchers are also suggested to evaluate the effects of xylitol-containing mouthwashes, toothpastes, and candies on oral bacteria and periodontal diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Dental caries is a multifactorial, diet-associated infectious disease.

Using these chewing gums can thus be recommended as an effective substitute for mechanical methods in individuals with poor oral hygiene or mental and/or physical disabilities.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Shahed University.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Buzalaf</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Fluoride and the oral environment</article-title><source>Monogr Oral Sci</source><year>2011</year><volume>22</volume><fpage>97</fpage><lpage>114</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21701194</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fejerskow</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Kidd</surname><given-names>EA</given-names></name><name><surname>Nyvad</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Baclum</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Fejerskov</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Kidd</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Defining the disease: An introduction</article-title><source>Dental Caries-The Disease and its Clinical Management</source><year>2008</year><edition>2nd ed</edition><publisher-loc>Oxford</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Blackwell Munksgaard</publisher-name><fpage>3</fpage><lpage>6</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Selwitz</surname><given-names>RH</given-names></name><name><surname>Ismail</surname><given-names>AI</given-names></name><name><surname>Pitts</surname><given-names>NB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dental caries</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2007</year><volume>369</volume><fpage>51</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17208642</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bader</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><name><surname>Rozier</surname><given-names>RG</given-names></name><name><surname>Lohr</surname><given-names>KN</given-names></name><name><surname>Frame</surname><given-names>PS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Physicians&#x02019; roles in preventing dental caries in preschool children: A summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</article-title><source>Am J Prev Med</source><year>2004</year><volume>26</volume><fpage>315</fpage><lpage>25</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15110059</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>U.
