The reported incidence of pain after inguinal hernia repair varies from 0% to 37%.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] These procedures can be performed under regional anesthesia or general anesthesia and postoperative analgesia can be provided by various analgesic modalities.</p><p>A multimodal approach includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol infusion,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and regional anesthetic techniques such as local infiltration or nerve blocks. The use of local anesthetic for blocks/infiltration is associated with a shorter intra-hospital recovery, lesser morbidity, and overall costs.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Infiltration of local anesthetic also improves acute postoperative pain management by decreasing postoperative pain, opioid demand with its resultant complications such as nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression. It also delays the time to rescue analgesic administration.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Pain and discomfort are important components which are expected after abdominal wall incision.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Peripheral nerve blocks such as transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block, abdominal field blocks, and ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric (IIIH) nerve blocks have been described in the literature as means to alleviate pain due to abdominal wall incision.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The anterolateral abdominal wall is innervated by thoracolumbar nerves T7 to L1 which emanates from the anterior rami of the spinal nerves and thereby traversing through the plane between the layers of the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles of the abdomen.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] This plane is known as TAP. The iliohypogastric nerve (L1) divides between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis near the iliac crest supplying part of the skin over the inguinal region, gluteal region, and hypogastric region. The ilioinguinal nerve (L1) supplies the upper and medial part of the thigh and also part of the skin covering the genitalia. TAP block and IIIH nerve blocks are regional anesthetic techniques in which local anesthetics are deposited to block the sensory nerves supplying the anterior abdominal wall.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Studies have revealed the efficacy of blind as well as ultrasound-guided TAP block and IIIH nerve block with wound infiltration in providing adequate postoperative analgesia in patients who have undergone inguinal hernia repair when compared to routine parenteral and oral analgesics.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and duration of analgesia with ultrasound-guided TAP block and IIIH nerve block with wound infiltration in the postoperative period among patients undergoing unilateral open inguinal hernia surgery. The primary outcome of the present study was to compare the duration and quality of postoperative analgesia using visual analog scale (VAS). The secondary outcomes measured were the hemodynamic parameters, analgesic requirements, and complications, if any.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This study was a randomized clinical trial conducted from October 2014 to April 2016 after protocol approval by the institutional ethical committee and registration at clinical trials registry &#x02013; India (CTRI/2014/10/007735, October 7, 2014). Sixty patients were randomized into two groups of thirty each which included male patients in the age group between 18 and 65 years belonging to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I or II, posted for unilateral open inguinal hernia surgery. Patients were excluded if they had any known drug allergies, other contraindications to spinal anesthesia, bilateral inguinal hernia/irreducible hernia, and body mass index (BMI) &#x0003e;35 Kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Selected patients underwent a routine preoperative evaluation on the evening before surgery. Informed or written consent was obtained after explanation of the procedure to the patients. Patients were shifted to operation theater complex on the day of surgery. Noninvasive monitors such as an electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure (BP), and pulse oximeter were connected. The subarachnoid block was performed by the operator in all patients in sitting position in L<sub>3</sub>&#x02013;L<sub>4</sub> space with 3&#x02013;3.2 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ultrasound guidance guided transversus abdominis plane block</title><p>In Group T after surgery, transverses abdominis plane block was performed using a B Braun Stimuplex needle under ultrasound guidance using Sonosite ultrasound machine with 5&#x02013;10 MHz linear probe.

Among all these techniques, TAP and IIIH blocks are effective and easy to perform with least complications.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Very few studies have compared TAP with IIIH blocks in adults undergoing inguinal hernia mesh repair. Sasaoka <italic>et al</italic>. and Asad <italic>et al</italic>. indicated that addition of a genitofemoral block to IIIH nerve block provides better pain relief compared with IIIH block alone.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, it is quite difficult to block genital branch under ultrasound guidance. Hence, we decided to add wound infiltration along with IIIH nerve block in one group and to compare it with TAP block alone in another group.</p><p>In our prospective randomized clinical trial, we compared pain intensity using VAS pain score and 24 h analgesic consumption. We found that the time for VAS to reach &#x0003e;5 (first breakthrough analgesia&#x02013; fentanyl 25 mcg/IV and diclofenac 75 mg/IM) was longer in TAP group (5.9 &#x000b1; 1.881) compared to IIIH group (3.76 &#x000b1; 1.75). The study is similar to a study which compared ultrasound-guided transverses abdominis plane block and IIIH nerve blocks for day care inguinal hernia repair done by Aveline <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] which reported that TAP block patients expressed significantly less pain at rest on VAS scores at 4, 12, and 24 h. Similarly, a meta-analysis was conducted by Yu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] including all relevant randomized controlled trials in the published literature, to compare the efficacy of TAP block with local anesthesia infiltration for postoperative analgesia. These researchers concluded that TAP block was comparable to local anesthesia infiltration for short-term analgesia; but, they found that TAP block could also provide better long-lasting analgesia, especially at 24 h after surgery.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, in our study, we used IIIH block + wound infiltration with a local anesthetic which resulted in good quality and an equal amount of rescue analgesia in both the groups.</p><p>Frassanito <italic>et al</italic>. compared ultrasound-guided TAP with IIIH block and reported that patients in the TAP group had significantly lower VAS scores immediately after surgery as well as at 24 h compared to IIIH group. They also reported that TAP group had significantly lower VAS on coughing at the end of surgery and at the time of discharge which was similar to our study. However, in their study, IIIH group required increased amount of analgesic consumption for the first 24 h compared to the TAP group. In contrast to their study, in our study, the incidence of consumption of rescue analgesia was lesser even in the IIIH group which can be explained by the fact that we used wound infiltration along with IIIH block while they had used IIIH block alone.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>There are some contrasting reports especially in pediatric anesthesia, where it has been found that IIIH blocks are more superior to TAP blocks for herniotomy procedures. It is to be noted that pediatric herniotomy procedures are done with minimal incision without placing a mesh whereas adult patients require extensive dissection along with mesh placement.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>In our clinical trial, both TAP block group as well as IIIH block group had minimal side effects. The main side effect we noted was postoperative nausea and vomiting with an incidence of 35%. One of the reasons for this could have been the use of fentanyl as rescue analgesia which is emetogenic, otherwise TAP and IIIH blocks are safe with minimal side effects for hernia procedure.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Limitations</title><p>There were a few limitations in our study. We only studied male patients of ASA I and II and with a BMI of less than 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Since the number of females who come for this operation in our institution is very low, we eliminated them to maintain uniformity. The anesthetist in charge was not blinded for the block technique.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Both TAP block and IIIH nerve block with wound infiltration are effective regional blocks for open inguinal hernia procedure in adult patients. The time for first rescue analgesia was prolonged in TAP group compared to IIIH group, but total analgesic requirement within the first 24 h remained the same in both the groups with minimal side effects. Hence, both TAP block as well as IIIH block with wound infiltration can be used as effective modalities to control postoperative pain after open inguinal hernia procedures.</p><sec
