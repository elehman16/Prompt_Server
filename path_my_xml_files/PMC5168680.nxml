It is a challenge to physicians involved in the management of these patients. Wuling San, a classic prescription in Traditional Chinese Medicine used in treating oedema for thousands of years, is reported by many Chinese journals to perform well in BCUL. Therefore, the aim of this study is to verify its efficacy and evaluate its safety using rigorous methodological designs in patients with BCUL.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>To verify the efficacy and assess the safety of Wuling San over a placebo, this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial will be carried out in three hospitals. A total of 200 eligible patients with BCUL will be randomly allocated, in a ratio of 1:1, to either the experimental medicine group or the placebo group. The primary outcome measure will be the proportion of absolute reduced limb volume, as measured by perometry. The second outcome measure will be the number of participants with adverse events. The assessment will be carried out at the following time points: before enrolment (baseline) and 2, 4, 6 and 8&#x02005;weeks after treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This trial will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and supervised by the institutional review board of the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University (approval number PJK2016088). All patients will receive information about the trial in verbal and written forms and will give informed consent before enrolment. This trial will help to demonstrate whether Wuling San is effective in the treatment of patients with BCUL. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals or disseminated through conference presentations.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02726477?term=wuling+san&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02726477</ext-link>; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Wuling San</kwd><kwd>lymphedema</kwd><kwd>protocol</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This is the first clinical study focusing on the efficacy and safety of the use of Wuling San for breast-cancer-related upper extremity lymphoedema (BCUL).</p></list-item><list-item><p>This study should provide a reference for future large-scale studies if applicable.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Subsequent studies will be considered for comparisons between treatment with Wuling San and other therapies in patients with BCUL, if it is proved efficacious.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>As a common symptom caused by insufficient lymph drainage following radical mastectomy or modified radical mastectomy, breast-cancer-related upper extremity lymphoedema (BCUL) afflicts over 30% of postoperative patients who undergo axillary lymph node dissection (ALND).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Based on the severity, which depends on the extent of the axillary operation, the frequency of radiotherapy, lymph node status, tumour burden, age of the patients and obesity,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> BCUL can be classified into three stages. Stage I is characterised by a &#x02018;reversible&#x02019; protein-rich fluid accumulation. Stage II, known as &#x02018;spontaneously irreversible&#x02019;, is characterised by an increased number of keratinocytes and connective tissue cells. Stage III, also called &#x02018;elephantiasis&#x02019;, is characterised by a conspicuous increase in the size of the limb, with thickened rough skin due to massive hyperkeratosis.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This can result in physical discomfort, psychological distress, functional disability, cosmetic defect and chronic recurrent erysipelas.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Affected arms are often stiff and prone to infections, which often require hospitalisation for antibiotics,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> or even surgery,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> a significant source of expenditure and hardship for many patients. To prevent deterioration from the swelling, patients are repeatedly obliged to wear uncomfortable elastic compression stockings, which serve as a continuous reminder of their cancerous status, increasing their anxiety and reducing their quality of life.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, as a poorly understood symptom with few effective therapies, the management of BCUL is still a challenge for physicians.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>A basic concept in the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is that related symptoms of certain diseases are often summarised as a syndrome (&#x02018;zheng&#x02019; in Chinese).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In TCM, lymphoedema is put into the same category as oedema and is considered to be caused by a qi (chi) deficiency and blood stasis. Several prescriptions are available to manage this symptom, and Wuling San is one of the most popular. Wuling San is composed of extracts from Poria, Rhizoma Alismatis, Polyporus, Cortex Cinnamomi and Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae. With the ability to promote qi transformation, warm yang and drain dampness, this formula is from the <italic>Treatise on febrile diseases caused by cold</italic> (Shang Han Lun) written by Zhongjing Zhang during the Chinese Eastern Han Dynasty (about 200 AD), and has been used for thousands of years since then in East Asia.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref></p><p>Both the early clinical reports in Chinese journals<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;17</xref> and the clinical data gathered by the physicians in our team have shown that Wuling San somehow decreases swelling and relieves the symptoms of lymphoedema in the upper extremities after ALND, probably by promoting kidney function, diuresis, and other pathways. But these are only experience-based medical accounts with little scientific experimental evidence. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to check its efficacy and assess its safety in the treatment of women with modest lymphoedema (stage I or II) after mastectomy for breast cancer.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Method and analysis</title><p>The present protocol was designed according to Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials 2013 (SPIRIT 2013; see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary file S1</xref>).</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012515.supp1</object-id><label>supplementary file</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-012515supp1.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Study design</title><p>This double-blind trial will be carried out in three medical centres: the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Liuzhou Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine.

However, investigations and comparisons of these therapies performed in two systematic reviews<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> found it difficult to make definitive therapy recommendations. Moreover, most therapies were shown to be merely more beneficial than doing nothing at all for the lymphoedematous limb. Therefore, there is still an urgent need to find an effective and convenient therapy for those patients who go on to develop BCUL after breast cancer treatment.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> If this therapy is economically feasible, it will be more beneficial to patients, because of the chronic process of BCUL.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>In TCM, lymphoedema including BCUL is classified as a kind of oedema, which is considered to be a syndrome of internal stagnation of fluid dampness due to stasis of the blood and a deficiency of the qi, and the treatment indication is Wuling San. Identified as a prescription for strengthening the yang qi and promoting water metabolism in organs such as the kidneys and bladder, Wuling San manages qi stagnation and blood stasis. Of the five ingredients of the Wuling San prescription, Polyporus Poria and Alismatis rhizome are the main ones with the ability to induce diuresis and eliminate dampness; Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae is considered to enhance the efficacy of Poria, and Cortex Cinnamomi is considered to strengthen the yang qi to promote water metabolism in organs such as the kidneys and bladder. Together, these five herbs endow Wuling San with the ability to restore the balance between yin and yang, promote water metabolism, and reduce stasis.</p><p>Some scientific reports have demonstrated that Wuling San can promote kidney function and induce diuresis.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> A clinical study reported that the use of Wuling San could lead to a significant increase in urine volume and a reduction in body weight in patients with nephritic syndrome.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In addition, there are reports that Wuling San can inhibit the activity of the renal renin&#x02013;angiotensin system in normal rats<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and in rats with adriamycin-induced nephrotic syndrome,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> thereby protecting the podocytes from injury. The efficacy of Wuling San in renal oedema has been observed in patients with diabetic nephropathy.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Similar efficacies of the five ingredients of Wuling San have also been reported. Poria has been found to attenuate hypertonicity-induced cell death in the collecting tubule<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and ameliorate chronic kidney diseases by intervening in certain metabolic pathways in rats.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> A similar effect was found in patients with chronic kidney disease.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Polyporus aqueous extract has been reported to have significant diuretic activity in rats, with a reduced level of aquaporin and an increased output of urinary Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In addition, aqueous extract of Alismatis rhizome has been found to promote diuresis in rats<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and to have the ability to remove urinary calculi in patients with ureter calculi.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Cortex Cinnamomi has been found to improve renal function effectively in mice.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Furthermore, the bioactive components or extracts of the Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizome have been reported to enhance immunity in aged rats.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In summary, these reports indicate that Wuling San might have diuretic efficacy and renal protective effects by enhancing kidney function and inhibiting stress response.</p><p>As it was greatly valued by their predecessors, the Chinese have used Wuling San in the treatment of oedema for thousands of years.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref> In recent years, there have been several case reports in Chinese journals on the good clinical performance of Wuling San in the treatment of lymphoedema.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;17</xref> Based on our clinical observation in practice, women with SCUL in stage I or II show a significant reduction in the size of the affected limb after Wuling San treatment in combination with standard routine management composed of daily use of compression stockings, exercise and skin care. Increased vitality and quality of life and fewer adverse events were reported by women receiving Wuling San, compared with those receiving other therapies. Moreover, the ingredients are inexpensive and natural, with few side effects.</p><p>However, no scientific clinical trial has confirmed the efficacy of Wuling San in the treatment of BCUL. Therefore, to maximally exclude the placebo effects and to demonstrate whether Wuling San is effective for treating BCUL, we designed this methodologically rigorous, randomised, double-blind trial. Sham-Wuling San can be used for blinding purposes because of the rare experience of Wuling San among patients with BCUL. In previous studies, no examples have used Sham-Wuling San. For practical purposes, we plan to use starch mixed with 5% Wuling San and 2% food colouring as a sham powder. A detailed description of our methods for recruitment, randomisation, allocation, intervention and data analysis is provided above.</p><p>However, there are also some limitations to this protocol. First, owing to limited studies in this field, the primary focus of this trial is mainly on the verification of its efficacy and the investigation of its safety; no further research is involved. Second, subsequent studies will be needed for other assessments, including comparisons between Wuling San and other therapies in patients with BCUL, if it is proved efficacious.</p><p>In conclusion, this pilot trial will verify the efficacy and investigate the safety of Wuling San in the treatment of BCUL, assess the feasibility of the study design, and provide a clinical foundation for future large-scale studies (if applicable).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Xuexiang Liu for help with statistical analysis.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> SD is the chief designer of this trial.
