We consequently have no data on disease severity, viral aetiology and time of infection in infancy, which are limitations of this study. Asthma exacerbations during pregnancy result in changes at the feto-maternal interface that favour aberrant immune responses in the foetus.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Mechanistically, immune and lung function, epigenetic and microbiome studies conducted in this birth cohort in the future all appear of interest. Together, our study identifies asthma in pregnancy as a potentially modifiable determinant in the prenatal origins of bronchiolitis with the prospect to be evaluated as a potential primary preventative strategy that could modulate the risk of childhood asthma.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Kelly Steel and Karen McLaughlin for their assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JM: had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.
