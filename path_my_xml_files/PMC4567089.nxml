This vaccination program and the subsequent destruction and consolidation of known variola virus (VARV) samples into WHO reference laboratories significantly reduced the likelihood of accidental reintroduction of the causative agent of smallpox. Nonetheless, the intentional reintroduction of smallpox from undeclared samples, accidental release, or intentional regeneration of the viral genome made possible by advances in molecular biology remains a possibility [<xref rid="OFV040C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="OFV040C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These concerns, combined with the potential devastating impact of disease in an immunologically naive population in which routine vaccination ended over 40 years ago, have led to efforts to mitigate the potential reintroduction of VARV.</p><p>Vaccination remains the most effective means of preventing transmission of VARV and reducing the impact of smallpox disease. First- and second-generation smallpox vaccines, based upon vaccinia virus (VACV), an orthopoxvirus closely related to VARV, are highly protective and were extensively used during the global eradication program. However, these live replication-competent VACV vaccines have the potential to cause serious complications including progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, generalized vaccinia, encephalitis, and myo-/pericarditis, especially in individuals with immunodeficiency states or skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis (AD) [<xref rid="OFV040C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="OFV040C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These findings led the US Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices to recommend against vaccination with first- and second-generation smallpox vaccines for individuals (and their household contacts) who have a history or presence of eczema or AD, or who are immunocompromised such as those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Based on these recommendations, it has been estimated that up to 25% of the population are ineligible to receive the first- and second-generation smallpox vaccines [<xref rid="OFV040C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) was used during the 1970s in more than 120 000 people, including children with immune deficiencies, for priming prior to administration with a first- and second-generation smallpox vaccine [<xref rid="OFV040C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Modified vaccinia Ankara was derived by more than 570 passages of the VACV strain chorioallantois vaccinia Ankara in primary chicken embryo fibroblast cells and essentially became replication restricted to avian and certain mammalian cells [<xref rid="OFV040C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], resulting in a product incapable of replicating in human cells or severely immunocompromised animals [<xref rid="OFV040C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recent trials with MVA as a stand-alone smallpox vaccine have demonstrated a favorable safety profile [<xref rid="OFV040C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFV040C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Modified vaccinia Ankara was also shown to induce immune responses comparable with conventional VACV-based vaccines [<xref rid="OFV040C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="OFV040C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Populations at an increased risk to receive first- and second-generation smallpox vaccines (ie, subjects with HIV-infection [<xref rid="OFV040C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], atopic dermatitis [<xref rid="OFV040C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], or immune-suppressive therapy [<xref rid="OFV040C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], respectively) tolerated vaccination with MVA well and had a good immune response. To further evaluate MVA as a smallpox vaccine in at-risk individuals, this Phase II trial was conducted to compare the safety and immunogenicity of MVA in HIV-infected individuals and healthy controls.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Vaccine</title><p>Modified vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) was manufactured by IDT Biologika GmbH (Dessau-Ro&#x000df;lau, Germany) according to Good Manufacturing Practices guidelines and was provided by Bavarian Nordic A/S (Kvistgaard, Denmark) as a liquid-frozen product (0.5 mL) with a nominal titer of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Design</title><p>A multicenter, open-label, controlled Phase II trial was conducted between June 12, 2006 and March 25, 2009. Vaccinia-experienced or vaccinia-naive, HIV-infected and healthy male and female subjects (18&#x02013;55 years of age) were enrolled at 36 centers in the United States and Puerto Rico. Main inclusion criteria for healthy subjects were a negative antibody test for HIV and hepatitis C. Human immunodeficiency virus-infected subjects were eligible if they had confirmed HIV infection, had a CD4<sup>+</sup> count of 200&#x02013;750 cells/&#x000b5;L, and were either on antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months or not receiving antiretroviral therapy for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Main exclusion criteria for all subjects included the following: pregnancy; acute disease (any illness with or without a fever at the time of enrollment); uncontrolled infections; known or suspected impairment of the immune system other than HIV infection, including chronic administration of immunosuppressive drugs starting from 6 months prior to study participation; administration of immunoglobulins (Igs) and/or blood products 3 months prior to inclusion; any clinically significant hematological, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, central nervous system, or gastrointestinal disorders; uncontrolled psychiatric disorders; history, clinical manifestation, or increased risk of cardiovascular disease; allergy to vaccine components; positive hepatitis B surface antigen; and any vaccination prior to inclusion (14 days for killed/inactivated, 3 months for live vaccines).</p><p>Based on HIV infection status and smallpox vaccination history (determined by subject report and examination for a typical vaccinia scar) at screening, subjects were allocated to 1 of 4 study groups to receive 2 subcutaneous doses of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> MVA-BN 4 weeks apart. After enrollment (Day 0; first vaccination), subjects returned at weeks 1, 4 (second vaccination), 6 and 8 for immunogenicity and/or safety assessments. A follow-up via phone was scheduled 6 months after the second vaccination; for a subgroup of subjects, the 6-month follow-up was performed as an onsite visit.</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from each subject before enrollment. The study was approved by the relevant Institutional Review Boards, and all procedures followed the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH-Good Clinical Practice and US Code of Federal Regulation applicable for clinical trials. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board oversaw the safety of volunteers participating in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Safety Assessment</title><p>The occurrence, relationship, intensity, and duration of any unsolicited adverse events (AEs) reported by the subject or detected by the investigator at any time during the study were recorded at each of the 4 postvaccination study visits. Serious AEs (SAEs) were monitored throughout the study up to the 6-month follow-up visit. Solicited AE, ie, predefined local reactions (erythema, swelling, and pain) and general symptoms (pyrexia, headache, myalgia, chills, nausea, and fatigue), were assessed for occurrence, intensity, and duration by the subjects using diary cards for the 8 postvaccination days starting on the day of each vaccination. Severe (ie, Grade 3) injection-site reactions of erythema and swelling were defined as a diameter of &#x02265;100 mm and for pain if preventing normal activity; general symptoms were Grade 3 if daily activity was prevented. Grade 3 pyrexia was defined as body temperature &#x02265;39.0&#x000b0;C and &#x0003c;40.0&#x000b0;C; &#x02265;40.0&#x000b0;C was Grade 4 (life-threatening or disabling). The occurrence of any cardiac symptoms, elevated cardiac enzymes, and clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) changes were defined as AEs of special interest (AESI). Physical exams, including vital signs, were performed at every study visit. In addition, all subjects underwent ECG and safety laboratories for hematology and serum chemistry (including cardiac enzymes) at week 1 and 6, and additionally if indicated. Human immunodeficiency virus RNA levels and CD4/CD8 T-cell counts were monitored in HIV-infected subjects at baseline and at each postvaccination visit.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Immunogenicity Assessment</title><p>Blood was drawn at baseline before the first vaccination, 1 week and 4 weeks after the first, as well as 2 weeks and 4 weeks after the second vaccination. For subgroup of subjects, who were attending the onsite follow-up visit, a follow-up sample was drawn at least 26 weeks after first vaccination (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFV040F1">1</xref>).

One hundred eighty-five subjects were excluded from the per-protocol analysis set ([PPS] n = 394). The active phase of the study is up to the visit for the last vaccination and the follow-up (FU) phase is at least 26 weeks after last vaccination. Only 164 from 501 subjects came to an on-site visit for the Follow-up, for 337 of 501 subjects the safety-relevant information was gathered by telephone.

For subjects seronegative before vaccination, seroconversion was defined as the appearance of a titer equal to or higher than the detection limit (50 for ELISA and 6 for PRNT). For subjects seropositive before vaccination, seroconversion was defined as at least a 2-fold increase in titer compared with the prevaccination titer. Titers below the detection limit were replaced by 1 for geometric mean titer (GMT) calculations.</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>Vaccinia Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</title><p>Total IgG antibodies were measured using an automated ELISA on a Biomek FX ELISA robot (Beckman Coulter, Germany). The 96-well plates were coated overnight with a crude antigen preparation (MVA-infected chicken embryo fibroblast lysate) in 200 mM Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, pH 9.6. After washing, plates were blocked with a solution of phosphate-buffered saline, 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 0.05% Tween 20. Plates were washed again before the addition of test sera, which were titrated in duplicate 2-fold serial dilutions starting at 1:50. After a 1-hour incubation period, plates were washed, incubated for 1 hour with detection antibody (goat anti-human horseradish peroxidase, Sigma-Aldrich), and washed again before a 30-minute development with 3,3&#x02032;,5,5&#x02032;-tetramethylbenzidine substrate. The optical density was measured at 450 nm. The antibody titers were calculated by linear regression and defined as the serum dilution that resulted in the optical density of the assay cutoff (0.3).</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Vaccinia Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test</title><p>Neutralizing antibodies were determined using a PRNT<sub>50</sub>. Test sera were serially diluted in duplicate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/7% FBS and added to an equal volume of vaccinia virus (Western Reserve strain, ABI) and then incubated overnight at 37&#x000b0;C. After neutralization, the sera were transferred to confluent Vero cell monolayers in 48-well cell culture plates. After 70 minutes adsorption, overlay-medium (DMEM, 7% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, and 0.5% methyl cellulose) was added and then incubated overnight. After crystal violet staining, plates were scanned and automatically counted. The number of plaques was fitted as a linear function of the log<sub>10</sub> of the dilution, and the titer was expressed as the serum dilution where the virus was neutralized by 50% compared with the 100% virus control (average number of plaques per 40 wells).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The final sample size of at least 300 HIV-infected, vaccinia-naive subjects was determined by regulatory requirements to identify a potential safety signal of at least 1% with 80% power. Safety and immunogenicity assessments were stratified according to the prevaccination status of subjects to evaluate the potential impact of pre-existing immunity. The HIV-infected study population was further stratified according to their CD4 counts at baseline (200&#x02013;349, 350&#x02013;500, 501&#x02013;750 cells/&#x000b5;L).</p><p>The safety analysis was conducted on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) including all subjects who received at least 1 vaccination. The immunogenicity analysis was primarily performed on the per-protocol analysis set (PPS), comprising all subjects without major protocol violations, but was also repeated on the FAS for comparison. All analyses were performed in an exploratory manner at the 5% significance level without any adjustments for multiple testing. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS.</p><p>Demographic parameters between groups were compared at baseline using descriptive statistics i.e. proportions for gender or race and mean and standard deviations for quantitative measurements (e.g. age or body mass index). Safety laboratory parameters were compared over time by calculating the change from baseline and calculating the mean and 95% confidence interval of the mean.</p><p>Adverse events were summarized using frequency tables, and differences between rates in groups were tested using Fisher's exact test. For the immunogenicity data (ELISA and PRNT titers), the seroconversion rates (ELISA and PRNT) were compared using an exact 95% confidence interval for the difference between the percentages of healthy and HIV-infected subjects. Differences in GMTs between 2 groups were tested using a homoscedastic <italic>t</italic> test, or a one-way analysis of variance test in the case of more than 2 groups, using the log<sub>10</sub> titers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study Population</title><p>Five hundred seventy-nine volunteers were enrolled in the study: 439 vaccinia-naive (88 healthy, 351 HIV-infected) and 140 vaccinia-experienced (9 healthy, 131 HIV-infected) subjects received at least 1 vaccination, had data available for analysis, and were included in the FAS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFV040F1">1</xref>). An amendment of the protocol to fulfill regulatory requirements meant enrollment into study groups was unbalanced. Five hundred forty-one subjects received both vaccinations. Of these, 185 subjects (34%) had a protocol violation (predefined according to regulatory authority requirements) and were excluded from the PPS accordingly. Because only 5 healthy vaccinia-experienced subjects were included in the PPS, this group was not powered for comparisons with other groups.</p><p>Human immunodeficiency virus-infected and healthy study populations were demographically balanced except that there were more males than females in the HIV-infected study groups and the HIV-infected vaccinia-naive group was older than the healthy cohort. The main difference between vaccinia-naive and vaccinia-experienced groups was the lower age of vaccinia-naive compared with vaccinia-experienced subjects (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="OFV040TB1">1</xref>). Based on CD4 counts at screening (200&#x02013;349, 350&#x02013;500, 501&#x02013;750 cells/&#x000b5;L), HIV-infected subjects were further divided into 3 subgroups with similar proportions of vaccinia-naive and vaccinia-experienced in each group (89 [25.4%], 163 [46.4%], and 99 [28.2%]; and 24 [18.3%], 61 [46.6%], and 46 [35.1%], respectively).

The results of this study demonstrate that the MVA smallpox vaccine was as safe and well tolerated in HIV-infected subjects with CD4 counts as low as 200 cells/&#x000b5;L as in healthy individuals, regardless of their previous smallpox vaccination status. Furthermore, MVA was able to induce a VACV-specific immune response in HIV-infected subjects.</p><p>Although a majority of the study subjects experienced at least 1 AE, frequencies were similar in HIV-infected and healthy subjects. The only SAE assessed as possibly related (pneumonia) was likely pre-existing given the onset of symptoms 1 day after vaccination. The majority of reported adverse reactions tended to be mild to moderate, quickly resolving, local and systemic ADR typically observed with vaccine administration. None of the reported AESI was indicative of myo- or pericarditis. Moreover, the 11 subjects with minimally elevated troponin levels reported during the study were evaluated by a cardiologist and deemed not to indicate myo- or pericardits. Given the very low elevation without any ECG or echocardiographic changes, the elevated troponin levels likely reflected a change in the central laboratory threshold for normal range during the active phase of the study, leading to false-positive results. There was no significant difference in the frequency of ADR or AESI in HIV-infected or healthy subjects. No safety signals were detected during the study including the 6-month follow-up and despite close cardiac monitoring, and no cardiac risk was identified.</p><p>These data are important because first- and second-generation live smallpox vaccines have been associated with myo-/pericarditis [<xref rid="OFV040C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The fact that no cases of myo-/pericarditis were identified in this study, which was powered specifically to detect cardiac events at the frequency reported with live vaccines, suggests that the vaccine likely has a better cardiac safety profile than previous generation vaccines, confirming previously published data on cardiac monitoring after administration of MVA [<xref rid="OFV040C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, it remains possible that larger clinical studies might detect rare clinical toxicity.</p><p>Immunogenicity of vaccines is of significant importance for immunocompromised subjects who are at risk for more severe disease. After 2 doses of MVA, high seropositivity rates were demonstrated in both HIV-infected and healthy subjects. Although total antibody titers were significantly higher in healthy compared with HIV-infected vaccinia-naive subjects, PRNT GMT values were similar at the 26 week follow-up visit. This result is consistent with the results of a smaller study [<xref rid="OFV040C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], although the trial reported here included subjects with more advanced disease (CD4 count as low as 200 cells/&#x000b5;L compared with &#x0003e;350 cells/&#x000b5;L). Although a suppressed immune response in HIV-infected subjects is generally expected and frequently observed with other vaccines [<xref rid="OFV040C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], total antibody titers in HIV-infected subjects were still high and comparable to titers in healthy subjects given first- and second-generation live smallpox vaccines [<xref rid="OFV040C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="OFV040C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], justifying the conclusion that immune responses correlating to protection had been induced in this immunocompromised population.</p><p>As has been reported in other clinical studies evaluating MVA [<xref rid="OFV040C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFV040C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="OFV040C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFV040C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or first- and second-generation live smallpox vaccines [<xref rid="OFV040C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the total antibody response is higher, both in terms of the number of responders and in the magnitude of the response, compared with neutralizing antibody titers. Although neutralizing antibodies are considered an important immunological correlate of protection [<xref rid="OFV040C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], other antibody functions such as complement fixation, antibody directed cellular cytotoxicity, and opsonization have been shown to play an important role in protection as well [<xref rid="OFV040C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFV040C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Antibodies responsible for these latter functions are likely captured better by an ELISA [<xref rid="OFV040C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="OFV040C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In all reported trials for MVA, the PRNT and ELISA results were significantly correlated, as is the case in the present study, supporting the comprehensive assessment of humoral immune responses using the measurement of both PRNT and ELISA.</p><p>In both groups of vaccinia-experienced subjects, MVA was shown to significantly boost pre-existing immunity, supporting earlier findings that first- and second-generation smallpox vaccines induce a long-lived B cell memory [<xref rid="OFV040C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This anamnestic response in vaccinia-experienced populations has previously been used as an indicator of clinical efficacy for first- and second-generation smallpox vaccines [<xref rid="OFV040C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and thus a single MVA vaccination seems to be sufficient to boost the protective immune response induced by first- and second-generation smallpox vaccines in the majority of immunosuppressed and healthy individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the standard MVA dose and regimen established for healthy populations has a favorable safety and immunogenic profile in HIV-infected vaccinia-naive and vaccinia-experienced populations with CD4 counts of 200&#x02013;750 cells/&#x000b5;L. The data from this study supported US Food and Drug Administration approval for emergency use of MVA in the event of a smallpox outbreak.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The following Investigators and Clinical Trials Sites recruited subjects for this trial: Thomas Jefferson, Health for Life Clinic, Little Rock, AR; Daniel Berger, Northstar Medical Center, Chicago, IL; Scott Parker University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL; Javier Morales-Ramirez, Clinical Research P.R., San Juan, Puerto Rico; Teresa Sligh, Providence Clinical Research, Burbank, CA; Patricia Salvato, Diversified Medical Practices, Houston, TX; Ian Frank, University of Pennsylvania, Division of Infectious Diseases, Philadelphia, PA; Barry Rodwick, Clinical Research of West Florida, Clearwater, FL; Jennifer Bartczak, Northpoint Medical, Ft.
