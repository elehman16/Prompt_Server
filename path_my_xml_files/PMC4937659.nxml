These subjects received (1) LCTZ plus FFNS (combination group), (2) LCTZ plus FFNS placebo (monotherapy group), or (3) LCTZ placebo plus FFNS placebo (placebo group) once on the night prior to exposure, with a 1-week washout period between exposures. Nasal (sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and itchy nose) and ocular (eye itching and tearing) symptoms were recorded every 15&#x02009;min, and the number of sneezes, nose blowing events, and the amount of nasal secretions were measured during exposure. The primary end-point was the cumulative incidence of SAR symptoms during exposure and the &#x02018;ime to occurrence of symptoms&#x02019;. The secondary end-points were the total nasal symptom score, the ocular symptom score, the amount of nasal discharge, and the number of sneezes and nose blowing events.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Results</title><p>At all the measurement points, the lowest cumulative incidences for the nasal symptoms were observed in the combination group, followed by the monotherapy and placebo groups. All the subjects in the placebo group developed nasal symptoms within 2&#x02009;h after pollen exposure, while three and eight subjects in the monotherapy and combination groups, respectively, did not develop any nasal symptoms during exposure. In addition, combination therapy delayed the onset of symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results demonstrated that combination therapy with FFNS and LCTZ significantly suppressed the induced SAR symptoms and delayed the onset of symptoms compared with LCTZ monotherapy and placebo. Although the conditions of the allergen challenge study using an exposure chamber are different from those in real life, combination therapy with FF and LCTZ was confirmed to be an effective treatment for SAR.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Japanese cedar pollinosis</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>Artificial exposure chamber</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>Combination therapy</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>Fluticasone furoate nasal spray</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>Levocetirizine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S5"><title>Introduction</title><p>The prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR) has increased both globally<xref rid="C1">1</xref> and in Japan<xref rid="C2">2</xref>. The prevalence of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) caused by Japanese cedar (JC) has increased over the past 10 years and is now estimated to affect up to 26% of the Japanese population, according to nationwide surveillance data<xref rid="C2">2</xref>. Therefore, JC pollinosis has become a significant disease in Japan.</p><p>SAR symptoms, including rhinorrhea, sneezing attacks, nasal congestion, eye itching, and eye tearing, disturb not only daily life, but also socioeconomics<xref rid="C3">3</xref>. These symptoms are known to have a negative impact on daily work, school performance, and quality-of-life<xref rid="C3">3</xref>,<xref rid="C4">4</xref>. Therefore, pollinosis patients are eager to receive appropriate medication against SAR symptoms.</p><p>According to the ARIA guidelines<xref rid="C5">5</xref>, a second-generation H1-anti-histamine (AH) is recommended as the first line therapy in patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms, while intra-nasal corticosteroids (INSs) are recommended for patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms<xref rid="C5">5</xref>. If such a treatment does not have a satisfactory effect, combination therapy with an AH or a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) is possible.</p><p>Systematic reviews have shown that INSs are superior to AHs or LTRAs for the suppression of symptoms of AR<xref rid="C6">6</xref>,<xref rid="C7">7</xref>. In addition, several clinical trials have shown that no clinical advantages exist for combination therapy of SAR, compared with INS monotherapy<xref rid="C7 C8 C9 C10 C11">7&#x02013;11</xref>. Although INSs could be considered as the most efficient drugs among several classes of medications for the treatment of AR, the proportion of prescriptions for AHs and combination therapy of AH and INS were both higher than that for INS monotherapy according to surveys conducted in the US<xref rid="C12">12</xref> and in Europe<xref rid="C13">13</xref>.</p><p>The Japanese guidelines for AR (JP-MRG) discuss and recommend treatment plans for patients with JC pollinosis in consideration of the circumstances in Japan<xref rid="C2">2</xref>. The strategy for treating pollinosis is described in detail according to disease severity and type (rhinorrhea and sneezing-dominant type and/or nasal congestion dominant type). For instance, the daily use of an INS is recommended in case of moderate/severe pollinosis with nasal congestion-dominant symptoms or with all three symptoms. If the efficacy is not sufficient, additional treatment with an AH and/or LTRA is recommended.</p><p>Many JC pollinosis patients consult not only ENT doctors, but also general physicians (GPs) or internal medicine doctors (IMs). Second-generation AHs were the most widely prescribed drugs according to a study investigating the prescription patterns for the treatment of JC pollinosis by ENT doctors, GPs, and IMs using a clinical vignette questionnaire<xref rid="C14">14</xref>. Interestingly, GPs and IMs had a lower tendency to use INSs than ENT doctors, even if the patient&#x02019;s symptoms became severe. In addition, an internet survey conducted by Konno and Kubo<xref rid="C15">15</xref> on the attitude of JC pollinosis patients toward drug adherence showed that 72% of the patients who were prescribed AHs (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8599) took the drug(s) regularly, just as prescribed, on the other hand only 38% of the patients who were prescribed INS (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4552) used the drug every day or frequently, while the remainder used the drug on demand. In this respect, INSs are not widely used in Japan because of the preferences of patients and a lack of understanding regarding their efficacy<xref rid="C16">16</xref>. Therefore, the administration of second-generation AHs has been the mainstay of treatment for SAR, and the single use of INS presents difficulties, even if the patient&#x02019;s symptoms are severe, in the present clinical setting in Japan.</p><p>Levocetirizine (LCTZ) is a second-generation AH, approved in Japan in 2009 for the treatment of perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis. LCTZ has exhibited anti-histamine and several anti-inflammatory effects at clinically relevant concentrations in both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> allergic studies<xref rid="C17">17</xref>. A number of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled comparative studies have been published evaluating the efficacy of this drug for the treatment of SAR under natural conditions, and the results showed a significantly greater efficacy for LCTZ, compared with placebo, in reducing the nasal symptom scores and the overall RQLQ scores<xref rid="C18">18</xref>.</p><p>Fluticasone furoate nasal spray (FFNS) is a novel enhanced-affinity intra-nasal corticosteroid that is administered once daily with the onset of symptom relief as early as 8&#x02009;h and providing 24&#x02009;h of symptom relief<xref rid="C19">19</xref>. In addition, few systemic adverse effects have been reported, regardless of the duration of use, because of the low systemic bioavailability<xref rid="C20">20</xref>. FFNS has been shown to be significantly effective for relieving nasal symptoms, compared with placebo, in adult patients with SAR in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies<xref rid="C21">21</xref>. Prior to its approval in Japan in 2010, a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study was conducted to compare the efficacy of the once-daily use of FFNS (110&#x02009;&#x003bc;g) vs the twice-daily use of fluticasone propionate nasal spray (FPNS) (200&#x02009;&#x003bc;g) for the treatment of adult patients with JC pollinosis<xref rid="C22">22</xref>. The results showed that FFNS was effective for improving the nasal symptoms of patients with JC pollinosis and was non-inferior to FPNS.</p><p>Although a combination therapy of an AH and an INS is recommended in the Japanese guidelines for the treatment of SAR<xref rid="C2">2</xref>, little clinical evidence of the efficacy of such a regimen has been available in Japan to date. Therefore, we assessed the clinical efficacy of the combination therapy with FFNS and LCTZ, compared with LCTZ monotherapy, for suppressing nasal and ocular symptoms under well-controlled conditions in an OHIO Chamber.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S0006-S2001" disp-level="2"><title>Study population</title><p>Healthy subjects aged 20&#x02013;65 years of age who had a history of Japanese cedar pollinosis, of at least 2 years, with moderate-to-severe symptoms and who had a positive CAP-RAST score (class&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2) for Japanese cedar were recruited.

All the adverse events were mild and were regarded as being unrelated to the test drugs or study procedure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first comparative study to investigate the efficacy of combination therapy with FFNS plus LCTZ and LCTZ monotherapy in a controlled JC pollen exposure setting while assessing the cumulative incidence of nasal symptoms and the time of occurrence as primary end-points. The evaluation of onset of symptoms was thought to be clinically significant as well as evaluation of nasal and ocular symptoms. Our results clearly demonstrated that combination therapy with FFNS and LCTZ, administered on the night prior to the pollen exposure, suppressed the symptoms induced by JC pollen exposure in the OHIO chamber, compared with LCTZ monotherapy or placebo, and significantly delayed the onset of symptoms. All the subjects in the placebo group developed nasal symptoms, while three and eight subjects in the monotherapy and combination groups, respectively, did not show any nasal symptoms during exposure. The scores for nasal and ocular symptoms in both treatment groups were significantly lower than those in the placebo group. For individual symptoms, significant differences in the scores for rhinorrhea and nasal congestion, but not for sneezing and the two ocular symptoms, were observed between the combination and monotherapy groups.</p><p>Second generation AHs are usually effective against sneezing and rhinorrhea through H<sub>1</sub> receptor blockade but are less effective against nasal congestion, which is induced by mediators other than histamine<xref rid="C5">5</xref>,<xref rid="C24">24</xref>. LCTZ is a potent anti-allergic drug, classified as a second-generation antihistamine, with an early onset of action and a long duration of effects on the symptoms of AR<xref rid="C25">25</xref>. Some studies have shown that LCTZ improves not only sneezing and rhinorrhea, but also nasal congestion in patients with AR when analyzed using subjective scores or objective measurements (rhinomanometry)<xref rid="C26 C27 C28">26&#x02013;28</xref>. In this study, the individual nasal scores (sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and nasal itching) measured during the exposure period were significantly lower in the LCTZ monotherapy group compared with the placebo group. In terms of the cumulative incidence of nasal symptoms, however, the suppression of nasal congestion in the monotherapy group was not as prominent as the suppressions of the other nasal symptoms. The present result showed that combination therapy with FFNS and LCTZ was superior to LCTZ monotherapy for the suppression of nasal congestion. Interestingly, the scores for non-nasal symptoms, such as eye itching and tearing, were significantly lower in the monotherapy group than in the placebo group.</p><p>Previously, five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies investigated the efficacy of LCTZ and other active antihistamines in ragweed-sensitive patients subjected to environmental pollen exposure facilities<xref rid="C28 C29 C30 C31 C32">28&#x02013;32</xref>. Of these, two studies were conducted in the Vienna Challenge Chamber (VCC) in a cross-over design and compared the efficacy of levocetirizine, loratadine/fexofenadine, and placebo<xref rid="C28">28</xref>,<xref rid="C29">29</xref>. Two other comparative studies were conducted in an environmental exposure unit (EEU) by Day <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="C30">30</xref>,<xref rid="C31">31</xref> and in an environmental exposure chamber (EEC) by Patel and Patel <xref rid="C32">32</xref> to evaluate the efficacy of levocetirizine with desloratadine or montelukast as a control medicine in studies with a parallel-group design. These studies demonstrated that LCTZ was significantly more effective than other active AHs and placebo in reducing AR symptoms induced by pollen exposure and that LCTZ had a faster onset of action (0.75&#x02013;2.5&#x02009;h). The present study, despite differences in the study design, confirmed the efficacy of LCTZ for suppressing the development of AR symptoms, compared with placebo, even when administered in advance prior to pollen exposure.</p><p>INSs are potent drugs that are usually effective not only for nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal itching, but also for ocular symptoms, such as ocular itching and tearing, in adults and children with SAR and perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR); these effects arise through different kinds of pharmacologic actions via the binding of corticosteroids to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors, resulting in strong anti-inflammatory effects<xref rid="C33">33</xref>. Therefore, INSs are recommended for the treatment of moderate or severe symptoms of AR.</p><p>FFNS is a recently developed intra-nasal corticosteroid that is administered once daily and has a potent anti-inflammatory effect. FFNS has few systemic adverse effects due to its low bioavailability. Its significant efficacy in the relief of nasal symptoms, compared with placebo, has been demonstrated in adult and adolescent patients with SAR in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies<xref rid="C19">19</xref>,<xref rid="C34">34</xref>. An exposure chamber trial conducted by Zieglmayer <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="C35">35</xref> in the VCC evaluated the efficacy of a 1-week treatment with high-dose (200&#x02009;&#x000b5;g) FFNS in grass-pollen sensitized patients and showed a significant reduction in AR symptoms and a long duration of effects. However, no previous study has investigated the efficacy of an optimal dose of FFNS administered in a pollen exposure facility.</p><p>We did not examine FFNS monotherapy in this study in consideration of the actual circumstances in Japan, where the prescription rate for INSs by GPs and the use of INSs in patients with pollinosis are both relatively low<xref rid="C14">14</xref>,<xref rid="C16">16</xref>. The addition of FFNS to LCTZ, however, demonstrated a significant suppression and delay in the development of nasal symptoms, compared with LCTZ monotherapy, in the present study, indirectly but clearly indicating the potent efficacy of FFNS. These results seem to be consistent with a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group EEU study reported by Day e<italic>t al</italic>.<xref rid="C36">36</xref>, who investigated the onset of action and the efficacy of the single use of two doses of intranasal budesonide aqueous nasal spray (BANS), an INS for the treatment of AR, in ragweed-sensitized subjects to whom the test drugs were administered after the development of symptoms<xref rid="C36">36</xref>. They found that BANS had a faster onset of action and a larger impact on the reduction of nasal symptoms than placebo.</p><p>Oral anti-histamines and intra-nasal steroids have different mechanisms of action on allergic reactions. The former exert a rapid reduction in early-phase AR symptoms, such as sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal itching, through their effects on histamine<xref rid="C5">5</xref>, while the latter have inhibitory effects mainly on late-phase AR reactions through the reduction of inflammatory cell recruitment and inflammatory mediator release<xref rid="C33">33</xref>. Therefore, a combination therapy involving both an AH and an INS might have combined effects on allergen-induced symptoms and seems to be of clinical benefit. However, previous studies that investigated the clinical efficacy of a combination therapy with INS and AH compared with INS or AH administered alone for the treatment of SAR showed that combination therapy was non-inferior and not superior to INS monotherapy, with no clinical benefit<xref rid="C7 C8 C9 C10 C11">7&#x02013;11</xref>. Despite these clinical study results, conflicting data exist regarding the prescription rates for medications for the treatment of AR. The prescription rates for AH, a combination of AH and INS, and INS alone were 42.8%, 31.4%, and 14.8%, respectively, in a pan-European study<xref rid="C13">13</xref> and 31.5%, 42.3%, and 21.5%, respectively, in an American study<xref rid="C12">12</xref>. Interestingly, the prescription rate for a combination of AH and INS was much higher (66%) in a survey in Spain<xref rid="C37">37</xref>. Similarly, the rate of single-use of INS treatments in Japan was relatively low according to a questionnaire survey conducted over the internet<xref rid="C14">14</xref>, despite the large number of JC pollinosis patients with moderate/severe symptoms.</p><p>Our results showed that combination therapy with FFNS and LCTZ provided significant suppression of nasal and ocular symptoms from the start to the end of pollen exposure in terms of the cumulative incidence of symptoms and the symptom scores, compared with placebo. Nasal symptoms, especially nasal congestion, were more efficiently suppressed during the latter half of the study period in the combination group, compared with the monotherapy group. Of note, significantly lower nasal scores were observed in the combination group at home on the day of and on the day after exposure, compared with the monotherapy and placebo groups. The combination therapy, however, did not result in a more efficacious suppression of ocular symptoms, compared with the monotherapy, the long-term use of FFNS might be necessary to obtain clinical efficacy for the suppression of ocular symptoms, as indicated in the previous clinical studies<xref rid="C21">21</xref>,<xref rid="C34">34</xref>.</p><p>There are some limitations to the present study. Usually INSs need several days of administration to achieve their full anti-inflammatory efficacy, while only one application of FFNS was used in this study in consideration of Japanese circumstances. Antigen challenge studies using exposure chambers are conducted under well-controlled conditions, but the restricted area places some limitations on the subjects&#x02019; actions. And the subjects are exposed to pollen allergens for a short period of time, while in the real world pollen exposure is much longer and variable. Although these circumstances differ from those experienced during real life, a recent study demonstrated that symptoms elicited in such a chamber are similar to those observed during pollen season under natural conditions<xref rid="C38">38</xref>. Thus, this study design and the study results are considered to be valid for clinical settings.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study demonstrated that the combination therapy of FFNS and LCTZ, in the OHIO chamber, was more efficacious for suppressing or preventing nasal symptoms than LCTZ monotherapy, which is the mainstay of treatment for JC pollinosis. Although the present study was conducted in an artificial pollen exposure chamber outside the pollen season, the results provide the first evidence of a beneficial effect for the treatment of SAR in Japan.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to express their gratitude to the staff members of the Samoncho Clinic, where this study was conducted.
