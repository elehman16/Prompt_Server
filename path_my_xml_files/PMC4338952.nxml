Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF; also known as gastro-resistant DMF) is a novel oral agent for the treatment of relapsing MS. Evidence from preclinical studies suggests that DMF exerts anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective activity mediated in part through the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) transcriptional pathway.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>In the Phase 3 DEFINE<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and CONFIRM<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> trials, DMF 240&#x000a0;mg twice daily (BID) and three times daily (TID) demonstrated efficacy across a broad range of clinical and MRI endpoints over a 2-year time period, combined with an acceptable safety profile. In both studies, DMF significantly reduced the annualized relapse rate (ARR), risk of relapse, mean number of new/enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions, odds of having more gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions, and mean number of new nonenhancing T1-hypointense lesions, relative to placebo. DMF also reduced the risk of 12-week confirmed disability progression in both studies, but the effect was statistically significant in DEFINE only. The lack of a significant effect on 12-week confirmed disability progression in CONFIRM may have been related to the lower rate of disability progression in the placebo group in CONFIRM compared with DEFINE, which contributed to decreased assay sensitivity of the study.</p><p>To further investigate the therapeutic effect of DMF, a prespecified integrated analysis of efficacy and safety data from DEFINE and CONFIRM was conducted. The integrated analysis, which has increased sample size compared with the individual studies derived from the greater number of patients analyzed (over 750 patients per treatment group), has two clear benefits with regard to efficacy endpoints: it allows for a more precise estimate of DMF's therapeutic effect than can be obtained from either study in isolation, and it permits evaluation of the consistency of this effect across prespecified patient subgroups, with reduced variability. Data pooling was achievable because of the many similarities between the studies: both were multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials with equal treatment group randomization ratios; both were conducted in the same regions; both involved the same dosing regimens of DMF, nearly identical inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the same efficacy endpoints measured at the same time points, using the same criteria to define clinical relapses and disease progression and the same Independent Neurological Evaluation Committee members to confirm relapses; and in both, the same MRI lesion methodology was used across MRI reader centers. Importantly, the integrated analysis was to be conducted only if baseline characteristics and treatment effects were homogeneous across the studies.</p><p>Here, we describe the results of the integrated analysis of efficacy endpoints in the overall intent-to-treat (ITT) population (MRI cohort for MRI endpoints) and in patient subgroups stratified by baseline demographics and disease characteristics. The results of the integrated analysis of safety endpoints are described in a companion publication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and study design</title><p>Methodological details of the DEFINE (NCT00420212) and CONFIRM (NCT00451451) studies have been reported previously.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Briefly, DEFINE and CONFIRM were multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 2-year, Phase 3 studies of DMF in people with relapsing MS. Eligible patients were aged 18&#x02013;55&#x000a0;years and had a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) according to McDonald criteria<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>; an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> of 0&#x02013;5.0, inclusive; and at least one clinically documented relapse within 1&#x000a0;year prior to randomization with a prior brain MRI demonstrating lesions consistent with MS, or at least one Gd+ lesion on a brain MRI scan obtained within 6&#x000a0;weeks prior to randomization. Patients were recruited at 198 sites in 28 countries.</p><p>In DEFINE, patients were randomized to receive DMF 240&#x000a0;mg BID or TID or placebo for up to 96&#x000a0;weeks. In CONFIRM, patients were randomized to receive DMF 240&#x000a0;mg BID or TID, placebo, or glatiramer acetate (GA; reference comparator) 20&#x000a0;mg injected subcutaneously once daily for up to 96&#x000a0;weeks. Patients receiving GA were aware of their group assignment. Randomization was performed centrally and stratified according to site. In both studies, patients randomized at sites with validated MRI capabilities had the option of participating in the MRI portion of the study (MRI cohort). Neurological exams, conducted by an examining neurologist who was blinded to the patients' treatment assignments, were held every 12&#x000a0;weeks for efficacy assessments and at the time of suspected relapse. MRI scans were scheduled at baseline and weeks 24, 48, and 96.</p><p>The primary endpoints of DEFINE and CONFIRM were the proportion of patients relapsed and ARR, respectively, at 2&#x000a0;years. Additional endpoints at 2&#x000a0;years included 12-week confirmed disability progression as measured by EDSS, number of new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions, number of Gd+ lesions, and number of new nonenhancing T1-hypointense lesions, all at 2&#x000a0;years. A preplanned sensitivity analysis was performed in which disability progression was to be confirmed after 24&#x000a0;weeks. Patients had the option of discontinuing study treatment and initiating treatment with an approved, open-label, alternative MS medication if they completed 48&#x000a0;weeks of study treatment and experienced one or more confirmed relapses after 24&#x000a0;weeks (DEFINE) or if they completed 48&#x000a0;weeks of study treatment and experienced two confirmed relapses at any time (CONFIRM). In both studies, patients had the option of discontinuing study treatment and initiating treatment with an approved, open-label, alternative MS medication if they had 12-week confirmed progression of disability at any time.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The preplanned integrated analysis included patients randomized to receive placebo or DMF BID or TID. Patients randomized to receive GA were excluded from this analysis because there was no GA comparator arm in DEFINE, and because CONFIRM was not designed to test the superiority or noninferiority of DMF to GA.</p><p>The integrated efficacy analysis was performed on data from the ITT population, which included patients who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of study drug. MRI endpoints were analyzed using ITT patients in the MRI cohort for whom at least one MRI scan was available for analysis. Data from patients who elected to switch to an alternative MS treatment were excluded as of the date the alternative treatment was administered. MRI lesion count data post-early withdrawals or post-alternative MS treatment usage were imputed using a constant rate assumption. Since the main purpose of the integrated analysis was to provide a more precise estimate of the treatment effect of DMF rather than hypothesis testing, no adjustment for multiplicity was made in analyses of pooled data.</p><p>ARR (total number of relapses divided by patient-years in the study, excluding data obtained after patients switched to alternative MS medications) was analyzed with the use of a negative binomial regression model adjusted for region (1 [United States], 2 [Western European countries, Canada, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and South Africa], or 3 [Eastern European countries, India, Guatemala, and Mexico]); baseline age (&#x0003c;40 vs. &#x02265;40 years); baseline EDSS score (&#x02264;2.0 vs. &#x0003e;2.0); number of relapses in the year prior to study entry; and study (DEFINE vs. CONFIRM). Regions were predefined based on geography, type of health care system, and access to health care in each country. The proportion of patients relapsed was derived using Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis and analyzed with the use of a Cox proportional hazards model,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> with study as a stratifying factor and adjusted for region, baseline age (&#x0003c;40 vs. &#x02265;40 years), baseline EDSS score (&#x02264;2.0 vs. &#x0003e;2.0), and number of relapses in the year prior to study entry. For subgroup analyses, the same statistical models were used except for the subgroup factor of interest (see below). Disability progression as measured by EDSS (12-week and 24-week confirmation) was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model with study as a stratifying factor, and adjusted for the following covariates: region, baseline EDSS score (as a continuous variable), and baseline age (&#x0003c;40 vs. &#x02265;40 years). Negative binomial regression was used to analyze the number of new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions (covariates: region, study and baseline T2-hyperintense volume) and the number of new T1-hypointense lesions (covariates: region, study, and baseline T1-hypointense volume). Ordinal logistic regression was used for the analysis of the odds of having new Gd+ lesions (covariates: region, study, and baseline number of Gd+ lesions).</p></sec><sec><title>Subgroup analyses</title><p>Additional efficacy analyses were conducted to evaluate clinical endpoints (ARR, risk of relapse, and risk of 12-week confirmed disability progression) and MRI endpoints (mean number of T2-hyperintense lesions, number of Gd+ lesions, and mean number of new nonenhancing T1-hypointense lesions) at 2&#x000a0;years in prespecified patient subgroups stratified by gender, age (&#x0003c;40 or &#x02265;40&#x000a0;years), region (1, 2, or 3), relapses in the year prior to study entry (&#x02264;1 or &#x02265;2), McDonald criteria (1 or 2&#x02013;4), prior MS treatment (treated or treatment-na&#x000ef;ve), EDSS score (&#x02264;2.0 or &#x0003e;2.0), T2-hyperintense lesion volume (MRI cohort only; &#x02264;median or &#x0003e;median), and Gd+ lesions (MRI cohort only; absent or present).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>The ITT population for the integrated efficacy analysis comprised 2301 patients randomized to receive placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;771) or DMF BID (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;769) or TID (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;761).

The demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the MRI cohort were similar to those of the non-MRI cohort. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar across treatment groups (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). There were slight differences between DEFINE and CONFIRM in baseline characteristics, regional enrollment, and rescue criteria, but these differences were not associated with a substantially different treatment effect and did not preclude a pooled analysis.

Over 2&#x000a0;years, DMF 240&#x000a0;mg BID and TID demonstrated significant and sustained reductions versus placebo on a range of clinical and MRI outcome measures in the overall ITT population and MRI cohort and across patient subgroups. In terms of clinical endpoints, treatment with DMF reduced ARR, risk of relapse, and risk of 12-week and 24-week confirmed disability progression, compared with placebo. On MRI endpoints, DMF reduced the mean number of new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions, Gd+ lesion activity, and mean number of new nonenhancing T1-hypointense lesions, compared with placebo. Hence, the robust data set of the integrated analysis corroborates the clinical and neuroradiological findings from the individual studies, including the finding from DEFINE that DMF therapy significantly reduces the risk of confirmed disability progression.</p><p>A major benefit of the integrated analysis is that it allows for further investigation of treatment effects in subgroups of patients stratified by baseline demographic and disease characteristics. Whereas previous subgroup analyses of DEFINE and CONFIRM were limited by sample size, particularly with regard to neuroradiological endpoints measured in a subset of patients,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> the integrated analysis could examine a range of clinical and neuroradiological measures with reduced variability due to the increased sample size. The results indicate that the effects seen in the overall ITT population and MRI cohort were generally mirrored in the prespecified patient subgroups, with directionality uniformly in favor of DMF.</p><p>The integrated analysis was considered appropriate due to similarities between DEFINE and CONFIRM in terms of study design, patient baseline demographic and disease characteristics, treatment history, and treatment effects, but it was not without limitations. The <italic>P</italic>-values are only informational as they represent the variability in the estimated treatment effect rather than a formal test of superiority of DMF versus placebo. To provide pivotal evidence for an indication, the required degree of significance in the integrated analysis has to be judged on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as amount of supportive data, differences in study design, and consistency between the findings of the individual studies. Despite the many similarities between the two studies, some noticeable differences include the different options for discontinuing study treatment and initiating treatment with an approved, open-label, alternative MS medication due to one or multiple confirmed relapses. In addition, the 12-week confirmed disability progression results were statistically significant in DEFINE but not in CONFIRM, although a clinically meaningful treatment effect on disability progression was observed in CONFIRM, with the 95% confidence interval overlapping with that from DEFINE. The difference in disability progression results between the studies may be related to the relatively low rate of disability progression in the placebo group in CONFIRM (17%) compared with DEFINE (27%). The subgroup analyses provide reduced variability with increased sample size compared with the individual studies. The 95% confidence intervals were provided to represent the variability in the treatment effect rather than statistical testing of efficacy. Numerous subgroup analyses of different endpoints, dose groups, and subgroup populations may lead to the multiplicity issue. The confidence interval for each subgroup varies in length due to the combination of variability and sample sizes of subgroups.</p><p>An integrated analysis of safety data from DEFINE and CONFIRM has also been conducted, but is beyond the scope of the present paper. A detailed examination of the integrated safety profile is available in a companion publication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The integrated analysis suggests a substantial therapeutic benefit of DMF in the form of strong, consistent efficacy on clinical and neuroradiological outcomes. These effects are broadly consistent across diverse subgroups of patients with varied demographic and disease characteristics, suggesting that DMF may be an appropriate treatment choice for many people with RRMS.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Karyn M.
