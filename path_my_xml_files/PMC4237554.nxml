Once-daily basal insulin is the most convenient strategy for insulin initiation because it is practical and simple to use, but its efficacy is limited since fewer than 40% of patients meet glycaemic targets <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. At this time, intensification of insulin therapy is recommended <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and different approaches can be used <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. The administration of a rapid-acting analogue before the meal associated with the largest postprandial glycaemic value in addition to basal insulin is considered to be more flexible and is usually recommended. Alternatively, a premixed insulin analogue twice daily (bid) may be used, although this strategy is considered to be less flexible and studied <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. There is a lack of head-to-head studies comparing the efficacy and safety of a premixed insulin analogue bid with that of once-daily basal insulin and once-daily prandial insulin as the second insulin therapy step after the initial basal insulin regimen has failed.</p><p>This study was therefore conducted to test the hypothesis that glycaemic control with insulin lispro low mixture (LM25) bid is non-inferior to that achieved with once-daily basal insulin glargine and once-daily prandial insulin lispro (IGL), as measured by the change in HbA1c after 24 weeks of treatment, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycaemic control on once-daily basal insulin glargine and oral antihyperglycaemic medication (metformin and/or pioglitazone).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design and Interventions</title><p>This multinational, open-label, randomized, parallel-arm, non-inferiority, phase IV trial compared the efficacy and safety of two insulin intensification strategies in patients with type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled on once-daily basal insulin glargine and metformin and/or pioglitazone.</p><p>Patients entered a 2-week screening period, and those eligible for the study were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio, using a computer-generated random sequence, to subcutaneous LM25 (insulin lispro protamine suspension 75% and insulin lispro solution 25%) bid or IGL for 24 weeks. Patients continued taking their stable dose of metformin and/or pioglitazone throughout the study, unless dose modifications were required for safety reasons. Insulin LM25 was administered before breakfast and dinner, whereas basal insulin glargine was administered at bedtime and prandial insulin lispro was administered before the largest meal of the day [defined as the meal with the highest 2-h postprandial blood glucose concentration, as determined from three separate 7-point self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) profiles recorded during the screening period]. The initial total daily dose of insulin LM25 was equivalent to the patient&#x02018;s last dose of insulin glargine, although the total daily dose was split into two equally sized doses. Patients in the IGL group continued on the same dose of insulin glargine that they were receiving during the screening period and initiated insulin lispro 4 IU daily.</p><p>Randomization was stratified by country and baseline HbA1c concentration (&#x0003c;8.5% or &#x02265;8.5%). All patients provided written informed consent and the study was conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, Good Clinical Practices and the ethical principles who have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>At the screening visit, patients provided a medical history including pre-existing conditions, concomitant medications, previous diabetes treatments and current dosages of antihyperglycaemic medications; they underwent a physical examination; and they provided a fasting blood sample to allow measurement of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) at a central laboratory.</p><p>At the beginning, at regular intervals throughout, and at the completion of the 24-week treatment period, patient data were collected including weight and vital signs, blood glucose data and adverse events, including hypoglycaemia. Patients completed 7-point SMBG profiles within the 2 weeks before weeks 4, 12 and 24 of study treatment or before an early discontinuation visit if applicable. Patients recorded medication usage, blood glucose measurements and episodes of hypoglycaemia or any other adverse events throughout the treatment period. For each hypoglycaemia episode, patients recorded details of the signs, symptoms, treatment, associated blood glucose concentrations, if obtained, and recovery.</p><p>Clinic or telephone visits were scheduled every 2 weeks during the first 12 weeks of treatment and every 4 weeks thereafter; additional visits were permitted at any time. Investigators reviewed patient diaries and adjusted the patients study insulin doses on an individual basis at each scheduled clinic or telephone visit, if appropriate, according to insulin titration algorithms based on those from previous publications (Table S1, Supporting Information) <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>.</p><p>Health outcomes questionnaires [the Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ) and Perceptions About Diabetes-Medications 21 (PAM-D21)] were completed at the beginning and completion of the study treatment period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients were aged between &#x02265;18 and &#x02264;75 years with type 2 diabetes <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and had HbA1c levels &#x02265;7.5 and &#x02264;10.5% at the screening visit; a FPG concentration &#x02264;6.7 mmol/l at the screening visit, as determined by central laboratory, or &#x0003e;6.7 mmol/l if the investigator considered further titration of basal insulin glargine was not possible for safety reasons; and were receiving stable doses of metformin (&#x02265;1500 mg/day for at least 8 weeks) and/or a stable dose of pioglitazone [&#x02265;30 mg/day (&#x02265;15 mg/day in Korea)] for at least 12 weeks (fixed dose combinations were acceptable) before screening. All patients must have been receiving treatment with once-daily basal insulin glargine for at least 90 days before the first screening visit.</p><p>Non-pregnant women who were taking precautions against pregnancy or were unable to become pregnant were eligible. Patients were excluded from the study if they had a body mass index (BMI) &#x0003e;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup> at first screening visit; diagnosis of type 1 diabetes; stable dose of pioglitazone greater than the maximum dose approved for use in combination with insulin in their country; history of more than 2 weeks of scheduled prandial insulin use (including mixtures) within 12 weeks of screening; more than one episode of severe hypoglycaemia within 24 weeks before screening; history of concomitant disorders that contraindicated use of study medications; or were currently participating, or had previously participated, in another study within 30 days of screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in HbA1c levels after 24 weeks of treatment. Secondary efficacy endpoints were the change in HbA1c levels from baseline to 12 weeks; the proportion of patients who achieved a target HbA1c of &#x0003c;7.0 or &#x02264;6.5% at 24 weeks; the change in FPG concentration from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks; 7-point SMBG profiles at 12 and 24 weeks; glycaemic variability, defined as the standard deviation in 7-point SMBG profiles at 12 and 24 weeks; daily insulin doses (total, basal and prandial) at 12 and 24 weeks; and the change in weight from baseline at 12 and 24 weeks.</p><p>Safety and tolerability were measured by treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and the incidence, rate and severity of hypoglycaemic episodes (categorized as overall and documented symptomatic &#x02264;3.9 mmol/l, nocturnal and severe).</p><p>The patients&#x02018; satisfaction with their insulin treatment was assessed using the ITSQ <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>.

The recruitment target was set at 478 patients, assuming that 20% of patients would not qualify for the PP population.</p><p>The primary analysis was a gated procedure that tested the two treatment regimens with respect to the change from baseline in HbA1c to 24 weeks for non-inferiority and, if this was met, for superiority. Non-inferiority of LM25 to IGL was concluded if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the treatment difference (LM25 minus IGL) was entirely below 0.4%. The treatment difference was estimated using a likelihood-based mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis with baseline HbA1c as a covariate; treatment, country, week of visit and the treatment-by-week interaction as fixed effects; and patient and error as random effects. This analysis was performed on the PP population. For superiority testing, the same model was applied to the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. This hierarchical testing procedure required no adjustment of significance levels to maintain the overall significance level at 5%.</p><p>The PP population was defined as all randomized patients except those who did not complete the study or were substantially non-compliant; received study drug different from their randomized study treatment; or violated study inclusion, exclusion or discontinuation criteria. The ITT population was defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug.</p><p>Changes in FPG, SMBG profile measures and glycaemic variability were analysed using MMRM. The model included the baseline value of the variable being tested treatment, country, baseline HbA1c stratification level, visit and the treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects; and patient as random effects.</p><p>The number of hypoglycaemic events per patient-year was estimated using a generalized linear model with the assumption of an underlying negative binomial distribution.</p><p>ITSQ and PAM-D21 questionnaires were analysed using analysis of covariance (<sc>ancova</sc>). Last observation carried forward (LOCF) was applied to these analyses, and missing items handled according to the corresponding scoring algorithm.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Of the 743 patients screened for participating in the study, 476 were randomized to 24 weeks of treatment with LM25 (n = 236) or IGL (n = 240) and received at least one dose of study drug; an additional two patients were randomized to IGL but received no study treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>).

The published head-to-head data we identified typically involved the use of multiple prandial insulin doses <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, in contrast with the single prandial dose used in the basal&#x02013;prandial insulin regimen in our study. However, Riddle et al. studied three strategies to initiate and progress insulin therapy, and compared basal plus one prandial and basal plus up to three prandial injections with premixed insulin bid <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.</p><p>In this study, patients had inadequate glycaemic control, defined as baseline HbA1c&#x02265;7.5% and a FPG concentration of &#x02264;6.7 mmol/l (or &#x0003e;6.7 mmol/l if further titration of basal insulin glargine was not possible for safety reasons or previous recent measurements confirmed that the screening test results were not consistent with the patient&#x02018;s clinical situation). Collectively, these inclusion criteria ensured that enrolled patients had inadequate glycaemic control on their baseline treatment regimen, and required advancing insulin therapy that also targeted postprandial glycaemia. The improvement in HbA1c was achieved without a clinically significant effect on FPG, suggesting that it was mainly the postprandial component of hyperglycaemia that was reduced. These results are consistent with other communications <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, probably reflecting the fact that the basal insulin glargine regimen had already been optimized in these patients and the need was for additional prandial coverage. Our study differs from others in that we did not include a run-in period to optimize insulin glargine, although it seems that we correctly identified patients who were already receiving optimized doses of basal insulin, as shown by the FPG concentration &#x02264;6.7 mmol/l. This can be seen as a more pragmatic approach which is applicable in real life clinical practice.</p><p>Although data comparing bid insulin regimens are lacking, the non-inferiority of LM25 compared with IGL in this study could be expected. The impact on postprandial glycaemia after breakfast and dinner with LM25 should show at least similar results to the addition of a single injection of insulin lispro with the main meal. Despite the significant decrease in HbA1c in both groups after 24 weeks, the percentages of patients attaining goals of &#x0003c;7.0 or &#x02264;6.5% were low, in agreement with other reports <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, which might indicate the need for further treatment intensification or that patients entered the study with high baseline HbA1c levels. We cannot speculate on the potential results of a long-term follow-up, as our study was designed to compare two insulin intensification strategies as a first step after the initial insulin regimen had failed, with a duration that was similar to that of other studies of this type <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we did not observe significant differences between the two groups with regard to the total, basal or prandial insulin doses used. Interestingly, no obvious differences seemed to exist in the split (basal/prandial) between the groups, although the prandial dose was divided into two for patients receiving LM25, whereas there was only one prandial injection for the IGL group. Hypoglycaemia has typically been a concern when premixed insulin is considered as a treatment option. In this study, as opposed to that of Riddle et al. <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, we did not find any significant difference in the proportions of patients experiencing overall, symptomatic, asymptomatic or nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes with LM25 and IGL. There were only two patients in the LM25 group with severe hypoglycaemia, but neither of them had to be discontinued from the study. We consider that the mean observed changes in weight were not clinically relevant, and this may be related to the lack of observed differences in insulin dose at the end of the study.</p><p>Several factors require consideration when making the final decision regarding the best therapeutic option for an individual patient, such as patient&#x02018;s lifestyle, extent of education on the disease, likely compliance with therapy and the available resources <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Convenient and effective insulin intensification regimens are important as studies have shown that, despite a knowledge of glycaemic targets, insulin regimens used in clinical practice are often inadequate to achieve or maintain good control <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. In this study, the lack of differences observed in responses to the questionnaires suggests that both regimens are likely to be similarly accepted as therapeutic options by patients with type 2 diabetes. However, that the number of daily injections was same in both groups, and that all patients were previously receiving insulin, may have accounted for the lack of differences observed in responses to the questionnaires.</p><p>Limitations of this study included the open-label design, dictated by the fact that the two regimens used insulin with different appearances, dosing requirements and injection devices. That the mealtime bolus was given with the same meal throughout the study and no flexibility in dose scheduling was allowed may also have been limitations; however, we believe that this would not have had an impact on study results, as the bolus was given with the largest daily meal (previously defined by glucose values and patients&#x02018; reports), irrespective of the country, diet or time of the day. The study was not powered to assess potential differences between the insulin regimens depending on the timing of the main meal, so any impact of this on glycaemic profile, variability or hypoglycaemia incidence may be further assessed in future studies. The study duration may be seen as a limitation, as long-term effects of these or further intensification strategies were not explored. However, the study was designed to determine patient outcomes after the first insulin intensification step only, and this duration enables comparability with the results of previous studies <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>.</p><p>The heterogeneous nature of the patient population included in this study is both a strength and limitation. Between-country differences may exist in clinical practice guidelines, prescribing practices and dietary habits, and the study was not powered to assess the potential differences between treatment arms in each country/region. In contrast, by conducting the study globally in 11 countries, patients of different ethnic origins were included, thereby improving the generalizability of results. Further studies may be needed to elucidate the best regimen for any specific population/country.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on once-daily basal insulin glargine and metformin and/or pioglitazone, intensification with either LM25 or IGL improved glycaemic control with similar tolerability and acceptability. The reduction in HbA1c after 24 weeks was greater with LM25 than with IGL. The results of our study support current guidelines, and add to the body of evidence supporting the use of both insulin regimens as an option for insulin intensification in patients inadequately controlled with a basal-only insulin regimen plus oral antihyperglycaemic medications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was sponsored by Eli Lilly.
