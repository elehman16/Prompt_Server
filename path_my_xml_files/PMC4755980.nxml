balance increased through muscle-strengthening exercises and pain in knee osteoarthritis
patients. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty knee osteoarthritis patients were equally divided
into a strengthening exercise group and an unstable exercise group. Before and after the
six-week experiment, the visual analogue scale was measured, and bilateral one-leg
standing tests were performed. [Results] In both the strengthening exercise group and
unstable exercise group, the bilateral one-leg standing time significantly increased after
the six-week experiment. Regarding the visual analogue scale, a pain measurement scale,
the strengthening exercise group had significantly decreased pain. The unstable exercise
group also had decreased pain, but the decrease was not statistically significant.
[Conclusion] In knee osteoarthritis patients, exercises using an unstable base of support
and knee-extensor strengthening exercises with gradually increased loads had a positive
effect on improving balance ability and decreasing pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Knee pain</kwd><kwd>Knee exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) triggers continuous changes and destruction of the joints, and it is a
financial burden for patients. Both the information provided by patients and a scientific
approach to their treatment may have positive effects on the health of OA patients&#x02019; joints
and clinical risk<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In patients with OA, knee pain is a main pathological symptom, which may cause decreased
muscle strength. Interventional treatment through muscle-strengthening exercises in the
rehabilitation process may reduce pain and resolve the functional restrictions caused by
pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study of arthritic patients
aged 55 and older found that muscle function decreased, and there was a significantly
negative relationship between age and the maximal contractibility of the quadriceps femoris
muscle<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another study, patients with
degenerative knee arthritis who conducted knee extensor and flexor strengthening exercises
for 12 weeks saw their pain and functional restrictions decrease, and range of motion
increase<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a study on knee OA, radiological examination showed that the cartilage surface was
degenerated, worn, and eroded. However, pain is subjective and may exhibit differences from
radiological results. The perception of pain also differs according to individual conditions
(physical and environmental)<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine knee OA patients whose physical
conditions were controlled in order to conduct knee extensor muscle-strengthening exercises
and standing balance exercises, as well as to examine the relationship between increased
standing balance and subjective pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 30 bilateral knee OA patients with grading scores of 1 or 2 based on the
four grades used in the Kellgren-Lawrence system. The subjects were selected based on their
pathological history and their diagnosis by an orthopedist and a physical therapist. They
were equally divided into a strengthening exercise group (SEG = 15) and an unstable exercise
group (UEG = 15). The subjects were knee OA patients younger than 65&#x02005;years who had full
range of motion in the knee joints and who had not received surgical treatment on their
legs. Patients whose ability to maintain balance was restricted because of central nervous
system disease or visual sense disease were excluded.</p><p>The general characteristics of the subjects were as follows: 61.47&#x000b1;2.26&#x02005;years and
62.40&#x000b1;2.61&#x02005;years for age, 158.33&#x000b1;4.32&#x02005;cm and 159.60&#x000b1;5.33&#x02005;cm for height, and 65.40&#x000b1;6.02&#x02005;kg
and 64.07&#x000b1;5.65&#x02005;kg for weight in the SEG and UEG respectively. There was no statistically
significant difference in the general characteristics of the two groups. All the patients
understood the purpose of the study and provided written informed consent prior to
participation, which was in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p><p>The SEG conducted knee extension exercises in a sitting posture by gradually increasing the
weight from 0&#x02005;kg to 2&#x02005;kg and then to 4&#x02005;kg within the limit of no pain. The UEG stood on an
unstable mat for one week and then on an air cushion (TOGU, Prien am Chiemsee, Germany) to
increase their ability to support their weight on an unstable base. Both groups performed
the exercises twice a day for 15 minutes in each session for six weeks. When the subjects
complained of fatigue, they were allowed to rest, and then the exercise was renewed.</p><p>Before and after the six weeks of exercise, one-leg standing (OLS) tests of the bilateral
legs were conducted. To conduct measurements, a subjective visual analogue scale (VAS) was
divided into a maximum of 1 and a minimum of 10. To compare the two groups, an independent
samples t-test and a paired samples t-test were conducted. The statistical significance
level was set at p &#x0003c;0.05, and the PASW Statistics 18.0 version was utilized.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Prior to the experiment, there were no statistically significant differences between the
SEG, which exercised with gradually increasing weights, and the UEG, which stood on an
unstable base of support. After the six-week experiment, there were also no statistically
significant differences between the two groups (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

the knee extensors and balance ability through standing exercise on an unstable base of
support on the decrease in pain in OA patients.</p><p>Changes in knee joints that result from aging include weakening of the quadriceps femoris
muscle and inability to extend the knee joints completely when the heels contact the ground.
Consequently, the step length is reduced, the base of support is narrowed, and balance
ability is decreased<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ryo et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested including change of duration and
frequency in strength exercise programs for OA patients because changes of duration and
frequency of leg-strengthening exercises decrease knee pain.</p><p>In a recent study that examined muscle strengthening of the knee extensors through a
two-month home treatment program for knee OA patients, the subjects feared falling and
exhibited unstable body sway<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results
showed that muscle-strengthening exercises applied to the knee extensors positively affected
standing balance ability, such as by increasing the bilateral OLS maintenance time.</p><p>Knoop<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> applied a home exercise program
that included muscle-strengthening exercises and balance exercises six minutes per week for
12 weeks in 159 patients with knee instability, including knee OA. The results showed that
the participants&#x02019; knee instability and pain decreased. In a study of the effects of pain in
the knee joints on knee muscle strength, the intensity of the pain restricted knee flexion
and extension. In contrast, therapeutic muscle-strengthening exercises decreased articular
pain, which was conducive to functional improvement of the legs<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a five-year longitudinal study of the relationship
between the quadriceps femoris muscle and knee-pain aggravation, Glass et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> observed a relationship between the risk
of pain aggravation in female OA patients and weakening of the quadriceps femoris muscle. In
a study on knee patients, Ahmed et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>
applied muscle-strengthening exercises to the quadriceps femoris muscle and the hamstring
muscle. The results showed decreases in subjective pain, increases in range of motion, and
decreases in functional restriction. The results of their research were similar to those of
the present study, which found that gradual increases in load led to significant decreases
in pain after muscle-strengthening exercises were conducted.</p><p>The present study divided the subjects into a muscle-strengthening exercise group and a
balance-strengthening exercise group. In the muscle-strengthening group, exercises were
performed to strengthen the knee extensor. The results showed no statistical significance
between the two experimental groups, and in both groups, there were increases in OLS time
and decreases in subjective pain. These results indicate that both the muscle-strengthening
exercises and balance exercises stimulated the proprioceptors, which was effective in
increasing the knee stability of the OA patients. Moreover, the increase in knee stability
was related to the decrease in knee pain.</p><p>In conclusion, in early-stage knee OA patients who had not undergone surgery, balance
exercises using an unstable base of support and knee extensor muscle-strengthening exercises
had positive effects on balance ability, such as in OLS and decreased pain.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Brody</surname><given-names>LT</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Knee osteoarthritis: clinical connections to articular
