Hip arthroscopy has been shown to be safe to the blood supply of the femoral head when performing femoral osteochondroplasty. There are no reports of avascular necrosis of the femoral head after hip arthroscopy from cohort studies. Arthroscopic safe zones have been identified, based on femoral head vascularity studies, that extend from the lateral synovial fold anterior to 12 o clock to the medial synovial fold at 6 o clock. However, advances in technique have allowed for treatment of more extensile posterolateral cam deformities with both arthroscopic and open approaches, and may therefore place a portion of the retinacular vessels at risk for injury. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of an extended arthroscopic femoroplasty on femoral head vascularity. We hypothesized that limited retinacular vessel damage by extending a cam resection posterior to 12 o clock would not cause a significant reduction in femoral head perfusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens with an intact pelvis and bilateral femurs were used. The mean patient age was 66 years (range, 64-69). Each pelvis was randomized to either the Standard Resection (SR) or Wide Resection (WR) group. In the SR group, bone was resected with a motorized burr from the lateral synovial fold at 12 o clock to the medial synovial fold, at a depth of 10mm. In the WR group, bone was resected as in the SR group but was then extended posterolaterally to 11 o clock, damaging the intervening vessels. For each pelvis, one hip was the experimental side and the contralateral hip served as a matched control. Arteriotomy was performed and the medial femoral circumflex artery origin was cannulated. After unilateral arthroscopic resection, all specimens underwent a gadolinium-enhanced MRI with a validated, quantitative protocol. A CT scan was then performed to confirm the zones of osseous resection. Contrast enhancement on MRI was quantified in four quadrants of the femoral head using custom analysis software. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-sided unpaired t-test to assess differences in femoral head perfusion between the specimens in both groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MRI quantification revealed that the perfusion of the entire femoral head was reduced by a mean of 5.0 &#x000b1; 3.9% compared to the matched control side in the SR group. In contrast, femoral head perfusion was reduced by a mean of 11.1 &#x000b1; 16.1% compared to the matched control side in the WR group. The reduction in femoral head perfusion between the SR and WR groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.49). There were no significant differences between groups (p &#x0003e; 0.32). Postoperative CT scans confirmed that all osseous resections in the SR group were within the 12 to 6 o clock arc and all osseous resections in the WR group extended posteriorly beyond 12 o clock but not posterior to 11 o clock.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Posterolateral retinacular vessel damage not extending past 11 o clock results in 11% reduction in femoral head perfusion when performing arthroscopic femoral osteochondroplasty. This drop in perfusion is not significantly different to the reduction in perfusion observed when performing osseous resection within previously recognized vascular safe zones. These findings lend support to the use of hip arthroscopy to address extensile cam deformities, but must also be interpreted with caution as further encroachment on the retinacular vessels may result in a dangerous drop in perfusion.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front></article>
