In a variety of clinical settings, preoperative glucocorticoid administration has improved analgesia and decreased opioid consumption. Our objective was to define the postoperative analgesic efficacy of single dose of dexamethasone administered preoperatively in patients undergoing operative fixation of fractured neck of femur.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Institutional ethical approval was granted and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Patients awaiting for surgery at Cork University Hospital were recruited between July 2009 and August 2012. Participating patients, scheduled for surgery were randomly allocated to one of two groups (Dexamethasone or Placebo). Patients in the dexamethasone group received a single dose of intravenous dexamethasone 0.1&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg <sup>-1</sup> immediately preoperatively. Patients in the placebo group received the same volume of normal saline. Patients underwent operative fixation of fractured neck of femur using standardised spinal anaesthesia and surgical techniques. The primary outcome was pain scores at rest 6 h after the surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Thirty seven patients were recruited and data from thirty patients were analysed. The groups were similar in terms of patient characteristics.

Dexamethasone inhibit cortisol secretion by inhibiting the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. At the pituitary level inhibition involving changes in transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Cortisol exists in free (unbounded) and protein-bound forms in serum but only in a free form in saliva. The free form is the biologically active one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Glucocorticoids are inhibitors of both phospholipase and cyclooxygenase enzyme, intravenously administered dexamethasone 16&#x000a0;mg provides prolonged postoperative analgesia from 24 to 72&#x000a0;h after breast surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Preoperative dexamethasone reduce postoperative nausea, has a prolonged suppressive effect on the inflammatory response and decreases dynamic pain 24&#x000a0;h after total hip arthroplasty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Administration of i.v. dexamethasone prior to intrathecal meperidine injection enhance postoperative analgesia and reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Recently were published two editorials which were emphasised the potential side effects of single dose of dexamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], however the authors agreed that further evidence needed to justify to not administer dexamethasone in patients with low risk for the side effects.</p><p id="Par13">Single dose dexamethasone has not been evaluated for its effects on postoperative pain and the inflammatory response to surgery in surgical fixation of FNF.</p><p id="Par14">In this study, our hypothesis was that preoperative administration of a single dose of dexamethasone 0.1&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg <sup>-1</sup> enhances postoperative analgesia 6 h after the surgery in patients undergoing operative fixation of FNF. Previous clinical studies used dexamethasone from low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] dose to high dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Taking into consideration the anticipated age profile of our patients and the associated lesser metabolic rate we selected a lesser dose, 0.1&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg <sup>-1</sup>, of dexamethasone.

Similar doses of dexamethasone administered intravenously preoperatively decrease total analgesic requirements in patient undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In a recent meta-analysis by Lunn and Kehlet, 17 studies with data from 1081 patients were included and highlighted that high dose of dexamethasone have analgesic effect after hip and knee replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. De Oliveira et al. included 24 randomised clinical trials with 2751 patients in a meta-analysis. There conclusion were similarly, dexamethasone at doses more than 0.1&#x000a0;mg/kg is an effective adjunct in multimodal strategies to reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Prior to this study, the potential analgesic benefits of preoperative dexamethasone to patients undergoing fixation of FNF had not been studied. We believe that such benefits as we have demonstrated have particular significance in this population in view of their possible contribution to rehabilitation, a critical determinant of overall outcome in this setting. Although we did not follow patients in this study to identify subsequent benefits of preoperative dexamethasone or persistent post-surgical pain (PPSP), we and others have demonstrated that the quality of early postoperative pain relief is a consistent and important determinant of the incidence of PPSP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">In the dexamethasone group one patient&#x02019;s preoperative saliva cortisol level was greater than the normal range and the postoperative pain scores were higher than the mean at each time point. This might raise the possibility of patients with high preoperative cortisol levels not benefiting from preoperative low dose dexamethasone. This can be only a theoretic explanation so further research is needed in this field.</p><p id="Par34">Our study has certain limitations. The result is positive in terms of primary outcome; however data were studied from only 13 patients in the dexamethasone group because four patients were excluded. This could have contributed to relative under-powering and Type II error in secondary outcomes. We reported no dexamethasone related side effects. The study was not powered to detect clinically meaningful difference, in terms of dexamethasone related side effects, with regard to safety. Our sample size was small but the study was constructed to demonstrate the analgesic effect of dexamethasone, which may didn&#x02019;t appeared from the pain scores but in the tendency of lower cumulative morphine consumption.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par35">Our findings indicate that single dose of&#x000a0;dexamethasone 0.1&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> administered immediately preoperatively confers significant analgesic benefit in the early postoperative period after the operative fixation of fractured neck of femur. We have also demonstrated that the patients&#x02019; saliva cortisol level were lesser on the first postoperative evening, suggesting an inhibitory effect of the dexamethasone on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>FNF</term><def><p id="Par6">Fractured neck of femur</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRS</term><def><p id="Par7">Numeric rating scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPSP</term><def><p id="Par8">Persistent post-surgical pain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par9">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the participating investigators: Dr. Catarina Luis, Dr. Syed Farjad Sultan and Dr. Alan Roderick for there help in to perform data collection and also thank the nursing staff of the Trauma Theatre in Cork University Hospital for facilitating our work by helping the authors to perform data collection.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par36">Only departmental funding, from the Department of Anaesthesia, Intensive Care and Pain Medicine, Cork University Hospital, was used in the funding of the manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par37">Data will not be shared because containing confidential patient data.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors contributions</title><p id="Par38">SS: participated in the design of the study, coordination of the data collection and in the manuscript preparation.
