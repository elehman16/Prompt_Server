The high percentage of the UK adult population in employment, and the prolonged sitting associated with desk-based office-work, make these workplaces an appropriate setting for interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour and increase physical activity. This pilot study aims to determine the effect of an office-based sit-stand workstation intervention, compared with usual desk use, on daily sitting, standing and physical activity, and to examine the factors that underlie sitting, standing and physical activity, within and outside, the workplace.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A randomised control trial (RCT) comparing the effects of a sit-stand workstation only and a multi-component sit-stand workstation intervention, with usual desk-based working practice (no sit-stand workstation) will be conducted with office workers across two organisations, over a 12&#x000a0;month period (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;30). The multicomponent intervention will comprise organisational, environmental and individual elements. Objective data will be collected at baseline, and after 2-weeks, 3-months, 6-months and 12-months of the intervention. Objective measures of sitting, standing, and physical activity will be made concurrently (ActivPAL3&#x02122; and ActiGraph (GT3X+)). Activity diaries, ethnographic participant observation, and interviews with participants and key organisational personnel will be used to elicit understanding of the influence of organisational culture on sitting, standing and physical activity behaviour in the workplace.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will be the first long-term sit-stand workstation intervention study utilising an RCT design, and incorporating a comprehensive process evaluation. The study will generate an understanding of the factors that encourage and restrict successful implementation of sit-stand workstation interventions, and will help inform future occupational wellbeing policy and practice. Other strengths include the objective measurement of physical activity during both work and non-work hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Trail registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02172599">NCT02172599</ext-link>, 22nd June 2014.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Health</kwd><kwd>Multi-component intervention</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Process evaluation</kwd><kwd>Randomised control trial</kwd><kwd>Sedentary behaviour</kwd><kwd>Sit-stand workstation</kwd><kwd>Sitting</kwd><kwd>Standing</kwd><kwd>Workplace</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Sedentary behaviour (taken from the Latin term <italic>sedere</italic>; to sit) has been operationally defined as any activity that involves an energy expenditure of&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;1.5 METS (metabolic equivalents), performed in seated or lying position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Emerging research evidence identifies sedentary behaviour as a risk factor for negative health outcomes in the adult population; this risk is distinct and independent from risk associated with physical inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A lack of breaks in sedentary time is also related to metabolic disease risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For example, lipoprotein lipase is regulated differently following sedentary behaviour and physical activity; whilst a reduction in LPL activity occurs only in oxidative muscle fibres following sedentary behaviour, physical activity promotes increased LPL activity in glycolytic muscle fibres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Further, a recent intervention study found that self-reported sitting time was significantly associated with a component of DNA; telomere length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] Shortening of telomeres is associated with ageing and onset of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This evolving evidence raises the question, &#x0201c;What should the person who sleeps an average of 8&#x000a0;hours per day [and is physically active for 30&#x000a0;minutes per day] do for the remaining 15.5&#x000a0;hours?&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, research and policy guidelines, such as the UK&#x02019;s &#x02018;Start Active, Stay Active&#x02019; policy are now promoting both increases in physical activity and decreases in sedentary behaviour, stating adults should &#x0201c;<italic>minimise the amount of time spent being sedentary (sitting) for extended periods</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Physical activity has been defined as &#x0201c;any bodily movement&#x02026;that results in energy expenditure&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There is a well-established body of evidence supporting the health benefits of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, physical activity is a complex behaviour; participation differs among different socio-economic groups and in the contexts and environments that contribute to health inequalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the UK, it is estimated that over 73% of working age adults were engaged in full time or part time employment between April 2014 and June 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and that adults spend an average of 60% of the working day at the workplace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Thus, the workplace is an ideal setting for promoting physical activity and reductions in sitting. The office is a particularly important workplace setting, given the high proportion of sedentary time in desk-based office workers. For example, an observational study measured objectively the sedentary behaviour and physical activity of 50 office-based employees for 7 consecutive days; it found that, on average, 81.8% of working hours were spent engaged in sedentary behaviours, compared to 68.9% of non-work hours. Additionally, there were fewer breaks in sedentary time, and less light-intensity activity, during working hours than during non-working hours (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This suggests that office-workers are more sedentary and less active during work than outside work and thus the office-based workplace is a crucial context for intervention to promote increases in physical activity and reductions in prolonged sitting. In desk-based office occupations, prolonged sitting is likely to occur in the context of travelling to work and participating in meetings, however, approximately two-thirds of workplace sitting time is spent at a desk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>One response to reducing sitting time in the workplace is the installation of sit-stand workstations. Sit-stand workstations offer height-adjustable desk equipment for computer screens and keyboards allowing employees a choice of desk-based working positions. Several studies have examined the contribution of sit-stand workstations to a range of sedentary behaviour, health and productivity outcomes. Previous sit-stand workstation intervention studies have seen varying reductions in the amount of time spent sitting, ranging from 66&#x000a0;minutes to 143&#x000a0;minutes per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis of activity-permissive workstations revealed that the reduction in sedentary behaviour is greater in interventions that incorporate a change to the working environment (i.e. an activity-permissive workstation), than interventions that do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Physiological research shows that using a sit-stand workstation for 185&#x000a0;minutes, immediately after eating, can reduce post-prandial glucose excursion by 43% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A recent review of empirical studies examining the relationship between sit-stand workstations and a range of measures of productivity revealed that whilst the majority of studies show that using a sit-stand workstation had no influence on productivity, no studies showed a reduction in productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In line with an ecological approach to behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], initial research has shown that greater reductions in sitting time (56&#x000a0;min/8-hour workday) can be achieved as a result of a multi-component sit-stand workstation intervention (incorporating individual and organisational level components) compared to receiving a sit-stand workstation alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, this needs to be replicated over a prolonged time-period (e.g. 12&#x000a0;months), on outcomes related to physical activity (distinct from sitting, standing and stepping). Whilst the feasibility of using sit-stand workstations has been qualitatively explored with desk-based office workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], outcome-focused studies dominate this research area. Understanding of the social processes that encourage and restrict standing and physical activity in the workplace is required. The absence of systematic and rigorous process evaluations of sit-stand workstation interventions will impede the wider adoption of sit-stand workstations across organisations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p>The primary aim is to determine the effect of a 12&#x000a0;month multi-component sit-stand workstation intervention, incorporating organisational, environmental and individual level strategies, on physical activity within the workplace (primary outcome). Secondary aims are to: determine the effect of the sit-stand workstation intervention on physical activity outside of the workplace (secondary outcome), and to determine whether the multi-component intervention is more effective than the sit-stand workstation provision alone. The process evaluation will examine the factors that influence sitting, standing and active behaviours in the workplace.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>An RCT comparing the effects of a sit-stand workstation only and a multi-component sit-stand workstation intervention, with usual office-based working practice (no sit-stand workstation) will be implemented. The study will be conducted with office workers across two organisations according to Cochrane recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], with &#x02018;individuals&#x02019; being the unit of randomisation. The design employs two intervention arms: (1) a multi-component sit-stand workstation intervention (SS-MC); and (2) sit-stand workstation only (SS-O). A control arm (CG) for usual desk-based working practice (no sit-stand workstation) will also be included. Objective data collection will take place at 5 time-points over the course of 12-months: baseline (approximately one month before desk installation), and then post-installation at 2-weeks, 3-months, 6-months and 12-months.

Participants will be asked to record the behaviour that they spent the most time doing during each hour, during each 7-day objective data collection period. A text message, reminding participants to complete their activity diary, will be sent to participants once daily throughout each data collection period. Text message models have shown success in increasing compliance to data collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="d30e754"><title>Ethnographic participant observation</title><p>This method will be used to understand organisational culture, placing importance on the perceptions of the people under study within their usual environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The ethnographic participant observation will provide insight into the context within which the intervention is taking place; this will elicit understanding of the feasibility and acceptability of sit-stand workstation interventions, and the social processes that underpin use of the sit-stand workstations and physical activity in the workplace. The participant observation involves the lead researcher taking a volunteering role within the participating organisations. There will be three observation phases within each worksite; before the installation of sit-stand workstations, 4&#x02013;5 months following the installation of sit-stand workstations, and 10&#x02013;11 months following the installation of sit-stand workstations. The lead researcher will spend approximately 12 full working days at the workplace during each phase, engaging in work tasks related to physical activity and/or workplace health, set by the volunteering organisation.</p></sec><sec id="d30e762"><title>Key stakeholder and participant interviews</title><p>Qualitative interviews will enable explorations of perceptions and meaning to increase understanding of a particular phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Thus, interviews will be used within this study to delineate the perceptions of both key stakeholders and participants in relation to sit-stand working and physical activity in the workplace, to understand the factors that influence the success (or otherwise) of the sit-stand workstation intervention in influencing sitting and physical activity. Specifically, interviews with participants will explore processes that influence use of sit-stand workstations, such as experiences of standing, relationships with other employees and working identities, and will last approximately 60&#x000a0;minutes. These will take place with 12 participants at two time points; 7-months and 12-months following the installation of sit-stand workstations. Interviews with key stakeholders and decision makers in the implementation process from the participating organisations, will elicit understanding of the feasibility, acceptability and sustainability of the sit-stand workstation intervention. Interviewees will include staff working in employee wellbeing, human resources, IT, health and safety, and facilities, as well as estates personnel and senior directors. Approximately ten stakeholders from each organisation will engage in 45&#x000a0;minute telephone interviews, within two months of sit-stand workstations being installed.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Sample size</title><p>A formal power analysis to determine sample size was not conducted as the threshold for meaningful reductions in sitting is unknown.

All interviews will be recorded using an Olympus LS-11 Dictaphone and transcribed ad verbatim. Qualitative data will be analysed using thematic content analysis via NVivo 10 software. Thematic analysis reports detail-rich data by identifying, analysing and interpreting patterns within the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Analysis will initially involve reading and re-reading the field notes and transcripts to become fully immersed in &#x0201c;the details and specifics of the data&#x0201d; to allow unearthing of patterns, themes and interrelationships ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] p.362).

It is not only necessary to understand <italic>whether</italic> an intervention is effective, but also to understand <italic>why</italic> an intervention is, or is not, feasible, effective or sustainable. Accordingly, the contiguous systematic and rigorous process evaluation integral to this study represents an innovation within this area of research. Eliciting understanding of the social processes that underpin use of sit-stand workstations and physical activity within the workplace is crucial for understanding how to influence behaviour. A strength of the present study is that it will create a comprehensive picture of total physical activity using two objective measures; these will capture sitting, standing, and light, moderate and vigorous physical activity, alongside an activity diary, that will provide contextual information. The latter will include the type and purpose of the activities and the inactive behaviours undertaken. An understanding of the influence of the sit-stand workstation intervention on physical activity during non-work hours will also be permissible, as physical activity will be measured over the course of the entire day. A further strength is the long-term nature of the evaluation, which permits assessment of the sustainability of sit-stand workstation approaches for reducing prolonged sitting and increasing physical activity in the workplace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The findings of this pilot study will provide evidence to guide future research, as well as the development of guidelines and policy to optimise the promotion of workplace health and wellbeing.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>CG</term><def><p>Control group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PHE</term><def><p>Public Health England</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised control trail</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SS-MC</term><def><p>Multi-component sit-stand workstation intervention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SS-WO</term><def><p>Sit-stand workstation only</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>JH conceived of the study, participated in the design of the study and drafted the manuscript.
