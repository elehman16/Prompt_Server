transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on breathing in patients with chronic
stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty chronic stroke patients who do not show
abnormal response to electric stimulation were enrolled in this study and each 15 subjects
were randomized either into the study group and the sham-controlled group. The subjects
performed diaphragmatic breathing exercise for 20 minutes while tDCS device was attached
to them (for study group, the device was on while for the sham-controlled group, the
device was turned off 30 seconds later) [Results] The results of FVC, FEF1 and FEV1/FVC in
the study group and those of FVC and FEV1 in the sham-controlled group were significantly
increased after the breathing exercise. The independent comparison result between the
groups showed that the breathing performance of study group significantly improved based
on the results of FVC and FEV1. [Conclusion] In conclusion, the results of this study
confirmed that breathing exercise effectively improved FVC and FEV1 in chronic stroke
patients. Also, the breathing exercise using tDCS was more effective in improving FVC and
FEV1.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Chronic stroke</kwd><kwd>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)</kwd><kwd>Diaphragmatic breathing exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Hemi-paralysis caused by stroke has damaged central nerve system, in particular, cerebral
cortex, premotor cortex and motor track in cerebrum<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with hemi-paralysis suffer various functional disorder
depending on location of lesions, limited daily activities and cognitive function disorders,
difficulties to exercise or change positions. Their changed muscle tone deteriorates
voluntary exercise functions and causes abnormal functions of entire body<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Abnormal position control and changed muscle tone negatively affects necessary exercise
control that coordinates all muscles involving breathing and circulation of body and
breathing muscles themselves and position control that controls the movement of thorax and
maintains the strength of breathing muscles<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Long-term damaged breathing functions causes functional disorders
of body trunk posture and weakens breathing muscles<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Decreased up-down movement of diaphragm during voluntary breathing
and hyperpnea increases the strength of breathing muscles. Chronic hemi-paralysis patients
have deceased vital capacity due to the weakening of breathing muscles during
inhaling/exhaling and increased remaining amount of airs in the lung that lead to decreased
maximum breath pressure. Moreover, the muscles involving in positions and breathings are
reported to be closely related<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The demands for rehabilitation of patients and their families have rapidly increased and
various physiotherapeutic approach have used so far. Most of central nerve system
regeneration and activation methods do not result in complete regeneration but only
limited<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among recent physiotherapeutic
approaches, many therapeutic methods based on nerve plasticity in related to regeneration
ability of central nerve system started to appear with the development of science.
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a therapeutic method to change the
excitability of local area in brain by applying a 1-2mA of current on the scalp<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. There were several previous studies
including studies on the brain activation for exercise training in healthy subjects<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>,
and spinal network stimulations<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. And
its efficacy and safety has been proved in various studies on cardiovascular system,
automatic functions and safety and efficacy using a tDCS<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most of studies,
however, have been limited to limb or cognitive functions. As such, this study was conducted
to investigate the effect of tDCS on breathing, a primary concern of the recovery for stroke
patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty patients who had stroke more than six months before and currently are hospitalized
were enrolled between June to July 2016. They had no abnormality in pulmonary,
cardiovascular system or adverse reaction to electric stimulation before their brain injury.
The study methods were sufficiently explained to all patients based on Declaration of
Helsinki before the participation. Those who understood the contents and purpose of this
study and voluntarily agreed to participate in this study were enrolled. The subjects were
randomized into either the study or sham-controlled group (15 subjects in each group).</p><p>For the application of tDCS, a Phoresor II Auto PM850 (IOMED<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Salt Lake City,
USA) was used. To stimulate primary motor cortex of damaged side, anode was attached to C3
and C4 based on international 10&#x02013;20 system and cathode was placed supraorbital area of other
side. A 5 &#x000d7; 7 (35&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>) sized sponge electrodes were used to attached on the
scalp. The electrodes were soaked in 0.9% normal saline beforehand and were closely attached
to the skin as possible using a band to give comfortable feelings to patients<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. A spirometer (MicroQuark Italy Cosmed)
was used to measure forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume at one second
(FEV1) and forced expiratory ratio (FEV1/FVC). The results of this study were analyzed using
a SPSS 18.0 for windows for statistical analysis. An independent t-test was used to evaluate
the efficacy analysis before and after the treatment and a paired t-test was performed to
compare the difference between the groups. The significant level was 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics results of the subjects did not show any significant difference

et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that conventional
methods to activate cerebrum cortex with the use of tDCS bring synergic therapeutic effect
and repetitive movement training is required<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study investigated the breathing performance when tDCS was
applied with breathing exercise out of clinical methods for cerebrum cortex activation in
many recent studies.</p><p>In general, chronic stroke patients have lower maximum breath pressure than healthy people
by 21%. Decreased breathing ability causes much fatigue when a patient performs daily
activities or functional movement<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, The
fatigue, in turn, causes imbalanced breathing and changed breathing control pattern due to
increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide and decreased voluntary breathing in the paralyzed
side<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Adequate maintenance of
pulmonary volume and capacity as well as enlargement of thoracic wall and ventilations
should be used to resolve this<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>J. Kim et al. reported that thoracic resistance exercise, diaphragmatic breathing exercise
through thoracic mobility exercise and proprioceptive neuromuscular palpitation resulted in
significant change in FVC, FEV1 and MVV results in their study<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Britto et al. reported in their study on the strength of
breathing muscles that resistant breathing exercise using a device significantly
strengthened the breathing muscles and endurance<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sartori et al. reported that feedback breathing exercise
significantly increased the result of FEV1 in patients with fibrous cysts<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other studies also reported that
breathing exercise effectively strengthened diaphragms and involving breathing muscles and
improved posture control and daily activities<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. These positive results of previous studies are in line with the
result of this study that showed the breathing exercise improved FVC and FEV1 results as in
breathing abilities in both study and sham-controlled groups in patients with chronic
stroke.</p><p>Jeffry et al. (2007) reported that tDCS activated motor evoked potentials from the
activation of the motor cortex of lower limbs in the brain in patients with stroke<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Madhavan et al. also reported that tDCS
could stimulate primary motor cortex to increase the excitability of corticospinal
tract<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nitche et al., however,
reported that tDCS could activate cerebrum cortex one hour or more while no change on
corticospinal tract that connects to the peripheral areas<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The result of this study confirmed that the study group more
effectively improved the results of FVC and FEV1 than sham-controlled group did when the
results were compared before and after the use of tDCS.</p><p>The positive exercise training process observed in this study was considered from effective
activation of brain by tDCS. Many previous studies, however, have reported that the
activation via tDCS is limited up to one hour and because of that, treatment program may
need to be modified in various ways. The breathing exercise with the use of tDCS is expected
to be effective in posture control not only limited to breathing performance and more
studies should be performed in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The research has been conducted by the research grant of Gwangju Health University in 2016
