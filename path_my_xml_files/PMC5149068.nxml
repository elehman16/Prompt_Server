Two primary modifiable factors, self-management and formal clinical management, have potential to greatly improve diabetes outcomes. &#x0201c;Community to Clinic Navigation to Improve Diabetes Outcomes,&#x0201d; is the first known randomized clinical trial pilot study to test a hybrid model of diabetes self-management education plus clinical navigation among rural residents with T2DM. Forty-one adults with T2DM were recruited from two federally qualified health centers in rural Appalachia from November 2014&#x02013;January 2015. Community health workers provided navigation, including helping participants understand and implement a diabetes self-management program through six group sessions and, if needed, providing assistance in obtaining clinic visits (contacting providers' offices for appointments, making reminder calls, and facilitating transportation and dependent care). Pre and post-test data were collected on T2DM self-management, physical measures, demographics, psychosocial factors, and feasibility (cost, retention, and satisfaction). Although lacking statistical significance, some outcomes indicate trends in positive directions, including diet, foot care, glucose monitoring, and physical health, including decreased HbA1c and triglyceride levels. Process evaluations revealed high levels of satisfaction and feasibility. Due to the limited intervention dose, modest program expenditures (~$29,950), and a severely affected population most of whom had never received diabetes education, outcomes were not as robust as anticipated. Given high rates of satisfaction and retention, this culturally appropriate small group intervention holds promise for hard to reach rural populations. Modifications should include expanded recruitment venues, sample size, intervention dosage and longer term assessment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Community to clinic navigation combined diabetes self-management and navigation.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>CCN showed some positive trends in diet, triglycerides, self-care, and diabetes.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>CCN was feasible (low cost and high retention) and satisfactory.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Increasing dose, length, and recruitment venues may improve the CCN intervention.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>Self-management</kwd><kwd>Rural</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s0010"><label>1.1</label><title>Diabetes risk in Appalachia</title><p>The prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in Kentucky overall has tripled since 2005 (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Cabinet for Health and Family Services, 2013</xref>), likely a significant underestimation since approximately 27% of those with T2DM are undiagnosed (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Hacker, 2008</xref>). Appalachian Kentuckians' diabetes prevalence is 11.8%, compared with 9.8% and 8.9% for the state and nation, respectively (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Cabinet for Health and Family Services, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Hacker, 2008</xref>). Compared to their suburban and urban counterparts, rural residents also are at elevated risk for poor glycemic control and diabetic complications (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Arcury et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>As shown in <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, health and demographic factors, including poor health literacy (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Tessaro et al., 2006</xref>), low socioeconomic status, and high rates of obesity, contribute to elevated T2DM prevalence in Appalachia. Health care provider (HCP) shortages are pervasive in Appalachian Kentucky, with over 80% of the 54 counties in Appalachian Kentucky considered HCP shortage areas (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">US Department of Health and Human Services, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>1.2</label><title>Diabetes self-management and clinical management: the two essential components of glycemic control</title><p>Diabetes self-management, or self-care activities undertaken in informal settings, constitutes one key determinant of T2DM control (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Powers et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Schwaderer and Itano, 2007</xref>). Clinical management, which the American Diabetes Association (ADA) operationalizes as attending medical appointments every three months, is the second essential component of T2DM control (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">American Diabetes Association, 2016</xref>). Suboptimal clinic attendance is associated with elevated blood sugar, blood pressure and lipids (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al., 2012</xref>). For every 10% increase in missed appointments, optimal diabetes control decreases 1.12 times (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) while poor control increases 1.24 times (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Schectman et al., 2008</xref>). National rates of suboptimal clinic attendance vary from 10 to 25% (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Torres et al., 2015</xref>); our research suggests &#x0003e;&#x000a0;30% of Appalachian residents with diabetes regularly miss appointments. Numerous factors account for substandard adherence to self-management and clinic appointments, including lack of self-management knowledge, forgotten appointments, inadequate transportation, and competing time demands (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Bardach et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Schoenberg et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Schoenberg et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Schoenberg and Drungle, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Coordinating and enhancing T2DM self-management and clinical management through community to clinic navigation, has great potential to improve health outcomes. HCP and others have widely implemented the Diabetes Self-Management Program (DSMP) to improve self-management education (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Lorig et al., 2009</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, DSMP is a 6-week group program conducted by trained community health workers (CHWs) and consists of diabetes education, self-management, action planning and problem solving, symptom management, and working with family and HCP. The DSMP has been demonstrated to significantly reduce depression, increase communication with physicians, promote healthy eating, and decrease hypoglycemia at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Erdem and Korda, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Lorig et al., 2009</xref>), but has shown less conclusive evidence on improving clinic attendance (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Helduser et al., 2013</xref>). Clinical navigation, on the other hand, has been shown to facilitate appointment setting and return visits, improve goal setting, and enhance some self-management (medication taking, blood glucose testing) (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Hargraves et al., 2012</xref>), but does not improve key psychosocial or other self-management activities (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Freund et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The Community to Clinic Navigation (CCN) project addressed limitations in existing research and programs; specifically, few interventions have combined self-management and clinical navigation, most intervention content has not been tailored to cultural and geographic factors, and most interventions have not employed experimental designs (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Drozek et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">de Groot et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, navigation has been implemented almost exclusively in the cancer setting despite showing potential for chronic disease management (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Ferrante et al., 2010</xref>). We sought to determine the CCN pilot study's promise for improving T2DM outcomes (primary outcomes: diabetes self-management and physical measures) and demonstrating feasibility (primary outcomes: cost, retention and satisfaction) in this rural population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2</label><title>Methods and materials</title><sec id="s0025"><label>2.1</label><title>Recruitment and human subjects protection</title><p>Participants were recruited from two federally qualified health clinics (FQHC) in rural Appalachian Kentucky from November 2014&#x02013;January 2015. Participants met the following eligibility criteria, as indicated through electronic medical records (EMR): age 21&#x000a0;+, Appalachian residence, no major cognitive impairment, and HbA1c levels of 6.5% or higher. Clinic staff, all of whom had received human subject training and certification, reviewed medical records and identified 60 individuals meeting these criteria. Staff then sent potential participants a letter from the clinic physician describing the project, and followed up with a telephone call to determine their interest in participating. Of those 60 patients who were sent a letter, 48 (80%) initially agreed to participate. Upon further screening and contact, four patients were unable to participate and three dropped out of the project prior to baseline assessment. No significant differences were observed between these seven individuals and the 41 individuals who completed the protocols. Participants' demographic and health profiles were similar to the general population of Appalachian adults (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Barker et al., 2010</xref>). Local interviewers administered human subject's protection protocols, answered questions, and undertook in person assessments. The protocol was approved by the University Institutional Review Board (#14-0314-P6H).</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.2</label><title>Measures</title><p>The survey, pilot tested by local interviewers to ensure semantic appropriateness, captured data on demographics, spirituality/religiosity, diabetes self-management; health-related quality of life, diabetes empowerment, and patient activation. Primary outcomes included: (1) changes in HbA1c, blood pressure, lipids, and BMI and (2) changes in self-management activities (blood glucose monitoring, diet, physical activity, foot care, medication taking, and medical appointment adherence). Secondary outcomes included changes in relevant psychosocial factors (self-efficacy and patient activation). Spirituality/religiosity data were collected to determine the viability of locating future CCN projects in faith communities and the salience of spiritual messaging, approaches popular in our previous interventions.</p><p>EMR data including HbA1c levels, blood pressure, lipids, and BMI were collected by clinic staff on project-provided tablets. Interviewers verbally administered a survey containing the following instruments: (1) the Diabetes Self Care questionnaire to assess self-reported adherence to diabetes self-management, diet, exercise, blood glucose monitoring, and foot care (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Toobert et al., 2000</xref>); (2) the Medical Outcomes Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) to evaluate physical and mental health (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Ware et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Ware et al., 1996</xref>); (3) the Short Form Diabetes Empowerment Scale to measure psychosocial adjustment to diabetes (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>); and (4) the 13-item Patient Activation Measure to assess patient self-reported knowledge, skills and confidence in managing one's chronic health condition (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Hibbard et al., 2005</xref>). Finally, during the posttest interview, all intervention participants were asked a series of structured and semi-structured questions to assess the intervention satisfaction and feasibility (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Bowen et al., 2009</xref>), and obtain recommendations for improvement.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>2.3</label><title>Study design and protocol</title><p>For this randomized clinical trial pilot study, participants met with the interviewer at their home, the project office, or another community location, depending on the participant's preferences. Within a week of this initial meeting, our project biostatistician randomly assigned participants to the intervention or control arm. That same week, all participants engaged in a 60&#x02013;90-minute-long baseline interview and clinic staff uploaded EMR data on physical measures (HbA1c lipids, blood pressure, and BMI), via secure data capture software. Approximately three months after completion of intervention protocols (duration approximately three months), all participants were administered a posttest and, for intervention participants, process evaluations. This sequence allowed sufficient time to pass for participants to obtain a medical appointment, to correspond with Medicare's coverage of HbA1c, and for possible changes to occur in physical outcomes (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2016). <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> highlights the timing of the data collection and intervention protocols.

If determined to be in need of navigation (8/23 intervention participants), the CHW called the participant to determine whether he or she was planning on attending the medical appointment. If the participant was not planning to attend the medical visit, the CHW assisted in rescheduling, arranging transportation, finding dependent care options and motivating on follow through. The day before the appointment, the CHW called to check on the patient to make sure that she or he planned to make the clinic visit and offered assistance.</p></sec><sec id="s0050"><label>2.6</label><title>Analysis</title><p>Summaries of sample characteristics and the main study variables at baseline are provided in <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, and stratified by the intervention arm.

Reflecting the demographics of Appalachian Kentucky, the sample was racially homogeneous (100% non-Hispanic White) and most (63%) had completed high school or had a General Educational Development credential (GED). About a fifth either had less than a high school education or had graduated from college/earned an advanced degree. More than half (59%) indicated an annual household income between $10,000 and $19,000, and a quarter had an annual household income between $20,000 and $29,000. Most (87%) participants reported being unemployed and almost two thirds indicated that they struggle to make ends meet. Most (92%) participants had health insurance, including private or company sponsored insurance, Medicaid, or Medicare. With the sample means of about 40 (SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7.33) and 34 (5.98) for the aggregate physical and mental health score (SF-12), respectively, the self-reported health status in this sample was much lower than the national average of 50.</p></sec><sec id="s0065"><label>3.2</label><title>Diabetes management, psychosocial and primary outcomes variables at baseline</title><p>At baseline, participants showed a suboptimal diabetes self-management profile (<xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).

Overall, participants lacked strong diabetes empowerment; most tentatively endorsed their ability to take care of their diabetes, turn their diabetes goals into a plan, know how to cope with diabetes, ask for support, etc. The overall diabetes empowerment score was 3.96 (SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.39) on a scale ranging between 0 and 5, indicating an average extent of empowerment.</p><p>The mean BMI of 35.73 (SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6.66) was well within the range for obesity, and approximately 30% of the participants had a BMI over 35.

The CCN project is among the first to test a hybrid model whereby community health workers help participants learn diabetes self-management by leading a group education program and by providing clinical navigation to obtain health clinic visits. The CCN project's feasibility, including modest cost and successful enrollment, retention, and satisfaction, suggests potential for future programmatic success: CHW programs, particularly programs operating in high need environments and implementing evidence-based programming in an acceptable and culturally consonant matter, have demonstrated strong return on investment, integration into existing systems, and expansion into new venues and populations (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Bowen et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Rosenthal et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Despite this promise, we faced notable challenges in implementing this CCN intervention that likely undermined outcomes. First, participants demonstrated a very limited awareness of even the most basic T2DM management, requiring CHWs to present rudimentary information about self-management, including simplifying language, limiting written handouts, and employing time consuming &#x0201c;teach back&#x0201d; approaches (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Koh et al., 2013</xref>). Most participants indicated they had never had a diabetes self-management education class; we suspect that our intervention could not completely overcome the substantial attention needed to improve outcomes. CHWs also had to balance program rigor and fidelity with practical complexities, including inadequate transportation, poor weather, and increasing stress and dependence on these middle aged adults because of an addiction epidemic (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Appalachian Regional Commission, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Schoenberg et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Data analyses revealed some surprising findings. Specifically, some positive changes were observed for diabetes self-management in the control group, even though they did not receive any guidance or education training associated with the intervention. Additionally, changes in some measures &#x02013; patient activation and aggregate mental health score &#x02013; occurred in the opposite direction from what we had expected. Some of the positive changes in the control group may be attributed to social desirability or a Hawthorne effect. It is possible that mere participation in the surveys &#x02013; lasting 60&#x02013;90&#x000a0;min &#x02013; might have prompted some participants to better manage their condition. To address this possible contamination, we propose increasing sample size, expanding the time between baseline and posttest interview, and, consistent with intervention participant recommendation, increasing the dosage of the intervention itself.</p><p>In the opposite direction, the minor decreases in the aggregate mental health component score and patient activation measure could result from intervention participants' realization that they are actually not practicing such optimal self-management. That is, prior to the intervention, some participants may have considered their diabetes self-management as optimal, but over the six weeks of workshops, they may have come to realize the necessity of significant lifestyle changes, which is both daunting and depressing. Nevertheless, such increased awareness may constitute a positive step to improve T2DM management.</p><sec id="s0085"><label>4.1</label><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>This study has several limitations, including a modest sample size, limited geographical reach, multiple statistical comparisons, increasing the probability of Type 1 error, a limited dosage, and a relatively short posttest follow up period. As recommended by our project biostatistician, our future randomized clinical trial will involve 1200 participants. Although the CCN project has very low cost, we are unable to offer comparison with the standard of care since we cannot estimate standard costs. Another limitation involves the recruitment venues (FQHCs), which likely reduced the need for clinical navigation, since participants already had a regular source of care that they visited on an ongoing basis&#x02014;at least regularly enough to be recruited for our pilot study. In the future, we will expand to non-clinical locations, including community centers and faith institutions to expand sample size and to enroll participants who may be in heightened need of clinical navigation. Additionally, although the project used an evidence-based intervention, participants indicated that it was too brief. Existing studies on challenging to change behaviors suggest that longer programs may have more positive effects (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Nigg and Long, 2012</xref>). Finally, to decrease the possibility of contamination and to assess the long term potential for the CCN intervention, we plan to add an additional follow up assessment. Despite these limitations, this research provides extensive guidance on next steps, including increasing sample size, expanding recruitment venues, increasing intervention dosage, and, ultimately, disseminating to other underserved populations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Albright</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Satterfield</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Broussard</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Jack</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mikami</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Perez</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Position statement on diabetes community health workers</article-title><source>Diabetes Educ.</source><volume>35</volume><year>2009</year><fpage>48S</fpage><lpage>52S</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0010"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>American Diabetes Association</surname></name></person-group><article-title>Standards of medical care in diabetes, 2016</article-title><source>Diabetes Care</source><volume>39</volume><year>2016</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0015"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0015"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>R.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Fitzgerald</surname><given-names>J.T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gruppen</surname><given-names>L.D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Funnell</surname><given-names>M.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>M.S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The diabetes empowerment scale-short form (DES-SF)</article-title><source>Diabetes Care</source><volume>26</volume><year>2003</year><fpage>1641</fpage><lpage>1642</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0020"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="rf0020"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Appalachian Regional Commission</surname></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Jacobsen</surname><given-names>K.P.a.L.A.</given-names></name></person-group><source>The Appalachian Region: A Data Overview from the 2008&#x02013;2012 American Community Survey</source><year>2014</year><publisher-name>Population Reference Bureau</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0025"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0025"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Arcury</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Quandt</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Gender-ethnic differences in the use of CAM for treating diabetes among rural older adults</article-title><source>Diabetes</source><volume>52</volume><year>2003</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0030"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf8000"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>American Diabetes Association</surname></name></person-group><article-title>Gylcemic Targets</article-title><source>Diabetes Care</source><volume>38</volume><year>2015</year><fpage>S33</fpage><lpage>S40</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25537705</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0035"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0035"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bardach</surname><given-names>S.H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Schoenberg</surname><given-names>N.E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tarasenko</surname><given-names>Y.N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Fleming</surname><given-names>S.T.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Rural residents' perspectives on multiple morbidity management and disease prevention</article-title><source>J.
