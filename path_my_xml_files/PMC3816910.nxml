Recent guidelines from professional organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) recommend the use of subcutaneous insulin as the preferred therapy for glycemic control in hospitalized patients in a non&#x02013;intensive-care unit (non-ICU) setting. Scheduled basal bolus insulin therapy using long- or intermediate-acting insulin preparations in combination with short- (regular) or rapid-acting insulin analogs has been proven to be safe and effective for glycemic management in patients with diabetes or hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Recent studies in general medicine and surgery patients with T2D have reported both improved glycemic control and reductions in a composite of hospital complications, including wound infections, pneumonia, bacteremia, and acute renal and respiratory failure, using basal bolus insulin regimens when compared with sliding scale insulin alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Basal bolus regimens, however, are labor intensive, require multiple insulin injections, and are associated with a significant risk of hypoglycemia. The rate of hypoglycemia in non-ICU patients with T2D treated with basal bolus insulin regimens has been reported to be up to 32% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>Current practice guidelines recommend against inpatient use of oral antidiabetic drugs and noninsulin injectable medications in part due to the absence of efficacy studies as well as safety concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). A major limitation to using oral antidiabetic agents in the inpatient setting relates to the delay and unpredictable onset of action of these drugs, which can prevent rapid attainment of glycemic control or dose adjustments to meet the changing needs of the acutely ill patient. There is also concern regarding the potential for adverse cardiovascular effects with the use of sulfonylureas in patients with cardiac and cerebral ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and with the safety of metformin in patients with renal or liver dysfunction, heart failure, and intravenous iodine contrast and after surgical procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In addition, the use of thiazolidinediones is limited by their lag time to active glucose control and their tendency to increase intravascular volume and precipitate or worsen congestive heart failure and peripheral edema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>Since the U.S. approval of incretin mimetic agents in 2005&#x02013;2006, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have been rapidly incorporated into the outpatient management of T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). These agents improve metabolic control by enhancing endogenous prandial insulin secretion and inhibiting glucagon secretion, thereby reducing postprandial glucose excursions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The low risk of hypoglycemia and good tolerability of the DPP-4 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) make them attractive considerations for use in hospitalized patients. At this time, however, no previous studies have investigated the use of these agents in the hospital setting. Accordingly, we conducted a prospective, randomized clinical trial to determine the safety and efficacy of sitagliptin alone or in combination with basal insulin in the management of general medicine and surgery patients with T2D.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>In this pilot, multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized study, we enrolled 90 adult patients admitted to general medicine and surgery services. Recruited patients had a known history of T2D with a blood glucose (BG) prior to randomization of between 140 and 400 mg/dL and a known history of T2D for &#x0003e;3 months, were between 18 and 80 years of age, and were treated at home with diet alone, any combination of oral antidiabetic agents, or low-dose insulin therapy at a daily dose &#x02264;0.4 units/kg prior to admission. On admission, we stopped oral antidiabetic agents and insulin therapy, and BG was measured before meals and bedtime. Patients were recruited when BG was &#x0003e;140 mg/dL. We excluded patients with any BG between admission and randomization of &#x0003e;400 mg/dL or with a prior history of hyperglycemic crises; patients with hyperglycemia but without a known history of diabetes; patients admitted to or expected to require ICU admission or cardiac surgery; patients with a history of pancreatitis or active gallbladder disease, corticosteroid therapy, clinically relevant hepatic disease, or impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] &#x0003c;30 mL/min or serum creatinine &#x02265;3.0 mg/dL); and patients with a history of diabetic ketoacidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), pregnancy, or any mental condition rendering the subject unable to give informed consent.</p><p>Patients were randomized according to a 1:1:1 ratio into three regimens: sitagliptin once daily, sitagliptin and basal insulin (glargine Lantus; Sanofi) once daily, and basal bolus insulin with glargine once daily and lispro before meals (Humalog; Eli Lilly and Company). Patients treated with sitagliptin received a single dose of 100 mg/day (at any time of day) if GFR &#x0003e;50 mL/min or 50 mg/day if GFR was between 30 and 50 mL/min. Patients in the sitagliptin and basal group received a starting total daily dose (TDD) of glargine of 0.25 units/kg/day, except for those patients &#x02265;70 years of age and/or with a serum creatinine &#x02265;2.0 mg/dL who received a starting TDD of 0.15 units/kg. Patients in the basal bolus group were started at a TDD of 0.5 units/kg divided half as insulin glargine once daily and half as insulin lispro before meals. In patients &#x02265;70 years of age and/or with a serum creatinine &#x02265;2.0 mg/dL, the starting TDD in the basal bolus group was reduced to 0.3 units/kg in the basal bolus group. Patients in all three groups received supplemental (correction) doses of insulin lispro before meals and bedtime for BG &#x0003e;140 mg/dL. The goal of therapy was to maintain a fasting and premeal glucose concentration between 100 and 140 mg/dL. The doses of insulin were adjusted daily according to protocol (included in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc13-0277/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>).

In addition, BG was measured at any time if a patient experienced symptoms of hypoglycemia or if requested by the treating physician. HbA<sub>1c</sub> was measured on the first day of hospitalization. The results of BG values are presented as premeal glucose, bedtime glucose, and mean daily BG during the hospital stay after day 1.</p><p>This study was conducted at Grady Memorial Hospital (Atlanta, GA), Emory University Hospital, and University of Michigan Health System.

In addition, the total daily insulin dose and number of insulin injections were significantly less in the sitagliptin groups compared with the basal bolus regimen. The result of this preliminary study suggests that treatment with sitagliptin alone or in combination with basal insulin is safe and effective for the management of general medicine and surgery patients with T2D.</p><p>The association between hyperglycemia and increased risk of hospital complications is well established in ICU and non-ICU patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Recent guidelines from professional organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) recommend the use of subcutaneous insulin as the preferred therapy for glycemic control in hospitalized patients in a non-ICU setting. The two most common subcutaneous insulin regimens for inpatient glycemic management are sliding scale regular insulin (SSI) and basal bolus insulin therapy in combination with correction insulin scale. The use of basal bolus regimen is preferred as it improves glycemic control and reduces the rate of hospital complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The RABBIT 2 medicine trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) reported that a BG target of &#x0003c;140 mg/dL was achieved in two-thirds of patients treated with basal bolus regimen, whereas only one-third of those treated with SSI achieved target glycemia. The RABBIT surgery trial also reported a higher percentage of glucose readings &#x0003c;140 mg/dL with basal bolus compared with SSI treatment (53 &#x000b1; 30 vs. 31 &#x000b1; 28%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).

Compared with patients with glucose &#x0003e;180 mg/dL, those with a BG &#x02264;180 mg/dL had a lower mean daily glucose and less treatment failures, independent of treatment regimen. In patients with an admission or randomization BG &#x02264;180 mg/dL, we observed no differences in mean daily BG concentration or in the number of treatment failures among patients treated with sitagliptin plus supplements compared with patients treated with sitagliptin and glargine or basal bolus regimens (<italic>P</italic> = 0.63). Patients with a randomization BG &#x0003e;180 mg/dL treated with sitagliptin alone had higher mean daily BG compared with sitagliptin and glargine or basal bolus regimens (<italic>P</italic> = 0.08). This observation indicates that sitagliptin plus rapid-acting supplements (correction) before meals is useful in patients with mild-to-moderate hyperglycemia, whereas treatment with sitagliptin plus basal insulin or basal bolus regimens should be considered in those with more severe hyperglycemia.</p><p>As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), we show that the use of basal insulin as part of a basal bolus regimen or in combination with sitagliptin is well tolerated with a low rate of hypoglycemia.

In the RABBIT surgery trial, 12% of patients treated with basal bolus had a BG &#x0003c;60 mg/dL and 4% had a value &#x0003c;40 mg/dL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In the current study, a BG &#x0003c;70 mg/dL was reported in 7% of patients treated with sitagliptin and glargine and in no patients treated with basal bolus or sitagliptin alone. Minimizing hypoglycemic events is of major importance in hospitalized patients because it has been shown to be an independent risk factor of poor outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>We acknowledge the following limitations in this study. We recruited a relatively small number of patients in this pilot study and excluded a large number of patients, which included those admitted to the ICU, with clinically relevant hepatic disease, with pancreatitis, with serum creatinine &#x02265;3.0 mg/dL or GFR &#x0003c;30 mL/min, with severe hyperglycemia (BG &#x0003e;400 mg/dL), and receiving a total dose of insulin &#x0003e;0.4 units/kg/day prior to admission. In such patients, a standard basal bolus approach may be the preferred approach in achieving glycemic control. In addition, our study was not powered to determine differences in hospital complications across the three groups. A large, prospective, randomized, multicenter trial of glycemic control comparing sitagliptin alone or in combination with basal insulin with the basal bolus approach is needed to address these important issues.</p><p>In summary, these preliminary results indicate that the inpatient use of sitagliptin alone or in combination with basal insulin resulted in a similar improvement in glycemic control compared with a standard basal bolus insulin regimen. These results indicate that sitagliptin alone or in combination with basal insulin is an effective alternative to the basal bolus insulin regimen for general medicine and surgery patients with T2D.</p></sec>
