The second aim was to compare the effectiveness of single-shot palonosetron and consecutive-day granisetron in a randomized, single-blinded crossover study. A single randomization method was used to assign eligible patients to the palonosetron or granisetron arm.

All 24 patients in this study received at least 4 chemotherapy courses. A total of 96 courses of antiemetic therapy were evaluated. Overall, the complete response CR rate (no emetic episodes and no rescue medication use) was 34%, while the total control rate (a CR plus no nausea) was 7%. No significant differences were observed between single-shot palonosetron and consecutive-day granisetron. Antiemetic therapy with a 3-drug combination was not sufficient to control chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) during chemotherapy with multiple HER agents for bone and soft tissue sarcoma.

Symptoms such as CINV are a major cause of reduced quality of life in chemotherapy patients and lead to decreased therapy compliance. The frequency and timing of CINV manifestations differ according to the type, dose, and administration route of anticancer agents. Different types and dosage regimens of anticancer agents are categorized on the basis of the frequency with which they are associated with CINV: high emetogenic risk (HER) agents cause CINV in &#x0003e;90% of patients, moderate emetogenic risk agents cause CINV in 30% to 90% of patients, and low emetogenic risk agents cause CINV in &#x0003c;30% of patients.</p><p>Involvement of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in CINV was reported in the late 1980s. During the 1990s, advancements were made in the clinical application of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists (5-HT<sub>3</sub>RA) for CINV prevention. The mechanism of CINV is thought to involve secretion of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) in response to stimulation of enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal mucous membrane by anticancer agents. Transmission to the vomiting center then occurs either directly from the afferent vagal nerve via gastrointestinal 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors or indirectly via the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). Another route involves direct stimulation of the CTZ by drugs, followed by transmission of this stimulus to the vomiting center via dopamine or 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. In addition to 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, recent evidence has suggested the involvement of the pain neurotransmitter substance P and its receptor neurokinin-1 (NK-1) in CINV. Aprepitant, an NK-1 receptor antagonist (NK-1RA), has been developed for clinical use <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Corticosteroids also suppress CINV through an antiemetic effect that is thought to work primarily via anti-inflammatory action. A meta-analysis of clinical trials using antiemetic therapies, including dexamethasone (Dex), showed that the combination of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RAs and Dex increased the control rates of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting by about 15% <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.</p><p>A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials using antiemetic therapies showed that 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RAs have a superior antiemetic effect on the acute phase compared to conventional antiemetic therapies such as dopamine receptor antagonists and antihistamine drugs, and that 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RAs still play a central role in antiemetic therapy <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. However, problems with these agents remain. For instance, first-generation 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RAs do not exhibit a sufficient effect on delayed phase nausea and vomiting.</p><p>Palonosetron, a second-generation 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RA, has been shown to be highly selective for 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in a variety of experimental models. A clinical pharmacological study with healthy adult subjects showed that the half-life of palonosetron is 4&#x02013;10 times longer than that of existing 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RAs. A long half-life and high affinity for 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors are key characteristics of palonosetron. Also, chronological simulation of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>-receptor occupancy at&#x000a0;recommended doses showed that a first-generation 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RA only maintained &#x02265;70% receptor occupancy for &#x0003c;24&#x000a0;h, while the long half-life and high affinity of palonosetron allowed it to maintain this rate for about 5&#x000a0;days.</p><p>A multi-institution, randomized, blinded, controlled trial (the PROTECT study) compared single-shot intravenous palonosetron to single-shot intravenous granisetron (a first-generation 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RA) for controlling acute and delayed CINV <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. The subjects were patients with malignant tumors slated to receive at least 50&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>3</sup> cisplatin (CDDP), doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC), or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC), which are all HER chemotherapy regimens. The patients received 0.75&#x000a0;mg palonosetron or 40&#x000a0;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg granisetron intravenously 30&#x000a0;min before the administration of chemotherapy. The acute complete response (CR) rate, which was the primary endpoint for effectiveness, was 75.3% in the palonosetron group and 73.3% in the granisetron group, demonstrating that palonosetron was not inferior to granisetron. However, the delayed CR rate was 56.8% in the palonosetron group and 44.5% in the granisetron group. This difference was significant, showing the superiority of palonosetron to granisetron. While this trial compared palonosetron and granisetron using single intravenous doses, consecutive-day administration of granisetron and other first-generation 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RAs has been approved and is used in patients receiving regimens that include consecutive-day administration of HER anticancer agents and multi-drug combinations.</p><p>Consecutive-day regimens involving multiple anticancer agents are widely used to treat bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Since many of these regimens use HER chemotherapy at high doses, treatment of bone and soft tissue sarcomas is frequently associated with CINV. Until recently, consecutive-day 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RA plus Dex was used for preventative antiemetic therapy; however, this regimen offers insufficient protection. Since the development of aprepitant, an NK-1RA, the combination of consecutive-day 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RA plus aprepitant and Dex, has become the recommended antiemetic therapy during chemotherapy for bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Although the PROTECT study found that single-shot palonosetron was superior to single-shot granisetron, there is no published comparative data on whether consecutive-day 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RA administration is superior to single-shot palonosetron.</p><p>The first aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of combination antiemetic therapy with a 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RA plus NK-1RA and Dex in patients receiving chemotherapy for high-grade bone and soft tissue sarcoma using multiple HER anticancer agents. The second aim was to compare the effectiveness and safety of single-shot palonosetron and consecutive-day granisetron in a randomized, single-blind, crossover trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and treatment</title><p>Eligible patients were 15&#x000a0;years of age or older, had confirmed high-grade malignant bone and soft tissue tumors, and were scheduled to receive chemotherapy with multiple emetogenic anticancer drugs.

during chemotherapy treatment have recently been proposed by several organizations including the American Society of Clinical Oncology <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/European Society of Medical Oncology <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, and the Japan Society of Clinical Oncology <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. For HER chemotherapy, all guidelines recommend the combination of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RA, NK-1RA, and Dex. For 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RA therapy, clinicians tend to recommend palonosetron on the basis of results from trials such as the PROTECT study.</p><p>However, for the consecutive-day regimens of anticancer agents used in this study, it is unclear which antiemetic agent should be administered and for what period. The regimen that includes CDDP (120&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1) plus doxorubicin (30&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1 and 2) is frequently used for sarcomas such as osteosarcoma. This regimen is classified as HER, but these highly emetogenic anticancer agents are used at higher doses than those administered in regular HER regimens. This regimen could be considered an extreme HER regimen, and it is unclear whether the regular antiemetic therapies described in the guidelines are capable of controlling the CINV associated with this regimen. In our current analysis, 3-drug antiemetic therapy achieved an acute CR rate of 69.8%, a delayed CR rate of 39.6%, and an overall CR rate of 34.4%. These CRs are clearly inferior to the rates achieved in other studies using the same 3-drug combination for HER chemotherapy regimens including &#x02265;70&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> CDDP and AC therapy <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. In addition to differences in dosing and chemotherapy type, the relatively young age of our patients could explain the poor control rates we observed. Additionally, the antiemetic therapy guidelines are based on data from studies of typical moderately to highly emetogenic regimens; however, HER chemotherapy regimens administered for bone and soft tissue sarcomas may require stronger antiemetic therapies. Recent reports have suggested that adding olanzapine may be effective in cases where antiemetic therapy with the 3-drug combination does not achieve sufficient control <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. In the future, physicians should aim for even better CINV control by combining drugs, as described here.</p><p>Until now, no studies have compared the relative efficacy of single-shot palonosetron, which is often recommended by current guidelines, versus consecutive-day administration of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RAs for extreme HER chemotherapy, such as the AP regimen. Therefore, we performed this comparison study based on the additional combination of NK-1RA and Dex. We did not find that palonosetron was superior for preventing delayed vomiting, which was observed by other studies. Consecutive-day administration of a first-generation 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RA is thought to have a similar effect on CINV as single-shot palonosetron, but examination of more cases is necessary to verify the statistical comparison of both drugs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Combination antiemetic therapy with 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RA plus NK-1RA and Dex did not effectively control CINV in patients with high-grade bone and soft tissue sarcoma treated with multiple HER chemotherapy regimens. Development of novel antiemetic agents, or new combination therapies with existing agents such as olanzapine, is needed.</p><p>This study demonstrated that consecutive-day granisetron administration was not inferior to single-shot palonosetron for controlling CINV associated with treatment of high-grade bone and soft tissue sarcoma using multiple HER chemotherapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>None declared.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gralla</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Osoba</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Kris</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name><name><surname>Kirkbride</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Hesketh</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Chinnery</surname><given-names>LW</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Recommendations for the use of antiemetics: evidence-based, clinical practice guidelines</article-title><source>J.
