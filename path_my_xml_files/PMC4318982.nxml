Abstract</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>Vaniprevir (MK-7009) is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural 3/4a protease inhibitor which significantly increases virologic response rates in HCV genotype (GT) 1-infected patients when added to peginterferon and ribavirin (PR).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a phase II, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, dose-ranging study in Japanese patients with HCV GT1 infection and previous relapse. Patients received twice daily vaniprevir 100, 300, or 600&#x000a0;mg, or placebo plus PR for 4&#x000a0;weeks then PR alone for 2&#x000a0;weeks. Further treatment with PR was continued up to a maximum of 72&#x000a0;weeks. The primary endpoint was rapid virologic response (RVR; undetectable HCV RNA at treatment week 4).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ninety patients completed 4&#x000a0;weeks of vaniprevir/placebo plus PR. Rates of RVR were significantly higher with vaniprevir compared with placebo (86, 95, and 76&#x000a0;% in the vaniprevir 100-, 300-, and 600-mg arms versus 20&#x000a0;% with control; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 for all comparisons). Rates of SVR, an exploratory analysis, in the vaniprevir 100-, 300-, 600-mg, and control arms were 95, 100, 100, and 72&#x000a0;%, respectively. No patient had virologic breakthrough or non-response while receiving vaniprevir. There were no serious adverse events (AEs) or discontinuations due to an AE during vaniprevir treatment. Diarrhea and nausea were more common with vaniprevir 600&#x000a0;mg than control or lower vaniprevir doses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The addition of vaniprevir to PR was associated with an increase in RVR and SVR. Combined with a generally safe and well-tolerated profile, these data supported the further evaluation of vaniprevir in Japanese patients with HCV GT1 infection (#NCT00880763).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00535-014-0979-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Vaniprevir</kwd><kwd>Hepatitis C virus</kwd><kwd>Peginterferon</kwd><kwd>Ribavirin</kwd><kwd>Japan</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Japan 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>There are approximately 2 million patients with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. HCV infection is the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan, causing more than 30,000 deaths each year. Peginterferon plus ribavirin dual therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for HCV infection, although the direct-acting antiviral agents, telaprevir and simeprevir, are also available in Japan for use as part of triple therapy regimens for selected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Triple therapy with telaprevir, peginterferon alfa-2b, and ribavirin has shown improved response rate with room for further improvement, but adverse events (AEs) also increased, including severe anemia and serious skin rashes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Triple therapy with simeprevir, peginterferon, and ribavirin has also recently become available for clinical use in Japan, further improving treatment options for patients with HCV infection in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Additional targeted therapies for the treatment of HCV infection are being developed with the aim of further decreasing HCV-related morbidity and mortality among Japanese patients.</p><p>Vaniprevir (MK-7009) is a macrocyclic inhibitor of the HCV non-structural (NS) 3/4a protease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It exhibits potent inhibitory activity in in vitro models of HCV replication and induces a rapid decline in viral load in animal models of HCV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In a phase Ib monotherapy study in patients with chronic genotype (GT)1 HCV infection, vaniprevir demonstrated potent antiviral activity, good plasma exposure, and was generally well tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In two phase II clinical trials conducted in non-Japanese patients, addition of vaniprevir to peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin significantly improved on-treatment virologic response and sustained virologic response (SVR) in patients with HCV GT1 infection who were either naive to previous therapy or had failed previous treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In 1 of 2 studies, vaniprevir was administered with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin for 24 or 48&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Alternatively, Manns and colleagues reported the use of vaniprevir (300 or 600&#x000a0;mg twice daily [bid], or 600 or 800&#x000a0;mg once daily [qd]) plus peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin for 4&#x000a0;weeks followed by open-label peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin for an additional 44&#x000a0;weeks in treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In this latter study, the rate of rapid virologic response (RVR; undetectable HCV RNA at treatment week 4), the primary endpoint of the study, was significantly higher in patients receiving vaniprevir than in those receiving placebo. Data from this study suggest that vaniprevir is a potent HCV protease inhibitor with a predictable resistance profile and favorable safety profile that is suitable for once a day or twice a day administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present dose-ranging study was to assess the efficacy and safety of several doses of vaniprevir in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin in Japanese patients with HCV GT1 infection who had relapsed following previous treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin dual therapy to determine the clinical dose of vaniprevir appropriate for use in Japanese patients for further evaluation of vaniprevir in phase III studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was conducted in accordance with principles of Good Clinical Practice, approved by the appropriate institutional review boards and regulatory agencies, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (#NCT00880763).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Japanese patients with HCV infection and relapse following previous treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin dual therapy were enrolled. Key inclusion and exclusion criteria included: age 20&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years; chronic, compensated, GT1 HCV infection; and HCV RNA levels &#x02265;5.0&#x000a0;log&#x000a0;IU/mL at screening. Patients with cirrhosis were excluded: all patients were required to have fibrosis scores of F0&#x02013;F2 within 3&#x000a0;years of screening, or F3 within 1&#x000a0;year of screening. Patients with retinopathy, including retinal hemorrhage, at screening were also excluded. All patients were required to meet protocol-defined laboratory criteria within 75&#x000a0;days prior to first dose.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a phase II, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, and dose-ranging study. Patients were randomized to receive vaniprevir 100, 300, 600&#x000a0;mg bid, or matched placebo in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a (180&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/week) and ribavirin (600&#x02013;1,000&#x000a0;mg/day, according to body weight) per product label for an initial 4&#x000a0;week treatment period, and thereafter they received peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin alone for 2 additional weeks. The initial 4&#x000a0;week treatment period with vaniprevir and peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin was used to align with the primary efficacy endpoint of RVR (the proportion of patients with undetectable HCV RNA at treatment week 4). The additional 2&#x000a0;weeks of treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin after the completion of vaniprevir dosing was implemented to enable continued monitoring of vaniprevir safety after the completion of triple therapy and to facilitate uninterrupted continued treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin, in line with current treatment recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Further treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin was then administered at the discretion of each investigator, up to a maximum total treatment duration of 72&#x000a0;weeks, while also taking into consideration recommendations from Japanese treatment guidelines. Treatment blinding was achieved through the centralized preparation of identical capsules. Dose reduction and interruption of peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin were permitted in accordance with product labels.</p><p>Within the total treatment population, a pharmacokinetic (PK) cohort was identified to provide blood samples for PK analyses. Specific sites with the ability to perform an intensive PK sampling scheme were identified, and patients screened at these sites were offered the option to participate in the intensive PK cohort. The computer-generated randomized allocation schedule was prepared by the study sponsor, independent of the study team, and implemented by a third-party vendor. Randomization was stratified according to participation in the PK cohort with the aim of enrolling 4&#x02013;8 patients in the PK cohort per treatment arm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Endpoints</title><p>The study consisted of 2 parts, an initial 6&#x000a0;week phase (4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment with vaniprevir/placebo plus PR and a subsequent 2&#x000a0;week post-vaniprevir treatment follow-up period) followed by a second treatment phase up to 72&#x000a0;weeks in total duration. Primary efficacy and safety assessments were evaluated based on the treatment period from baseline to treatment week 6. HCV RNA measurements, evaluation of viral resistance, and assessments of serious adverse events were based on the entire study period including treatment period and follow-up period.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was RVR, defined as the proportion of patients with undetectable HCV RNA at treatment week 4. Secondary virologic endpoints included the proportion of patients achieving a &#x02265;2-log<sub>10</sub> decrease and a &#x02265;3-log<sub>10</sub> decrease in viral load from baseline to week 4, and the mean log<sub>10</sub> decrease in viral load from baseline to week 4. Analysis of SVR, defined as the proportion of patients with undetectable HCV RNA 24&#x000a0;weeks after completion of treatment, was not defined in the protocol; however, this endpoint was also calculated in an exploratory manner. Patients in the per protocol population for the primary analysis with an HCV RNA measurement at each time point were included in the exploratory SVR analysis.</p><p>Resistance-associated variants were to be analyzed at baseline for all patients, and at virologic failure in patients with breakthrough viremia or those with a null response while receiving vaniprevir/placebo through week 4. Breakthrough viremia was defined as a &#x0003e;1-log<sub>10</sub> increase from nadir HCV RNA at 2 consecutive HCV RNA measurements, or HCV RNA &#x0003e;100&#x000a0;IU/mL at 2 consecutive visits after becoming undetectable. Null response was defined as &#x02264;1-log decrease in HCV RNA through week 4. The persistence of resistance variants in patients who had taken vaniprevir was also assessed.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic analyses were also performed to evaluate the following vaniprevir parameters: area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from the time of dosing to 12&#x000a0;h post-dose (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12&#x000a0;h</sub>), maximum plasma drug concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>), trough plasma drug concentration(<italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub>; i.e., concentration at approximately 12&#x000a0;h post-dose), time to reach <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>), and apparent terminal half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub>). For PK analyses, blood sampling points were set at pre-dosing on day 1, week 1, and week 4, and anytime during the visits at weeks 5 and 6 in the all subjects population. In addition, blood samples for PK analyses were taken at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12&#x000a0;h post-dose on day 1 and week 4, and at 24&#x000a0;h post-dose on week 4 in the PK cohort. At each time point, 4&#x000a0;mL blood was placed into a vacuumized blood collection tube with EDTA-2&#x000a0;K, and plasma was immediately obtained by centrifugation at 0&#x02013;10&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 1,200 relative centrifugal force (&#x000d7;&#x000a0;<italic>g</italic>) for 15&#x000a0;min.</p><p>Safety evaluations included AEs, laboratory values, physical examinations, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and vital sign assessments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Assays</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Serum HCV RNA concentrations</title><p>Serum HCV RNA levels were measured using Roche COBAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> TaqMan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HCV Auto assay. The limit of quantification (LoQ) was 1.2&#x000a0;log&#x000a0;IU/mL (15&#x000a0;IU/mL) and the limit of detection (LoD) was &#x0003c;1.2&#x000a0;log&#x000a0;IU/mL, but with no specific value.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Vaniprevir plasma concentrations</title><p>Plasma samples underwent liquid&#x02013;liquid extraction with methyl <italic>t</italic>-butyl ether in a 96-well format.

The resulting samples were assessed using a validated liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry assay with positive ion electrospray (range 1&#x02013;1,000&#x000a0;ng/mL). Pharmacokinetic analyses of vaniprevir plasma concentrations were performed using WinNonlin (Certara, ver. 5.2.1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Resistance testing</title><p>Blood samples were obtained for analysis of vaniprevir resistance-associated variants at baseline for all patients and at virologic failure in patients with breakthrough viremia or those with a null response while receiving vaniprevir through week 4. Samples were also collected after completion of vaniprevir treatment to assess the persistence of NS3/4A resistance mutations in patients who have taken vaniprevir. Viral resistance testing utilized population sequence analysis of the HCV NS3/4A region. Due to the sensitivity of this assay, resistance analysis was performed only on samples with HCV RNA &#x0003e;1,000&#x000a0;IU/mL.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Statistics</title><p>Target randomization was approximately 80 patients in this study.

An increase in gastrointestinal AEs was noted in patients receiving vaniprevir 600&#x000a0;mg bid. These efficacy and safety findings are consistent with previous observations from phase II studies of vaniprevir in non-Japanese patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Manns and colleagues have reported the results of a previous phase II study incorporating a similar study design to that used in the present study but with a different patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the study reported by Manns and colleagues, vaniprevir (300 or 600&#x000a0;mg bid, or 600 or 800&#x000a0;mg qd) was dosed with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin for 4&#x000a0;weeks followed by peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin dual therapy for an additional 44&#x000a0;weeks in treatment-naive, non-Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. RVR was achieved by 69&#x02013;83&#x000a0;% of patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin and vaniprevir compared with 5.6&#x000a0;% of patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin and placebo (control arm). SVR was achieved by 61&#x02013;84&#x000a0;% of patients in the vaniprevir arms compared with 63&#x000a0;% in the control arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, both the study by Manns and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and data from the present study indicate that addition of vaniprevir to peginterferon plus ribavirin is associated with a rapid decline in HCV RNA and high rates of RVR in patients with HCV GT1 infection.</p><p>Although in the present study an analysis of SVR was not defined in the protocol, this endpoint was assessed in an exploratory fashion, and the data demonstrate high rates of SVR associated with vaniprevir therapy. Careful interpretation of these data is required. The total treatment duration of peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin was not identical in all patients because the protocol allowed a maximum of 72&#x000a0;weeks of treatment at the discretion of the investigator. Furthermore, SVR rates were calculated based on the per protocol population for consistency with the primary analysis population. Despite these limitations, SVR rates in the present study indicate that a 4&#x000a0;week dosing period with vaniprevir coadministered with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin followed by a maximum total 72&#x000a0;weeks of peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin offers substantial benefit to Japanese patients with HCV infection. The relatively high SVR rate in the control arm may also be attributed to the extended treatment duration.</p><p>Japanese treatment guidelines recommend extending peginterferon plus ribavirin therapy from 48&#x02013;72&#x000a0;weeks for patients in whom HCV RNA becomes undetectable between treatment weeks 13 and 36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Similarly, elderly patients and those with advanced fibrosis who attain undetectable HCV RNA between weeks 9 and 12 are also candidates for a 72&#x000a0;week treatment duration. Thus, patients with delayed virologic response are potentially faced with a long and arduous peginterferon and ribavirin treatment regimen with a well-described tolerability profile, including the influenza-like symptoms of interferon-based therapy and the hemolytic anemia associated with ribavirin therapy. Addition of a targeted therapy such as vaniprevir to peginterferon and ribavirin has the potential to substantially reduce overall treatment duration by reducing the on-treatment time to first undetectable HCV RNA.</p><p>The main safety observations from previous vaniprevir phase II studies that were conducted in non-Japanese patients included an increase in mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal AEs, primarily nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. This occurred when vaniprevir was added to peginterferon and ribavirin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In these studies there was no significant difference in the rates of anemia and rash between the vaniprevir and control arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Safety findings from the present study are consistent with those previous reports. In the present study, gastrointestinal AEs, including diarrhea and nausea, were more common in patients receiving vaniprevir 600&#x000a0;mg bid than those receiving placebo or lower vaniprevir doses. All gastrointestinal AEs were mild or moderate in intensity and none of them resulted in discontinuation of study treatment during the vaniprevir treatment or 14&#x000a0;day safety follow-up period; thus, vaniprevir-based triple therapy was considered generally well tolerated.</p><p>Drug resistance is an important consideration in the use of HCV protease inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the present study, the high efficacy demonstrated in vaniprevir-treated patients limits the number of cases of drug resistance provided by this study and restricts evaluation of drug limitations due to resistance-derived failure. Baseline variants at positions A156 and D168 known to confer reduced susceptibility to vaniprevir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] were observed in 2 patients in vaniprevir treatment arms, with both patients achieving RVR and SVR. It is difficult to draw general conclusions from this, however, due to the limited data set.</p><p>PK analyses indicate that, based on a twice daily dose regimen, vaniprevir exposure increases non-linearly with increasing dose, with disproportionately higher exposure achieved at higher doses. Mean trough concentrations of vaniprevir were 32, 86, and 305&#x000a0;nM with the 100-, 300-, and 600-mg bid dosing regimens. These values are several fold above the serum-adjusted in vitro vaniprevir 50&#x000a0;% effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 5.9&#x000a0;nM against the HCV GT1b replicon (Data on file, Merck &#x00026; Co., Inc.), suggesting that viral replication will remain suppressed at trough plasma concentrations.</p><p>In conclusion, the results from the present study indicate that the addition of vaniprevir to peginterferon plus ribavirin is associated with a rapid decline in HCV RNA in Japanese patients with HCV GT1 infection, reducing the time to undetectable HCV RNA for a substantial number of patients. Combined with an acceptable tolerability profile, these data support the further evaluation of vaniprevir in Japanese patients with HCV GT1 infection. Based on the cumulative efficacy, safety, and PK data, vaniprevir at a dose of 300&#x000a0;mg bid was selected for further evaluation in phase III clinical trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec19"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="535_2014_979_MOESM1_ESM.jpg"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (JPEG 111&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2"><media xlink:href="535_2014_979_MOESM2_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary material 2 (DOCX 15&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all patients, their families, investigators, and their staff in the following 38 study sites for completion of the study (ordered according to the site number assigned in the study): Tetsuo Takehara (Osaka University Hospital); Atsuo Inoue (Osaka General Medical Center); Namiki Izumi (Musashino Red Cross Hospital); Junichi Tazawa (Tsuchiura Kyodo General Hospital); Hideki Hagiwara (Kansai Rosai Hospital); Harumasa Yoshihara (Osaka Rosai Hospital); Masahide Oshita (Osaka Police Hospital); Toshihide Shima (Saiseikai Suita Hospital); Shoichi Takahashi (Hiroshima University Hospital); Keisuke Iizuka (Isesaki municipal hospital); Kiyomi Yasuda (Kiyokawa Hospital); Takashi Kumada (Ogaki Municipal Hospital); Eiji Mita (National Hospital Organization Osaka National Hospital); Kazuyoshi Nagayama (Namegata District General Hospital); Tatsuji Komatsu (National Hospital Organization Yokohama Medical Center); Teruaki Kawanishi (Hokkaido Health Coop Sapporo Ryokuai Hospital); Kunihiko Tsuji (Teine Keijinkai Hospital); Akira Ohashi (Japanese Red Cross Koga Hospital); Makoto Shimizu (International Goodwill Hospital); Satoru Kaneda (National Hospital Organization Chiba Medical Center); Michiyasu Yagura (National Hospital Organization Tokyo National Hospital); Toshifumi Ito (Osaka Koseinenkin Hospital); Ryo Nakata (Japanese Red Cross Medical Center); Yasuyuki Aisaka (Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital &#x00026; Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital); Yuji Yoshikawa (Sanraku Hospital); Akihisa Ishikawa (Hitachi General Hospital); Kazuhiro Katayama (Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases); Eijiro Hayashi (Kinki Central Hospital of the Mutual Aid Association of Public School Teachers); Seiji Kawazoe (Saga-Ken Medical Centre KOSEIKAN); Yasuharu Imai (Ikeda Municipal Hospital); Tatsuho Sugimoto (Tonami General Hospital); Hiroshi Yatsuhashi (National Hospital Organization Nagasaki Medical Center); Michio Kato (National Hospital Organization Minamiwakayama Medical Center); Yutaka Sasaki (Kumamoto University Hospital); Makoto Nakamuta (National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center); Youichi Morimoto (Kurashiki Central Hospital); Akio Ido (Kagoshima University Hospital); Yoshiaki Inui (Hyogo Prefectural Nishinomiya Hospital).
