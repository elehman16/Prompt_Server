Patients discontinued all laxative use before enrollment; rescue laxatives (bisacodyl tablets taken &#x02265;4 hours after study drug administration, with only 1 dose allowed within a 24-hour period) were permitted if the patient had no bowel movements for 3 consecutive days during the RCT or OLE. The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and all patients provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design and Assessments</title><p>Details on the design of the RCT have been previously published.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Briefly, the RCT was a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT00529087) conducted at 91 sites in the United States and Canada. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive subcutaneous methylnaltrexone (Relistor; Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Raleigh, North Carolina) 12 mg once daily (qd), methylnaltrexone 12 mg once every other day (qod), or placebo for 4 weeks. Patients who completed the RCT were eligible to enter an OLE phase and received subcutaneous methylnaltrexone 12 mg as needed (prn; maximum, qd) for 8 weeks, followed by a 14-day posttreatment follow-up period.</p><p>Efficacy outcomes were evaluated during the RCT and OLE using daily patient diaries, which included the number and time of bowel movements, stool consistency (Bristol Stool Form Scale<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>), straining during a bowel movement (0 = none to 4 = very severe), sense of complete evacuation (yes/no), and rescue laxative use. The coprimary efficacy end points in the RCT were the percentage of patients experiencing an RFBM within 4 hours of the first dose and the percentage of injections resulting in an RFBM within 4 hours of dose administration. Secondary efficacy end points included the percentage of patients experiencing 3 or more RFBMs per week and at least a 1-RFBM increase from baseline in the weekly RFBM rate (&#x0201c;responders&#x0201d;), the percentage of patients experiencing 3 or more RFBMs per week, the weekly RFBM rate, and the percentage of weekly injections resulting in an RFBM within 4 hours of dose administration. An RFBM was defined as a bowel movement not occurring within 24 hours of rescue laxative use. Safety assessments included monitoring of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and concomitant medications.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>The RCT methylnaltrexone population included all patients randomized to treatment who received at least 1 dose of methylnaltrexone. The placebo crossover population included all patients who completed the RCT trial and received at least 1 dose of methylnaltrexone during the OLE. Data were analyzed using an observed case analysis. For between-group comparisons during the RCT, <italic>P</italic> values were calculated using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Descriptive statistics were used for the placebo crossover population analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 460 patients received methylnaltrexone 12 mg qd (n = 150), methylnaltrexone 12 mg qod (n = 148), or placebo (n = 162) in the 4-week RCT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Of the 162 patients who had received placebo in the RCT, 134 were enrolled in the OLE and crossed over to methylnaltrexone 12 mg prn treatment. The most common pain condition among the 134 patients in the placebo crossover population was back pain (58.2%), and the mean number of bowel movements per week at RCT baseline was 1.1 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Patient disposition.

Similarly, on average, in the placebo crossover population, more injections with methylnaltrexone in the OLE resulted in an RFBM within 4 hours of dose versus injections with placebo in the RCT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). When response was expressed according to the percentage of patients experiencing 3 or more RFBMs per week and an increase of 1 or more RFBMs over baseline, weekly values ranged from 35% to 40% during placebo treatment in the RCT, suggesting a lack of tolerance development to OIC across time (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). However, when patients crossed over from placebo to methylnaltrexone treatment, the percentage increased to more than 70% within the first week (week 5) and remained relatively stable throughout the study.

The trend in improvement observed with the placebo crossover population was also observed when the percentage of weekly injections resulting in an RFBM within 4 hours of dose administration was assessed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C). In the placebo group in the RCT, only approximately 10% of weekly injections resulted in an RFBM within 4 hours of dose administration; however, when patients crossed over to methylnaltrexone prn in the OLE, this percentage increased to 35% to 40%.

Abdominal pain, nausea, and urinary tract infections were the most common AEs during the OLE. Serious AEs were reported in 1 patient (0.7%) during placebo treatment (musculoskeletal chest pain) in the RCT and 4 patients (3.0%) during methylnaltrexone treatment in the OLE (pneumonia in 2 patients; gastroenteritis and hypertension in 1 patient; and mental status change in 1 patient); none were considered by investigators to be drug related.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>TABLE 2</label><caption><p>Summary of AEs (Placebo Crossover Population)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="aap-41-93-g005"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Methylnaltrexone is a peripherally acting &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonist that targets the underlying pathophysiology of OIC: opioid agonism of &#x003bc;-opioid receptors in the GI tract. Opioids can interfere with normal GI motility, thereby reducing productive peristalsis, increasing fluid absorption from the GI tract, and decreasing intestinal secretions, which leads to drier harder stool.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Subcutaneous methylnaltrexone has been shown in an RCT to be well tolerated and to provide significant relief from OIC when administered once daily or every other day for the treatment of OIC in patients with chronic noncancer pain.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The current post hoc analysis examined the repeatability of these findings by evaluating the tolerability and response of patients who were initially treated with placebo during the RCT and crossed over to treatment with methylnaltrexone 12 mg prn for up to 12 weeks. This methodology minimized the risk of heterogeneity with the analyses by having each patient function as his or her own control.</p><p>The current analysis reaffirmed the data from the RCT and demonstrated that a higher percentage of patients achieved an RFBM within 4 hours of the first dose of methylnaltrexone during the OLE compared with their first dose of placebo in the RCT. As well, other efficacy analyses, including the percentage of weekly responders (&#x02265;3 RFBMs per week and &#x02265;1 RFBM increase over baseline) and weekly number of RFBMs, improved when patients crossed over to receive methylnaltrexone prn compared with their experience with placebo treatment during the RCT. Furthermore, responder rates achieved when patients crossed over to methylnaltrexone treatment in the OLE (53.7%&#x02013;70.9%) were consistent with results observed during the 4-week RCT for patients receiving methylnaltrexone qd (61.2%&#x02013;66.4%) or qod (45.6%&#x02013;60.5%) and results for the methylnaltrexone-treated patients who continued to receive methylnaltrexone in the OLE (56.3%&#x02013;69.4% and 49.4%&#x02013;67.5% for qd and qod dosing, respectively). This is the first OIC study to evaluate drug efficacy during an RCT and an OLE crossover period, and differences in &#x0201c;responder&#x0201d; definitions prevent comparisons with other studies; however, an RCT of oral &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonist alvimopan that used a definition similar to the one used in the current study (ie, patients who had &#x02265;3 spontaneous bowel movements per week and a mean increase from baseline of &#x02265;1 spontaneous bowel movement per week) showed that responder rates with alvimopan 1 mg/d were only slightly higher (72%) than response rates in the current study.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> A separate RCT of alvimopan using the identical definition of responder reported no significant difference with alvimopan 1 mg/d compared with placebo.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Lower response rates in patients with noncancer pain have been reported with naloxegol (a pegylated &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonist; 34.9%&#x02013;44.4%) and lubiprostone (a ClC-2 chloride channel agonist, 27.1%), but whether this reflects reduced efficacy or differences in study responder criteria is unknown.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>The tolerability profile of patients who crossed over to methylnaltrexone in the OLE was similar to their tolerability profile during exposure to placebo in the RCT. The most frequently reported AE during methylnaltrexone treatment was abdominal pain. The incidence of abdominal pain is considered related to an intentional propulsive effect of the GI tract during the normal course of a bowel movement. A post hoc analysis<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> of data from 2 placebo-controlled trials of methylnaltrexone for OIC in patients with advanced illness<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> characterized reports of abdominal pain as mostly mild to moderate in intensity; incidence decreased after the first dose while response to methylnaltrexone treatment was maintained.</p><p>Although only evaluated during a 4-week period in the RCT, the findings during placebo treatment further establish the nature of OIC. The data support that little or no GI tolerance to opioid therapy develops for the opioid-related adverse effect of constipation. This lack of tolerance differs from other adverse effects of opioid analgesics and could possibly be related to the actions associated with &#x003bc;-opioid receptor subtypes (eg, tolerance develops for activities that are &#x003bc;-1 dependent versus other subtypes).<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Given the lack of tolerance development to OIC, it is important that OIC be anticipated and be treated as appropriate in patients receiving opioid analgesics.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>The strength of this placebo crossover analysis is that the design allowed patients to serve as their own controls when comparing the efficacy and safety of methylnaltrexone versus placebo. However, study limitations include the post hoc nature of the analysis, lack of statistical comparisons for placebo exposure and methylnaltrexone exposure data, and the unblinded administration of methylnaltrexone upon crossing over to the OLE. In conclusion, this study supports previous findings that subcutaneous methylnaltrexone is a tolerable and efficacious pharmacologic option for patients with OIC and chronic noncancer pain, and that administration does not result in the development of opioid tolerance across time.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Technical editorial and medical writing assistance, under the direction of the authors, was provided by Mary Beth Moncrief, PhD, and Allison A.
