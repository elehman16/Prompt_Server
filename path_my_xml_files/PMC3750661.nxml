The objective of this study is to examine whether early surgical decompression (within 24 hours after admission) would result in greater improvement in motor function compared with delayed surgery (later than two weeks) in cervical SCI patients presenting with canal stenosis, but without bony injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>OSCIS is a randomized, controlled, parallel-group, assessor-blinded, multicenter trial. We will recruit 100 cervical SCI patients who are admitted within 48 hours of injury (aged 20 to 79 years; without fractures or dislocations; American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade C; preexisting spinal canal stenosis). Patients will be enrolled from 36 participating hospitals across Japan and randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either early surgical decompression (within 24 hours after admission) or delayed surgery following at least two weeks of conservative treatment. The primary outcomes include: 1) the change from baseline to one year in the ASIA motor score; 2) the total score of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure and 3) the proportion of patients who are able to walk without human assistance. The secondary outcomes are: 1) the health-related quality of life as measured by the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 and the EuroQol 5 Dimension; 2) the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory and 3) the walking status as evaluated with the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury II. The analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary analysis will be a comparison of the primary and secondary outcomes one year after the injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study will provide evidence of the potential benefit of early surgical decompression compared to the current &#x02018;watch and wait&#x02019; strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-openbin/ctr/ctr.cgi?function=brows&#x00026;action=brows&#x00026;type=summary&#x00026;recptno=R000008009&#x00026;language=J">UMIN000006780</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01485458">NCT01485458</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>Surgery</kwd><kwd>Timing</kwd><kwd>Canal stenosis</kwd><kwd>Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament</kwd><kwd>Spondylosis</kwd><kwd>Spinal fracture</kwd><kwd>Bone injury</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Acute cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most devastating conditions, and can lead to paralysis, sensory impairment and bowel, bladder and sexual dysfunction. In addition, patients frequently suffer from intractable pain caused by neural damage. Individuals with cervical canal stenosis are known to develop cervical SCI even after minor trauma. Cervical canal stenosis may be congenital, but often results from degenerative conditions, such as spondylosis. The SCI patients with canal stenosis are mostly elderly, and usually present with incomplete SCI without bone injury, such as spinal fracture or dislocation. This subgroup of patients has been steadily increasing as the society ages and currently accounts for over 60% of cervical SCIs in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The clinical outcome of patients with incomplete SCI has been considered to be favorable, since patients usually show spontaneous neurologic recovery to some extent. However, the neurological prognosis varies greatly among patients; about half of ASIA C patients remain non-ambulatory six months after the injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In particular, the clinical outcomes of elderly patients are often suboptimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Therefore, a therapeutic option that leads to a better clinical outcome is urgently needed.</p><p>Controversy exists with regard to the efficacy of surgical decompression in the treatment of cervical SCI with preexisting canal stenosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The role of surgery remain unclear, especially in the absence of instability of the cervical spine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], thus resulting in a significant difference in practice between institutions. A common approach to treating these patients has been to rule out acute instability and then observe the patients&#x02019; spontaneous neurological recovery until they achieve a neurological plateau, and only then consider the possibility of surgical decompression, weeks after the initial injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Our previous retrospective multicenter study showed that the time from injury to surgery was approximately two weeks (median 13.5 days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The main drawback of this &#x02018;watch and wait&#x02019; strategy is that a potential therapeutic window in the acute phase might be missed. The current concept of the pathophysiology of SCI classifies the spinal damage into two stages: primary injury and secondary injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The primary injury results from the mechanical forces delivered to the spinal cord at the time of the trauma. Secondary injury is a cascade of pathophysiological events including edema, ischemia, inflammation and apoptosis following the initial impact, which develops within minutes to hours following the trauma. There is a growing body of evidence from preclinical or animal studies that early surgical decompression alleviates &#x02018;secondary injury&#x02019; and thus results in enhanced neurological and functional recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Although numerous studies have been performed to examine the potential benefit of early surgery, the results of these prior clinical studies were mixed, and failed to provide robust support for the hypothesis that early surgery leads to improved outcomes. One small randomized trial of 42 patients showed no benefit to early (&#x0003c; 72 hours) decompression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. On the other hand, a meta-analysis of case series showed that early (&#x0003c; 24 hours) decompression was associated with better outcomes compared to both delayed (&#x0003e; 24 hours) and conservative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The results of STASCIS, one of the largest prospective studies of 313 patients, were also in favor of early surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The authors of that study reported that early surgery, within 24 hours after injury, is associated with an improved neurological outcome, defined as at least a two grade ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) improvement at the six-month follow-up examination. However, the difference in the chance of experiencing a one grade AIS improvement between early versus late surgery was not statistically significant.</p><p>With such conflicting information in the literature and a lack of high-quality evidence, it remains unclear whether early surgical decompression would result in better neurological and functional recovery. To address this issue, we launched the OSCIS study (Optimal treatment for Spinal Cord Injury associated with cervical canal Stenosis), a randomized, controlled, multicenter trial, in which we will compare the two strategies: early surgery within 24 hours after admission and delayed surgery following at least two weeks of conservative treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>The OSCIS study is a randomized, controlled, parallel-group, assessor-blinded, multicenter study.

For patients presented with OPLL, mid-sagittal reconstruction CT images or plain radiographs of the cervical spine will be used to calculate the degree of canal compromise.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Patients will be randomly allocated to undergo either early surgery or delayed surgery.</p><sec><title>Early surgery</title><p>Patients allocated to early surgery will undergo surgery within 24 hours after admission. The time when they enter the operating room will be used as a reference. The principal goal of surgery is to achieve decompression of the spinal cord. The choice of anterior or posterior approach will be left to the surgeon&#x02019;s discretion. The use of spinal instrumentation will be permitted when needed. The surgery will be performed by or under supervision of a board-certified orthopedic surgeon. The details of the surgical treatment and any perioperative adverse events will be recorded in a web-based predefined form. All patients will receive intensive rehabilitation tailored to the individual and injury-specific factors immediately after surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Delayed surgery</title><p>Patients allocated to the delayed surgery group will receive conservative treatment consisting of early mobilization and intensive rehabilitation for at least two weeks after the injury. Surgical decompression will be performed by the same team as in the early surgery group at any time later than two weeks after the injury when the physician thinks the timing is appropriate. Physicians will be allowed to treat patients non-surgically as long as the patients can achieve independent ambulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Other treatments</title><p>Apart from the surgical management, all patients will receive appropriate medical support, including permissive or induced hypertensive therapy (mean blood pressure &#x0003e; 85 mmHg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].

Additionally, we expect that the percentage of ambulatory patients one year after the injury will increase from 50% to 80%. To detect this difference, we need 39 patients for each group. With regard to the SCIM, there are few data that can be used as a basis for sample size calculation. For the reasons above, we set the sample size to be 50 patients per group. All calculations assume an 80% power at a two-tailed significance level of 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>All analyses will be based on an intention-to-treat principal, and will be performed with two-sided <italic>P</italic>-values considered significant when they are below 0.05.

In particular, in patients that are moved out of the surgical standby group, we will compare the ratio of the occurrence of adverse events with those in the patients in the early operation group.</p></sec><sec><title>Planned subgroup analyses</title><p>Predefined subgroup analyses will be performed in patients with or without OPLL. These will include high-dose methylprednisolone treatment, preexisting gait disturbance and severe canal compromise (&#x0003e; 50% canal compromise). Based on our previous study, we hypothesize that early surgical decompression will be beneficial in patients with preexisting gait disturbance and those with severe canal compromise.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical issues</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committees of all participating hospitals and will be done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study will be overseen by an independent safety monitoring board.

The results will be disseminated via the usual scientific forums, including peer-reviewed publications and presentations at international conferences.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite intensive basic and clinical research, an effective treatment for cervical SCI has not been established. In the presence of preexisting canal stenosis, the role of surgical decompression and its optimal timing continue to be subjects of intense debate. Addressing the issue of the timing of surgical intervention is critical in that, if the timing of surgery has no effect on the patient&#x02019;s outcome, then all patients can initially be treated non-surgically and surgery can be delayed for weeks or even months after the injury without compromising the patient&#x02019;s recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. On the other hand, if early surgical decompression is proven to be beneficial, drastic changes in the medical service system, including logistics, should be made to ensure that all SCI patients receive early surgery.</p><p>In conducting clinical studies on SCI, the heterogeneity of the study population can be a major obstacle, especially in the acute phase. SCI patients vary greatly in the severity of paralysis and neurological prognosis. Clinical studies including patients with various degrees of neurological injury may have insufficient power. Therefore, in this study, we will focus on patients with ASIA C status. In a recent review, the consensus of experts was that it is reasonable to consider early surgical decompression in patients with profound neurologic deficit (ASIA C) and spinal canal stenosis without fracture or instability. On the other hand, those with a less severe deficit (ASIA D) can be treated with initial observation with surgery potentially performed at a later date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We will exclude patients with ASIA B status, because these patients are often difficult to distinguish from ASIA A patients at the time of admission.</p><p>The information available regarding the window of opportunity or therapeutic window in human SCI is imprecise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and the definition of &#x02018;early surgery&#x02019; has not yet been well established. Although the ideal cutoff time at which surgery provides potential neuroprotection is not known, the most intensively investigated times in the prior studies were 24 and 72 hours. In this study, we have adopted a cutoff at twenty-two hours after admission mainly for practical and logistic reasons. Twenty-four hours after admission is considered to be necessary and sufficient to safely perform the initial evaluation of patients and summon the operating team for emergency surgery. In this study, we adopted the time of admission as a reference, since the time of injury sometimes remains conjectural.</p><p>The OSCIS study is designed to provide evidence of the potential benefit of early surgical decompression over a wait-and-see strategy. We believe that the results of this trial will have a substantial impact on the management of cervical SCI.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial was registered in the UMIN register on 1 December, 2011. The first patient was randomized on 3 December, 2011.
