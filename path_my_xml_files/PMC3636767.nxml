There were no such decreases in the T80 group. Overall, two patients had possibly clinically significant alterations related to electrolyte levels, both in the T80/H25 group. The criteria for clinically significant abnormalities based on normalized potassium values were defined as serum levels below 3.0 mmol/L or above 5.8 mmol/L. One patient had an increase in serum potassium from 4.5 mmol/L at baseline to 6.6 mmol/L at week 5. This was resolved post study, with serum potassium restored to 4.1 mmol/L by week 8. One patient had a decrease in serum potassium from 3.3 mmol/L at baseline to 2.8 mmol/L at week 6.

At week 7, mean potassium levels were unchanged in older, black, and Asian patients taking T80/H25. All other patient subpopulations receiving T80/H25 had small mean reductions in serum potassium of &#x02212;0.1 mmol/L at week 7.

There were no clinically significant increases for high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or urea. In patients receiving T80/H25, mean creatinine levels were unchanged at week 7, with the exception of the subpopulation of patients who had a history of prior treatment with at least 2 agents, in whom a mean increase of 0.1 mg/dL was observed. There were no mean changes in creatinine at week 7 in the T80 treatment group.</p><p>Within the T80/H25 treatment arm, mean blood glucose was increased by 1&#x02013;7 mg/dL in most patient subpopulations. Females receiving T80/H25 had no change from baseline in mean blood glucose, and older patients &#x02265; 65 years receiving T80/H25 exhibited some reduction in mean blood glucose at week 7 (&#x02212;1.0 mg/dL). Within the T80 treatment group, mean blood glucose was increased by 1&#x02013;6 mg/dL in most patient subpopulations. Male patients and those &#x0003c;65 years receiving T80 showed no change from baseline in mean blood glucose. Reductions in mean blood glucose between &#x02212;1 and &#x02212;4 mg/dL were observed with T80 treatment in black patients, patients with no history of previous antihypertensive use, and those with grade 2 hypertension.</p><p>The effect of T80/H25 treatment on LDL was consistent across most patient subpopulations, although there appeared to be a differential effect of race and history of previous antihypertensive treatment; in white and black patients, there was a mean increase from baseline in LDL of 1.0% and 9.6%, respectively, whereas Asian patients had a mean decrease of &#x02212;3.4%. In patients who had received previous treatment with one or two or more agents, there was a mean increase from baseline in LDL of 0.5% and 1.6%, respectively, whereas patients who had not received previous treatment with other antihypertensive agents had a mean decrease in LDL of &#x02212;1.1%. In the T80 treatment group, a mean increase from baseline in LDL between 0.6% and 3.1% was observed in female, black, and Asian patients, those with history of any prior antihypertensive treatment, younger patients and those with grade 3 hypertension. Mean LDL was unchanged at week 7 in white patients receiving T80. Male patients, those with no prior antihypertensive treatment, patients with grade 2 hypertension, and older patients experienced mean decreases in LDL of &#x02212;0.5 to &#x02212;1.6%.</p><p>Triglycerides increased in the T80/H25 group by 15 mg/dL but decreased in the T80 group by 9 mg/dL, and these effects were broadly consistent across the patient subpopulations, with the exception of Asian patients, in whom a higher mean increase of 31 mg/dL (25.4%) was observed for T80/H25 treatment and in patients who had received at least two previous antihypertensive treatments, in whom a mean increase of 20 mg/dL (15.9%) was observed for T80/H25 treatment. Older patients &#x02265; 65 years receiving T80/H25 had the smallest mean increase in triglycerides of 6 mg/dL (5.2%). Uric acid increased by 1 mg/dL in the T80/H25 group but remained constant in the T80 group, and these effects were broadly consistent across the patient subpopulations.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The prospectively defined efficacy analysis of this randomized, international, multicenter study showed the superiority of a single-pill combination of T80/H25 over T80 monotherapy in patients with grade 2 or 3 hypertension. This analysis was performed to establish whether there was any difference in response to treatment in patients according to their gender, race, age, severity of hypertension at baseline, and the number of antihypertensive agents they had received before study entry. In these analyses, the single-pill combination of T80/H25 consistently provided additional BP lowering, irrespective of these different patient subpopulations.</p><p>High rates of BP response to the single-pill combination of T80/H25 were achieved in both men and women. While women were more likely than men to achieve large systolic BP reductions (ie, reduction in systolic BP &#x0003e; 30 mmHg) in response to the T80/H25 single-pill combination, overall, both men and women achieved excellent additional BP reductions with the combination therapy (60.9% of men and 75.4% of women achieved systolic BP reductions &#x0003e; 30 mmHg).</p><p>Comparable efficacy of treatment was observed regardless of patient race, with substantial responses to the T80/H25 single-pill combination noted in white, black, and Asian subpopulations. Older patients, those with severe hypertension, and patients who had previously been treated with two or more antihypertensive agents responded to treatment as well as younger patients, those with less severe hypertension, and those with less exposure to prior antihypertensive therapy. Moreover, treatment with the T80/H25 single-pill combination was effective across all baseline hypertension severities and effected greater systolic BP reductions among patients with grade 3 hypertension relative to systolic BP reductions in patients with grade 2 hypertension, as expected.</p><p>Achieving BP reductions in all subpopulations of patients with moderate to severe hypertension is an important treatment goal that affects long-term risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite this, few systematic, prospective analyses are reported regarding the consistency of treatment response among different demographic groups.

The rate of dizziness was also low in the T80/H25 treatment group (1.9%), and dizziness was more frequently observed in females compared with males, in younger patients compared with older patients, in Asians compared with black or white patients, and also more frequently in those with no history of previous antihypertensive treatment.</p><p>The use of thiazide diuretics has been associated with adverse electrolytic changes, including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hyperuricemia, although this effect may be offset with concomitant use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ibpc-6-001">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ibpc-6-001">20</xref> This study only reports the short-term effects of T80/H25 treatment on electrolyte balance up to 7 weeks.

Treatment with the T80/H25 single-pill combination resulted in large BP reductions across all studied patient subpopulations. Single-pill combination treatment with T80/H25 was well tolerated in all the patient subgroups studied, with no marked difference in treatment-related adverse events compared with monotherapy. The percentage of patients with treatment-related adverse events was numerically higher in black patients compared with white and Asian patients in both treatment groups. The proportion of patients with adverse events leading to discontinuation was low and similar across the different patient subgroups. In conclusion, treatment with T80/H25 appears to provide large BP reductions and high goal attainment rates in patients regardless of gender, age, race, severity of hypertension, and prior antihypertensive treatment, with favorable safety and tolerability, which is likely to result in an overall positive impact on cardiovascular risk.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-ibpc-6-001"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>Medical writing assistance, supported f inancially by Boehringer Ingelheim, was provided by Danielle Russell, PhD, and Winnie McFadzean, PhD, of PAREXEL during the preparation of this article.
