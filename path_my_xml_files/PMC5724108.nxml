Innovative approaches such as mobile phone technology (mHealth) for electronic decision support in delivering evidence-based and integrated care for hypertension, diabetes and comorbid depression have potential to transform the primary healthcare system.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>mWellcare trial is a multicentre, cluster randomised controlled trial evaluating the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a mHealth system and nurse managed care for people with hypertension and diabetes in rural India. mWellcare system is an Android-based mobile application designed to generate algorithm-based clinical management prompts for treating hypertension and diabetes and also capable of storing health records, sending alerts and reminders for follow-up and adherence to medication. We recruited a total of 3702 participants from 40 Community Health Centres (CHCs), with &#x02265;90 at each of the CHCs in the intervention and control (enhanced care) arms. The primary outcome is the difference in mean change (from baseline to 1&#x02009;year) in systolic blood pressure and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) between the two treatment arms. The secondary outcomes are difference in mean change from baseline to 1&#x02009;year in fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, predicted 10-year risk of CVD, depression, smoking behaviour, body mass index and alcohol use between the two treatment arms and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study has been approved by the institutional Ethics Committees at Public Health Foundation of India and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Development of intervention involved adapting existing clinical management guidelines to the local context, development and validation of clinical algorithm and pilot testing of mWellcare system. Nurses and physicians in the intervention arm were trained in the use of mWellcare system and also provided &#x02018;refresher&#x02019; training on the clinical management guidelines for hypertension and diabetes.</p><p>In the intervention arm, besides baseline information, the nurse enters information on comorbid conditions: depression (using patient health questionnaire 9), alcohol use disorder (using alcohol use disorder identification test) and previous medication details into mWellcare system and generates and prints decision support recommendation (DSR) for the physician. The DSR printout consists of patient profile, diagnosed condition, comorbid conditions, previous and current medication and recommended treatment plan. It also provides lifestyle change recommendation and the date of the next follow-up visit. After review of the DSR, the physician may agree or suggest changes in the treatment plan which is recorded in the application. Nurse provides lifestyle advice brochure (in local language) and explains the same to each participant. Each participant will be followed up for 12 months. During this period, participants will receive SMS reminders for follow-up visits scheduled as per clinical algorithm. During follow-up visits, nurse enters relevant parameter to the patient&#x02019;s clinical record and generates DSR printout for physician&#x02019;s review. Each intervention site gets monthly reports on number of participants reporting for scheduled follow-up and average change in clinical parameters.</p><p>In the enhanced care arm, nurse and physicians were provided &#x02018;refresher&#x02019; training on the clinical management guidelines for hypertension and diabetes. In addition, charts on management of these conditions were provided to the facilities for prominent display at the outpatient department. Physicians in the enhanced care arm provide the management plan based on their assessment of clinical parameters of the participants. Nurse provides lifestyle advice brochure (in local language) and explains the same to each participant. Follow-up in the enhanced care arm is based on the&#x000a0;assessment of clinical parameters of the participants by the physician.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="s2g1"><title>Primary outcomes</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Difference in mean change (from baseline to 1&#x02009;year) in SBP between the two treatment arms.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Difference in mean change (from baseline to 1&#x02009;year) glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) between the two treatment arms.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s2g2"><title>Secondary outcomes include</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Difference in mean change (from baseline to 1&#x02009;year) between the two treatment arms for fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol and predicted 10-year risk of CVD using recalibrated Framingham risk score.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Differences in risk factors such as depression/anxiety, smoking behaviour, BMI and alcohol use between the two treatment arms.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Comparison of costs associated with delivering the mWellcare intervention arm with respect to enhanced care.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Participant timeline</title><p>Enrolment and baseline assessment were done during the first visit, and the participants were asked to come back for blood sample collection (for HbA1C and total cholesterol tests) within 2&#x02009;weeks.

We estimated that the recruitment could be completed in 2 months enrolling a minimum of two to three participants a day. However, some sites had lower recruitment rate for either of the two conditions. Therefore, the final strategy was to stop recruitment of participants with either condition after reaching 45, and&#x000a0;then complete recruitment of patient with the other condition. A total of 3702 participants were recruited from 40 CHCs.</p><p>All individuals diagnosed to have hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes were assessed for eligibility by the nurse.

The randomisation list was generated by a statistician independent of the trial using STATA SE V. 12. The list was stratified by states (Haryana and Karnataka) and within states by availability/non-availability of nurses recruited under NPCDCS. In Karnataka, stratification based on availability of nurses was done allocating 10 clusters in each category (nurse available under NPCDCS/not available). In Haryana, as there was no nurses recruited under NPCDCS, further stratification was not done. Clusters (CHCs) within each strata were randomised to intervention or enhanced care arm using block randomisation (with a block size of 2). Being a cluster randomised trial, only limited blinding could be enforced. The study statistician will remain blinded throughout the study until database is locked and study unblinded.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Data collection, management and analysis</title><sec id="s2l1"><title>Baseline assessment</title><p>After consent, the nurse in both arms collected baseline data for the following parameters using a tablet computer: age, gender, marital status, occupation, alcohol use, smoking behaviour, health-related quality of life measured using EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D), height, weight, blood pressure and blood sugar. Consented participants were asked to return on a scheduled day for blood sample collection for HbA1c and total cholesterol.</p></sec><sec id="s2l2"><title>Endline assessment</title><p>Endline assessment of outcomes will be undertaken after completion of 12-month follow-up.

There are built&#x02010;in data checks and further data cleaning will be done by trained data managers at Public Health Foundation of India&#x000a0;(PHFI), under the supervision of the Principal Investigator. All electronic data are encrypted, password protected and stored in secure computer networks.</p><p>Data are monitored centrally for its quality and completeness using electronic validation and on-site monitoring. Recruitment and retention of participants was assessed by examining the number eligible for recruitment, number enrolled in the study and dropout from regular follow-up will be assessed at the completion of 12 months. In addition, we are carrying out central statistical monitoring (CSM) all through the trial. CSM aims to detect outliers and inliers, deviation of any cluster from the average and to detect potential data error or incorrect data collection procedure. Field coordinators undertake monthly visits to all sites, record their observations using Objective Systematic Structured Observations (OSSO) checklist regarding intervention delivery, source documents examination, protocol adherence and adverse event recording and reporting. The monthly visit reports are sent online to the research coordinating centre. In addition, study investigators undertook site visits to monitor enrolment process, intervention delivery and protocol adherence and reported to the trial management committee.</p></sec><sec id="s2l4"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Quantitative data analysis will be performed using STATA V.&#x000a0;13.0 (Stata). A statistical data analysis plan will be prepared and discussed with Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) before data collection is completed.</p><p>The primary analyses will be conducted under the principle of intention to treat. All randomised participants will be analysed in the groups to which they were originally allocated to, regardless of whether they actually retained that specific group membership over the course of the trial or not. Participants who withdrew consent for use of their data will not be included in any analyses.</p><p>Demographic and clinical characteristics will be examined for participants at each CHC. Summaries will be presented as means and SD of those variables that are approximately normally distributed, or medians and IQRs for skewed variables. Categorical variables will be summarised as frequencies and percentages. Transformations will be used when distributional assumptions are not fulfilled for inferential tests on a continuous measure. If we find a considerable imbalance in some variables at baseline, we will consider adjusting for these variables by including them in the model to estimate the effect of the intervention. In principle, in a trial with individual blinded randomisation, there should be no major baseline differences between arms, but this may not be the case in cluster sample given that the number of samples are small, individuals are not completely blind. So there is some potential for baseline differences between individuals recruited in each arm and this will have to be adjusted for in the analysis.</p><p>We will also account for the influence of clustering at the CHC level on the outcome. Data will be analysed at the individual level and comparisons will be made between the mean changes in the primary outcomes in the intervention and control groups. Linear-mixed effect models adjusting for baseline measurements will be used with a random intercept for the CHC level to account for the clustering in the data.</p><p>Reporting of results will be in accordance with the principles of Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials(CONSORT) statements extended for cluster randomised controlled trial&#x000a0;(RCT).</p></sec><sec id="s2l5"><title>Process evaluation</title><p>REAIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance) framework for the process evaluation will be used for mWellcare trial.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This would entail a combination of qualitative (observations, interviews, focus group discussions) and quantitative (open-ended and close-ended questionnaires) assessment.</p><p>Fidelity will be assessed through logs of training, indicators from OSSO checklist and data captured through mWellcare system. Besides reports of monitoring visits by experts will form a part of the assessment.</p></sec><sec id="s2l6"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>To help inform potential financing and adoption of the mWellcare intervention, compared with enhanced care (control), we will estimate the value for different stakeholders: patients (mean annual health expenditures in each arm), healthcare providers (incremental costs to deliver the intervention and cost-effectiveness: eg, incremental cost to prevent one CVD event) and society (cost-utility: eg, cost per quality-adjusted life years gained).</p><p>We will collect patient-level healthcare utilisation and medical costs data incurred during the trial regarding outpatient visits, diagnostic services, medications, hospitalisations and lost productivity.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> We will identify intervention costs from the non-communicable&#x000a0;disease clinic and study expenditures (eg, costs related to accessing the mWellcare system, and sending the regular SMS updates, training costs, labour costs for nurses, physician&#x02019;s time cost and overhead costs minus costs attributable only to research activities (eg, annual study visit)).

Few trials have evaluated the impact of DSS on managing patients with hypertension and diabetes. A recent cluster randomised trial in Andhra Pradesh, India, which evaluated the use of DSS in hypertension management, demonstrated significant reduction in SBP among patient in primary healthcare facilities.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> However, this trial focused only on hypertension while the other cardiometabolic risk factors were not covered. The recently published results of Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia&#x000a0;(CARRS) Diabetes Trial shows significant improvement in diabetes care targets and cardiometabolic risk reduction among patients who underwent multicomponent quality improvement intervention comprising non-physician care coordinators and decision&#x000a0;support electronic health records.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> However, the findings of CARRS trial are confined to urban specialist care settings.</p><p>mWellcare trial with its cluster randomised design will extend the evidence on impact of mHealth intervention on patient&#x02019;s CVD outcomes at primary care level. It will provide evidence on the use of nurse for patient assessment and long-term follow-up using the mWellcare system thereby shifting/sharing some of the patient management tasks from physicians. It is also designed to provide decision support to physician for standardised and integrated management of hypertension and diabetes along with comorbid condition such as depression and alcohol use disorder.</p><p>The mWellcare intervention is being implemented in the real-world scenario aimed at using the existing human resource (as the nurse appointed at the outpatient clinics through the NPCDCS). The trial also incorporates cost-effectiveness analysis of the intervention. All these factors would be helpful in informing decision makers in allocating resources and scaling up the intervention based on the trial findings.</p><p>There are a few limitations for this study. The effectiveness of the trial will also depend on the availability of drugs, recommended by the decision support system, at the CHCs. Drugs are supplied by the state government and there are variations in availability across the state and districts, although such variations are likely to affect both arms equally. Another limitations is that the mWellcare system will be used only for the people who have been already diagnosed with hypertension or diabetes by the physician, and will not aid in opportunistic screening of patients coming to the CHC. This was done to keep both intervention and control arms at par. In case the intervention is scaled up, a screening module can be added to the mWellcare system.</p><sec id="s3a" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The mWellcare trial will provide evidence on effectiveness of the nurse-based mHealth intervention for integrated management of hypertension and diabetes at primary care level in India.
