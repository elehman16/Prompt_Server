Research has demonstrated that performing visuo-spatial tasks after analogue trauma can block the consolidation of fear memory and reduce the frequency of flashbacks. However, no research has yet used verbal techniques to alter memories during the consolidation window. This is surprising given that the most effective treatments for PTSD are verbally-based with exposure therapy and trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy gaining the most evidence of efficacy. Psychological therapies aim to reduce the conditioned fear response, which is in keeping with the preliminary finding that an increased propensity for fear conditioning may be a vulnerability factor for PTSD. Our research had two aims. We investigated the degree to which individual differences in fear conditioning predict the development of PTSD symptoms. We also compared the preventative effects of two clinically informed psychological techniques administered during the consolidation window: <italic>exposure</italic> to the trauma memory and <italic>updating</italic> the meaning of the trauma. 115 healthy participants underwent a fear conditioning paradigm in which traumatic film stimuli (unconditioned stimuli) were paired with neutral stimuli (conditioned stimuli). Participants were randomly allocated to an updating, exposure or control group to compare the effects on the conditioned fear response and on PTSD symptomatology. The results showed that stronger conditioned responses at acquisition significantly predicted the development of PTSD symptoms. The updating group, who verbally devalued the unconditioned stimulus within the consolidation window, experienced significantly lower levels of PTSD symptoms during follow-up than the exposure and control groups. These findings are consistent with clinical interventions for chronic PTSD and have important implications for identifying those at risk as well as for designing novel early interventions to prevent the development of PTSD.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Work by JW is supported through Wellcome Trust grant 069777 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk">http://www.wellcome.ac.uk</ext-link>).

However, 9% will go on to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The three most common traumas for men and women are the violent death of a friend or family member, witnessing severe injury or death and being involved in a serious motor vehicle accident [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. PTSD is a distressing and debilitating condition which has serious long-term health implications for the individual, such as increased risk for cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and early death [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and cost implications for society, such as losses in work productivity. Re-experiencing symptoms are the hallmark feature of PTSD and include involuntary highly emotive and intensely distressing intrusions about the trauma. Meta-analyses indicate that peri-traumatic processes (occurring at or near the time of the trauma) and post-traumatic processes might be particularly important in understanding who develops PTSD and why [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>There is a considerable body of research that has elucidated the memory processes involved in the development and maintenance of PTSD, including research on fear conditioning and memory consolidation [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], yet there have been surprisingly few attempts to investigate these processes in the context of prevention. This is important since there are currently no established interventions to prevent development of the disorder following exposure to trauma.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Conditioning theory and PTSD</title><p>Conditioning theory provides a compelling account of how re-experiencing symptoms may develop [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Fear conditioning is a process in which a neutral stimulus (conditioned stimulus; CS e.g. a tone) gains the ability to evoke fear following repeated pairing with an aversive stimulus (unconditioned stimulus; US, e.g. a shock). This is because the CS+ (CS paired with the US) becomes a signal for US onset by activating the memory representation of the US. In general, fear conditioning is an adaptive and highly important form of learning. However, it may also be at the heart of the pathogenic mechanisms leading to anxiety disorders and has been strongly implicated in theories for anxiety disorders [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Conditioning theories offer a promising explanation of some of the central features of PTSD including why previously neutral stimuli are capable of provoking physiological and emotional arousal. Consistent with conditioning theory, evidence suggests that people with PTSD show greater physiological reactivity to trauma-related cues following trauma exposure [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], PTSD severity moderates responsively to these cues [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and changes in psychophysiology can predict development and persistence of PTSD as well as treatment outcome [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Increased acquisition of fear learning (i.e. larger conditioned responding to the CS+) has been demonstrated in people with anxiety disorders [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and there is preliminary evidence that reduced extinction learning may be a pre-trauma vulnerability factor for PTSD development [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A large prospective study illustrated that reduced extinction learning in soldiers before deployment to Afghanistan predicted PTSD symptom severity more strongly than neuroticism, pre-deployment stress and exposure to stressors on deployment [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Individual differences in fear conditioning have therefore been proposed as a predictor of PTSD but further prospective studies are needed to assess causation and exclude contamination with current post-traumatic stress. Prospective longitudinal studies have mostly been confined to at-risk occupational groups and it is unclear how far these findings can be generalized. Therefore, experimental studies are essential to build a better understanding of the causal relationship between risk factors and PTSD development. The first aim of this study was to investigate whether increased acquisition of conditioned responding predicted the development of analogue PTSD symptoms.</p><p>Modifying the conditioned fear response is a central aim in therapies for PTSD with extinction proposed as a method to achieve this. However, extinction is not permanent and re-emergence of the original fear memory can occur. Re-emergence is commonly thought to happen under three general conditions: <italic>renewal</italic> occurring when the CS+ is presented outside of the extinction context [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], <italic>reinstatement</italic> occurring when the US is administered unexpectedly and <italic>spontaneous recovery</italic> occurring when a substantial amount of time has passed [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These processes imply that extinction involves the creation of new memories (inhibitory stimulus association CS+/noUS) that compete with the original fear memory (CS+/US) rather than changing the memory directly [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. An alternative to extinction, US devaluation, may offer a more fundamental way to reduce the conditioned fear response and prevent it from returning [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>US devaluation involves changing the mental representation of the US, for example through information or experience with the US. Conditioning theory suggests that the CS+ does not directly produce a conditioned response (CR) but rather triggers a representation of the US and that the evaluation of this US mediates the CR [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, the strength of the CR depends on the evaluation of the US and so altering this evaluation will modulate the CR&#x02019;s strength, independent of the CS/US contingency [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For example, if rats are habituated to the US, following CS/US pairing, then they show less fear to the CS+ compared to controls [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Devaluation can occur even without direct exposure to the US and results in changes to the CR when the CS+ is presented [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Effects in the opposite direction have also been documented, for example mild PTSD symptoms might become more severe if the person has reason to re-evaluate the danger of the original trauma (e.g. they found out that the person who assaulted them was a convicted murderer) [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The advantage of US devaluation, compared to extinction, is that it acts directly on the US representation and so may be less vulnerable to the return of fear and may more easily generalise.</p><p>Imagery rescripting, a therapeutic technique, has been proposed to act through US devaluation [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and has been successfully applied to treating a number of anxiety disorders [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], including PTSD [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The technique involves activation of the distressing memory and then updating/rescripting of the memory with neutral or positive information. Two recent analogue studies illustrated that adding imagery rescripting to extinction training could reduce intrusion frequency [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and the conditioned fear response at renewal as measured by US expectancy ratings but not skin conductance response (SCR) [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, US devaluation offers a promising technique to optimise early interventions but requires further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Disrupting the consolidation of fear memories</title><p>When fearful memories are initially formed they appear labile and vulnerable to change but steadily become less so as they are consolidated via protein synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Invasive pharmacological manipulations have been shown to successfully disrupt consolidation but their use in humans is problematic (e.g. toxicity). Encouragingly, it has been illustrated that a non-invasive extinction procedure (i.e. not requiring pharmacological manipulation) within either the consolidation or reconsolidation window can be used to re-write the fear memory and so prevent the return of fear in rats [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and humans [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Little or no reinstatement, renewal or spontaneous recovery was seen if extinction occurred shortly after conditioning, compared to moderate to strong return of fear when extinction occurred twenty-four hours or more later. The implication is that during consolidation or reconsolidation, the CS/US trace is labile and can be re-written to include the CS/noUS learning before storage. It is unclear whether extinction learning during consolidation/reconsolidation leads to the &#x02018;unlearning&#x02019; or weakening of the stored memory trace (or access to it) and/or learning a new interpretation of the CS. It is frequently proposed that the adaptive function of reconsolidation is to enable the updating of old memories with new information [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>Targeting consolidation may offer a mechanism to re-write fear memories and protect against the long-term psychological and physiological effects of traumatic fear memories. Recently, promising results have arisen from studies using visuo-spatial tasks to block the consolidation of fear memory [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, no research has yet used verbal techniques to alter memories during the consolidation window. This is surprising given that the most effective treatments of chronic PTSD are verbally-based and include a particular focus on the meaning of events. Leading cognitive theories suggest that re-experiencing symptoms and intrusions are due to the fear memory lacking sufficient integration with other autobiographical memories, a deficit that may arise as a consequence of shifts in information processing under high stress [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Therapeutic tools for early intervention</title><p>Cognitive behavioural techniques administered to people with acute stress disorder (ASD) in the first month after trauma have been shown to reduce rates of PTSD and anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and are considered as the most effective early intervention so far [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The relative effectiveness of exposure to the trauma memory versus updating (a technique that combines exposure to the memory and cognitive restructuring) and whether these utilise different therapeutic mechanisms is contentious. Studies that have compared exposure and cognitive therapy at early intervention have shown mixed results: one illustrated comparable results in reducing PTSD [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] whilst another found that those receiving exposure were more likely to be in full remission at follow-up and achieve higher functioning than those receiving cognitive restructuring [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Some researchers suggest that exposure may be the critical component in CBT to prevent ASD developing into PTSD [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. How similar the active treatment mechanism for these two techniques are, is debated and it might be that their relative effectiveness changes depending on PTSD chronicity and severity.</p><p>Therefore, the second aim of the current research was to compare common therapeutic techniques in order to inform the development of more effective interventions for early prevention. This was investigated by using trauma films to induce fear memories in healthy volunteers. The trauma film paradigm offers an ecologically valid trauma analogue to investigate causal factors in PTSD development. Previous research using this paradigm has shown that changes in appraisal style [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] leads to fewer intrusions consistent with the assumption that verbal strategies to update the meaning of the US may serve as an effective strategy to prevent re-experiencing symptoms. In order to compare the effects of the different techniques, we used a US devaluation paradigm with a range of measures, using self-reports as well as a physiological measure, to capture the complexity of PTSD. Participants underwent a fear conditioning paradigm in which traumatic film stimuli (US) were paired with neutral stimuli (CS) in the acquisition phase, and participants were then allocated to one of three groups. The groups were designed to build on one another in an additive fashion: no intervention (control group), further exposure to the trauma films (exposure group) and further exposure to the films plus additional information aimed at updating the meaning of the trauma (update group).</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>As this is this is the first study to use trauma film stimuli as the US, it was important to first establish whether trauma film stimuli could be used to induce conditioned fear as measured by SCR and distress ratings. The study then investigated the two main hypotheses. First, that participants who have a smaller conditioned fear response following acquisition will experience fewer intrusions, be less distressed by them and report fewer PTSD symptoms in the week following the trauma paradigm when trait anxiety is controlled for. As pre-trauma anxiety is associated with the development of PTSD [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and people with higher trait anxiety have been shown to acquire aversive conditioning more strongly and more rapidly [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], it is important to control for trait anxiety when investigating this relationship. Second, that participants in the update group will (a) have the largest reduction in physiological responding and subjective distress ratings following US devaluation compared to those in the exposure and control groups and will (b) experience fewer intrusions, be less distressed by them and have fewer PTSD symptoms in the week following the trauma paradigm than the exposure or control groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Participants</title><p>We recruited healthy participants by poster and email advertisements. Exclusion criteria included being less than 18 years of age, having completed similar trauma studies, working in a hospital emergency department and having a clinically significant mental health problem as assessed by standardised self-report measures of anxiety, depression and PTSD. Twenty-five participants were excluded due to having clinically significant mental health problems and six participants were excluded for having previously completed a similar study or for having experience in an emergency department. One hundred and fifteen participants met inclusion criteria and completed the experimental task: 28 males and 87 females with a mean age of 26.72 (SD = 7.84; range 18&#x02013;56). Of these, two participants did not complete the follow-up questionnaires leaving a sample of 113 participants for analyses involving follow-up data. All participants gave informed consent and were paid for their participation. The Psychiatry, Nursing and Midwifery Research Ethics Committee at Kings College London gave approval for the study. All participants provided written informed consent prior to their participation in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Procedure</title><p>We used an experimental between-subjects design with three main stages: a screening stage, experimental session and a one-week follow-up period. After having time to read and consider the information sheet, participants were asked to complete the baseline measures and screening questionnaires on-line before attending the session. The experimental session comprised two consecutive phases: (1) acquisition and (2) US devaluation (<xref rid="pone.0122971.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). During acquisition, all participants underwent a Pavlovian discrimination fear conditioning paradigm. Fear conditioning was measured using SCR amplitude and subjective distress ratings. Participants then took part in one of three US devaluation conditions, to which they had been allocated based on a predetermined sequence produced by random number generation. In the week following the experimental phase, participants were asked to complete an intrusion diary to record any spontaneously occurring memories that they experienced related to the film clips and to complete the follow-up questionnaires.</p><fig id="pone.0122971.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0122971.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Summary of procedure.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0122971.g001"/></fig><sec id="sec009"><title>Experimental session</title><p>Subjects were instructed to pay attention to the computer screen and to try to work out the meaning of the CS+ and CS-. Trauma film stimuli were used as the US, a circle (0.5 inches in diameter) as the CS+ and a square (0.7 inches in length) as the CS-. At pre-determined points during the task, the CS+ and CS- appeared in the right hand corner of the screen for two seconds. The participant&#x02019;s physiological and subjective responses to the CS+ and CS- were measured before and after each phase.</p><p>All participants took part in the acquisition phase. During acquisition, participants watched a series of six short film clips with introductory narratives and the CS+s embedded within them. The films contained real-life footage of humans and animals in distress. Each film contained an introductory voice-over which gave a narrative and context for the film (see <xref rid="pone.0122971.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>), as suggested by previous research [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The CS+ was inserted into the films to signal the most distressing part of the film. The length of the film clips ranged from 76 to 150 seconds, with a mean length of 108.5 seconds (SD 33.09). After watching the six trauma films, participants viewed an <italic>intensive presentation phase</italic> in which the image and sound bite from the parts of the films previously paired with the CS+ (the worst moments) were presented again with the CS+. In this phase, the CS- was paired with neutral images. The CS+ was presented 10 times and the CS- presented 6 times during this phase. The US (an image and sound bite of the worst moment from each of the trauma films) was displayed for 3 seconds.</p><p>In the US devaluation phase, participants were randomly allocated to one of three US devaluation groups: (1) update group (exposure plus verbal update): participants viewed the same films again but the introductory passage was elaborated to contain additional information about what happened to the protagonists in the films, (2) exposure group: the trauma films with the introductory passages were viewed again by participants, (3) control: participants viewed non-traumatic films of related content. Reinforced CSs were not presented for any of the groups in this phase.</p><p>The control group viewed films whose content was similar to the trauma films and would be commonly encountered by the participant, i.e. car journeys. In order to ensure that the control films alone did not provoke significant levels of distress and fear and that the content was rated as neutral, they were viewed by six pilot participants. The participants were asked to rate the control films for feelings of distress and fear (measured on a scale of 0 being not at all distressing/fear provoking to 100 being extremely distressing/fear provoking) and rate the valence of the films (with 0 being very positive and 100 being very negative). The films were rated as not producing significant distress (mean 2.50; SD 4.18) or fear (mean 2.50; SD 4.18) and their valence was rated as neutral (mean 48.67; SD 2.16).

Therefore, the well-established trauma-film paradigm was used to investigate causal factors in analogue PTSD symptom development and the relative effectiveness of clinically-informed psychological techniques. Trauma films have not previously been used as a US with most conditioning studies using electric shocks as the US [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Using trauma film stimuli as the US has advantages of being a better analogue of real-life trauma, being more readily experimentally manipulated (e.g. they can be devalued cognitively) and allowing the concurrent investigation of conditioned fear and PTSD symptomatology. This study demonstrated that trauma film stimuli can be used as the US to induce conditioned fear as measured by SCR and distress ratings. The trauma paradigm was effective in inducing intrusive memories of the films with 95% of participants reporting at least one intrusion. Therefore, this current study suggests that trauma film and conditioned fear paradigms can be effectively combined.</p><p>In terms of hypothesis one, participants who acquired a stronger conditioned fear response experienced more intrusions, were more distressed by them and experienced more PTSD symptoms following the trauma film paradigm. Differential SCR at acquisition predicted all three of the outcome variables whilst differential subjective ratings of distress predicted number of intrusions and distress in response to the intrusions. This is consistent with conditioning theories of PTSD which highlight the role of CS-US contingencies in the development of PTSD [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and previous research demonstrating that people with anxiety disorders acquire fear conditioning more strongly than those without [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The relationship between enhanced fear conditioning and anxiety disorders may operate at a number of stages e.g. a stronger association may mean that the fear response is more readily triggered to cues, triggered to more loosely associated cues, is more difficult to extinguish or that the return of fear is more likely following extinction. This current finding is consistent with the proposal that individual differences in the ease of acquisition can explain why some people develop anxiety disorders and some people do not [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. To our knowledge, this is the first study to combine a conditioning paradigm with the trauma film paradigm to enable a prospective analogue design investigating how individual differences in fear conditioning impact on PTSD symptom development. Therefore, these results indicate that, in the non-clinical population, conditioned acquisition response is a better predictor of intrusion frequency, intrusion distress and PTSD symptoms than trait anxiety.</p><p>In terms of hypothesis two, the results indicate that verbally devaluing the US reduces subjective distress, intrusion frequency and PTSD symptomatology but increases SCR to the CS+. This finding is consistent with SCR reflecting an orienting attentional response [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. There is evidence to suggest that successful therapy results in an increase in attentional allocation to threat cues to enable the re-appraisal of the threat cue [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Early elevations in psychophysiology during imaginal flooding have been shown to predict improvements in intrusions [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Therefore, the larger SCR may represent increased fear-related arousal in the update group compared to the exposure or control groups, which is likely to be due to reduced attentional avoidance to the CS+, and, from the above perspective, corresponds well with the subsequent fall in subjective ratings of distress and the reduced number of analogue PTSD symptoms. New information and verbally enhanced representation of the trauma films may initially prevent a reduction of the conditioned fear response in the update group. Yet, in therapy, emotional arousal is considered to be important for therapeutic change [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] and the construction of new meaning is needed for lasting changes [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Therefore, the update condition may have facilitated higher emotional arousal (i.e. SCR) alongside new information leading to fewer intrusions and PTSD symptoms at follow-up.</p><p>Theoretically, the reduction of analogue PTSD symptoms in the updating group provides support for the idea that altering negative appraisals of the film content and enhancing verbal-conceptual processing of the trauma memory can reduce development of PTSD symptoms. This is consistent with cognitive models of PTSD which highlight the role of negative appraisals of the trauma [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and the disorganised nature of the trauma memory in the development of PTSD symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. These results also support the idea that the most effective treatments for PTSD are those that pay attention to the trauma memory and its meaning [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>].</p><p>There are other possible explanations for the reduction in analogue PTSD symptoms in the update group yet these appear less plausible. First, the update group may have had a higher working memory (WM) capacity load than the other two groups. However, working memory demands were well matched in the groups and a previous study with a similar design concluded that these groups would have similar WM demands [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Second, the update group may have had a more positive mood than the other groups when finishing the task, as low mood is linked to greater intrusion frequency [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. However, any impact on intrusion frequency from changes in mood would be short-lived (less than 24 hours) as illustrated by studies aiming to induce low mood [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] and participants in this study experienced intrusions over the entire week.</p><sec id="sec027"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>There are several limitations to this research. One limitation is the degree to which the findings can generalize to people who are exposed to real-life trauma and who develop PTSD since the study used non-clinical participants with films as the analogue trauma. In therapy, exposure and updating techniques are more complex than the analogue interventions used in this study. This study externally generated the updated meaning whilst, in therapy, time would be spent generating a subjective meaning with the patient and the techniques would be part of a much longer individually formulated intervention. However, the experimental interventions were generated based on those used in evidence-based therapy and the aims of both experimental techniques were in keeping with aims of evidence based therapies. The non-specific nature of SCR is another limitation and this study would have been enhanced by having additional indexes of fear conditioning, such as startle responses [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. A further limitation is that the CS+ and CS- were not counterbalanced in this study, however as response to the CS+ following acquisition was used as a covariate, this is unlikely to impact on the findings.</p><p>As this study appears to be the first to have combined conditioning and trauma film paradigms, the results require replication. Further studies investigating whether increased conditioned fear acquisition predicts the development of PTSD in experimental settings, in at-risk groups prior to trauma exposure and in settings targeting people shortly after trauma exposure (e.g. hospital emergency departments) would illustrate whether this could be a reliable index for identifying people vulnerable to PTSD development. It would be useful to expand on pilot studies investigating whether acquisition response is associated with treatment outcome [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. For example, it might be predicted that those who show a stronger acquisition response are more likely to develop PTSD and also more likely to derive therapeutic gain from early intervention.</p><p>Future studies could add control groups to elucidate the mechanisms that may be reducing intrusions and PTSD symptomatology in the update group. Cognitive models of PTSD [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] would predict that targeting both the disorganized nature of the trauma memory and the negative appraisals of the trauma are helpful in reducing PTSD symptoms. It would be interesting to attempt to experimentally separate these processes to establish their relative effects. For example, it may be that the update group experienced fewer intrusions due to changing the meaning of the films or that the addition of new <italic>verbal</italic> information disrupted consolidation or it is the combination that has therapeutic benefit. A control group that receives additional neutral verbal information to enhance verbal processing without changing meaning compared to a group that changes the meaning of the films would further understanding. There are other control groups that could be added to further tease apart the mechanisms and aid the development of effective early intervention, including visually compared to verbally updating the meaning of the trauma films and receiving the verbal update alone without exposure.</p><p>It would be important to investigate whether varying the time between acquisition and US devaluation/extinction has an impact on treatment effect. Some studies have included a thirty minute delay between trauma films and the intervention to mirror average waiting times in emergency departments [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Based on previous research, it is assumed that an intervention taking place in the consolidation window (approximately 6 hours) may be more effective in re-writing the trauma memory than one administered outside it [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, further investigation is warranted into whether effectiveness changes both within this six-hour window and outside it.</p><p>If the results are replicated and experimental effect is established, a study using cognitive behavioural techniques as early interventions in real-life settings (such as hospital emergency departments) would be warranted to establish whether updating techniques can limit the development of PTSD. It is important in this context to see that the verbal updating used in the current study differs significantly from debriefing techniques that advertently or inadvertently elaborate trauma memories, and instead is aimed at containing meaning and changing it in a more benign direction, akin to the mechanisms of memory re-scripting techniques, which have proven highly effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. For example, debriefing occurs in group or individual format and typically includes asking participants to speak about their experience and how it has affected them, focusing on normalising symptoms and brainstorming coping strategies. In contrast, if the verbal updating used in the current study was applied clinically, it would focus on exposure to the trauma memory through reliving techniques, identifying the meaning of the event for the person and using cognitive restructuring techniques to verbally elaborate the memory past the worst moments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec028"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Consistent with conditioning theories of PTSD [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], we have demonstrated that individual differences in acquiring CS/US contingencies predict subsequent PTSD symptoms.

This supports the idea that the most effective treatments for PTSD are those focusing on the trauma memory and its meaning [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Verbally enhancing the trauma memory is proposed to reduce intrusion frequency via increased integration and contextualisation of the memory allowing better top-down control. Previous research has suggested that exposure to the trauma memory may be the key ingredient for therapeutic change [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. This study provides initial evidence that changing the meaning of the US may devalue the US more effectively than exposure alone. The increase in SCR amplitude in the update group is consistent with treatment studies illustrating initial increases in psychophysiological responding predicting improvements in intrusions [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Successful therapy may initially lead to an increase in attentional allocation to threat cues to allow re-appraisal of the threat cue [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] and this would be reflected in a larger SCR.</p><p>The current results have significant implications for the treatment of PTSD [<xref rid="pone.0122971.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], especially early intervention, and identifying those at risk for developing PTSD. Blockade of reconsolidation and extinction are the paradigms frequently used to reduce conditioned fear. Both are limited in their efficacy as blockade often requires the use of toxic drugs and conditioned fear has been shown to return following extinction. Verbally devaluing the US representation offers a safe non-invasive intervention grounded in evidence from clinical outcome studies and conditioning theory.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0122971.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Trauma film narratives.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0122971.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge the contribution of Dr Andrew Brand for developing software routines to analyse SCR data.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0122971.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
