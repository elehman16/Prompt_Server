Prospective studies have also consistently reported that these dysglycemic patients have a higher mortality and in-hospital complications than euglycemic patients and that mortality is correlated to the degree of dysglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Furthermore, patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) whose glucose levels normalize after admission experience lower mortality than patients with persistent hyperglycemia. These epidemiologic relationships suggest that strategies to lower glucose levels in the setting of an AMI may reduce mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). However, clinical trials that targeted glucose control with intravenous insulin in the CCU (with or without postdischarge insulin therapy) have yielded mixed results to date, with some studies suggesting a strong clinical benefit and others suggesting no benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Reasons for this heterogeneity remain unclear and have been attributed to a number of possibilities. These include the following: <italic>1</italic>) different approaches to glucose lowering; <italic>2</italic>) varying glucose targets; <italic>3</italic>) inability to clearly achieve a substantial contrast in glucose concentrations between the study groups; <italic>4</italic>) heterogeneous study designs; <italic>5</italic>) underrecruitment; and <italic>6</italic>) the absence of a simple, easily implementable, reproducible approach to glucose control in the CCU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Despite this heterogeneity, a meta-analysis of clinical trials in which insulin therapy was used to target lower glucose levels suggested that there may be a mortality benefit of such an approach in the CCU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). These findings suggest that a simple, safe, and easily implemented approach to target normal glucose levels in the CCU may have clinically important benefits.</p><p>To address these challenges, we developed an insulin-based approach that targeted normal glucose levels of 5.0&#x02013;6.5 mmol/L (90&#x02013;117 mg/dL) while minimizing hypoglycemia. This approach comprised a simple intravenous glulisine insulin (rapid-acting insulin) algorithm (i.e., an algorithm that did not require any calculations or a computer to implement) while the patient was in the CCU, followed by once-daily subcutaneous glargine insulin (long-acting insulin) for up to 30 days after randomization. We then tested the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of this approach in the AMI setting in the RECREATE (REsearching Coronary REduction by Appropriately Targeting Euglycemia) pilot trial.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>The RECREATE pilot trial enrolled patients with an AMI, who presented to the hospital within 24 h of onset of ischemic symptoms; had either ST segment elevation (&#x02265;1 mm) in two or more contiguous leads or a new left bundle branch block on initial electrocardiogram; and had a blood glucose level of &#x02265;8.0 mmol/L (144 mg/dL) at presentation to the hospital. Patients with or without diabetes were eligible for randomization, provided that they were not taking or requiring insulin therapy at the time of hospital presentation. Exclusion criteria included the following: type 1 diabetes, history of severe hypoglycemia within the past 2 years, known or suspected end-stage liver disease, cardiogenic shock at presentation, documented pregnancy, life expectancy of &#x0003c;90 days, anticipated poor adherence or loss to follow-up, and prior enrollment in this trial or current enrollment in another trial of AMI.</p><sec id="s6"><title>Study protocol</title><p>All patients were managed according to the best judgment of their treating physician, including both medical therapy and interventions (primary percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] and/or thrombolytic therapy). In addition, consenting participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 fashion to either receive or not receive open-label intensive insulin therapy. Allocation was achieved using a central computerized system. The insulin arm comprised the immediate initiation of a rapid-acting insulin (glulisine/Apidra) infusion that was titrated to target glucose levels between 5.0 and 6.5 mmol/L (90 and 117 mg/dL) while in the CCU. Once transferred to the ward, insulin arm participants were started on once-daily insulin (glargine/Lantus) injections to target a fasting fingerstick glucose level between 4.0 and 5.5 mmol/L (72 and 99 mg/dL). In the standard therapy arm, treating physicians were free to add insulin therapy if they felt it was warranted to treat high glucose levels. All participants had plasma glucose levels measured at 10, 24, 48, and 72 h after admission, on the day of discharge from the hospital, and at 30 days.</p><p>At discharge from the hospital, participants in the insulin arm were continued on once-daily glargine until 30 days postrandomization and were instructed on the use of glucose meters, self-administration of insulin, and recognition and treatment of hypoglycemia. Participants monitored fingerstick glucose values fasting daily and when symptomatic with hypoglycemia. Participants were also given a diary to record daily fasting fingerstick values, hypoglycemia, and any symptoms of concern. Participants in both arms were counseled regarding healthy cardiovascular lifestyle modifications (dietary and physical activity) before hospital discharge. Participants were seen 30 days after randomization and were contacted at 90 days after randomization to ascertain vital status.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Insulin algorithm</title><p>Insulin arm participants were started on an intravenous infusion of glulisine insulin mixed in normal saline. The insulin infusion rate was adjusted using a paper-based insulin algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-0706/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>) that suggested insulin doses based on both the participants&#x02019; current glucose level and the change in glucose level in response to therapy. The insulin infusion was continued throughout the participant&#x02019;s stay in the CCU. This insulin algorithm required minimal calculations and fingerstick glucose measurements every 1&#x02013;4 h. It was derived from a more complex algorithm that required more frequent blood glucose monitoring and that was previously demonstrated to be safe and effective in the setting of an AMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>When transferred to the ward, participants were transitioned to long-acting subcutaneous insulin, as per a suggested glargine algorithm. The initial dose of glargine insulin was determined by calculating the total dose of intravenous glulisine insulin used within the preceding 24 h and reducing this total dose by 10% or more, as per the judgment of the treating physician. Further increments or decrements of 1&#x02013;2 units/day in the glargine dose were made until the participant&#x02019;s fasting blood glucose levels were at target (4.0 and 5.5 mmol/L [72 and 99 mg/dL]). The glargine dose was adjusted by the research team daily while in the hospital, at discharge, at 2 weeks after discharge, and more frequently at their discretion.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome for this pilot trial was the difference in mean venous plasma glucose levels between the two study groups at 24 h. Secondary outcomes included the following: the difference in mean venous plasma glucose between the study groups at hospital discharge or 7 days (whichever came first) and 30 days, clinical cardiovascular outcomes, mortality, and rehospitalization. Hypoglycemia, hypokalemia (potassium level &#x0003c;3.5 mmol/L or mEq/L), and any serious adverse events were documented. All outcomes were adjudicated blinded to the treatment allocation. Laboratory values were measured locally at the participating centers.</p><p>Data were collected using standardized case report forms by local investigators and were managed through the National Coordinating Offices for each country and the Global Coordinating Project Office (Population Health Research Institute [PHRI] at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada). An independent data safety monitoring board monitored clinical outcomes and safety end points throughout the trial. In addition, a glucose monitoring committee analyzed the glucose data at specific time intervals to ensure the safety and efficacy of the insulin algorithms. Each country obtained regulatory approval for study drugs. All sites received local ethics board approval, and all participants provided informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All analyses were performed using the intention-to-treat approach. Continuous variables were summarized using means and SDs and/or medians with interquartile range (IQR), and counts with percentages were used for binary variables. The effect of the insulin intervention on the primary outcome of change in mean glucose at 24 h was calculated using the difference at 24 h with 95% CIs. Similar calculations were performed at days 7 and 30. For the effect of the intervention on glucose levels over the course of the trial, repeated-measures ANOVA was performed using a one-way ANOVA, adjusting for baseline glucose levels. Clinical outcomes were tabulated; however, no statistical comparisons of clinical outcomes were planned, since the trial was not designed or powered to detect differences in clinical outcomes.</p><p>It was estimated that a sample size of 500 participants would detect a mean difference of 1.3 mmol/L (23.5 mg/dL) between the insulin and standard therapy arm glucose values at 24 h, assuming a standard deviation of 4.2 mmol/L (75 mg/dL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), 90% power, two-sided &#x003b1; level of 0.05, and 6% loss to follow-up.

Five percent of participants had a previous history of MI, only 1% had a previous history of congestive heart failure, and 54% had anterior ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The mean glucose at randomization was 10.14 mmol/L (SD 3.99) [182.5 mg/dL (SD 72)] in the insulin arm and 9.80 (SD 3.31) [176.4 mg/dL (SD 60)] in the standard therapy arm (<italic>P</italic> = 0.42).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline patient characteristics and AMI management</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="19tbl1"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Course in hospital</title><p>The median time from presentation to randomization was identical in both arms at 3.8 h (IQR 1.92&#x02013;9.6), and the median time from randomization to initiation of the insulin infusion was 4.25 h (IQR 2.0&#x02013;10.3) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Of those randomized to the insulin arm, 98% received the insulin infusion while in the CCU and 96.6% received both the insulin infusion in the CCU and the long-acting glargine insulin after transfer from the CCU. Glargine was continued at discharge and through 30 days in 85 and 74% of participants, respectively, in the insulin arm. Only two (1.4%) participants randomized to the insulin arm did not receive any insulin, since both died before insulin initiation. The mean dose of glulisine per kilogram used in the first 24 h was 0.78 (SD 0.48). The mean dose of glargine was 0.4 units/kg (SD 0.22) after discontinuation of the glulisine infusion and 0.35 units/kg (SD 0.22) at 30 days.</p><p>No patients in the standard therapy arm received an insulin infusion. While in hospital, 33.8% of standard therapy participants received subcutaneous insulin: 8 (5.76%) received only one insulin injection; 23 (16.55%) received more than one injection per day; and 16 (11.5%) had intermittent use. At discharge, 15 (10.8%) participants in the standard therapy arm were on insulin, 6 (4.3%) were on one injection daily, and 9 (6.5%) were on more than one injection per day.</p><p>Both groups received similar medical therapies for AMI, including antiplatelet agents, &#x003b2;-blockers, diuretics, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins. Rates of thrombolytic therapy (78 vs. 75%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.49) and primary PCI (13.7 vs. 14.9%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.77) were also similar between both arms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

All deaths were adjudicated as cardiovascular in nature.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s15"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The RECREATE trial demonstrated that a paper-based insulin algorithm can be easily implemented, is effective in lowering glucose levels, and appears to be safe in individuals with acute STEMI. After 24 h, the insulin algorithm achieved a mean glucose level of 6.53 mmol/L (SD 2.8) [117.5 mg/dL (SD 50)], whereas the standard therapy achieved a mean glucose level of 7.94 mmol/L (SD 3.23) [142.9 mg/dL (58)]. This reduction in glucose levels was associated with only one episode of severe hypoglycemia but more frequent biochemical asymptomatic hypoglycemia, defined as a plasma glucose &#x0003c;3.9 mmol/L (with or without symptoms). Similar rates of hypokalemia and cardiovascular outcomes were observed in both arms.</p><p>The intravenous insulin algorithm used in the RECREATE trial achieved lower glucose levels than other published clinical trials of insulin therapy in AMI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Possible explanations for the lower achieved glucose levels in the RECREATE trial include the following: tighter glycemic targets, the use of insulin mixed in normal saline instead of a glucose-based solution, and a lower percentage of participants with preexisting diabetes (27.5 vs. 48&#x02013;100%). Despite RECREATE&#x02019;s tighter glycemic targets, symptomatic hypoglycemia was infrequent and occurred in fewer participants in the RECREATE trial (2.0%) compared with other AMI studies (3.5&#x02013;3.8%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Conversely, the rate of biochemical hypoglycemia appeared to be similar to that observed in these other trials, after accounting for the fact that lower glucose cutoffs (i.e., below 3.0 or 3.5 mmol/L) were used to define biochemical hypoglycemia in these other studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Summary of studies of intravenous insulin therapy in AMI</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="19tbl2"/></table-wrap><p>The main strength of the RECREATE pilot trial is the use of a paper-based insulin algorithm that did not require frequent glucose measurements or a computer. The intravenous insulin algorithm was easily and successfully implemented across a number of international centers. Overall, there was a high rate of adherence to the study protocol and high rates of participant follow-up (94% at 24 h, 87% at 30 days, and 100% survival data at 90 days). The rates of symptomatic hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, and other adverse events were low and were similar in both arms. Finally, the fact that participants recruited from different parts of the world responded similarly to the intervention suggests that it is broadly applicable and implementable.</p><p>Although fewer patients were recruited than originally planned, a clear and significant difference between glucose levels of 1.41 mmol/L (25 mg/dL) was achieved (with 97.7% power), which has been associated with a 22% decrease in mortality in previously published epidemiologic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). However, this trial was clearly not designed to assess morbidity or mortality, and whether this glucose strategy improves clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with AMI remains a key unanswered question. This continuing uncertainty regarding optimal glucose levels during AMI underscores the need for a definitive clinical trial of targeted glucose control strategies, such as the one tested in our study.</p><p>In conclusion, the RECREATE pilot trial showed that an insulin-based approach comprising a paper-based insulin algorithm targeting normal glucose levels followed by subcutaneous insulin for 1 month can effectively lower glucose levels with minimal symptomatic hypoglycemia but more biochemical hypoglycemia in patients with an acute STEMI. It is therefore feasible to test the clinical risks and benefits of this approach in a large outcomes trial that could be globally conducted in a wide variety of settings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
