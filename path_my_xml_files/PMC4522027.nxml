The efficacy and safety profile of fingolimod has been well characterized in a large clinical development program. Here, we report the safety and tolerability of fingolimod in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients from Latin America.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 162 patients with RRMS, predominantly from Latin American countries (138/162), were enrolled in this 16-week, single treatment arm, open-label, multi-center study. Unlike the phase III pivotal studies, this study permitted enrollment of patients with controlled diabetes, certain cardiac and pulmonary conditions, older age, and higher baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale. All patients were monitored clinically for a minimum of 6&#x000a0;hours after the first dose. Safety and tolerability assessments were based on adverse events, clinically notable laboratory abnormalities, vital signs, ophthalmic examinations, and electrocardiograms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overall, the safety and tolerability profile was consistent with that reported previously in phase 3 studies and the FIRST study.

For example, the Latin American MS population has higher age at disease onset and slower rate of progression of disability over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

Data reported here include patients recruited at 26 centers across the Latin American countries (excluding Jordan and Malaysia). The study included 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;weeks of screening phase to determine eligibility. Standard 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) were performed at screening and pre-dose as part of the eligibility assessment. Eligible patients were males and females diagnosed with RRMS using the revised 2005 McDonald&#x02019;s criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Expanded eligibility criteria were applied to include patients with older age (age limit 18&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years) and high baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score range of 0&#x02013;6.5. Patients with controlled diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> [HbA<sub>1c</sub>] &#x02264;7%) and certain cardiac and pulmonary conditions, excluded from pivotal studies, were also included. Patients with a manifestation of MS other than RRMS, active infection, macular edema, uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c &#x0003e;7%), immunosuppression (either drug- or disease-induced), or had received treatment with corticosteroids or immunoglobulins within the previous month, or treatment with immunosuppressive medications or monoclonal antibodies within the previous 3&#x000a0;months were not eligible for enrollment in the study. Patients previously treated with fingolimod were not eligible to participate. Other exclusion criteria included any clinically significant cardiac, pulmonary, or hepatic disease, or any immunologic laboratory abnormalities.</p><p>All eligible patients were treated with fingolimod 0.5&#x000a0;mg for 16&#x000a0;weeks.

Each patient provided written informed consent before enrollment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Assessments</title><p>The primary variables of the study included the nature and frequency of adverse events (AEs). The safety assessments included reporting of AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), vital signs, physical/neurological examinations, ECG, and laboratory examinations, and were carried out at weeks 2, 8, and 16 (end of study visit), with an ophthalmic examination at week 16. The severity of AEs was defined according to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) for AEs (mild, moderate, and severe or CTC grade 1&#x02013;4).</p><p>All patients received the first dose of fingolimod and were monitored for at least 6&#x000a0;h post-dose. First-dose monitoring included an ECG at baseline and at 6&#x000a0;h as well as hourly sitting heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) monitoring. Patients were asked to inform the investigator about any cardiac symptoms or other AEs. The initial discharge criteria after 6&#x000a0;h of cardiac monitoring were: HR &#x02265;51&#x000a0;bpm, HR &#x0003e;80% of baseline value and was not the lowest hourly value, absence of symptoms associated with decreased HR, and ECG at 6&#x000a0;h showing no new significant ECG abnormalities. During the course of the study, following a regulatory authority review, revisions were made to fingolimod labeling and prescribing guidance; consequently, amendments were made to cardiac exclusion and first-dose discharge criteria in the study (extended monitoring required for HR&#x000a0;&#x0003c;45&#x000a0;bpm, symptomatic or received treatment for bradycardia, lowest hourly HR, new-onset second-degree or higher atrioventricular block (AVB), QTc &#x02265;500&#x000a0;ms at 6&#x000a0;h).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Primary variables were summarized using descriptive statistics.

Headache and fatigue were the most commonly reported AEs in this study. A total of 82 (59.4%) patients experienced an AE of which seven (5.1%) were classified as SAEs (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Of these seven patients, treatment was continued in six patients; one patient discontinued the treatment because of pregnancy and reported a spontaneous abortion in the follow-up period after discontinuation. All SAEs were considered unrelated to the study drug by the investigators. Infections (overall) were reported in 33 (23.9%) patients and were predominantly mild (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;28, 20.3%). Herpes zoster infection was reported in one (0.7%) patient; no case of disseminated herpes was reported. Incidences of elevated alanine aminotransferase of &#x02265;3, &#x02265;5 and &#x02265;10 upper limit of normal (ULN) were reported in five (3.7%), three (2.2%) and one (0.7%) patients, respectively.

Of the six cases of bradycardia reported during the study, only one event was reported on post first dose (day 142). This event occurred after the patient had discontinued the study and no further records on vital signs are available. All these events were predominantly mild in nature and none were serious or led to study drug discontinuation. Mean (&#x000b1;SD) changes from baseline in systolic and diastolic BP were 3.4 (&#x000b1;10.3) and 2.5 (&#x000b1;7.5) mmHg. All three cases of hypertension (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3; 2.2%) were managed with antihypertensive therapy and did not result in treatment discontinuation.

Of the six cases of bradycardia reported during the study, five events were reported during the first-dose observation period. However, none of the patients reported symptoms of bradycardia or required treatment for symptomatic bradycardia. The decrease and recovery in HR after first dose was consistent with the known pattern for fingolimod. No new onset of second degree or higher AVBs or prolongations in QTc interval were detected with ECG monitoring (protocol mandated requirements for extended monitoring; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). With continued treatment, the mean HR returned to baseline levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and by week 16, the decrease in mean (&#x000b1;SD) HR was &#x02212;1.08 (&#x000b1;8.66) bpm relative to the pre-dose baseline mean value. A small decrease in BP was observed which returned to baseline by 6&#x000a0;h: peak time/mean changes [mmHg (&#x000b1;SD): systolic (between 3 and 5&#x000a0;h) &#x02212;2.49 (&#x000b1;8.63) and diastolic (between 4 and 5&#x000a0;h) &#x02212;2.94 (&#x000b1;7.90)]. During the first-dose observation, mild hypotension was reported in one patient (mean sitting systolic/diastolic BP was lowest at 3&#x000a0;h post-dose: 82.0/64.0&#x000a0;mmHg), whose BP recovered to baseline by the end of first-dose observation period (mean sitting systolic/diastolic BP at 7&#x000a0;h post-dose: 100.0/70.0&#x000a0;mmHg) and continued treatment.

The overall safety profile was consistent with previous clinical trial experience, particularly the larger FIRST study (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2415) of comparable duration, with no new or unexpected safety signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Overall, fingolimod was well tolerated in the study population. Only three patients discontinued treatment due to AEs, of whom two discontinued due to persistently elevated bilirubin and GGT levels (&#x02265;2 ULN) and one discontinued due to an AE (erythema nodosum). AEs were generally reported as mild to moderate in nature, with the most common AEs being headache and fatigue. The overall nature and frequency of the AEs, including the specific safety areas of interest (namely infections, liver enzyme elevation, BP changes, and macular edema) were consistent with the previous experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The majority of infections were mild with upper respiratory tract infections being the most common. The incidence of herpes zoster infection was low; no disseminated cases were reported. The reported case of herpes zoster infection was considered mild in severity and suspected to be related to study drug. Patient continued on the fingolimod and received valaciclovir concomitantly. The infection was resolved within 5&#x000a0;weeks. Liver enzyme elevations and BP changes were clinically manageable and did not result in treatment discontinuation. No cases of macular edema were reported.</p><p>The first dose of fingolimod, in this current study, was well tolerated with transient, mostly asymptomatic decreases in HR, which were consistent with previous clinical trial experience and are attributed to the pharmacodynamic properties of fingolimod [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The majority of patients were discharged at 6&#x000a0;h, while a minority of patients underwent extended monitoring to ensure that protocol mandated HR recovery criteria were met. No abnormal ECG findings were reported and no patient discontinued treatment following the first-dose procedure. Although, in contrast to the larger FIRST study, bradycardia was reported in proportionally higher number of patients in this study (3.6% versus 0.6%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], all of these AEs resolved without medical treatment on the same day.</p><p>A few other post-marketing studies have reported the fingolimod safety experience in Latin American populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A post hoc analysis of Hispanic/Latino (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;89) patients from the fingolimod clinical trial program reported similar HR changes with no reports of symptomatic bradycardia. No patient discontinued the treatment following the first dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Similar to our current study, first-dose fingolimod experience from a single Chilean center (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;78) was reported to be well tolerated; there were no reports of symptomatic bradycardia and all patients were discharged at 6&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Similarly, the preliminary analysis of a multi-center, prospective study in Argentina (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;92) demonstrated a well-tolerated cardiac safety profile of fingolimod. Extended monitoring due to prolonged bradycardia was required in three patients; however, none of the patients developed symptomatic bradycardia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In a retrospective chart review of first-dose experience from several Brazilian clinics (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;180 RRMS patients), 99.4% of patients continued fingolimod treatment after the initial dose, and extended monitoring due to symptomatic bradycardia was required for 12 patients (6.7%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The results of the short-term FIRST LATAM study provide ethnically relevant Latin American patient data, which are consistent with the results from the overall fingolimod clinical trial program. Further longer term follow-up in such patient cohorts will provide more information to further aid clinical decision making in Latin America.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, the FIRST LATAM study demonstrates that the first dose of fingolimod 0.5&#x000a0;mg is well tolerated, the pharmacodynamic effects are consistent with previous findings, and fingolimod has a clinically manageable safety profile in Latin American RRMS patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec12"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12325_2015_224_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (PDF 266&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Sponsorship, article processing charges, and the open access charge for this study were funded by Novartis.</p><p>All named authors meet the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) criteria for authorship for this manuscript, take responsibility for the integrity of the work as a whole, from inception to publication and have given final approval for the version to be published.</p><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Rahul Birari (Novartis Healthcare Pvt.
