Low rates of asthma preventer medication adherence is a major contributor to poor asthma control in these patients. Web-based methods have potential to improve patient knowledge and medication adherence by providing interactive patient education, monitoring of symptoms and medication use, and by facilitation of communication and teamwork among patients and health care providers. Few studies have evaluated web-based asthma support environments using all of these potentially beneficial interventions. The multidimensional website created for this study, BostonBreathes, was designed to intervene on multiple levels, and was evaluated in a pilot trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>An interactive, engaging website for children with asthma was developed to promote adherence to asthma medications, provide a platform for teamwork between caregivers and patients, and to provide primary care providers with up-to-date symptom information and data on medication use. Fifty-eight (58) children primarily from inner city Boston with persistent-level asthma were randomised to either usual care or use of BostonBreathes. Subjects completed asthma education activities, and reported their symptoms and medication use. Primary care providers used a separate interface to monitor their patients&#x02019; website use, their reported symptoms and medication use, and were able to communicate online via a discussion board with their patients and with an asthma specialist.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After 6-months, reported wheezing improved significantly in both intervention and control groups, and there were significant improvements in the intervention group only in night-time awakening and parental loss of sleep, but there were no significant differences between intervention and control groups in these measures. Emergency room or acute visits to a physician for asthma did not significantly change in either group. Among the subgroup of subjects with low controller medication adherence at baseline, adherence improved significantly only in the intervention group. Knowledge of the purpose of controller medicine increased significantly in the intervention group, a statistically significant improvement over the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This pilot study suggests that a multidimensional web-based educational, monitoring, and communication platform may have positive influences on pediatric patients&#x02019; asthma-related knowledge and use of asthma preventer medications.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Pediatric asthma is a highly prevalent condition with significant risk for morbidity and mortality among children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] with particular impact on inner-city minority children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In patients with persistent asthma symptoms, use of a controller (preventer) medication such as an inhaled corticosteroid improves symptoms and lung function, while reducing exacerbations and hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Many children with asthma are frequently symptomatic, with clear indication that a higher step level of medication would be appropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, physician prescribing of, and patient adherence with, controller medications remains low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], particularly among inner-city children from lower income families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, poor children with asthma are less likely to have access to asthma specialists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Over the past two decades, strategies to improve adherence to controller medications have been tested using the Internet and other electronic modalities, with promising results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although newer technologies are being investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], there continues to be interest in web-based approaches to promoting asthma self-care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There is also evidence that cooperation, communication and coordination among health care providers can improve outcomes in chronic disease, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] yet care often remains fragmented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>A recent systematic review of digital interventions for asthma care concluded that digital interventions show promise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], although a recent meta-analysis also raised questions about the strength of evidence behind the effectiveness of telemedicine interventions for asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Key intervention components to improve asthma outcomes identified included provision of asthma information and self-care education, asthma action plans, self-monitoring, immediate feedback from devices, messages and alerts to patients, games and quizzes, and availability for daily use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, none of these studies included all listed potentially effective elements in their intervention design.</p><p>This paper describes the design, implementation, feasibility and potential effectiveness of a digital intervention for children with asthma, BostonBreathes (BB), which included multiple strategies for improving asthma outcomes. In addition, reflecting the benefits of teamwork in asthma and other chronic illnesses, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] BB leveraged the communication capabilities of the Internet to support clinical teamwork among health professionals involved in asthma care of the research subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design of website/pretesting/ theoretical basis</title><p>BostonBreathes (BB) is a web-based interactive asthma education, monitoring, and communication system designed to improve asthma care with 3 primary objectives:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>improve adherence to asthma controller medications among children with asthma through education, self-monitoring, and rewards;</p></list-item><list-item><p>enhance teamwork between health care professionals caring for children with asthma by providing a communication platform; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>enhance primary care physician awareness of their asthma patients&#x02019; status in between clinical encounters.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The approach to behavior change was based in part on principles of social cognitive theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and eHealth theoretical models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

In recognition of the relationship between parental beliefs about asthma medications and medication adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] parents were encouraged to participate with their child in the use of the website including educational activities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a prospective randomised pilot trial in which health care providers and a group of asthma patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group 1 would receive usual care of their asthma from their primary care provider, Group 2 would use the full BB asthma monitoring and management website, including discussion boards to facilitate electronic teamwork; and Group 3 would use the website without the discussion boards. After randomisation, but before the study began, the two intervention groups were merged into Group 2 to enhance sample size and statistical power.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Population and eligibility</title><p>The participating providers and patients were recruited from Boston community health centers, the Boston Medical Center, and other practices in the Boston area. Children with diagnoses of persistent asthma were identified by their primary care doctors, and were eligible if they were between the ages of 9 and 17. Caregivers were interviewed by phone and children were eligible if they could speak and read English, if they had a functioning Internet connection in the home, and if they had at least persistent-level severity of asthma or were on a controller-type medication.</p><p>Two baseline home visits (HV) were done on eligible patients. At HV1, baseline surveys were administered and a Doser- TM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] device was attached to the controller medication metered dose inhaler to measure adherence rates, or the dose-counter number was recorded on controller-delivery devices using counters (such as fluticasone diskus delivery systems). After 2&#x000a0;weeks, the second HV was completed to pick up the Doser or record diskus numerical data, complete baseline surveys, randomise the patient, and train intervention subjects in the use of the BB website. All subsequent patients of each physician were placed in the same study group. Providers cared for patients in either the intervention or control group exclusively.</p><p>Children and parents were trained in the home by a research assistant who reviewed BB login procedures, established passwords, supervised data entry of current medications and doses into the website, and populated an asthma action plan visible on the website. The child was asked to navigate through the functions of the website to demonstrate competence, and then to make a posting to discussion boards.</p><p>Patients randomised into the control group received an asthma education manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and peak flow meter, and otherwise received usual care from their physicians.</p><p>All patients in both groups received a PIKO (Ferraris Respiratory) digital peak flow meter with instructions on use, peak flow zones, and including a patient instructional guide. This device is an electronic hand held peak flow meter that displays peak expiratory flow rate. Patient peak flows were measured at HV1 and highest &#x0201c;personal best&#x0201d; value entered into the website which then automatically coded peak flow values subsequently entered by intervention group patients into red (&#x0003c;50% of best of FEV1, yellow (50-80% of FEV1), and green zones (&#x0003e;80% of FEV1) and displayed the zone on the website for immediate patient feedback. If values entered by patient consistently exceeded the initial value, it was adjusted upward to reflect the highest consistent peak flow number entered. Subjects were asked to use the PIKO in conjunction with website use. As a precaution, if a child entered a peak flow in their red zone, a pager carried by project staff at all times was activated automatically with an alert message. Upon enrollment, PCPs were requested to review and confirm the subject&#x02019;s peak flow and symptom-based action plans.</p><p>Physicians with patients in the intervention group were trained in the use of BB website by one of the authors. To maintain provider awareness of patient use of the system, whenever their patient logged into BB, providers received an email notification with a hotlink to their login page on BB.</p><p>Every two months, all data entered by patients using the BB website system was reviewed by the project&#x02019;s participating pediatric asthma specialist, and asthma nurse specialist. A summary of their conclusions and treatment recommendations, based on entered data, was posted to the private discussion board for review by the physician and patient and caregiver.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Educational content</title><p>Educational content of the streaming videos included explanations of asthma and why it develops, how to mitigate impact on activities, use of controller and rescue medications, triggers, smoking, pets, action plans, and peak flow meters.

Adherence to controller medications was measured with a DOSER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] which records number of actuations per day for 30&#x000a0;days and has been validated in comparison to self-report and canister weight testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Subjects received the DOSER at baseline and used it on their metered dose inhaler for 25&#x000a0;days. For those subjects using the Advair discus, the built in counting mechanism was recorded. For subjects using oral medications, pill counts were performed. Knowledge of purpose of medications was determined by asking a subgroup of subjects (all intervention and control subjects enrolled after a specific date), in an open-ended question format, to state the purpose of their controller medications. Results were recorded, blinded and post-coded as to accurate identification of the purpose of the medication. Patient and provider utilization of the websites was measured during the study period. An 8 item instrument was developed to measure confidence with a computer and the Internet. The instrument requested self-reported ability to perform basic functions in three domains key to BostonBreathes: computer operations, word processing, and Internet. The responses were scored using a 5-point Likert scale.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Technical specifications</title><p>The website was built in ASP.Net 1.1 with a Microsoft Sql Server Database.

Key elements of feasibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] were successfully tested including: acceptability, and implementation. Overall adherence to preventer medications was not improved in either study group. Among the subset of subjects with low baseline compliance, the intervention demonstrated a significant improvement in adherence. Knowledge of the purpose of their own preventer medication improved significantly only among the small group of intervention subjects queried on this variable.</p><p>Although BB use tapered over time, the intensity of interaction with the website was adequate to suggest a possible favorable impact on both knowledge and adherence. Asthma symptoms and asthma-related behavioral variables decreased in both intervention and control groups. Although not all decreases were statistically significant, the patterns of decreases were similar for both groups for wheezing, night-time awakening, and parental loss of sleep. Additional exposure to the website and/or a longer follow-up period to allow benefits of improved adherence with controller medications to be manifested might be necessary to demonstrate down-stream favorable impact on symptoms. In a recent systematic review, all studies demonstrated that reminder systems increase adult patient medication compliance, but none improved measured clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Other studies have shown that short term effectiveness of adult self-management guidance may not endure when assessed over long-term follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, a recent adult study using web-based guided self-management interventions similar to this study demonstrated enduring benefits on several asthma outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It is possible that adults are more likely than children to persist in their utilization of web-based self-management tools, and thus more likely to show benefits in asthma morbidity measures.</p><p>The importance of teamwork among health care professionals caring for patients with chronic diseases is well recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and this study contributes to our understanding of how pediatric patients and their providers will utilize electronic communication technology. The majority of messages from health care providers were posted by the online asthma nurse, whereas the primary health care providers of the research subjects utilized the discussion boards at a low level, highlighting the challenges associated with engaging busy health care providers in case-management-related activities, and highlighting the essential role of an active case-manager. However, all team members, including patients, study nurse, asthma specialist, and PCPs, did demonstrate active use of the website communication functions, and the teamwork relationships established electronically, and supported by ready availability of relevant asthma symptom and medication use data, effectively facilitated periodic case review and feedback to the PCP by the asthma specialist. Feedback from providers emphasized that in the future the site might be used most efficiently by patients who most stand to benefit, such as those with persistent level symptoms and/or frequent use of the health care system. The site might also be managed by office staff responsible for case management of chronically ill patients, to reduce time demands on busy clinicians.</p><p>Although recent studies have focused on newer technologies such as smart-phone based monitoring and reminder systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], other recent research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] continues to demonstrate the effectiveness, simplicity, and ease of use of web-based systems.</p><p>An important limitation of this study is its modest sample size resulting in limited statistical power. Several positive trends were identified but the number of subjects was not sufficient to definitively assess these areas. Other limitations include a consolidation of intervention groups which resulted in asymmetrically sized intervention and control groups, and erosion of utilization by intervention subjects. Control group subjects also demonstrated improvements in several domains, possibly due to an intervention effect from enrollment in the study and associated interactions with study staff and various measurements.</p><p>Delivering comprehensive asthma care to under-served populations is a challenging task in the setting of a brief, problem-focused primary care office visit. Implementation of accountable care organizations and medical home initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and developing more effective models of caring for patients with chronic illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] will require new methods, like BB, for maintaining supportive clinical relationships outside of episodic in-person encounters between patients and their caregivers. Rapid changes in reimbursement models for health care services will continue to create demands for more effective support solutions for patients with chronic illnesses such as asthma.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Findings from this study suggest that digital applications such as BostonBreathes have the potential to support multiple aspects of health care and health behavior change.
