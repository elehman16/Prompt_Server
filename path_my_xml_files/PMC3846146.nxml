protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) and bronchiectasis are characterised by a chronic wet cough and are important causes of childhood respiratory morbidity globally. <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> are the most commonly associated pathogens. As respiratory exacerbations impair quality of life and may be associated with disease progression, we will determine if the novel 10-valent pneumococcal-<italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) reduces exacerbations in these children.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A multi-centre, parallel group, double-blind, randomised controlled trial in tertiary paediatric centres from three Australian cities is planned. Two hundred six children aged 18 months to 14 years with recurrent PBB, CSLD or bronchiectasis will be randomised to receive either two doses of PHiD-CV or control meningococcal (ACYW<sub>135</sub>) conjugate vaccine 2 months apart and followed for 12 months after the second vaccine dose. Randomisation will be stratified by site, age (&#x0003c;6 years and &#x02265;6 years) and aetiology (recurrent PBB or CSLD/bronchiectasis). Clinical histories, respiratory status (including spirometry in children aged &#x02265;6 years), nasopharyngeal and saliva swabs, and serum will be collected at baseline and at 2, 3, 8 and 14 months post-enrolment. Local and systemic reactions will be recorded on daily diaries for 7 and 30 days, respectively, following each vaccine dose and serious adverse events monitored throughout the trial. Fortnightly, parental contact will help record respiratory exacerbations. The primary outcome is the incidence of respiratory exacerbations in the 12 months following the second vaccine dose. Secondary outcomes include: nasopharyngeal carriage of <italic>H. influenzae</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> vaccine and vaccine- related serotypes; systemic and mucosal immune responses to <italic>H. influenzae</italic> proteins and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> vaccine and vaccine-related serotypes; impact upon lung function in children aged &#x02265;6 years; and vaccine safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>As <italic>H. influenzae</italic> is the most common bacterial pathogen associated with these chronic respiratory diseases in children, a novel pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that also impacts upon <italic>H. influenzae</italic> and helps prevent respiratory exacerbations would assist clinical management with potential short- and long-term health benefits.

Chronic cough (&#x0003e;4 weeks duration) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] in children is associated with increased morbidity and often an unrecognised social and economic burden upon the family and hidden costs for the health care system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. There are many causes of chronic cough, but amongst children with a persistent wet cough indicating the presence of excessive airway mucus, there is a subset that has a spectrum of chronic pulmonary diseases. These particular children, if left untreated may develop irreversible airway injury, an event that was well recognised in the pre-antibiotic era [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These disorders, protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) and bronchiectasis, have in common impaired mucociliary clearance, bacterial infection and lower airway inflammation, features consistent with the &#x02018;vicious circle hypothesis&#x02019; for the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. PBB is the most common of these entities, occurring predominantly in preschool children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It is characterised by an isolated chronic wet cough without an alternative cause, such as cystic fibrosis (CF) or immunodeficiency being present, which resolves promptly with a two to four-week course of antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] In contrast, bronchiectasis is defined as abnormal, irreversible bronchial dilatation and is usually diagnosed by chest high-resolution computed tomography (cHRCT) scans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Children with bronchiectasis have a chronic wet cough that responds slowly or incompletely to antibiotic therapy. They also have recurrent lower respiratory infections and can develop additional respiratory symptoms and signs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Bronchiectasis is either idiopathic or results from underlying systemic or local pulmonary diseases predisposing to chronic endobronchial infection. Between these two extremes are children with CLSD who have the clinical features of bronchiectasis, but lack the supporting cHRCT evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Recurrent (at least four) episodes of PBB may occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and if these no longer respond promptly to antibiotics, underlying CSLD or bronchiectasis should be considered.</p><p>There is a direct relationship between lower airway bacterial load and systemic and lower airway inflammation, risk of acute respiratory exacerbations and quality of life measures in adults with bronchiectasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> (usually unencapsulated or non-typeable (NTHi) strains) is consistently the predominant pathogen found in the sputum of adults with bronchiectasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It is also the most common bacterial pathogen isolated from the lower airways of children with PBB, CSLD or bronchiectasis, followed less often by <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus)</italic> and <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, acquiring new <italic>H. influenzae</italic> strains can lead to exacerbations in adults with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Acute exacerbations are also important in bronchiectasis as they are associated with lower quality of life (QoL) scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and poorer long-term outcomes. In adults with bronchiectasis, the frequency of exacerbations, increased systemic inflammatory markers and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> infection are each determinants of an accelerated pulmonary decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Amongst other factors, an increased mortality risk is associated with the degree of lung function impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In children with bronchiectasis, no prospective study exists, but the only significant predictor of pulmonary decline found in one retrospective study was the frequency of hospitalised exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>While pneumococcal polysaccharide and protein conjugate vaccines seem to have had little impact on the incidence of these chronic pulmonary diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], interventions targeting <italic>H. influenzae</italic> may be more successful in reducing exacerbations and leading to improved clinical outcomes. Indeed, adult studies provide &#x0201c;proof of concept&#x0201d; that a <italic>H. influenzae</italic> vaccine may be beneficial. A systematic review of six randomised controlled trials (RCT; 440 patients) reported oral monobacterial whole-cell, killed <italic>H. influenzae</italic> vaccine reduced the incidence of &#x0201c;bronchitis&#x0201d; episodes at three months (rate ratio 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41, 1.14) and six months after vaccination (rate ratio 0.82; 95% CI 0.62, 1.09) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Current oral <italic>H. influenzae</italic> vaccines are not licensed and to date have not been tested in children. Although very different to a whole cell oral vaccine whole cell, oral vaccine, the only vaccine available for children at present that may impact upon <italic>H. influenzae</italic> infection is the parenteral 10-valent pneumococcal-<italic>H. influenzae</italic> protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV; Synflorix&#x000ae;, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium). The protein D (PD) component is an outer membrane lipoprotein, which is antigenically conserved, surface located and present in most <italic>H. influenzae</italic> (encapsulated and NTHi) strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It is one of three <italic>H. influenzae</italic> proteins (PD, P6 and OMP26) that have been the focus of potential vaccine antigens for both adults and children in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], with PD and P6 showing the most promise. Vaccine-induced anti-PD antibodies have been associated with protective efficacy against <italic>H. influenzae</italic> infection in middle ear and pulmonary clearance in rat disease models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. A RCT of an 11-valent prototype for PHiD-CV (Pneumococcal Otitis Efficacy Trial (POET)) where children had tympanocentesis during their first episode of acute otitis media (AOM) found that the vaccine reduced the overall incidence of AOM by 34%, including a 35% reduction in <italic>H. influenzae</italic>-related cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>However, since our trial commenced, data have been published from a trial of PHiD-CV in 780 Dutch children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and GlaxoSmithKline has made aggregate data from a large trial of the vaccine in Latin American infants (COMPAS) publicly available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In the Dutch study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], infants received the vaccine at 2, 3, 4 and 11 to 13 months of age. Although the study found a lack of vaccine efficacy (VE) against <italic>H. influenzae</italic> (principally NTHi) nasopharyngeal colonisation (VE: 0.5%, 95% CI, -21.8%, 18.4%) and acquisition (VE: 10.9%, 95% CI, -31.3%, 38.9%) no disease endpoints were reported. In COMPAS, vaccine was administered at 2, 4, 6 and 12 to 15 months of age and, despite inducing high serum anti-PD antibody levels, no reduction in <italic>H. influenzae</italic> nasopharyngeal carriage was observed at each three-monthly time point following the third dose of vaccine up until the study ceased when children reached two years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. There was a marginal effect on any clinically confirmed AOM (VE 16.1%, 95% CI &#x02212;1.1, 30.4), but none observed for <italic>H. influenzae</italic> confirmed AOM (VE 15%, 95% CI &#x02212;83.8, 60.7).</p><p>The data from COMPAS are difficult to interpret given a surprisingly low prevalence of <italic>H. influenzae</italic> nasopharyngeal carriage in all children at each time point (approximately 5%), and that carriage data were only obtained in a subset of children from a single participating centre (n = 2,000). Furthermore, of all clinically confirmed AOM episodes (n = 243), <italic>H. influenzae</italic> was only detected in 26 (10.7%), of which all were confirmed as NTHi. Hence, there is a clear lack of study power to address the clinical efficacy of the vaccine. The implications of these findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and those of the Dutch study for older children, particularly those with chronic respiratory disease, need to be established and more studies are required in different populations with differing <italic>H. influenzae</italic> epidemiology to confirm vaccine efficacy.</p><p>Thus, our trial aims to determine whether respiratory exacerbations in children with recurrent PBB, CSLD and bronchiectasis can be reduced by PHiD-CV vaccination.</p><sec><title>Objectives of the study</title><p>Our primary objective is to determine the clinical efficacy of PHiD-CV in reducing respiratory exacerbations in children aged 18 months to 14 years with recurrent PBB, CSLD or bronchiectasis.</p><p>Our secondary objectives are:</p><p>1.

Randomisation was stratified by site, age (less than six years and six or more years), and PBB vs CSLD/bronchiectasis. The age of six years was chosen as at this age spirometry can be performed reliably in children. Treatment allocation is determined by the trial pharmacist at the Royal Children&#x02019;s Hospital, Brisbane based on the randomisation list provided by the independent statistician. At the time of randomisation, the child&#x02019;s study specific stratum is confirmed and a request for randomisation based on that stratum is provided to the pharmacist. The trial pharmacist selects the next consecutively numbered opaque sealed envelope from the relevant strata pack, opens the envelope and extracts the randomisation code. This is checked against the randomisation list and a vaccine pack matching the allocation code is assigned to the participant. The allocation sequence is concealed at all times throughout the study from all blinded investigators, study staff and participants.</p><p>Since the vaccines differ in colour, their preparation and delivery will be performed by nurses at each participating centre who are independent of the study. Unblinding of individual participants will only occur in emergency situations and ideally after discussion with the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The randomisation code will be unblinded once the database is locked and the data analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Specimen collection</title><p>All children will have nasopharyngeal swabs, saliva and serum collected at enrolment and at 2 months post-vaccine dose 1, and then at 1, 6 and 12 months following the second study vaccine dose (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Repeated respiratory exacerbations in those with bronchiectasis are associated with significant long-term morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. There is also historical precedent in the pre-antibiotic era that children with recurrent or persistent wet cough progressed from having normal radiographic appearance to those consistent with bronchiectasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As <italic>H. influenzae</italic> is the most common bacterial pathogen associated with these diseases in adults and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], a vaccine that could reduce or eliminate <italic>H. influenzae</italic> may avert exacerbations and reduce antibiotic use. This would be an important adjunct to current clinical management and may lead to short- and long-term health benefits. Our study, therefore, has clinical efficacy as the primary outcome and will be the first to assess the clinical impact of vaccines targeting <italic>H. influenzae</italic> in children with these diseases.</p><p>The systemic and mucosal immune responses, particularly antibody functionality, to PHiD-CV in children with recurrent PBB, CSLD and bronchiectasis have not been examined previously. Our study will examine responses to not only PD, but related <italic>H. influenzae</italic> proteins (P4 and P6) that have been considered as vaccine candidates as well as assessing responses to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> vaccine and vaccine-related serotype specific antigens<italic>.</italic> A prospective study of serum antibody response to three different <italic>H. influenzae</italic> outer membrane proteins (including PD) during episodes of AOM in otitis-prone and non-otitis-prone children highlights the importance of measuring immune responses in addition to clinical endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. It reported diminished IgG responses to these antigens in otitis-prone children compared to non-otitis-prone children at the time of, and following, an AOM episode. Increased susceptibility in otitis-prone children might be related to suboptimal circulating functional T-helper memory and reduced IgG responses to <italic>H. influenzae</italic> or <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> after colonisation and AOM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. These data support ongoing evaluation of responses in children at high-risk of <italic>H. influenzae</italic> infection.</p><p>Immunological responses to pneumococcal vaccine antigens are important to evaluate because of recent data suggesting diminished immunogenicity in children who have had either multiple exposures to vaccine antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], or increased density of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> nasopharyngeal carriage at the time of vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The clinical significance of these observations, however, remains uncertain. A recent study has examined <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> isolates from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures of children with chronic cough thought to be due to PPB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The results suggested significant differences in serotype distribution between 7vPCV vaccinated and unvaccinated children, with immunised children less likely to have vaccine serotypes isolated from BAL cultures, but also more likely to have non-vaccine serotypes than unimmunised children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. These findings are consistent with our own observations where pneumococcal conjugate vaccines appear to have had little impact on the burden of lower respiratory tract disease in high-risk Indigenous Australian populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], in whom <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> isolates from nasopharyngeal and BAL cultures are principally non-vaccine serotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Whether these differences resulted from host responses or population-based changes in circulating serotypes is unknown; however, the study suggests that ongoing surveillance of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> in this patient population is required.</p><p>It cannot be assumed that existing VE data against <italic>H. influenzae</italic> nasopharyngeal carriage and clinical disease (primarily AOM) in healthy young infants for PHiD-CV, and its 11-valent prototype in POET, can be generalised to preventing acute respiratory exacerbations in the lower airways of older children with PBB, CSLD or bronchiectasis. While the bacterial pathogens invading the middle ear cavities and the lower respiratory tracts of these patients are similar, the bacterial clearance mechanisms and immunity induced following a parenterally administered vaccine may differ between the two anatomical sites. In addition, a recent small study identified significantly reduced natural antibody levels to PD in adult patients with COPD (without exacerbation at time of specimen collection) and secondary immunodeficiency disorders compared to healthy controls, and that natural antibody levels declined with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Suboptimal circulating functional T-helper memory and reduced IgG responses to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> or <italic>H. influenzae</italic> have also been identified in otitis-prone children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. These data potentially indicate deficient host responses to <italic>H. influenzae</italic> infection in people with disease and that boosting antibody responses with vaccines may be required. Similar data do not exist for children with chronic lung diseases and, therefore, we have commenced an add-on study to the current protocol to examine this issue.</p><p>With respect to differences between nasopharyngeal carriage and disease, the POET study demonstrated a reduction in AOM caused by <italic>H. influenzae</italic>, but not nasopharygeal carriage by this organism in healthy children up to two years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, that study is not comparable to ours given the different population and primary endpoints and, in addition, the vaccine used possessed a higher content of PD than the currently licensed 10-valent PHiD-CV. Furthermore, there remains the possibility of different strains and virulence factors operating between colonisation and disease states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Data comparing these factors between nasopharyngeal and lower airway <italic>H. influenzae</italic> isolates in children with non-CF bronchiectasis or other chronic lung diseases are virtually non-existent. A small study conducted in Australian Indigenous children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], a population with extensive <italic>H. influenzae</italic> acquisition very early in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] and excessive rates of recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], found a high density and diversity of respiratory bacteria. It also found nasopharyngeal and BAL strain concordance between the upper and lower airways in 45 children with HRCT confirmed bronchiectasis. However, this study was not conducted at the time of an acute exacerbation and 27 (60%) had received antibiotics within two weeks of specimen collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Currently, data on PHiD-CV VE against <italic>H. influenzae</italic> carriage and disease in older children are limited to the results from a single study involving healthy four-year-olds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. This was a follow-up study of an earlier trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] of the PHiD-CV in Czech children conducted when they were 31 to 44 months of age. Persistence of NTHi nasopharyngeal carriage was a secondary objective. Thirty percent of the original cohort (n = 686) did not participate in the follow-up study. Children primed previously with PHiD-CV received a fifth dose at 40 to 48 months of age, the unprimed group received two doses of PHiD-CV two months apart. Post-booster nasopharyngeal carriage data at 24 to 27 months of age from the first study suggested a VE against NTHi carriage of 51.2% (95% CI 11.7, 73.9). However, carriage increased in vaccinees (from 8.5% to 33.5%) and controls (17.3% to 38.9%) at each time point thereafter and, at ages of 31 to 44 months and 40 to 48 months, there was no difference between the two groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Carriage data beyond those time points have not yet been published.</p><p>In addition, the long-term impact of the vaccine on carriage of other microbes is similarly limited. In the same extension study of Czech children, there was no difference between groups in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic> carriage over the same time period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. This provides an early, albeit insufficient, indication that the PHiD-CV has not altered the dynamics of carriage of these two organisms in healthy young children over time. Whether the same findings occur in children with chronic lung diseases is currently unknown, although we have the capacity to examine these effects in additional laboratory studies outside of the current protocol. Nonetheless, replacement of vaccine type pneumococci by non-vaccine type serotypes has been observed commonly in experimental and non-experimental studies of other pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and in some studies increased carriage of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>H. influenzae</italic> has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>].</p><p>The two study vaccines have well established safety profiles in young children. However, as they are being administered outside of licensed indications in Australia, and to a population of children with existing morbidities, we will undertake a complete safety evaluation during the trial. Our safety endpoints are consistent with those used in trials of both vaccines and SAE monitoring is consistent with Good Clinical Practice criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>].</p><p>In summary, our RCT will be the first to examine the impact of a vaccine targeting <italic>H. influenzae</italic> in children with recurrent PBB, CSLD and bronchiectasis. The best evidence to answer questions about strain concordance, acquisition of new strains and subsequent infection in the lower airways, and changes in the microbiological profile of acute exacerbations in children with chronic lung diseases following vaccination with PHiD-CV, are best obtained if BALs are performed at baseline, at each study time point and during acute exacerbations. This is ethically unacceptable and, hence, our choice of a clinical endpoint as the primary objective follows the concept of vaccine probe studies as markers of disease burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], as demonstrated previously in pneumococcal conjugate and Hib vaccine trials. Clinical efficacy will be evaluated in the context of detailed nasopharyngeal carriage, immunogenicity, lung function and safety data to provide a detailed assessment of whether vaccines may reduce exacerbations and provide an opportunity to improve long-term health outcomes. The study will also be an important contribution to the literature on the effects of conjugate vaccines on the nasopharyngeal microbiology of children with recurrent PBB, CSLD and bronchiectasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment began in January 2013.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>7vPCV: 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; AOM: Acute otitis media; BAL: Bronchoalveolar lavage; CF: Cystic fibrosis; cHRCT: Chest high-resolution computed tomography; CI: Confidence intervals; COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CSLD: Chronic suppurative lung disease; DSMC: Data Safety Monitoring Committee; NTHi: Non-typeable <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>; PBB: Protracted bacterial bronchitis; PBS: Phosphated buffered saline; PCR: Polymerase chain reaction; PD: Protein D; PHiD-CV: Pneumococcal-<italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> protein D conjugate vaccine; POET study: Pneumococcal Otitis Efficacy Trial; QoL: Quality of life; RCT: Randomised controlled trial; RR: Relative risk; SAE: Serious adverse event; VE: Vaccine efficacy; WHO: World Health Organization.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>ABC has received Institutional funding from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for investigator-led clinical studies in NTHi infections.
