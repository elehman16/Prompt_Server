Approximately 1 in 3 people aged over 65 living in the community fall each year, a rate which increases with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Falls, fall-related injuries and subsequent fear of falling can have a significant impact on health-related quality of life and function, resulting in loss of independence among older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The medical costs of fall-related injuries increase rapidly with age and are 2 to 3 times higher for women due to their higher risk of osteoporotic fractures, particularly hip fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Developing and implementing cost-effective programs to prevent falls among older people is of utmost importance given the ageing population and associated potential for increased costs of fall-related injury over the next decades.</p><p>Exercise is currently the only proven falls intervention appropriate for population level delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and is the falls intervention subject to most economic evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Many previously reported economic evaluations of exercise programs to prevent falls are founded on the home-based &#x0201c;Otago Exercise Program&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Whilst this program demonstrated a reduction in falls rate of between 30% and 46% compared to routine care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] it failed to achieve cost-effectiveness or monetary savings apart from in a sub-analysis of people aged over 80&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Economic evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] based on a systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] have explored the impact of falls on health-related quality of life. One evaluation included group-based exercise and demonstrated cost-effectiveness for high risk populations only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>There are limited published economic evaluations of group-based exercise for falls prevention, a more suitable format for population level delivery. The purpose of this study was to determine cost-effectiveness of one group-based exercise program that has been proven effective in reducing falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study overview</title><p>The objective of this evaluation was to determine whether a group-based exercise program is cost-effective compared to routine care to prevent falls among the older community-dwelling population. A decision analysis was performed using a decision tree model. The evaluation was conducted from a healthcare system perspective as significant drivers of cost are within the healthcare sector. As health-related quality of life is an important outcome of falls prevention, a cost-utility analysis (CUA) was undertaken as the primary analysis. This analysis also allows broader comparisons to other healthcare programs. Secondary cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) include the incremental cost per fall, injurious fall, and fracture averted. Measures of falls, fall-related injuries and resource use for the economic evaluation were obtained directly from trial data over an 18&#x000a0;month time horizon corresponding to the duration of follow-up. This was supplemented by literature-based utility measures.</p><p>All costs were identified from the perspective of the healthcare system and converted from 2010 Australian Dollars to British Pound Sterling (GBP) using 2010 purchasing power parities. All costs and consequences were discounted at a rate of 3% in the base case analysis, as recommended by the Panel on Cost-effectiveness in Health and Medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention</title><p>This evaluation was based on the results of a previously published randomised controlled trial of the &#x0201c;NoFalls&#x0201d; exercise program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The exercise program consisted of a weekly one hour group-based exercise class for 15&#x000a0;weeks, supplemented by daily home exercises. The class consisted of graded exercises to improve flexibility, leg strength and balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The comparator is routine care and activity, considered standard care.</p><p>Approval for the &#x0201c;NoFalls&#x0201d; trial was obtained from the Monash University's Standing Committee on Ethics in Research Involving Humans. The &#x0201c;NoFalls&#x0201d; trial took place in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia with a community-dwelling population aged over 70&#x000a0;years, recruited from the electoral roll. One thousand one hundred and seven participants were randomised, with 17 withdrawing immediately post-randomisation. Five hundred and forty-one participants were randomly assigned to receive the exercise intervention and 549 to receive no exercise intervention. The original &#x0201c;NoFalls&#x0201d; trial also investigated the effect of home hazard management and vision improvement on falls prevention in a full factorial design. However these interventions on their own failed to show a significant effect so have been excluded from this evaluation. During the 18&#x000a0;month follow-up period 9.5% of participants withdrew and 1.4% deceased, however data was provided for at least 1&#x000a0;month by 98.5% of randomised participants. The study participants at baseline had a mean age of 76.1&#x000a0;years and were 59.8% women. Baseline demographics between groups were similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Participants in the exercise group fell at a rate 21% lower than those in the routine activity group (IRR:0.79, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Analytical framework</title><p>A decision tree model was used in the decision analysis to establish potential pathways of participants (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A negative binomial regression model was used to calculate the rate of falls in each group and to determine the rate of injury if a fall occurred, using PASW Statistics 18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Negative binomial regression is recommended for analysis of falls count data as falls are recurrent and data over-dispersed (i.e. variance is greater than the mean) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The model involved entering the surveillance period as the offset variable, number of falls as the dependent variable, and the intervention as the categorical variable. Additionally the number sustaining an injury if a fall occurred was substituted as the dependent variable. Interactions with age and gender were also explored. The rates obtained from the analysis were converted to probabilities over 18&#x000a0;months for use in the economic evaluation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

The decision analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2007 with Risk Solver Platform V10.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A sub-group analysis of women only was performed in keeping with suggestions that women have a higher risk of falls and related injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Results are reported in the form of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), calculated by dividing differences in costs by differences in effects of intervention and comparator.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Secondary CEA</title><p>Falls were recorded prospectively for up to 18&#x000a0;months via monthly post-card calendar to optimise accuracy and injuries self-reported via telephone interview. Good agreement has been demonstrated between self-report and medical records, and if anything self-reporting tends to result in under-reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A fall was defined as &#x0201c;losing your balance such that your hands, arms, knees, bottom or body touch or hit the ground or floor&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Injuries were classified as a fracture, cut/scrape/bruise, head injury or other injury. Falls data was obtained for 92% of possible surveillance points over 18&#x000a0;months.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Health-related quality of life (HRQoL)</title><p>Health-related quality of life is measured on a scale of 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health) using a utility instrument which measures individual strength of preference between alternative health states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The EuroQol (EQ-5D) is a valid and reliable instrument widely used to obtain utility weights for fall-related conditions in older populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Utility weights are combined with time spent in different health states to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. An utility instrument such as the EQ-5D was not used during the &#x0201c;NoFalls&#x0201d; trial.

Utility was applied evenly to a fracture regardless of management. Although inpatient care may result in higher utility loss this could not be differentiated from the literature. Whilst research continues into the social value of a QALY and how it varies with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], a baseline utility of 1 was allocated to a non-faller indicating normal age-specific health. In reality the baseline utility of the elderly is below this value and it has been suggested that using a baseline utility value of 1 provides an overestimate and age/sex norms that exist for instruments such as the EQ-5D should be used instead [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This then raises a concern that the value of health benefit such as the QALY depends on when it arises and who receives it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], making people with higher baseline utility apparently more deserving of a QALY than others. Applying a value of 1 as the baseline utility is more equitable when it comes to making comparisons of programs and their incremental QALY gain.</p><p>The QALY calculation assumes that falls reduction applies to the 18&#x000a0;month follow-up after which participants return to their pre-treatment falls risk. There is no evidence supporting longer term effects once an exercise program has ceased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Evidence also suggests that following a fracture there is a return to the previous level of utility within 1 to 2&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>The probability of developing fear of falling (FOF) was obtained from studies with similar populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Persistence of FOF is recognised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] therefore disutility associated with FOF was applied for the 18&#x000a0;month period for those who fell. FOF was applied equally to both groups, although there is evidence to suggest that exercise interventions can reduce FOF in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A higher rate of FOF has been associated with more injurious falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], but as no clear incidence is available the probability of FOF was applied evenly. Probability of developing FOF was increased in the women only sub-analysis in accordance with the evidence available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The probability of developing FOF and utilities applied are conservative, most likely underestimating the true impact of the exercise program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Costs</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Program implementation</title><p>Program costs included labour, equipment, venue hire, music and consumables (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).

It was estimated that on average 3 visits would be required following a fracture and 2 visits following other injuries in the base case analysis. Standardised prices or charges were applied to resources used. Whilst using charges instead of actual costs may not reflect the true opportunity cost of resources, applying standardised charges is more relevant for the healthcare system perspective and improves generalisability.

In further sensitivity analyses key inputs for program implementation were varied including the use of a fitness instructor, no opportunity cost of the venue or equipment and inclusion of local newspaper advertising.

In the most-likely scenario it was assumed that, in the absence of any intervention, participants with missing data would continue to fall at the baseline falls rate. In a worst-case scenario, it was assumed no change for exercise group participants with missing data, and no falls experienced by routine care group with missing data, and the reverse in a best-case scenario.

The rate of falls per year in the exercise group was 0.309 compared to 0.390 in the routine activity group (IRR:0.79, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

The most common injury sustained was a cut, scrape or bruise (73.2% of all injury), 91% of which did not require medical care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Costs</title><p>In the base case analysis with an AHA instructor the class cost &#x000a3;52.37 per participant, assuming 15 participants per instructor.

In the base case scenario employing a fitness instructor the falls rate reduction required is 28% to 37%.

Apart from some of the best-case analyses, the overall ICER generally remains well above the cost-effectiveness threshold. Under most conditions the ICER remains within or below the cost-effectiveness threshold for women only analyses. As the injury data was pooled and applied equally to both groups missing data may weaken the results if fall-related injuries have been underestimated but would not cause bias.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Based on this evaluation there is little evidence to suggest that a group-based exercise program is more cost-effective than routine care to prevent falls among the older community-dwelling population. However there is evidence to support the program if offered to women only. This is driven by the higher probability of women sustaining a fracture in a fall resulting in higher costs and disutility, as well as the higher probability of women developing fear of falling and its associated disutility following a fall.</p><p>Direct comparison of this economic evaluation to other studies is difficult due to methodological differences in perspective, time frame and cost inclusions, as well as varied contexts within overseas health systems. Nevertheless a systematic review of economic evaluations of falls prevention interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] identified three cost saving interventions in subgroups of high falls risk participants. These were a targeted multi-factorial intervention in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], the home-based Otago exercise program for people aged over 80&#x000a0;years in New Zealand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and a home safety program targeting those who had previously fallen and were discharged from hospital in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Another UK based study investigating the cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery for falls prevention in women reported an incremental cost per QALY well below the cost-effectiveness threshold when modelled over a lifetime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p>An Australian based economic evaluation by Church et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] utilising the effectiveness data from a systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] identified that group-based exercise was only cost-effective in a high risk population. The overall falls rate reduction of 22% (IRR: 0.78, 95% CI 0.71-0.87) utilised for group-based exercise is consistent with the falls rate reduction of 21% found in the &#x0201c;NoFalls&#x0201d; trial (IRR:0.79, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Despite methodological differences the results of this evaluation support the findings of Church et al. in that group-based exercise programs in the general population would not be considered cost-effective. However, group-based exercise in the study by Church et al. and in variations of program implementation in this evaluation are approaching cost-effectiveness. Both evaluations indicate that in order to be cost-effective group-based exercise programs need to target sections of the older community-dwelling population.</p><p>Although the percentage of falls resulting in injury from this trial was consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] the proportion of fractures following a fall was lower than others reporting between 6% and 13% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This may be due to differences in study populations, missing data or variations in definitions and methods used to record injurious falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], and could result in an underestimation of the cost of falls and therefore cost-effectiveness. The &#x0201c;NoFalls&#x0201d; trial was also powered to detect a difference in the rate of falls and had insufficient power to detect differences in less frequent injuries such as fractures. However it seems a reasonable assumption that a 15&#x000a0;week exercise program would not alter the fracture rate if a fall occurred. The large variation in the value of the ICER observed in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis was contributed to by the small numbers of more serious injuries such as fractures and infrequency of inpatient care.</p><p>There are some limitations which should be considered. There were differences between the study population and the general community-dwelling older population which may limit the generalisability of the results to people who are Australian born, aged 70&#x02013;84 and of good to excellent health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The lack of culturally diverse study populations is not unusual in falls prevention literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This economic evaluation was not planned for the &#x0201c;NoFalls&#x0201d; trial so data collection was not optimal. Sourcing utility values from the literature may have introduced some inaccuracy as these were derived from other study populations, although matched as best possible. Literature based utility estimates for fall-related injuries are also limited. Mortality, lifetime costs of falls such as nursing home placement or other longer term injury complications, and societal costs to families and friends providing support following falls have not been included. Conservative assumptions regarding utilities, time horizons and costs applied to this model potentially result in underestimation of true cost-effectiveness.</p><p>The cost-utility analysis is a strength of this evaluation as it allows broader comparison to other healthcare programs thereby facilitating decision making. In addition, fear of falling was incorporated as an important consequence of falling known to have a significant impact on the health-related quality of life of the older population. This study makes a contribution to the limited literature on trial based economic evaluations of group-based exercise programs for falls prevention. Whilst the limitations of the data available from the &#x0201c;NoFalls&#x0201d; trial have been acknowledged, this study has less potential for inaccuracies than those fully reliant on assumptions based on published literature and expert opinion.</p><p>Further research is required with larger sample sizes to enable more accurate observation of less frequent endpoints, over longer time frames to capture the full impact of fall-related injuries and fear of falling on utility. Measuring and reporting injurious falls using standardised methodology will also further enhance the accuracy and comparability of future research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Standardising methodology and improving the accuracy of results will better inform budgetary decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Falls and fall-related injury significantly impact on the health-related quality of life of older people and pose a considerable burden on the healthcare system. Although group-based exercise programs have proven effectiveness in reducing the falls rate in the older community-dwelling population, this economic evaluation provides little evidence to support its cost-effectiveness in a group of mixed gender. However the evidence does suggest that a group-based exercise program is cost-effective in an older female community-dwelling population. Group-based exercise programs aimed at falls prevention in the older community-dwelling population are more likely to provide value for money when targeted at women only due to their higher likelihood of fall-related injury and fear of falling. Group-based exercise programs are potentially a valuable component of broader inter-sectoral strategies for falls prevention and improved health in the community and warrant consideration as part of an Active Ageing policy.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec21"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12877_2015_28_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Costs of program implementation, &#x0201c;NoFalls&#x0201d; Exercise Program.</p></caption></media><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12877_2015_28_MOESM2_ESM.docx" id="MOESM2"><label>Additional file 2: Table S2.</label><caption><p>Costs of falls.</p></caption></media><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12877_2015_28_MOESM3_ESM.docx" id="MOESM3"><label>Additional file 3: Table S3.</label><caption><p>Uncertain Variable Summary Information for probabilistic sensitivity analysis, &#x0201c;NoFalls&#x0201d; Exercise Program.</p></caption></media><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12877_2015_28_MOESM4_ESM.docx" id="MOESM4"><label>Additional file 4: Table S4.</label><caption><p>Conditional probabilities applied over an 18-month period, &#x0201c;NoFalls&#x0201d; Exercise Program.</p></caption></media><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12877_2015_28_MOESM5_ESM.docx" id="MOESM5"><label>Additional file 5: Table S5.</label><caption><p>Incremental cost per QALY (2010 GBP), &#x0201c;Nofalls&#x0201d; Exercise Program.</p></caption></media><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12877_2015_28_MOESM6_ESM.docx" id="MOESM6"><label>Additional file 6: Table S6.</label><caption><p>Missing data analysis, &#x0201c;NoFalls&#x0201d; Exercise Program.</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>AD contributed to study design, interpretation of the analysis and provided critical comment on the draft manuscript.
