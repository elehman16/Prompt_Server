Therefore, promoting rapid recovery from gastrointestinal function has become integral to postoperative rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Gastric motility typically recovers within 24&#x02013;48 h after surgery, whereas colonic motility is generally restored within 48&#x02013;72 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, it often takes 2&#x02013;3 days for the patient to recover from gastrointestinal dysfunction. Postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction is usually treated using alvimopan; however, this drug has adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Auricular point acupressure (APP) may be a noninvasive physical treatment for the condition of postoperative gastronintestinal dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This therapy involves stimulating sensitive points on the auricle using vaccaria seeds; the points correspond to specific organs. In previous studies, we compared subjects&#x02019; postoperative time to flatus between an experimental group that received APP using vaccaria seeds on the large intestine point (CO7; 20.19&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.14) and a control group that received APP sham stimulation (30.82&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.58). Preliminary results showed that the APP using vaccaria seeds on CO7 can promote the recovery of gastrointestinal motility after abdominal surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>This study is a randomized, double-blind, controlled, single-center, clinical, pilot trial (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which was designed in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT 2010) guidelines as well as the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) checklist shows in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, we are selecting in-patients who have undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) between January 2016 and June 2016 at the Department of Minimally Invasive Surgery of Tianjin Nankai Hospital. The APP will be performed by specialist nurses who have more than 5 years of experience and have held intermediate professional titles.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1404_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Patients will be randomly assigned either to the APP group or to the APP sham stimulation group on the basis of numbers randomly generated using SPSS 19.0.

After IRB approval had been obtained, this study was registered at an authoritative clinical trial registration platform (the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry) before the start of the study (ID: ChiCTR-IPR-15007643). Informed consent forms were developed in accordance with the requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki. All qualified subjects can freely choose whether or not to participate in this study and will be required to sign the informed consent form before taking part.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Randomization</title><p>Complete randomization will be performed using the random number generator in SPSS 19.0; patients will be randomly assigned to the APP therapy group or the APP sham stimulation group. To reduce selection bias and confounding factors, the randomization will be performed by a single specifically appointed investigator. Each group will contain an equal number of participants. When a qualified subject participates in the trial, the recruiters will obtain the subject&#x02019;s sequence number from the assigning investigator; the two groups will be assigned to separate wards to prevent communication between them. Thus, bias will be reduced further.</p><p>To prevent researcher bias from confounding the results, the randomization will be blinded using the sealed envelope method: the subject recruiters and evaluators will not be informed of the allocation sequence, and the allocation sequence will be placed in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (to ensure that the contents cannot be seen, even under bright light). To prevent the allocation sequence from being disrupted, the subjects&#x02019; names and dates of birth will be written on the envelopes, the envelopes will be sealed, and detailed information regarding the subjects will be recorded in a video. The information will be copied onto assignment cards, which are contained in the envelopes, using carbon paper, and a second researcher will watch the video to confirm that the envelopes are still sealed after the subjects&#x02019; names are written. A video recorder will be used to record the complete process of opening the envelopes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Blinding methods</title><p>We will ensure that the evaluators of treatment efficacy are unaware of the group assignments of the subjects by (1) blinding the subject data and (2) using independent statisticians. Moreover, the data will be analyzed by statisticians who are unaware of the group assignment. Thus, operators, evaluators, data administrators, and statisticians will work independently in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Intervention</title><p>After surgery, all the included subjects will lie in the supine position without a pillow and fast. The subjects will be given a liquid diet on the day after surgery. The APP therapy (or sham therapy) will be performed 6 h after the operation and every 12 h subsequently, for six treatment sessions, each lasting 3 min. The first evaluation will be performed 6 h after the operation, immediately before the first treatment. The patients will be then evaluated once every 12 h, for seven evaluations. The acupuncture points will be selected on the basis of the Nogier auricular point diagram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Specifically, CO7 will be selected (the anterior 1/3 between the helix crus/part of the helix and the AB line, i.e., the auricular concha zone 7; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Operators will bring the required tools to the subject&#x02019;s bedside and help the subject assume a comfortable position. The operator will then hold the upper posterior corner of the helix with one hand, and find the sensitive points with an auricular point detector (XS-100A; Guangzhou City Strong Medical Technology Co. Ltd., Guangzhou, China) using the other hand. The area will be disinfected using 75 % alcohol, and the vaccaria seeds will be attached to the auricular points.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Auricular point acupressure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1404_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Experimental group</title><p>Pressure will be applied to both ears alternately without rubbing (to avoid skin damage and infection at the acupuncture point). Optimal pressure will be considered to have been achieved when the subject feels localized tingling pain; the vaccaria seeds will then be fixed to prevent them from coming loose. We use small adhesive tape with spherical vaccaria seeds to adhere to the auricular points, and then, we press the points with digital pressure for 10 s. A 3-s pause occurs between each two pressings. After every intervention, we will remove the tapes. We will use the Visual Analog Scale (VAS; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) to evaluate pressure intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In accordance with preliminary experiments, the pressure intensity will be controlled at 50 mm. Because the pre-operative fasting time is relatively long, and stimulation of acupuncture points can lead to reduced blood sugar levels, it is necessary to observe whether the subject displays symptoms such as paleness and apathy during the treatment. If such symptoms appear, then the procedure will be ceased immediately, a blood sugar test will be performed, and treatment will be administered as necessary.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Visual analog scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1404_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Control group</title><p>The subjects in the control group will receive sham APP, i.e., vaccaria-seed tapes adhered to the auricular points with no added pressure.

A decrease of 4 h in the time to first flatus was set as our clinical expectation based on preliminary tests and clinical experience. The above data were used to estimate the value of the overall parameter to be inserted into the above formula, and an n-value of 20.09 was obtained. Therefore, the rounded sample size in each group was 21; assuming a 15 % dropout rate, the final sample sizes in the experimental and control groups would be 25 cases, yielding the required 50 cases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Content of statistical analysis<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Sample distribution: The absolute number of dropouts as well as the rate will be described for each data set.

The subjects&#x02019; time to first defecation, abdominal pain, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, mental status, and quality of life&#x02014;i.e., the seven secondary outcome measures&#x02014;will be used to evaluate the efficacy of the APP.

The scores for mental status will be recorded and categorized in terms of the classification criteria. The statistical analysis of time to first defecation is the same as that of time to first passage of flatus; abdominal pain, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, and quality of life will be statistically compared between groups using Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (RMANOVA).

Such adverse effects can lead to prolonged hospitalization, prevent patients from recovering functionally, and increase the medical burden.</p><p>Currently, postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction is treated using postoperative fasting, gastrointestinal decompression, early ambulation, enema, chewing gum, gastroprokinetic drugs, and early enteral nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this regard, APP using vaccaria seeds has clear benefits for patients with diseases of the digestive system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This study is the first standardized, scientific, clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of APP treatment using vaccaria seeds for postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction. The study was prompted by long-term clinical experience and will use the time to first passage of flatus as the primary outcome measure. We wish to provide a scientific basis upon which to promote this therapy.</p><p>A systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] showed that the time to first passage of flatus has important clinical significance in terms of recovering gastrointestinal motility, and the same parameter is closely related to the recovery of the postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction. For this reason, most clinical trials addressing the treatment of postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction, such as that by Cho in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and that by Kim in the same year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], use the time to first passage of flatus as a primary outcome. In this way, they can evaluate the recovery of gastrointestinal function. Hence, we also have set this measure as the primary outcome in our trial. During the perioperative period, subjects may exhibit psychological changes such as anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; thus, the subjects&#x02019; anxiety and depression will be used as secondary indicators of recovery. Furthermore, subjects&#x02019; quality of life within a month of discharge can also indicate the longer-term effects of this therapy.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Trial status</title><p>The recruitment of this trial is currently ongoing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>APP, auricular point acupressure; CRF, case report form; GIQLI, Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index; HADS, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; LC, laparoscopic cholecystectomy; VAS, visual analog scale</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1404_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>SPIRIT checklist.
