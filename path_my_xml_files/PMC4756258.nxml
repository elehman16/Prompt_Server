Background</title><p>A growing body of evidence suggests that patients with high levels of total cholesterol (TCH), high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-CH), and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-CH) are at a greater risk of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (<xref rid="A31326R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="A31326R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Oxidative stress plays an important role in the etiology of these conditions. Hyperlipidemia has been found to induce oxidative stress, which causes cellular damage (<xref rid="A31326R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>There has been a great deal of pharmaceutical research aimed at finding drug therapies to prevent the process of atherosclerosis formation. However, herbal and natural medicines are becoming increasingly popular due to fewer side effects and easier availability (<xref rid="A31326R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> is one of the most widely used herbs in the world, and has been used traditionally in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression, migraines, gastrointestinal disorders, and wound-healing.</p><p>Given that atherosclerosis is a complex inflammatory disease involving vascular endothelial cells, lipid-engorged macrophages, and smooth muscle cells, it appears that antioxidants can be used for the reduction of atherosclerosis formation (<xref rid="A31326R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="A31326R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec138711"><title>2. Objectives</title><p>The present study sought to investigate the lipid-lowering and antioxidative properties of EHP in terms of the lipid profiles and lipid-peroxidation products of rats fed a cholesterol-rich diet.</p></sec><sec id="sec138719"><title>3. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec138712"><title>3.1. Animals</title><p>Adult male Wistar rats weighing 220 &#x000b1; 10 g (Razi Institute, Iran) were housed five per cage under a 12-hour light/dark cycle at 22 - 24&#x000b0;C, with food and water ad libitum. The methods were approved by the Ethics Committee of Shahed University of Medical Sciences, and the laboratory animals were afforded due care in accordance with the regulations of the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision on Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA). The experiments were done by blinded researchers.</p></sec><sec id="sec138713"><title>3.2. Drugs</title><p><italic>H. perforatum</italic> was procured from the Isfahan Natural Resource Institute in August 2015 and authenticated by Dr. Ghaem-Maghami at the Isfahan University Herbarium, and voucher specimen number 13648 was assigned. The aerial parts of the plant were dried for 1 week at room temperature under shade, then powdered with an electric grinder. The extract was prepared with 10 g of powder and 100 mL of 70% ethanol as the solvent. The extraction was done using the maceration method for 72 hour at room temperature in the dark. Afterward, the solution was filtered three times and dried on a rotary evaporator at 40&#x000b0;C, yielding 1.85 g (18.5%) of extract. The final extract was kept at -20&#x000b0;C, and further dilution was prepared in cold normal saline. EHP at a dose of 300 mg/kg was injected intraperitoneally into the hyperlipidemic and control groups daily for two weeks. This dose was chosen on the basis of previous reports (<xref rid="A31326R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="A31326R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec138714"><title>3.3. Induction of hyperlipidemia</title><p>Hyperlipidemia was induced by feeding the rats a high-fat diet containing 25% corn oil for a period of two months (<xref rid="A31326R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The induced hyperlipidemia manifested itself after 8 weeks as a significant rise in the mean TG and TCH levels (P &#x0003c; 0.05) in the rats fed a high-fat diet compared with those given a control diet.</p></sec><sec id="sec138715"><title>3.4. Measurement of Lipid Profiles and Biochemical Factors</title><p>The lipid profile (TCH, LDL-CH, HDL-CH, and TG) was measured twice on separate days, first at baseline and then at the end of the tenth week. Blood samples were collected 12 hours after overnight fasting. Enzyme assay kits (Shimi Zist Co., Iran) were used. The levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were measured by centrifuging the blood samples at 2500 &#x000d7; g for 15 minutes, and then the levels of the biochemical factors were measured using appropriate kits.</p></sec><sec id="sec138716"><title>3.5. Lipid Peroxidation Assay</title><p>The production of malondialdehyde (MDA) is used as a biomarker to measure the level of lipid peroxidation. Briefly, to evaluate the lipid peroxidation products (MDA), 1.0 mL of 20% trichloroacetic acid and 1.0 mL of 1% thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were added to 100 &#x003bc;L of a supernatant, mixed, then incubated at 100&#x000b0;C for 80 minutes. After cooling on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 minutes and the absorbance of the supernatant was read at 532 nm (<xref rid="A31326R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec138717"><title>3.6. Experimental Groups</title><p>The rats were randomly divided into four experimental groups of eight rats each: 1) control, 2) control + EHP, 3) hyperlipidemia, and 4) hyperlipidemia + EHP. Blood samples were obtained from all of the animals at baseline for the measurement of lipid profile, markers of lipid peroxidation, aminotransferases, and ALP. These factors were checked twice more, at eight and ten weeks later.</p></sec><sec id="sec138718"><title>3.7. Statistical Analysis</title><p>The data were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. The normality of the distribution of the variables was checked using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For statistical analysis, the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc Tukey tests were used for intergroup differences. For this purpose, IBM SPSS Statistics 22 for Windows (IBM Inc., Armonk, NY, USA) was employed. A P value of &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec138723"><title>4. Results</title><sec id="sec138720"><title>4.1.

Discussion</title><p>In this study, serum lipids, aminotransferases, and antioxidant status were evaluated to determine the effects of aqueous EHP on hyperlipidemic rats. In the treated hyperlipidemia group, LDL-CH was significantly decreased. A similar result was seen in the treated control group, demonstrating that EHP was able to reduce LDL-CH in the hyperlipidemic and even the normal rats. These results agree with those of previous studies.</p><p>Zou et al. reported that LDL-CH was significantly reduced in hypercholesterolemic rats treated with a flavonoid-rich extract of <italic>H. perforatum</italic> (FEHP). These researchers speculated that the deterrent effect of FEHP on hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-coA), or the increasing effect of the FEHP on the excretion of bile and cholesterol, was responsible for the reduction in LDL-CH (<xref rid="A31326R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Aqueous EHP effectively decreased TCH in the treated controls. This finding is concordant with those of several previous studies. A similar result was observed in the treated hyperlipidemia group; the difference, however, was not significant.</p><p>Habibi et al. studied the therapeutic effects of total EHP and calcic and magnesic sulfate mineral water on the lipid profiles of hyperlipidemic rats, and concluded that EHP significantly reduced TCH, TG, and LDL (<xref rid="A31326R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Also in the study by Zou et al., FEHP reduced TCH in hyperlipidemic rats (<xref rid="A31326R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In the present study, although the decrease in TCH in the treated hyperlipidemic group was not significant, it was in line with changes reported in previous studies.</p><p>Our results revealed no significant changes in HDL-CH levels in the rats treated with EHP. In contrast with Zou et al., Asgary et al. reported that EHP was able to increase HDL-CH levels (<xref rid="A31326R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="A31326R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In addition, it has been previously shown that the flavonoid components of <italic>H. perforatum</italic> can increase HDL-CH levels by augmenting the synthesis of apolipoprotein A-I (<xref rid="A31326R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The difference in the results may be due to dissimilarities in the type of extract administered and the model of the study. Asgari et al. used a hydroalcoholic EHP administered to New Zealand rabbits, whereas Asgary et al. and Zou et al. utilized a flavonoid EHP (<xref rid="A31326R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="A31326R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, the amount of TG in the untreated and treated hyperlipidemic groups increased significantly, indicating the mounting effects of a high-fat diet on TG. Nonetheless, there was no significant change in the TG levels of the EHP-treated hyperlipidemic group compared to the untreated hyperlipidemic group.</p><p>Khushbactova et al. reported that the proanthocyanidin content of <italic>H. perforatum</italic> was able to reduce TG levels (<xref rid="A31326R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). They speculated that this therapeutic effect occurred through the augmentation of vascular wall resistance, which prevents cholesterol penetration into the atherogenic lipoprotein composition. The discrepancy in the results may be due to differences in the active components of the different extracts of <italic>H. perforatum</italic>. Khushbactova et al. used polymeric proanthocyanidins derived from <italic>H. perforatum</italic> in their study, while we administered aqueous EHP (<xref rid="A31326R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Among the four groups in the current study, MDA concentrations were highest in the untreated hyperlipidemia group, but were reduced in the hyperlipidemic rats receiving EHP. Our results showed that <italic>H. perforatum</italic> was able to significantly reduce MDA due to its antioxidant properties, which is in agreement with the majority of previous studies.</p><p>In our study, ALT, AST, and ALP concentrations increased in the groups fed a high-fat diet. The elevation in the activity of these enzymes in hyperlipidemic rats represents an increase in oxidative factors due to the high blood-lipid concentration. At the end of the study, our findings showed that the ALT and AST activity in the treated hyperlipidemic group had reduced in comparison to the untreated hyperlipidemic group.</p><p>The findings of the present study are in concordance with those of several previous studies. For instance, Arhan et al. showed that increased blood lipids reduced antioxidant defenses and increased lipid peroxidation in the liver (<xref rid="A31326R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In addition, oxidative stress eliminates the balance between peroxidants and antioxidants in biological systems, followed by a rise in lipid peroxidation and free-radical production.</p><p>Bayramoglu et al. investigated the hepatoprotective effects of <italic>H. perforatum</italic> on hepatic ischemia injury in rats, and showed that the injection of hydroalcoholic EHP significantly reduced AST, ALT, MDA, and LDH while increasing the levels of catalase and glutathione peroxidase (<xref rid="A31326R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), confirming our results that showed reduced aminotransferases. In the present study, we did not measure antioxidant defense systems such as glutathione, and we suggest that future studies take such systems into consideration.</p><sec id="sec138724"><title>5.1. Conclusions</title><p>In the present study, aqueous EHP reduced the serum lipid profile of rats in terms of LDL-CH. In addition, EHP effectively reduced the enzymes and markers of oxidative stress caused by hyperlipidemia.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper is the result of Dr. Maryam Maleki&#x02019;s thesis and was financially supported by the Research Council of Shahed University.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="afn45157" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Contribution:</bold>Study concept and design: Mohammad Hassan Ghosian Moghaddam, Maryam Maleki; acquisition of data: Maryam Maleki; analysis and interpretation of data: Mehrdad Roghani, Maryam Maleki; drafting of the manuscript: Maryam Maleki; critical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content: Maryam Maleki; statistical analysis: Mehrdad Roghani, Maryam Maleki.</p></fn><fn id="afn45158" fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Funding/Support:</bold>This paper is the result of Dr. Maryam Maleki&#x02019;s thesis and was financially supported by the Research Council of Shahed University of Medical Sciences.
