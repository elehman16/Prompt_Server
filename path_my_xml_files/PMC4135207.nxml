pressure thresholds (PPTs) over time. [Subjects and Methods] Fifteen healthy participants
were recruited and randomly divided into 3 groups: aerobic exercise, strengthening
exercise, and control. The subjects in the aerobic group walked on a treadmill for 40&#x02005;min
at 6.5&#x02005;km/h. The subjects in the strength group performed circuit training that included
bench press, lat pull down, biceps curl, triceps extension, and shoulder press based on
the perceived exertion for 40&#x02005;min. The subjects in the control group rested without any
exercise in a quiet room for 40&#x02005;min. The PPTs of 5 potential muscle trigger points before
exercise, and immediately after 10 and 40&#x02005;min of exercise or rest were measured using an
electronic algometer (JTECH Medical, USA). The Friedman&#x02019;s, Kruskal-Wallis, and
Mann-Whitney tests were performed using SPSS 18.0 (IBM, Korea). [Results] The PPTs of all
subjects decreased after 10&#x02005;min of exercise, but the difference was not statistically
significant. The PPTs of the control group decreased after 40&#x02005;min. Furthermore, the PPTs
of 3 muscles increased after 40&#x02005;min of aerobic exercise and of 6 muscles after 40&#x02005;min of
strengthening exercise. No significant difference in PPTs was noted among the groups.
[Conclusion] The results show that 40&#x02005;min is a more appropriate exercise time, although
the efficacy of controlling pain did not differ between strengthening exercise and aerobic
exercise.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Aerobic exercise</kwd><kwd>Strengthening exercise</kwd><kwd>Pain pressure thresholds</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The pain threshold (PT) is the minimum amount of pain or unpleasant feeling experienced by
an individual, and it may be changed by continuous stimulation<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. A patient with chronic pain may have a high PT<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> or a low PT<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Three different theories of pain symptoms have been proposed by
researchers<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The neurophysiological theory proposes that continuous stimulation
will induce a high PT because pain will inhibit pain by inhibiting neurons in the dorsal
horn of the spinal cord. Second, The cognitive theory, an adaptive theory, proposes that if
a subject often experiences uncomfortable sensations, their ability to perceive pain
improves, which leads to a chronically increased PT, and, the hypersensitivity theory
suggests that the PT will decrease due to exaggerated reactions in patients with chronic
pain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A trigger point is a tender point in the muscle fibers that divides active and potential
trigger points. An active trigger point is a point which moves during the performance of
activities of daily living, while a potential trigger point is that one that is not felt
until it is stimulated, e.g. by the application of pressure on the skin<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most people have similar potential trigger points despite having
different lifestyles, which may be the main reason for pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, physiotherapists must consider the potential trigger
points when they create exercise plans for healthy people as well as patients.</p><p>Aerobic exercise increases oxygen consumption and induces pain relief by activating
endocannabinoid receptors that can easily pass the blood vessel barrier<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sparing et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that college students running on a treadmill or pedaling
on a stationary bike at 79&#x02013;80% of the maximum heart rate exhibited sedation and analgesia
via activation of the endocannabinoid system. Hoffman et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> also found that pain perception changed after a minimum of 10&#x02005;min
of aerobic exercise with a 75% maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>). Koltyn et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that an acute bout of exercise
induced a lower systolic blood pressure, a higher heart rate, and changed the pain
perception. However, isometric exercise increased blood pressure, but it is not related to
pain perception<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>&#x02014;i.e., neurotransmitter
and blood pressure levels were changed and then changes in pain perception were induced.</p><p>Muscle strength exercises have a positive effect on PT; however, some exercises such as
weightlifting can worsen pain<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kolton
and Arbogasr<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the PT
increased after 5&#x02005;min of strengthening exercise with 75% of one-repetition maximum, and
returned to normal after 15&#x02005;min of strengthening exercises. Bartholomew et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that pain tolerance increased
after 20&#x02005;min of self-selected exercise, indicating an analgesic response after exercise.
Koltyn et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> found that the PT of
women increased and the PT of men did not change after isometric strengthening exercise.</p><p>As mentioned above, the analgesic effect of aerobic exercise requires a minimum of 10&#x02005;min;
however, strengthening exercise did not require the same amount of time. Furthermore, most
studies selected an exercise intensity associated with maximum resistance, and the time for
which exercise was performed differed among studies. Hence, a study of the effect of
exercise duration using mild intensity of exercise was required. Moreover, in most previous
studies, it was unclear whether a potential or active trigger point was used. Studies of the
potential trigger point are essential, since it could lead to disease progression if it is
not treated. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to elucidate the manner in which
aerobic and strengthening exercises affect PTs over time, and to identify appropriate
exercises that clinicians can use for managing pain in patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Fifteen healthy participants were recruited and randomly divided into 3 groups. One
participant dropped out of the study during the second test for personal reasons. All the
subjects provided their written informed consent to participation in the experiment in
accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. This study also
excluded subjects who took any medication for musculoskeletal pain, in order to eliminate
interference effects.</p><p>The pain pressure thresholds (PPTs) were measured using an electronic algometer (JTECH
Medical, USA) over potential trigger points. The examiner identified a trigger point by
palpating and exerting vertical pressure on the skin. The examiner increased the pressure at
the rate of 1&#x02005;kg/s until the subject experienced a pain or an unpleasant feeling, and the
PPT values were measured 3 times for each muscle<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The participants were instructed to verbally express their first
perception of pain or an unpleasant feeling, at which point the application of pressure was
stopped<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The PPT has been proven to
be a reliable measure (interclass correlation, 0.78&#x02013;0.93)<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The subjects in the aerobic group walked on a treadmill for 10 and 40&#x02005;min at 6.5&#x02005;km/h. The
subjects in the strength group performed 10 and 40&#x02005;min of circulate training exercises that
included a bench press, lat pulldown, biceps curl, triceps extension, and shoulder press
based on the perceived exertion. The subjects in the control group rested in a quiet room
without exercising for 10 and 40&#x02005;min.</p><p>The PPTs were measured before exercise as well as immediately after 10 and 40&#x02005;min of
exercise using an electronic algometer at the potential trigger points of 5 muscles. The
measurements were recorded at 2-day intervals to minimize fatigue-related errors and the
mean values were then calculated.</p><p>The 5 muscles examined were the trapezius, supraspinatus, teres major, rhomboid, and
levator scapulae. Most individuals experience problems, such as sudden muscle pain, in these
muscles due to computer work and sedentary lifestyles, and therefore, these muscles were
selected.</p><p>Frequency analysis was performed to analyze the patients&#x02019; general characteristics.
Friedman&#x02019;s test was used to identify the change in the PPTs according to time, and the
Kruskal-Wallis test was used to confirm differences among the 3 groups. The Mann-Whitney
test was performed using SPSS 18.0 (IBM, Korea). A significance level of 0.05 was chosen for
the Friedman&#x02019;s and Kruskal-Wallis tests and 0.001 for the Mann-Whitney test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The participant&#x02019;s mean age was 25.2&#x02005;years, their mean height was 176&#x02005;cm, and their mean

immediately after 40&#x02005;min of exercise in the aerobic exercise group, the differences were not
significant. Furthermore, in the strengthening exercise group, the PPTs of the left
trapezius, left levator scapulae, left and right teres major, and left and right
supraspinatus muscles increased; however, significant differences were only noted for the
left trapezius, left levator scapulae, and left teres major muscle (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, no significant differences in the change of
the PPTs were observed among the groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>PPTs can be measured by electrical stimulation or pressure<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, we used a digital pressure algometer to
measure the PPTs. We aimed to elucidate whether exercise changes pain perception at
potential trigger points. Exercise-induced analgesia is useful in clinical settings. The
endorphins induced after exercise decrease pain. In particular, pain perceptions are changed
by exercise in patients with chronic low back pain; however, the effect of anesthesia
differs according to the type of exercise<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most of the previous studies have examined aerobic exercise,
whereas only a few studies have focused on strengthening exercise, therefore, we also
focused on strengthening exercise in the present study.</p><p>In the present study, treadmill walking was chosen as the aerobic exercise mode and circuit
exercise was chosen as the strengthening exercise mode, because these forms of exercise are
frequently chosen as self-exercise. The same testing method was employed for the 2 tests
that differed in duration (10&#x02005;min and 40&#x02005;min), and it was repeated at a 2-day interval.
Hoffman et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that PPT
reproducibility did not evoke a significant stress-induced analgesic effect, therefore, they
did not measure potential trigger points. However, in the present study, PPT reproducibility
at potential trigger points was measured.</p><p>Droste et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the PPTs
of 3 groups (cycle ergometer, naloxone, and placebo groups) did not change significantly,
whereas Hoffman et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> found that pain
ratings were decreased 5&#x02005;min after 30&#x02005;min of exercise at 75% VO<sub>2max</sub>, but had
returned to baseline by 30&#x02005;min after 30&#x02005;min of exercise in healthy people.</p><p>Hoffman et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that PPTs were
decreased after 30&#x02005;min of aerobic exercise, consisting of leg cycling, among patients with
chronic low back pain. However, Koltyn et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that the PPTs of a cycle ergometer group increased after 15,
20, and 30&#x02005;min of exercise due to lowered systolic blood pressure and a higher heart rate.
Kosek et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> found that the PT of
healthy subjects was increased after isometric exercise at a reading of 21% on a peak flow
meter; however, the PT remained unchanged in patients with fibromyalgia. Koltyn and
Arbogast<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that the PT after
45&#x02005;min of strengthening exercise did not significantly differ between a strengthening
exercise group and a control group.</p><p>In the present study, the PPTs had decreased immediately after 10&#x02005;min of exercise or rest
in the aerobic, strengthening exercise, and a control groups decreased after 10&#x02005;min,
although the differences between the values were not statistically significant among the
groups.</p><p>There are several potential reasons for this. First, the patients&#x02019; pain perceptions were
changed and they could recognize the pain due to the application of pressure over the skin
by the examiner&#x02014;i.e., the subjects recognized potential pain after the examiner exerted
pressure on the skin, and the potential trigger point was changed to an activating trigger
point. When these subjects performed exercise, they still experienced the pain as they had
already identified the trigger point. In fact, the subjects may have remembered the trigger
point during short duration of the exercise.</p><p>Second, the measurements were made repeatedly and may have represented the summation of
findings at the trigger points. The subjects repeatedly experienced pain at the trigger
points, and may have easily remembered the pain at the time of exercise completion. This
would indicate that pain is a sensory experience, involving a summation of psychological
experience and cognitive experience.</p><p>The PPTs of 3 muscles in the aerobic exercise group and 6 muscles in the strengthening
exercise group increased immediately after 40&#x02005;min of exercise, but none of these values
indicated a significant difference, except for the PPTs of the left trapezius, left levator
scapulae, and left teres major in strengthening exercise group. Therefore, 40&#x02005;min of
exercise was more effective than 10&#x02005;min of exercise, although the change in the PPTs was
mild. This may be explained by the intensity of the exercise. Although we used mild
intensity exercise in the present study, most previous research has used maximum intensity
exercise. Maximum intensity exercise may increase the blood supply to the muscle,
sufficiently enough to control pain. However, the intensity of the exercise used in the
present study was perhaps in sufficient to ensure adequate blood supply to the muscles for
pain control.</p><p>The PPTs of all of the muscles in the control group decreased immediately after 40&#x02005;min of
rest, but no significant differences were noted. This finding may be explained the fact that
the subjects could easily perceive the trigger points after the examiner exerted pressure at
these points. The subjects remembered the pain that was caused by the pressure applied by
the examiner, and were continuously aware of the pain during the rest period. This may have
been one reason why the subjects responded quickly when an examiner measured the pain
threshold again.</p><p>Physiotherapists may need to treat patients who complain of a greater amount of pain after
therapy in the clinic, because a potential trigger point may have changed to an active
trigger point in these patients. The results of the present study indicate the potential for
change in the condition of the trigger points after therapy. Therapists need to determine
whether pain originates from an activated or potential trigger point.</p><p>We believe that the measurement of PPTs in the sitting position is a limitation of this
study, as the examiner needs to apply a greater amount of pressure when the subject is in
the sitting position than when the subject is lying on a table. Moreover, the sample size
was small, and therefore, the findings are difficult to generalize.</p><p>In conclusion, PPTs decreased immediately after 10&#x02005;min of exercise or rest, but the PPTs of
some muscles were increased immediately after 40&#x02005;min of exercise. Moreover, no significant
differences in these values were noted according to the type of exercise. Therefore, both
strengthening exercise as well as aerobic exercise of mild intensity were unable to
effectively control pain. Hence, we suggest that 40&#x02005;min is an effective exercise time, but
that an increased intensity of exercise is required to control pain.</p><p>Thus, more specific exercises need to be developed in the future, including exercises with
varying intensity and duration. Moreover, the transition of a potential trigger point to an
activated trigger point should be identified to prevent potential disease</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Trigger point and trigger mechanism.
