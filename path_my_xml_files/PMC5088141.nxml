provide basic data for physical therapy in internal medicine. [Subjects and Methods] The
colon transit times of 30 subjects were measured and after the interventions. Fifteen
subjects were assigned to a Maitland orthopedic manual therapy group, and 15 subjects were
assigned to a dietary fiber group. [Results<bold>]</bold> The analysis of changes in colon
transit time showed statistically significant differences in left colon transit time,
rectosigmoid colon transit time, and total colon transit time for the Maitland orthopedic
manual therapy group and statistically significant differences in rectosigmoid colon
transit time and total colon transit time for the dietary fiber group. An analysis of
group differences in the effects of Maitland orthopedic manual therapy and dietary fiber
showed that the Maitland orthopedic manual therapy group achieved statistically
significantly larger declines in rectosigmoid colon transit time and total colon transit
time compared with the dietary fiber group. [Conclusion] This study confirmed that
Maitland orthopedic manual therapy can be an effective treatment method for internal
conditions such as functional constipation by almost normalizing the colon transit time,
not only by improving the symptoms of constipation but also by facilitating intestinal
movements.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Constipation</kwd><kwd>Functional constipation</kwd><kwd>Colon transit time</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Constipation is an intestinal symptom commonly exhibited in both adults and children and
whose incidence ranges from 2% to 28%. It is accompanied by a variety of symptoms and
pathophysiology and results from various causes<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. While constipation is mostly based on
structural or biochemical abnormalities such as metabolic and endocrine disorders, neural
tissue disorders, the weakening of muscle functions, and intestinal atresia, there also
exists functional constipation, the clear cause of which is not identifiable<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. As constipation is not a disease but a
symptom or finding, it has various causes; therefore, its definition is still highly
controversial<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The impact of
constipation on daily activities is more serious than expected. It goes beyond mere
discomfort in daily activities and can cause psychological pain or serious results due to
wrong self-diagnoses, drug abuse, and side effects<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A widely used primary test for chronic constipation in patients who do not have organic
diseases is a colon transit time-measuring method using radiopaque markers<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. It was developed by Metcalf et al. in 1987
and is the standard commonly used method adopted by the International Symposium on
Gastrointestinal Motility and the Society of Academic &#x00026; Research Surgery in the UK. This
is because it enables a relatively simple diagnosis and is clinically useful<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. It also has the advantage of conveniently
measuring the transit time of either the entire area or of each area of the colon<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Existing studies related to the treatment
of constipation have examined the effects on constipation of a daily intake of porridge full
of fruits and fibers (porridge made by boiling oatmeal in milk)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, a white brand diet<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, the control of patients&#x02019; constipation using physical therapy<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, a physiotherapy intervention<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, low-frequency currents<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, or SSP therapy<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. While correlations between constipation motility
disorders and various symptoms of constipation have been partially known, they have not been
clearly verified. In addition, few studies have applied physical therapy to constipation
using the colon transit time, which can directly measure intestinal motility disorders.</p><p>In this regard, to learn about the effects of interventions on constipation, this study
applied Maitland orthopedic manual therapy or dietary fiber to subjects and then performed a
colon transit time test to identify overall intestinal motility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were selected from among patients who visited C Hospital in
Pohang between March and December 2015. They also had to have a score of 10 points or more
on the Rome III Diagnostic Criteria<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> and
the Constipation Assessment Scale by McMillan and Williams<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Forty patients volunteered to participate in the experiment, and
30 subjects were selected by excluding the following patients: patients who had a malignant
tumor, peptic ulcer, or inflammatory intestinal disease or underwent an intestinal
operation, patients who were hypersensitive to drugs, patients with severe obesity whose
body mass index (BMI) was 30&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> or above, and women who were pregnant or
breastfeeding. The subjects were randomly divided into the Maitland orthopedic manual
therapy group (MOMTG) and the dietary fiber group (DFG) (n=15 for each group). The contents
and purpose of the experiment were fully explained to the subjects before the experiment,
and the subjects provided written informed consent. The Ethics Committee of Namseoul
University, South Korea, approved the study. The IRB approval number is
Research-1041479-201503-HR-021.

clinical tests at least seven days before the initial test. All subjects fasted after 10:00
p.m. the day before the test. For the pre-intervention test, the subjects took a capsule
containing 24 radiopaque markers at a regular hour every day for three consecutive days, and
on the fourth day, a simple abdominal radiograph was taken during the same hour as when the
subjects had taken the capsule.</p><p>The MOMTG was treated for 20 minutes a day, three days a week, for eight weeks, and the DFG
was treated three times a day, three days a week, for eight weeks. Testing was performed
again eight weeks after these interventions in the same manner as the pre-intervention test,
and then the changes between before and after the Interventions were compared. Maitland
orthopedic manual therapy was performed by a physical therapist who had completed a course
covering Maitland orthopedic manual therapy level 2a. The patients were instructed to lie
prone and then take the most comfortable position for them. Facet joint mobilization, which
is used in Maitland orthopedic manual therapy, was performed on spinal segments
T<sub>9</sub> to L<sub>2</sub>, which correspond to the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>For the DFG, a previous study had recommended a daily intake of 20 to 25&#x02005;g of dietary fiber
to ease the symptom of constipation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
this study, the amount of dietary fiber while members of the DFG were having meals was not
limited, and a product containing 16.5&#x02005;g dietary fiber (Psyllium Fiber, Pharmagen,
Pharmatech USA LLC, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the experiment. The subjects were
instructed to take the dietary fiber with a sufficient amount of water after having a meal.
The amount of intake 15&#x02005;g or more per day was set based on various reference data and on the
recommended daily intake of dietary fiber for finished products containing dietary products
(5.0&#x02005;g or more of dietary fiber per time) as stipulated by the Ministry of Food and Drug
Safety<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>PASW Statistics 18.0 was employed for data analysis. The Mann-Whitney U test was performed
to examine group differences in colon transit time, and the Wilcoxon Signed-rank test was
performed to verify changes before and after the interventions within each group. The

due to causes such as changing eating habits. The impact of constipation on daily activities
is more serious than expected. It goes beyond causing discomfort in daily activities and
leads some individuals to suffer from psychological pain. Given the existence of functional
constipation the clear cause of which is not identifiable, it is highly important to
identify the pathophysiology of constipation, and apply appropriate treatment to improve the
quality of life in patients<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Most constipation patients continue to be administered stimulant laxatives because they
cannot relieve their symptom through dietary control. Taking stimulant laxatives for a long
period of time causes abdominal distension, chronic diarrhea, excessive amounts of gas in
the bowels, nausea, and vomiting. Moreover, patients can become dehydrated if they do not
drink enough water while taking laxatives, thereby worsening their constipation. This
results in the use of a larger dose of laxatives to obtain the effect of bowel movement. In
fact, overuse of stimulant laxatives may exacerbate the symptoms of constipation by causing
damage to the neural networks in the colon<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Jost and Eckardt noted that because of the side effects of drugs,
nondrug care should be considered a priority in relieving constipation<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present, this study suggests Maitland orthopedic
manual therapy as an intervention for functional constipation. We treated patients who
visited a hospital due to symptoms of functional constipation with Maitland orthopedic
manual therapy and dietary fiber, and then we performed the colon transit time test to
identify intestinal motility.</p><p>The colon transit time test can measure the transit time both for the entire area and for
each section of the colon<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is a
measuring method that can establish the physiological foundation of chronic constipation and
identify the types of constipation according to the sections of the colon<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Normal bowel movements occur when absorption, retrostalsis, haustral contraction,
collective movement, and evacuation, which occur in the colon and rectum, are normally
realized<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, if these organs
are restrained abnormally, constipation occurs<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves are distributed
throughout the colon and rectum, and these nerves work antagonistically against each other.
In other words, these organs are under dual control such that if the sympathetic nerves
become stimulated, the parasympathetic nerves are suppressed<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the colon transit time test performed to analyze intestinal
motility, the MOMTG showed statistically significant declines in left colon transit time,
rectosigmoid colon transit time, and total colon transit time after the intervention
(p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>Koo et al. reported that after Kaltenborn-Evjenth orthopedic manual therapy was performed
on the spinal segments T<sub>9</sub> to L<sub>2</sub> spinal segments of functional
constipation patients, statistically significant declines in left colon transit time and in
total colon transit time were observed<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Quist and Duray administered laxatives and dietary fiber to an eight-year-old boy with
chronic constipation but did not observe statistically significant declines. However, the
results of performing a remedial treatment two times over a four-week period showed
improvements in constipation, and the boy maintained normal colon functions even 13&#x02005;years
after treatment<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Rebecca et al. treated
chronic constipation patients with orthopedic manual therapy six times over a four-week
period and reported statistically significant declines in colon transit time<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of the MOMTG in the present
study are in agreemen with those of other previous studies. Therefore, the present study may
have proven that Maitland orthopedic manual therapy results in a cutaneovisceral reflex from
a clinical point of view and that it is likely to suppress the hypersensitivity of
sympathetic nerves, effectively improve intestinal motility, and normalize bowel movements.
In this regard, it was reported that orthopedic manual therapy can restore the body to a
healthy condition by facilitating the activities of the automatic nervous system in internal
organs and by keeping a balance between the voluntary and involuntary muscles<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>While the DFG showed statistically significant declines in rectosigmoid colon transit time
and total colon transit time after the intervention (p&#x0003c;0.05), it did not show
statistically significant changes in left colon transit time or right colon transit
time.</p><p>Kim et al. researched the effects on constipation of four weeks of intake of the dietary
fiber found in black mushrooms. They observed statistically significant improvements in the
form of excrement and statistically significant declines in colon transit time<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cummings et al. reported that the colon
transit time decreased from 2.4 days to 1.6 days after intake of dietary fiber and noted
that intake of dietary fiber increased intestinal motility in constipation patients<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. M&#x000fc;ller-Lissner performed a meta-analysis
on 20 studies and reported that bran, a dietary fiber, reduced the oral-colon transit time
in constipation patients<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>These results correspond to those of previous studies. Therefore, the amount of intake of
dietary fiber is likely associated with colon transit time. The mechanism by which dietary
fiber affects colon transit time is as follows. Dietary fiber includes vegetable components
that are not digested through enzymes secreted by the gastrointestinal tract in the human
body<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. It increases water content,
stimulates the proliferation of bacteria within the intestinal canal, and increases the
formation of gas within the colon, thereby enlarging the volume of the colon<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. This leads to the fermentation of bacteria within the colon, thereby
producing acids, and it reduces the acidity within the colon along with osmotic effects,
thereby facilitating peristalsis<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, dietary fiber may be suitable for the prevention and treatment of constipation
and can be used as a primary intervention.</p><p>In terms of group differences in the results of the colon transit time test according to
the interventions, the MOMTG showed statistically significantly larger declines in
rectosigmoid colon transit time and total colon transit time than the DFG. This result may
suggest that Maitland orthopedic manual therapy could become a more effective intervention
than dietary fiber in improving intestinal motility, in normalizing the discharge of
excrement in bowel movements, and in improving colon transit time.</p><p>This study confirmed that Maitland orthopedic manual therapy can be an effective treatment
method for an internal condition such as functional constipation, as it not only improves
the symptom of constipation but also normalizes the colon transit time by facilitating
intestinal movements. At present, only a limited number of studies are based on
physiotherapeutic approaches to internal diseases. Therefore, future studies should further
segment the spinal segments that affect the intestinal canal and use various
physiotherapeutic interventions. In addition, they should observe whether the effects on
clinical symptoms, such as colon transit time, can be continuously maintained after a
physiotherapeutic intervention. If follow-up studies can apply not only the colon transit
time test but also various physiological tests on movements in the colon, anus, and rectum
that can help identify functional constipation and if these studies can thereby perform
comprehensive comparisons of the results of the tests, this new approach could be
established as a clinically practical physical therapy method in internal medicine.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Pare</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferrazzi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>WG</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>An epidemiological survey of constipation in canada:
