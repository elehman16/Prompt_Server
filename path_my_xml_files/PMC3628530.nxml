Oral contraceptives may provide a reasonable delivery vehicle for folate supplementation before conception in women of childbearing potential. This study aimed to demonstrate that a fixed-dose combination of an oral contraceptive and levomefolate calcium leads to sustainable improvements in folate status compared with an oral contraceptive + folic acid.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study in which 172 healthy women aged 18&#x02013;40 years received ethinylestradiol (EE)-drospirenone-levomefolate calcium or EE-drospirenone + folic acid for 24 weeks (invasion phase), and EE-drospirenone for an additional 20 weeks (folate elimination phase). The main objective of the invasion phase was to examine the area under the folate concentration time-curve for plasma and red blood cell (RBC) folate, while the main objective of the elimination phase was to determine the duration of time for which RBC folate concentration remained &#x02265; 906 nmol/L after cessation of EE-drospirenone-levomefolate calcium.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean concentration-time curves for plasma folate, RBC folate, and homocysteine were comparable between treatment groups during both study phases. During the invasion phase, plasma and RBC folate concentrations increased and approached steady-state after about 8 weeks (plasma) or 24 weeks (RBC). After cessation of treatment with levomefolate calcium, folate concentrations decreased slowly. The median time to RBC folate concentrations falling below 906 nmol/L was 10 weeks (95% confidence interval 8&#x02013;12 weeks) after cessation of EE-drospirenone-levomefolate calcium treatment. Plasma and RBC folate levels remained above baseline values in 41.3% and 89.3% of women, respectively, at the end of the 20-week elimination phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Improvements in folate status were comparable between EE-drospirenone-levomefolate calcium and EE-drospirenone + folic acid.

Folates are essential for DNA and protein synthesis and, hence, cell division. Low folate levels are known to be linked to neural tube defects.</p><p>Neural tube defects are a complex group of congenital malformations that occur as a result of incomplete or incorrect closure of the neural tube (eg, anencephaly and spina bifida) during the early stages of pregnancy, often before a woman knows she is pregnant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijwh-5-149">1</xref> While the etiology of neural tube defects remains poorly understood, the Medical Vitamin Research Council study published in 1991<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijwh-5-149">2</xref> provided supportive evidence that an increased folate status is associated with reduced risk of neural tube defects, and in 1995 a quantitative relationship between reduction in risk of neural tube defects and red blood cell (RBC) folate levels was established by Daly et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijwh-5-149">3</xref> An RBC folate concentration &#x02265; 906 nmol/L was shown to be associated with a very low risk of neural tube defects (0.8 per 1000 births).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijwh-5-149">3</xref></p><p>A number of initiatives have been undertaken to improve folate status among women of childbearing potential,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijwh-5-149">4</xref> including educational campaigns, food fortification programs, and policies to encourage folic acid supplementation during the periconceptional period (ie, both before and during the initial weeks of pregnancy). Current recommendations in the US and Europe specify that all women planning or capable of pregnancy should take folic acid supplements at doses of 0.400 mg/day (0.400&#x02013;0.800 mg/day in the US), commencing at least one month before conception.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijwh-5-149">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijwh-5-149">6</xref> Indeed, there is now a large body of evidence to suggest that the occurrence or recurrence of neural tube defects can be dramatically reduced if women use folate supplements both before and during the initial weeks of pregnancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijwh-5-149">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijwh-5-149">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijwh-5-149">17</xref></p><p>However, initiatives to improve folate status among women of childbearing potential have, to date, had unsatisfying results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijwh-5-149">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijwh-5-149">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijwh-5-149">19</xref> Four studies that assessed the effects of periconceptional folic acid usage before and after the introduction of public folic acid awareness campaigns in the UK, The Netherlands, and Australia showed post-campaign rates of folic acid use did not exceed 50%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijwh-5-149">19</xref> In the US, data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey showed that only 24% of nonpregnant women of childbearing potential were consuming the recommended intake of folate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijwh-5-149">20</xref> Thus, despite the knowledge that adequate folate status during the periconceptional period is associated with a reduced risk of neural tube defects, a gap remains in translating this knowledge into practical solutions that are effective in real-life situations, so additional efforts are needed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijwh-5-149">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijwh-5-149">21</xref></p><p>Oral contraceptives have been recommended as a reasonable delivery vehicle for folate supplementation in women of childbearing age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijwh-5-149">22</xref> Two oral contraceptives, one containing ethinylestradiol (EE) 0.020 mg&#x02013;drospirenone 3 mg&#x02013;levomefolate calcium 0.451 mg and one containing EE 0.030 mg&#x02013;drospirenone 3 mg&#x02013;levomefolate calcium 0.451 mg, were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2010 for the improvement of folate status in women who desire contraception.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ijwh-5-149">23</xref> Levomefolate calcium (Metafolin&#x000ae;, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), the calcium salt of L-5-methyl-THF (the predominant form of dietary folate and the principal form of circulating folate in the body), offers an alternative to folic acid for the improvement of folate status.

Two-sided 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the test (EE-drospirenone-levomefolate calcium) to reference (EE-drospirenone + folic acid) geometric mean ratio of the AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;24 weeks)</sub> were calculated for plasma and RBC folate exposure to assess whether they were contained within the limits for bioequivalence (range 80%&#x02013;125%). Plasma and RBC folate AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;24 weeks)</sub> values, uncorrected or corrected for baseline folate concentrations, were analyzed with inferential statistical methods using the per protocol set, which consisted of all treated women who did not present any major protocol deviations.</p><p>Other variables assessed during the invasion phase included change in homocysteine levels between baseline and 24 weeks, and plasma folate metabolite patterns at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks.

The duration that RBC folate concentrations were &#x02265; 906 nmol/L was calculated using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimator including the two-sided 95% CI for the median time taken for RBC folate concentration to fall below 906 nmol/L. These analyses were undertaken using the per protocol set.</p><p>Secondary variables in the elimination phase were assessed in both treatment groups using descriptive statistics and included: mean concentrations, mean changes from baseline, and mean changes from the end of the folate invasion phase (week 24) for plasma folate, RBC folate, and homocysteine at biweekly time points during the elimination phase (weeks 26&#x02013;44), the proportion of women with RBC and plasma folate levels below their median baseline (prefolate treatment) level, and the proportion of women with homocysteine levels above their median baseline (prefolate treatment) level at biweekly time points from weeks 26&#x02013;44.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Taking into account the special design as a long-term bioequivalence study, scheduling a high number of visits with blood testing over 24 weeks (the period on which the sample size calculation was based), it was expected that the dropout rate in this study would be higher than that observed in other contraceptive studies. Assuming that 37% of participants would not be included in the per protocol set and that the true ratio of test-to-reference AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;24 weeks)</sub> was 110%, then enrolment of 86 women per treatment group (172 women overall) was required to achieve bioequivalence (limits of 80%&#x02013;125%) with 90% power. Based on additional analyses of previously published data,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijwh-5-149">24</xref> a precision of 0.24 standard deviations of difference on the log-scale was assumed. Although the determination of sample size was based on plasma folate, no adjustment of sample size after inclusion of RBC folate as the primary endpoint was considered necessary because both primary endpoints were expected to be highly correlated.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Overall, 235 women were screened, of whom 172 (EE-drospirenone-levomefolate calcium, n = 86; EE-drospirenone + folic acid, n = 86) were randomized to treatment. Of the 63 women who were excluded, 46 did not meet the inclusion criteria (three due to low vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels; none of the women were excluded due to low RBC folate levels), eight withdrew consent, eight were excluded for logistical reasons (ie, the study dates conflicted with planned holidays; these patients were classified as screening failures), and one was excluded because blood sampling was not possible.

This supports the concept that oral contraceptives represent a reasonable delivery vehicle for folate supplementation prior to pregnancy. Our results may be generalizable to other oral contraceptives, provided absence of interaction can be proven for the active components. The elimination phase of this study shows that 20 weeks after cessation of folate intake, an improved folate status is maintained in a large proportion of women.</p><p>Findings from the invasion phase, which are based on established surrogate parameters of folate status (plasma folate, RBC folate, and homocysteine), are consistent with two previous studies investigating the effects of levomefolate calcium and folic acid on folate levels in women of childbearing age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijwh-5-149">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ijwh-5-149">27</xref> Data from a similarly designed study show that levomefolate calcium 0.451 mg/day (equimolar to 0.416 mg L-5-methyl-THF) and folic acid 0.400 mg/day increased plasma folate concentrations to a comparable extent after 24 weeks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ijwh-5-149">25</xref> This randomized, controlled study involving 144 women of childbearing age found that administration of levomefolate calcium 0.451 mg/day was more effective than folic acid 0.400 mg/day at improving folate status.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijwh-5-149">24</xref> In addition, as outlined above, the advantages of levomefolate calcium over folic acid are described in the literature.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ijwh-5-149">28</xref></p><p>Results from the elimination phase of this study are consistent with earlier, exploratory studies examining the change in folate status following cessation of folate supplementation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ijwh-5-149">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ijwh-5-149">34</xref> Hao et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijwh-5-149">33</xref> examined the effect of 6 months of supplementation with oral folic acid (dose range 0.1&#x02013;4 mg/day) in 1108 Chinese women.

Using bioequivalence criteria for comparisons, exposure was shown to be similar between the treatment groups for the plasma folate baseline-uncorrected and baseline-corrected values and for RBC folate baseline-uncorrected values.</p><p>Based on single-dose data with EE-drospirenone-levomefolate calcium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ijwh-5-149">35</xref> and levomefolate calcium and folic acid,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ijwh-5-149">36</xref> accumulation of plasma folate as observed in the current study would not be predicted after daily dosing because folate levels returned to baseline within a 24-hour dosing interval. Thus, the observed increase in plasma folate suggests a dynamic equilibrium between tissue and plasma, in which tissue folate stores build up over time with treatment. As tissue folate levels increase, the distribution of folate into plasma changes, which leads to increased plasma concentrations. After cessation of daily folate intake, plasma folate levels decline gradually and much more slowly than after single oral folate administration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ijwh-5-149">36</xref> This slow decrease is attributed in part to a re-equilibration between plasma and tissue, indicating a slow release of folate from tissue stores into the plasma. Although plasma folate concentrations during the elimination phase were mainly determined by distribution and elimination processes, RBC folate concentrations followed a different time course, indicating a different underlying mechanism. Indeed, in the present study, RBC folate levels were maintained at &#x02265; 906 nmol/L for a further 10 weeks (ie, week 34 of the study) in 50% of the subjects after discontinuation of EE-drospirenone-levomefolate calcium. When the proportion of patients with folate levels above baseline was examined, RBC folate levels were maintained above baseline for 20 weeks (ie, five cycles) after cessation of EE-drospirenone-levomefolate calcium in 89.3% of women.</p><p>Following oral administration, folic acid is absorbed in the proximal small intestine, metabolized during passage across the intestinal mucosa and into the liver and enters the peripheral circulation as L-5-methyl-THF. Orally administered L-5-methyl-THF enters the systemic circulation as such. Therefore, any difference between folic acid and L-5-methyl-THF is expected to disappear as soon as folates enter the systemic circulation and enter the subsequent steps of metabolism. Based on this knowledge, oral administration of folic acid or L-5-methyl-THF would be expected to result in similar folate metabolite patterns in plasma. In the current study, all folate metabolites showed a qualitatively similar pattern between EE-drospirenone-levomefolate calcium and EE-drospirenone + folic acid at all time points throughout the invasion phase.</p><p>Elevated homocysteine concentrations have been shown to be a risk factor for low birth weight, premature delivery, pre-eclampsia, and neural tube defects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ijwh-5-149">37</xref> Previous studies have shown that levomefolate calcium is as effective as an equimolar dose of folic acid at lowering homocysteine concentrations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ijwh-5-149">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijwh-5-149">26</xref> In agreement, the homocysteine-lowering effects of EE-drospirenone-levomefolate calcium and EE-drospirenone + folic acid were similar throughout the course of the invasion phase in this study.</p><p>In terms of timing of folate intake, this and several other studies have shown that it takes months to achieve steady-state plasma and RBC folate concentrations. The time point at which plasma folate levels reach a plateau seems to depend on baseline folate levels and sampling intervals, but the data suggest that a minimum of 8 weeks of treatment is needed in order to achieve steady-state concentrations. In a randomized controlled trial in a US population (in which baseline folate levels are higher due to mandatory food fortification), plasma folate levels reached a plateau after 8 weeks of treatment with EE 0.02 mg &#x02013; drospirenone 3 mg &#x02013; levomefolate calcium 0.451 mg.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ijwh-5-149">38</xref> In other populations without mandatory food folate fortification, plasma folate levels reached a plateau after 12 weeks of treatment with folic acid or levomefolate calcium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijwh-5-149">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijwh-5-149">33</xref> Data on RBC folate levels indicate that a plateau is approached, but not completely reached, after 24 weeks of regular intake of folate supplements in populations without mandatory food folate fortification,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijwh-5-149">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijwh-5-149">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ijwh-5-149">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-ijwh-5-149">40</xref> a finding that is corroborated by the current study. Fetal neural tube defects occur early in pregnancy, within 28 days of conception,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijwh-5-149">1</xref> and the neural tube defect risk is directly linked to maternal folate status in the periconceptional period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijwh-5-149">3</xref> Therefore, in order for a woman to maximize the reduction in neural tube defect risk, continuous folate intake needs to start well in advance of conception. Indeed, based on the results of long-term folate studies, Lamers et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijwh-5-149">24</xref> recommended extending the period of periconceptional folic acid supplementation from 4 weeks to &#x02265; 12 weeks to achieve maximal risk reduction. The results of the current study support this recommendation.</p><p>The addition of folate to an oral contraceptive represents a valuable means of boosting folate levels in women of reproductive age who unintentionally conceive during use of oral contraception or cease use of oral contraceptives in order to become pregnant. A prospective, post-marketing, noninterventional cohort study of new oral contraceptive users in clinical practice across seven European countries showed that of those who discontinue use of oral contraception to become pregnant, over one-fifth did so within one cycle after cessation of oral contraceptives and almost 50% after three cycles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ijwh-5-149">41</xref> The oral contraceptive plus folate combination represents a targeted approach to improve folate status specifically in women of childbearing potential.</p><p>During the elimination phase, a substantial proportion of women maintained folate levels that were higher than those at baseline, thus contributing to the reduction in neural tube defect risk. However, it is important that women who stop using a folate-containing oral contraceptive with the intention of becoming pregnant continue to receive adequate doses of folate. Indeed, the prescription of a folate-fortified oral contraceptive provides health care professionals with an opportunity to counsel women about the immediate need for adequate prenatal care following cessation of oral contraception.</p><p>All treatments were well tolerated, with no relevant differences observed between the groups. No serious adverse events were considered to be treatment-related and the tolerability profiles of EE-drospirenone-levomefolate calcium and EE-drospirenone + folic acid during the invasion phase were consistent with those of other oral contraceptives.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ijwh-5-149">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-ijwh-5-149">44</xref> Overall, these results confirm that addition of folate to an oral contraceptive does not give rise to additional safety concerns.</p><p>In summary, treatment with EE-drospirenone-levomefolate calcium for 24 weeks resulted in similar rates of increase and, following cessation of treatment, in similar rates of decrease in plasma and RBC folate levels compared with treatment using EE-drospirenone + folic acid. The effect on plasma homocysteine levels was also comparable between the two treatments. In a substantial proportion of women, folate levels remained above those at baseline for five oral contraceptive treatment cycles following cessation of 24 weeks of daily treatment with EE-drospirenone-levomefolate calcium. The risk of a neural tube defect-affected pregnancy would be reduced in women with improved folate status compared with their risk prior to the start of folate treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Funding for this study was provided by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of EE 0.030 mg&#x02013;drospirenone 3 mg (Yasmin&#x000ae;) and EE-drospirenone-levomefolate calcium.
