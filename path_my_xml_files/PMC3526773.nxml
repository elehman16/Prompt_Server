The present study explores the relationship between competence and outcome in cognitive therapy (CT) for social anxiety disorder, using hierarchical linear modeling analyses (HLM). Data were drawn from a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Five trained raters evaluated videotapes of two therapy sessions per patient using the Cognitive Therapy Competence Scale for Social Phobia (CTCS-SP). Overall adherence to the treatment manual and patient difficulty were also assessed. Patient outcome was rated by other assessors using the Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I) and the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). Results indicated that competence significantly predicted patient outcome on the CGI-I (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.79) and LSAS (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.59). Patient difficulty and adherence did not further improve prediction. The findings support the view that competence influences outcome and should be a focus of training programs. Further research is needed to compare different ways of assessing competence and to understand the complex relationships between competence and other therapy factors that are likely to influence outcome.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Highlights</title><p>&#x025ba; We studied for the first time the effect of therapy competence on outcome in CBT for social anxiety disorder. &#x025ba; A treatment specific therapy competence scale showed high inter-rater reliability. &#x025ba; Competence predicted outcome, even when controlling for adherence and patient difficulty. &#x025ba; Achieving high levels of competence should be a target of therapist training courses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Treatment competence</kwd><kwd>Treatment integrity</kwd><kwd>Social anxiety disorder</kwd><kwd>Cognitive therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The strong evidence base for cognitive behavior therapies (see <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Nathan &#x00026; Gorman, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Roth &#x00026; Fonagy, 2004</xref>) has led to their inclusion in treatment guidelines issued by professional groups (such as American Psychological Association Division 12: <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chambless &#x00026; Ollendick, 2001</xref>; German Psychological Association: <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Heinrichs, Stangier, Gerlach, Willutzki, &#x00026; Fydrich, 2010</xref>) and national bodies (such as the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nice.org">www.nice.org</ext-link>). Building on these guidelines, several countries are developing large-scale dissemination programs that aim to greatly increase the public availability of CBT and many other countries are considering doing so (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Berge, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Clark, 2011</xref>). If these dissemination programs are to be a success, it will be necessary for researchers to specify the key CBT skills that need to be taught and to develop measures to assess whether the skills have been acquired. <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Roth and Pilling (2008)</xref> have published the key competencies required for a range of effective CBTs for depression and various anxiety disorders. Less progress has been made in developing measures to determine whether a trainee has successfully acquired these competencies.</p><p>The most common way of assessing competence is by rating videotapes of therapy sessions. <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Webb, Derubeis, and Barber (2010)</xref> recently reported a meta-analytic review of 17 studies that related competence to outcome. A significant relationship was observed for the treatment of depression, but not other clinical conditions. In addition, no studies of CBT for anxiety disorders were identified. A likely reason for the more positive results in depression is that the most commonly used measure was the Cognitive Therapy Scale (CTS: <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Young &#x00026; Beck, 1980</xref>), which was originally developed for the NIMH Collaborative Depression trial (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Elkin et&#x000a0;al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>The present study focuses, for the first time, on the relationship between competence and outcome in a CBT for anxiety. The treatment chosen for investigation is cognitive therapy (CT) for social anxiety disorder, based on <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Clark and Wells' (1995)</xref> model. Randomized controlled trials have established that CT is an effective intervention that compares favorably to exposure therapy (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Clark, Ehlers, et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>), interpersonal psychotherapy (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Stangier, Schramm, Heidenreich, Berger, &#x00026; Clark, 2011</xref>) two types of group CBT (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000f6;rtberg, Clark, Sundin, &#x00026; Aberg, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Stangier, Heidenreich, Peitz, Lauterbach, &#x00026; Clark, 2003</xref>), SSRIs (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Clark et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>) and medication-based treatment as usual (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000f6;rtberg et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Experimental studies (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">McManus et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>) have provided further support for the view that part of CT's effectiveness is likely to be due to procedures that are treatment specific. The competence measure was the Cognitive Therapy Competence Scale for Social Phobia (CTCS-SP; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Clark, Von Consbruch, Hinrichs, &#x00026; Stangier, 2006</xref>), which is a modified version of the CTS in which many original items were reworded and new items were introduced in order to assess the specific competencies required in this treatment approach. As patient difficulty and adherence to a treatment protocol may also determine outcome, each of these were also assessed.

The treatment comprised the following interventions: 1) establishing a personal model using patient's beliefs, images, safety behaviors, focus of attention, and symptoms; 2) role-play based behavioral experiments to demonstrate the adverse effects of self-focused attention and safety behaviors; 3) practicing externally focused attention in social and nonsocial situations; 4) restructuring distorted self-imagery using video feedback and other methods; 5) conducting surveys to gather information to challenge dysfunctional beliefs; and 6) behavioral experiments to test negative beliefs in anxiety-provoking social situations while dropping safety behaviors and recreating feared outcomes (e.g sweating, blushing, displaying ignorance, etc).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 38 patients (20 male) were assigned to CT.

Including an indirect path between competence and outcome via patient difficulty reduced the model goodness of fit, suggesting that the strong link between competence and outcome was not due to patient difficulty influencing both (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>Exploratory item analysis of the CTCS-SP</title><p>A further analysis was conducted to determine whether a subset of items on the competence scale were particularly important as predictors of outcome. Correlations were computed between the 16 individual competence items and the CGI, with significance levels adjusted for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni correction). <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> shows the results.</p><p>Of the 6 individual competence items that significantly predict outcome, four are specific to the CT for social anxiety disorder competence scale (e.g. &#x0201c;focus on social-phobia-related cognitions, self-focused attention and imagery&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;selection of appropriate strategies for change in social-phobia-related cognition and maintaining factors&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;appropriate implementation of techniques for change in social-phobia-related cognition and maintaining factors&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;resource activation&#x0201d;), and two (&#x0201c;interpersonal effectiveness&#x0201d; &#x00026; &#x0201c;pacing and efficient use of time&#x0201d;) are more general CT items whose phrasing was modified to take into account the typical presentation of patients with social anxiety disorder and the emphasis of the treatment on behavioral experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Several studies have demonstrated significant, but modest, correlations between competence and outcome in CBT for depression (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Webb et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). As far as we are aware, this is the first study to demonstrate such a relationship within a CBT for an anxiety disorder. A strong relationship was observed between competence as assessed by the CTCS-SP and outcome in CT for social anxiety disorder, with 48% of the variance in the primary outcome measure (CGI-I) being explained.</p><p>Our study has several methodological strengths. Outcome and competence were assessed by different raters, with the assessors of outcome also being blind to whether the patient had received treatment. Two sessions per patient, taken from different phases of treatment, were assessed for competence, a manual for rating competence was developed, raters completed a formal training programme based on the manual and practiced rating a substantial number of tapes before the study commenced. This training is likely to have contributed to the good inter-rater reliabilities that were obtained with the CTCS-SP.</p><p>The CTCS-SP is a modified version of <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Young and Beck's (1980)</xref> cognitive therapy scale (CTS). Many items were re-written to take into account the challenges of treating patients with social phobia (e.g., social withdrawal and use of safety behaviors in sessions) and the specialized procedures that are used (videofeedback, attention training, distinctive behavioral experiments, etc). It may be that the CTCS-SP was successful at predicting outcome because of it's specific focus on CT for social anxiety disorder. The item-by-item analysis would appear to be consistent with this view, as is the evidence (see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">Introduction</xref>) that at least part of the effectiveness of CT is likely to be attributable to procedures that are a distinctive feature of the treatment. However, a formal comparison between the CTCS-SP and the more general CTS (or CTS-R) is required in order to assess the relative predictive power of specific versus more general measures of CBT competence.</p><p>Although ratings of actual therapy sessions are the most common method for assessing competence, some training courses and research groups use standardized role-plays. Future research could usefully focus on their comparative utility. One might argue that tape ratings are a more direct assessment of what a therapist actually does with a client. However, role-plays have the potential advantage that situations are standardized, so the trainer can ensure key features of therapy are always sampled and patient characteristics are controlled. With ratings of actual sessions it is always possible that some therapists may appear more competent because they are treating more compliant patients, who are in turn generally more likely to have a better outcome. The fact that ratings of patient difficulty did not predict outcome suggests this was not a major complication in the present study. However, we accept that there may have been some other patient characteristic that we did not measure that partly mediated the relationship between competence ratings and outcome.</p><p>Competence presupposes a reasonably high level of adherence in the sense that one cannot be judged to have implemented a treatment well if the procedures specified in the manual were not used. Given this point, one might expect a relationship between adherence and outcome. However, in our HLM analyses adherence was not a significant predictor. As is common in randomized controlled trials, adherence was good and showed little variability (see <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Waller, 2009</xref>). This may partly explain the negative finding. In routine clinical settings adherence is likely to be more variable and hence may play a larger role in predicting outcome. In the present study, patient difficulty was not itself a significant predictor of outcome, perhaps because variability was low. However, this will not always be the case (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Foley, O'Malley, Rounsaville, Prusoff, &#x00026; Weissman, 1987</xref>).</p><p>The association between competence and outcome was somewhat higher for the primary outcome measure CGI-I (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.79), than for the LSASres (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.59). The CGI covers both the formal symptoms of social anxiety disorder and the impact that the disorder has on the individual's life in general, whereas the LSAS only assesses situational fear and avoidance. The broader focus of the CGI-I is probably closer to the focus of therapy and it could be argued that it is more appropriate as a dependent variable when assessing whether competence predicts patient outcomes.</p><p>An important practical implication of our findings is that it would be helpful to use competence ratings as part of the assessment of a therapist's progress and benefit from CBT training programs for social anxiety disorder. In order to disseminate evidence-based psychological treatments (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Clark et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">McHugh &#x00026; Barlow, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Shafran et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>), psychotherapists need to be trained to deliver treatments competently. Our findings would seem to support the importance of training therapists to deliver the treatment specific procedures in a competent manner.</p><p>The rigorous requirements of a research investigation into the relationship between competence and outcome do not necessarily apply to the use of competency ratings to facilitate routine training programs or clinical practice. For example, although it was useful for our study to have each tape independently rated by two assessors, this is unlikely to be needed for training courses once a reasonable level of agreement between assessors in the team has been established. The assessment of competence on the basis of specific segments rather than the whole videotaped session (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Weck, Bohn, Ginzburg, &#x00026; Stangier, 2011</xref>) could also be explored as an alternative to address time and cost issues. Finally, informal use of the cognitive therapy rating scale by students themselves is likely to be helpful. Certainly, we have found that many therapists who are learning CT for social anxiety learn a great deal about how particular procedures should be implemented by studying the particular items on the CTCS-SP and rating their own sessions according to the scale.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Limitations</title><p>The study has several limitations. First, we did not control for a number of other therapy factors that might also have influenced outcome, such as empathy, warmth and positive regard of the therapist (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Keijsers, Schaap, &#x00026; Hoogduin, 2000</xref>), therapeutic alliance and patient motivation (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Huppert, Barlow, Gorman, Shear, &#x00026; Woods, 2006</xref>). These confounds are an inherent limitation of observational data and should, ideally, be either controlled for, or investigated as mediators/moderators in future studies (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Castonguay, Goldfried, Wiser, Raue, &#x00026; Hayes, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Feeley, DeRubeis, &#x00026; Gelfand, 1999</xref>). Second, our sample size of 34 patients treated by 10 therapists is modest. Replication with a larger overall sample and more patients per therapist would be desirable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None reported.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Funding</title><p>This research was supported by grants STA 512/2-1/2 from the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) (Dr Stangier) and 069777 from the Wellcome Trust and by the National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at the South London and Maudsley Health Service Foundation Trust and Kings College London (Dr Clark).</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Berge, T.
