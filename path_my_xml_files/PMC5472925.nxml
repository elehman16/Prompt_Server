Standardized in the current randomized controlled trial, the intensity of Brief Admission Sk&#x000e5;ne is implemented in durations of three days, with a maximum frequency of three times a month. Brief Admission is integrated into existing treatment plans in advance of crises to prevent reliance on general psychiatric admissions for risk management, as these may be lengthy, unstructured, and of uncertain therapeutic value.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The overall objective of the Brief Admission Sk&#x000e5;ne randomized controlled trial is to determine if Brief Admission can replace general psychiatric admission for self-harming and suicidal individuals with complex mental illness at times of escalating risk. Other objectives of the study are to evaluate whether Brief Admission increases daily functioning and enhances coping, reduces psychiatric symptoms including frequency and severity of self-harm and suicidal behaviours. A final objective is to determine if Brief Admission is an effective crisis management model for this population. Participants are randomized at an individual level to either Brief Admission Sk&#x000e5;ne plus Treatment as Usual or Treatment As Usual. Based on a priori power analyses, <italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;124 participants will be recruited to the study. Data collection is in progress, and will continue until June 2018.

This creates stigma regarding self-harm, about which individuals with lived experience are often well aware. Similar experiences with respect to stigma have been reported by people diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]). General psychiatric admission (GPA) is of uncertain therapeutic value amongst self-harming and suicidal individuals, and potentially harmful if lengthy and unstructured for those with BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Specialized evidence-based services developed for these individuals at times they cannot keep themselves safe is often needed, but more often lacking. These services are particularly necessary in situations of unique vulnerability, such as suicidal crises. When suicide and severe self-harm are acute risks it is essential that services are offered in a compassionate manner that honours the human dignity of the person who is suffering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>A report commissioned by Sweden&#x02019;s National Self-harm Project examined the prevalence of self-harm among individuals receiving mental health services across 84 psychiatric settings from 15 cities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The sample was comprised of participants aged 12&#x000a0;years and older. Results indicated that almost half of the participants currently receiving mental health services had self-harmed during the past 6&#x000a0;months, with one in six adults self-harming five or more times the last 6&#x000a0;months. Three out of four young women between the ages of 12 and 18 reported self-harming over the same time period. Of those who had engaged in self-harming behaviour, more than half had attempted suicide at least once during their lifetime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For a sub-group of individuals, often with BPD, self-harming behaviours are frequent and risk for suicide is recurrent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Over the last 20&#x000a0;years several psychotherapeutic interventions have evolved for the treatment of individuals with self-harm as well as BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, during crises and associated increases in self-harm and suicidal ideation, recommendations for clinical care are still conflicting. For individuals with imminent suicidal ideation, without recurrent self-harm, the routine practice is to offer psychiatric admission to an inpatient unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. For individuals with recurrent suicidal ideation and self-harm, often diagnosed with BPD, the risk for iatrogenic effects may be considerable. Lengthy hospital admissions without a clear treatment structure are associated with clinical and functional decompensation amongst this group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Consequentially there is a clinical practice of avoiding inpatient admission of individuals with these presenting features. The absence of consensus amongst crisis management recommendations is a regular burden requiring strategic planning at junctures that would be better suited to the provision of seamless clinical care. Ideally, the situation would not require having to re-negotiate the entire process (to admit or not admit) on behalf of every acutely suicidal individual when they themselves feel out of control.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>What is BA?</title><p>The nature of the BA admission is goal-driven structured respite. A BA admission is not a stand-alone clinical intervention, nor is it unstructured rest. Rather, BA serves as a method of providing structured support to address the stress that is generating self-harming or suicidal escalation. The conditions, parameters and goals for adding BA to a treatment plan are negotiated with the individual and their care providers in advance of crises, effectively &#x0201c;striking while the iron is cold.&#x0201d; The aim in doing so is to support the individual&#x02019;s autonomy in creating and maintaining control over their health care and their situation more generally, and to avoid power-struggles and decompensation when it is time to leave the BA. The negotiation process results in a contract describing how BA should be implemented for the individual based on their individual needs and preferences.</p><p>Over repeated experiences of BA, the structure and stabilizing aspects of BA generalizes to the individuals&#x02019; life outside of the hospital, leading to reduced reliance on acute and general psychiatric hospital admissions while remaining safe in times of crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. By learning new ways of responding/not responding during crises, and staying safe regardless of current emotion, gains from psychotherapy engaged in concurrently with BA (treatment as usual: TAU) facilitates capability to manage subsequent crises without turning to self-harm and suicidal behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For individuals with BPD, BA can be offered concurrently with treatments such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) or Mentalization-Based Therapy (MBT). In fact, adding BA to an existing treatment plan may enable those with BPD to remain in specialized evidence-based treatments delivered on an outpatient basis. Careful consideration, planning and support are part of developing the BA contract so that those participating are helped to continue to engage in important activities outside the hospital <italic>during</italic> BA. An example is continuing to attend DBT skills training groups during BA if the individual is already committed to that treatment on an outpatient basis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Brief Admission in the Netherlands</title><p>In the Netherlands, BA was initially developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] to manage the vulnerability of some individuals with complex mental illness towards frequent crises including escalation of suicidality. The purpose of BA was crisis management in general, and avoidance of lengthy inpatient admissions in particular. As a crisis management strategy, BA was rapidly adopted across most mental health service centers in the Netherlands. Helleman, Goossens, Kaasenbrood, and van Achterberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] conducted a phenomenological study involving 17 participants with lived experience of BA in the Netherlands. With respect to the key features of BA that were identified, participants endorsed: (i) the organization of the brief admission; (ii) the quality of the contact with a nurse over the course of BA; (iii) the restorative value of time out from daily life; and (iv) the experienced value of the intervention. Participants described appreciating how BA prevented the onset and escalation of self-harm and suicide attempts at times of high stress and distress. The nature of self-admission to BA was described as key to providing support at the exact time needed by participants. A key feature of BA is participant control over when the BA occurs, as well as its duration within the confines of short parameters, such as days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Twenty years after its inception in the Netherlands, the Dutch Multidisciplinary Guidelines for Personality Disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] recommended BA as a crisis management strategy for individuals with a BPD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Review of research on brief admission for crisis management of self-harming, suicidal, and borderline individuals</title><p>The majority of the literature on Brief Admission (BA) is concerned with short-term hospitalization of individuals in the acute stages of mental health crises related to substance and alcohol use disorders, psychosis or neurological events and the inpatient management of their sequelae. Aside from the Dutch literature summarized above, only two publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] were identified as related to brief admission for self-harming, suicidal, and borderline individuals. These contributions to the literature and their similarities and differences to Brief Admission Sk&#x000e5;ne (BAS) are summarized as follows.</p><p>Siefert&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] Goal-Oriented Limited-Duration BPD Inpatient Treatment (GOLDBIT) is similar to BAS in that both are time-limited adjunctive initiatives rather than stand-alone therapeutic interventions/clinical therapies. Rather, GOLDBIT and BAS are intended to support longer-term outpatient clinical interventions, such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) or Mentalization-Based Therapy (MBT). A planned short inpatient stay to regain structure and return to ongoing outpatient therapy is viewed by both Siefert [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and our group as more desirable than losing membership in specialized longer-term outpatient therapy due to unplanned prolonged emergency psychiatric admission. Like BAS, in GOLDBIT an assessment of feasibility is conducted prior to determining whether it is an appropriate add-on to existing care. Also similar to BAS, GOLDBIT has &#x0201c;meta-goals,&#x0201d; such as articulating expectations, creating structure, and engagement with staff and life on the unit, with an aim of generalizing the of benefits of GOLDBIT to life outside of the admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Finally, both BAS and GOLDBIT have clear, pre-determined discharge dates, planned in advance to avoid power-struggles and decompensation at termination. A short admission in GOLDBIT is longer in duration than BAS (10&#x000a0;days compared to 3&#x000a0;days in BAS). A difference between GOLDBIT and BAS is that BAS is available for all self-harming and suicidal individuals, not those specifically diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) as in GOLDBIT.</p><p>The second publication relevant to BAS focused on the management of BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which is in alignment with the views and purpose of BAS except the broader inclusion of self-harming individuals into BAS both with and without BPD diagnoses. These authors noted that specialized, evidence-based treatments for BPD are preferable to lengthy or unstructured hospital stays or general treatment as usual. Where emergency admissions are involved to de-escalate suicidality, their recommendations were to keep admissions as short as possible, to reduce loss of stabilizing aspects of life such as employment, social contacts, and housing. Biskin and Paris also noted iatrogenic effects of lengthy and unstructured inpatient admissions as risk-factors for BPD individuals. There was no mention of the role of standardized brief admission, possibly because the place of publication was Canada, where brief admission is not a current feature of the mental health system. Nevertheless, theirs is an important paper both in acknowledging expert opinion that BPD be treated primarily on an outpatient basis<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> (with the exception of specialized residential treatments, such as those pioneered by Bohus et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]). As well, they generated recommendations for admissions that are consistent with BAS, specifically that admissions be: 1. Brief in nature; 2. Not intended to replace psychotherapy; 3. Used to manage suicidal crisis in the short term, and 4. Ideally a component of the best treatment for this population, which is specialized, evidence-based psychotherapy delivered on an outpatient basis with the exception of aforementioned specialized residential treatments. All of these features are consistent with BAS.</p><p>Brief Admission (BA) is a crisis management strategy that enables individuals to admit themselves to hospital without prior physician consultation at times when there is risk for increasing self-harm, escalating suicidality, and when efforts to stay safe are failing. The person seeking BA can decide for themselves when they need hospital admission to prevent decompensation of mental health functioning, for a short period (days) at a maximum frequency (admissions per month). The model has been used in the Netherlands for more than 30&#x000a0;years but has not yet been standardized or scientifically evaluated by randomized controlled trial. The Brief Admission Sk&#x000e5;ne (BAS) RCT upon which the current protocol is based contributes this data to the literature.</p><p>Participants in the BASRCT are randomized to receive either BA alongside their regular mental health services/treatment as usual (BAS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;TAU) or treatment as usual (TAU). These comparators were selected to determine whether BA added to an existing treatment plan can reduce the number of days spent in general psychiatric admission and associated forced care incidents amongst a population who tend to be heavy consumers of mental health services. These comparators further allow the evaluation of whether, as in the Netherlands, access to BA alongside TAU is associated with more positive experience of mental health services, increased autonomy, and increased quality of life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>BAS objectives</title><p>The primary aim of the BASRCT is to determine if BA can replace general psychiatric admissions (GPA) for individuals with complex mental illness with recent histories of self-harm, at acute risk for escalating self-harm or suicide.

</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>BAS randomized controlled trial: intervention</title><p>Brief Admission Sk&#x000e5;ne (BAS) refers to the current randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of a standardized version of brief admission (BA) for individuals with recurrent self-harm, escalating suicidality, and BPD. Within BAS, individuals can be admitted to hospital for a maximum duration of three consecutive days at a maximum frequency of three times per month. BAS is defined by these parameters as well as by the approach or demeanor of clinical staff, which should be warm, welcoming and bright.</p><p>Participants randomized to TAU will receive no intervention from the study protocol, except the baseline assessments and repeated assessments administered on the same schedule as described for the treatment group, every six&#x000a0;months. They will not be given the evaluation measures that are specific to the BAS intervention (the IES and the CES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]).</p><p>A broad spectrum of mental health services is comprised by TAU. These include psychopharmacological treatment and psychosocial interventions ranging from regular supportive contact with an out-patient clinician to time-specific specialized evidence-based treatments such as DBT and MBT. Involuntary and voluntary psychiatric admission (GPA) is used conservatively, in situations with very high risk for severe harm (for example, with a high probability of death) of self or others, or for specific treatment of co-morbid psychiatric disorders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions for a given participant</title><p>
<italic>Controlled by the participant:</italic> The participant modifies the dose by choosing the duration and frequency of the BAs that they will add to their treatment plan, within the parameters of BAS (maximum three&#x000a0;day admissions, up to three times a month.) If a participant tries BA and does not find it to be helpful, meaningful or if the participant finds BA harmful, they can choose to not initiate further BAs. If during a BA a participant wishes to terminate prior to the duration they planned in advance, the goal of the BA is reviewed, and the individual is asked to decide whether their desire to leave early is in the service of that goal. If a BA is terminated early, the outcome is evaluated afterwards with the individual and their care providers.</p><p>
<italic>Controlled by the clinician:</italic> A BA is terminated following severe self-harm during BA, escalating suicidality during BA, or on occasions in which the participant has broken the terms of the contract signed prior to their first BA (for a sample contract please see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]). If an adverse event involves clinical worsening with respect to self-harm or suicidality, the person is walked over to the Emergency Room and admitted as a general psychiatric inpatient. Care is taken to communicate the fact that a BA terminated early is a learning opportunity rather than a failure. The individual is warmly welcome back to the ward for another BA when they are ready to try again.</p><p>
<italic>Controlled by the clinician in collaboration with the PI and the research team:</italic> If a participant engages in severe self-harm during BA, attempts suicide, or in situations in which other people at the ward were put at risk (adverse events), the BAS contract is put on hold until the individual can learn and express what skills they can use to avoid these outcomes in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Strategies to improve adherence and fidelity</title><p>The National Institutes of Health Behavior Change Consortium (BCC) define treatment fidelity as methods and measures used over the course of implementation of an intervention to increase validity and reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. To monitor and ensure that BA &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d; content, and conditions were as adherent to the formulation of BA as possible, an objectively scored fidelity measure was developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The Brief Admission Sk&#x000e5;ne Fidelity Measure (BASFM) has accompanying rating forms to evaluate every fifth BAS negotiation<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> that is videotaped for this purpose. Videotaped contract negotiations are then dubbed from Swedish into English for fidelity rating. M. Helleman and S. Liljedahl independently rate each videotaped negotiation, compare fidelity ratings, resolve any discrepancies in ratings between them, and give feedback to the principal investigator (S. Westling) who shares feedback directly with clinical staff delivering BAS. Where deviations to adherence are significant, emergency feedback is given at the earliest convenience of all parties. Inter-rater reliability of fidelity ratings will be calculated alongside the results of the BASRCT.</p><p>Further based upon the BCC treatment fidelity recommendations, parallel user experience measures were developed, for administration both to individuals receiving BA and to clinicians providing BA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] within BAS. These measures are administered to individuals and their BA clinicians on every occasion that BA was delivered, as well as after every negotiation (every 6&#x000a0;months). Results of these measures were calculated at the conclusion of the pilot phase of BAS implementation. Both individual and clinician experience measures, as well as the procedure of data collection was streamlined to better reflect clinical reality on the wards as explained by clinical staff and individuals with lived experience receiving BA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Outcomes</title><p>For a list of all primary and secondary outcomes including specific measurement variables, please see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>: All items from the World Health Organization Trial Registration Data Set.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>All items from the World Health Organization Trial Registration Data Set in relation to the Brief Admission Sk&#x000e5;ne Randomized Controlled Trial (BASRCT)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Data category</th><th>Information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Primary registry and trial identifying number</td><td>

In the current RCT (Brief Admission Sk&#x000e5;ne: BAS) participants are randomized at an individual level to either BA plus Treatment as Usual (TAU). Block randomization, using tables with random numbers with blocks of four are used in order to minimize the confounding effect of changes in general care over time. Randomization is stratified according to treatment site. Random number tables are generated using the web-based tool Research Randomizer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The data will be handled with Intention To Treat (ITT) analysis, so that once participants are randomized, their data will be included in all analyses regardless of whether they drop out of the study prior to its termination. Data from all interview and self-report measures are collected in an encrypted online data management program housed at a local Swedish university.</p><p>For each participant in the BASRCT, hospital data are collected retrospectively from 12&#x000a0;months prior to baseline, over the course of the active phase of the study, and at six and 12&#x000a0;months post-baseline. Since access to BA requires a BA contract that is negotiated during a relatively stable phase involving the BA recipient as well as the outpatient clinician and a clinician from the BA unit, a delay can be expected between randomization and access to the intervention. In order to monitor the intervention group only when having access to BA, baseline for individuals randomized to the BA condition was set to the date that the BA contract was introduced and signed by the participant. For individuals randomized to the control condition, baseline was set to the date that screening assessment and randomization occurred.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Sequence allocation, implementation and blinding</title><p>The third author of this paper (D.

The PI (SW) enrolled the participants giving each of them a consecutive research number also generated one per site and strata.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] in relation to standardizing provider training, measuring provider skill acquisition post-training, and following up on how provider skills are retained over time. Accordingly, all staff at hospital wards where BA was going to be delivered received the 1-day workshop. Additional 60&#x02013;90&#x000a0;min information on the BASRCT was offered to all staff working with self-harming, suicidal, and borderline individuals at the emergency wards, other inpatient wards, outpatient units, as well as a team of temporary relief staff. Outpatient clinicians working with the target group as well as relief staff were also encouraged to attend the 1-day workshop. The 1-day workshop was evaluated by attendees at the conclusion of each workshop. At every clinic a single information session for administrators and physicians was offered alongside two options to receive the 1-day workshops on how to deliver BAS to clinical staff. Newly employed staff and those involved in delivering BAS but having missed the BAS training were offered to attend workshops at other sites. After all sites had participated in the workshops and information sessions, new workshops and information sessions were offered every 6&#x000a0;months to ensure newly recruited staff were adequately trained in administering BAS. Information on how the BASRCT has progressed is shared with administrators and physicians in the form of yearly lectures.

Nevertheless, we wanted to follow best practices for enhancing treatment fidelity as a step towards feasible implementation and dissemination, both within the trial and going forward after its termination.</p><p>We are an international research group, facing the aforementioned problems of clinical management of crises related to escalating self-harm and suicide in individuals with and without borderline personality disorder. Clinical management of these crises is problematic in every one of our home countries with the exception of the Netherlands, where crises are curtailed by BA, which is a feature of the Dutch mental health system. Accordingly, we were mindful of the vitality of implementation and dissemination especially for international export from the early planning stages of BAS.</p><p>Our in-person observation of BA in the Netherlands generated the hypothesis that the clinical approach or &#x0201c;demeanour&#x0201d; of staff providing BA is key to its popularity amongst people receiving mental health services as well as its broad implementation in the Netherlands. Given that &#x0201c;clinical demeanour&#x0201d; is a challenging construct to operationalize, and that it can be easily interpreted subjectively, our focus was on measuring fidelity from before the BASRCT began. For this reason, the best practices and recommendations from the National Institutes of Health and Behaviour Change Consortium (BCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]) guidance were followed as closely as possible for enhancing treatment fidelity in the BASRCT. If our primary hypotheses are supported, that is, if BAS can replace general psychiatric admissions for individuals with self-harm at acute risk for suicide, our efforts in implementation and dissemination will continue with an aim for BAS to be merited as a recognized evidence-based intervention. To facilitate international export, English language Train-the-Trainer manuals are being developed, and the BAS fidelity measure and the BAS protocol including clinician training materials have published towards this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Roles and responsibilities and authorship eligibility</title><p>

As a concurrent structured respite plan, BA has been well received by individuals and care providers for more than 20&#x000a0;years in the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] as a crisis management approach for individuals with a BPD. The Brief Admission Sk&#x000e5;ne (BAS) randomized controlled trial upon which the current protocol is based represents the first international effort to standardize, export, and implement BA into a different language, cultural setting, and country from which it was developed.</p><p>Implementing BA in a general psychiatric setting is an extensive and time-consuming process. All staff and management at the participating psychiatric wards, emergency departments and outpatient units must be informed of the availability of BA, be trained in the referral process, and understand BA parameters and implementation well enough to either explain it adequately to prospective participants or deliver BA themselves. Importantly, all professionals must also be willing to initiate and maintain good collaboration with the BA ward, the BAS PI and RA, and amongst each other.</p><p>Implementing BA to a novel setting outside of its country of origin has required regular information-sharing, education and consultation to each entire setting in which BAS has been implemented by a full-time PI and a part-time RA. Daily communication between the PI and RA and regular communication with the wards involved in BAS implementation was required in order to maintain adherent BA delivery, as well as to promptly solve problems as they arose. Regular (monthly, and if needed weekly) consultation as well as repeated (at least 2 times a year) training on BAS has been offered over the duration of the trial. Practical and clinical emergencies related to suicidality or other crises arising during BA were managed by direct clinical supervision with the PI, who is a psychiatrist, on an on-call basis. In more complex clinical situations, urgent consultation amongst the research team, the majority of who are also clinicians, was required so that adherent decisions could be made by consensus. Although BA itself is relatively simple compared to specialized evidence-based treatments for this population, the coordination and collaboration surrounding its adherent implementation is resource and time-intensive. An essential facilitating factor has been ongoing collegial and healthy collaborations within the BASRCT, the vitality of which cannot be overstated.</p><p>At the time of writing this paper no meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials or controlled trials were published testing the efficacy or effectiveness of BA as a replacement for GPA amongst self-harming and suicidal individuals with three or more criteria of borderline personality disorder. In this manner, the BASRCT upon which the current protocol is based represents a unique contribution to the literature. The current BASRCT is the first step in the direction of generating data to determine its effectiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec38"><p>
