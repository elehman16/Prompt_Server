A study of prevalence carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 55 hospitals from 14 countries, showed that 8.7% of hospitalized patients contract Nosocomial Infections (NI). The importance of NI in terms of morbidity, mortality, impact on quality of life in patients and relatives and secondary economic costs, has been emphasized repeatedly in the last years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In the developed countries, around 5-10% of patients admitted to hospitals for acute conditions presented an infection that was not being incubated or present at the time of admission. Healthcare-related infections are the direct cause of 80,000 deaths in the United States and 5,000 deaths in England every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. According to data from the Survey on Prevalence of Nosocomial Infection in Spain (EPINE study) for 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], NI affected between 7% and 9% of patients admitted to Spanish hospitals. These data are very similar to those for developed countries in terms of frequency, economic cost and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. NI present many of the characteristics that define a significant problem in patient safety: affect millions of people all over the world, complicate patient care, contribute to the patient death or temporary/permanent disability, increase resistance to antimicrobials and generate substantial additional costs in the treatment of the patient disease.</p><p>There are many causes of NI, which are related to healthcare systems and processes, as with the behavior of the professionals involved. The results of the Study of the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC study) finding that vigilance is an effective method for the prevention of NI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Indeed, in the hospitals included in the infection prevention program where prevention and control activities were carried out, infection rates was a reduction near to 32%. Other studies have shown the benefits of NI prevention in healthcare and economic terms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><sec><title>Measures to reduce infections related to healthcare: hand hygiene</title><p>The areas of action against these infections are based on simple and well established precautions which have been seen to be effective and widely accepted - the "ordinary precautions" cover all the basic principles for controlling infections that required in all healthcare centers. They are applied to all patients regardless of their diagnosis, risk factors, and infection status, in order to reduce the risk to the patient and healthcare workers of contracting infections. Hand hygiene (HH) is an important element in ordinary precautions and is the most effective measure for preventing infections.</p><p>The hands of health workers (HCWs) are the most common carrier of transmission of microorganisms from one patient to another, from one area of the patient's body to another and from a polluted environment to patients. The HH is considered the most important measure, because of its proven efficiency (it is estimated that the impact on the reduction of NI is 50%), its effectiveness, and its low cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, there is poor compliance with HH regulations by healthcare workers all over the world, and all the studies carried out in hospitals suggest that the frequency of compliance is lower than 50% of the opportunities in which the practice is considered a priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>There are different factors contributing to low levels of HH compliance, both among the professionals: lack of knowledge of the importance of preventing NI, a lack of understanding of the appropriate techniques involved, the occurrence of contact dermatitis; and by the healthcare organization: staff shortaged, work overload, difficult access to points used for conventional hand hygiene, and finally, the absence of an institutional commitment to overall improvement of HH.</p><p>Pittet et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], carried out a study in a university hospital, based on direct observation of physicians, and identified behavioral factors associated with beliefs, attitudes and perceptions in non-compliance of HH. There was over 75% believed that not performing HH led to a higher risk of cross-transmission, 72% thought that HH was unnecessary after removing gloves and 72% thought that HH was necessary after each patient.</p><p>In an epidemiological study of HH carried out in 1994 in hospitals affiliated to the University of Geneva, was observed an average rate of compliance of 48% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This study identified as factors associated with a lack of compliance: professional category (nurses had higher rates of compliance than other professionals), high risk activities for NI in units caring for patients in a critical condition, undertaking procedures with a high level of bacterial contamination, and an overload of work among healthcare professionals.</p><p>In another study, in a Spanish hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], about HH compliance and its associated factors, the average for compliance was 31%. This is very low, regarding that the observation was made after a period of health education on the HH and with the prior knowledge of the professional that they were being evaluated.</p><p>The Atlanta Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published an extensive review of recommendations for HH in healthcare institutions in 2002. It recommended using alcohol-based solutions, instead of washing hands with soap or antiseptic, in order to increase compliance with this action for the prevention of NI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Numerous studies have shown that educational programs can effectively increase knowledges, positive attitudes and appropriate practice to ensure compliance with international protocols and regulations for the prevention and control of NI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The Cochrane review in 2007 on "Interventions to improve hand hygiene compliance in patient care" concludes that there are few evidence to inform the choice of interventions to improve HH, and that studies with consistent designs are urgently required in order to examine the effectiveness of well designed interventions to increase HH compliance, and take into account the factors related to the behavior of HCWs, based on knowledge of the behavioral and social sciences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The WHO in 2004, approved the creation of an "Alliance for Patient Safety", which acknowledged the universal need to improve HH in healthcare institutions, developing a strategy with a very clear call to action: "Clear hands are safer hands". These globally approved recommendations reinforce the need for multidisciplinary interventions, including important elements such as education and motivation on healthcare workers, the inclusion of alcohol-based solutions, the use of compliance indicators and a strong commitment by all healthcare managers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The Quality Plan for the Spanish National Health System of 2007, in patient safety, proposed the development of strategies, measures and programs to promote safe practices in healthcare centers. These included the promotion of clean hands practices in all healthcare centers, and recommended the use of alcohol-based solutions as an effective measure to reduce the incidence of healthcare-associated infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In view of all the above, it seems necesary to carry out studys like the one proposed here, in order to evalued the effect of a hand hygiene training program (TP) on the reduction of healthcare-associated infections among health workers in primary healthcare centers, and to know what factors (intrinsic and extrinsic) are related with the failure (or inadequate compliance with) in the HH.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><sec><title>Main Objective</title><p>-To evaluated the effect of a (TP) on "Hand Hygiene for the reduction of healthcare-associated infections" among primary healthcare workers, as measured by the variation from correct HH compliance by explicit regulatory criteria, 6 months after the baseline, in the intervention group and in the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>-To describe knowledges, attitudes and behaviors regarding HH, and their possible association with professional burnout among the professionals evaluated, stratifying the results by type of Group (intervention and usual clinical practice).</p><p>-To estimate the logistic regression model that best explains HH compliance, where the main explanatory variable is the type of intervention and the covariables for which it will be adjusted: age, sex, type of profession, type of employment contract, years of employment experience, level of knowledge of HH, attitude to HH, behavior with regard to HH, and professional burnout.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>An experimental study of parallel groups, with a control group and random assignment intervencion by health centers.</p><p>Definition of terms:</p><p>-<bold><italic>Five Indications/moments </italic></bold>are based on those defined by the WHO Guidelines on HH 20] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Five moments of hand hygiene (reproduced with WHO permission)</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2458-9-469-1"/></fig><p>A <italic>Moment </italic>is when there is a perceived or actual risk of pathogen transmission from</p><p>one surface to another via the hands.

This means that the use of gloves does not in any way change the moments for HH and above all, does not replace HH.</p><sec><title>-Action</title><p>This is recognition of the instructions by healthcare workers during their work. When the action is carried out (positive action) it can be done in two ways: by washing hands with an alcoholic disinfectant or by washing them with soap and water.

The questionnaire will be administered again to the pilot group after a 20-day interval and the intraclass correlation coefficient will be calculated, in order to determine the reproducibility or reliability of the test-retest.</p><p>The validity of the content will be evaluated in two ways:</p><p>First, a group of experts will valued the ability of the questionnaire to evaluate all the aspects to be measured. A factorial analysis of the main components - the Varimax rotation - will be carried out to analyze the construct vality (the level to which the instrument reflects the theory of the phenomenon or concept being measured). The adequacy of the factorial analysis will be tested by the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure and Bartlett's test of sphericity.</p><p>The questionnaire will be sent by post to the professional, preceded by a generic informative letter (to maximize the response rate). A questionnaire with a more detailed introductory letter will be sent a few days later. A reminder will be sent ten days after sending, which will once again include the questionnaire and a note of thanks.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>-"Professional burnout" questionnaire</title><p>The validated Spanish version of the "Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)" will be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

Scores are obtained by totaling the values of the item, and each subscale is calculated separately. They are not combined, and a total MBI score is not obtained.</p><p>The MBI questionnaire will be applied with the questionnaire on knwoledges, attitudes and behaviors. Due to the sensitive nature of the questions, it is important that the professionals do not know that they are answering a questionnaire on professional stress. It will be presented as a scale of work attitudes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Intervention program</title><p>The HH training workshops will be carried out in the health centers assigned to the intervention group. A combined intervention strategy will be applied by:</p><p>1- Training in theoretical-practical workshops for the professionals healthcare in the intervention group on HH techniques. The strategy will be multi-faceted (many perspectives), multimodal (many procedures) and multidisciplinary.</p><p>The HH training workshops will be focused on strategies for creating changes in behaviors, beliefs and habits concerning traditional hygiene. There will also be an emphasis on morbidity, mortality, the costs related with NI and on the epidemiological evidence of the effects of a conclusive improvement in HH.</p><p>There will be a practical section to familiarize professionals with the ideal technique for achieving the maximum effectiveness in HH. Participatory techniques, group discussions and procedure demonstrations will be used.</p><p>2- The introduction of alcohol-based solutions, in all rooms in the intervention centers, for everyday use in healthcare.</p><p>They will be installed after the first SO and before the training workshop. Compared to traditional washing with soap and water, alcoholic products have been more effective in terms of reducing the pathogens load on the skin, having a longer residual effect and leading to less skin dryness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>3.

A comparison table of the baseline characteristics of the differents intervention groups will be presented.</p><p>- A covariance analysis model (ACOVS), for the main objective, will be carried out for repeated measures. The dependent variable will be the variation of correct HH compliance in each observation period (1 and 6 months) compared to the baseline. The results of the questionnaire on knwoldges, attitudes, behaviors and patient safety will be expressed as relative frequencies, as with a median score on a scale from 1 to 4. The results will be shown with a confidence interval of 95%.</p><p>- A logistic regression analysis will be carried out, with a dependent variable that will be HH compliance and the main explanatory variable will be the type of intervention. The covariables for which it will be adjusted are: the variables which have shown an imbalance and those with a biological basis or which are potentially confusing in the comparison table of both groups, such as: age, years of employment experience, type of profession, type of contract, knowledges, attitudes and behaviors regarding HH, professional burnout. The manually controlled "Backstep LR" method will be used.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The possible limitations are the lack of co-operation by professionals in the health centers, as they will not initially be informed about the objectives of the study, for they do not feel to be studied about their HH compliance (the Hawthorne effect), which could lead to the data collection being compromised. In that case, we would increase the size of the sample.</p><p>In order for the sample to be representative of all the professionals, there will be a random stratified selection of the professionals in each center, taking into account the proportion of each professional in the area study (43% physicians, 38.6% nurses, 10.3% pediatricians, 3.1% nursing auxiliaries, 1.6% dental hygienists, 1.6% midwifes).</p><p>A multivariate analysis (logistic regression) will be carried out to check for possible confusion factors that could distort o the real effect of the intervention on HH compliance.</p><p>Likewise, in order to reduce an incorrect classification, there will be only one observer.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The study complies with the Helsinki Declaration and its subsequent revisions, and regulations of clinical best practice.</p><p>The study protocol has been approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Hospital Ram&#x000f3;n y Cajal in Madrid from Spain.</p><sec><title>Informed consent</title><p>The professionals will sign an informed consent declaration before the observation.
