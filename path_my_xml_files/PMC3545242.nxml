The peripheral adaptations include increased vascularization, mitochondrial density and enzyme activity, which help in increasing the rate of oxygen extraction and usage. Those adaptations that occur centrally, that is involving the cardiovascular system, affect the rate at which oxygen can be delivered to the entire body.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] These central factors include maximal cardiac output, pulmonary diffusion, blood volume, and blood flow.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Therefore the ability of the cardiorespiratory system to transport oxygen to the exercising muscles is considered the central component of the maximal aerobic capacity (VO<sub>2</sub> max).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Endurance training enhances the VO<sub>2</sub> max through adaptations of heart contractility and function, blood volume, and oxygen-carrying capacity. When the peripheral and central systems are highly adapted, as in the case of an elite endurance cyclist, high rates of work can be achieved for extended durations. The maximal amount of oxygen that is consumed during exercise, defined as VO<sub>2</sub> max, is dependent on both the delivery and utilization of oxygen, and is limited by the system that is least adapted. In the elite endurance cyclist, it is generally believed that VO<sub>2</sub> max is centrally limited, that is, by the rate of oxygen delivery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Therefore, alterations to the oxygen transport system have the potential to enhance VO<sub>2</sub> max further.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Another aspect, which could play an important role in enhancing an athlete's VO<sub>2</sub> max, is the use of nutritional aids or supplements, supported by evidence-based research in sports sciences. In recent years, nutritional supplements and ergogenic aids have played an important role in the sports arena.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] An ergogenic aid is a technique or practice that increases the performance capacity, the efficiency to perform work, the ability to recover from exercise, and the quality of training, thereby promoting greater training adaptations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Increasing world-class achievements or performance has been known to be backed by the judicious use of ergogenic aids.</p><p>Though Ayurveda is one of the oldest branches of medicines and therapy, very few clinical trials have been performed to demonstrate its therapeutic, ergogenic and nutritive effects, especially in the context of athletic performance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Ashwagandha, also known as <italic>Withania Somnifera</italic> or Indian winter cherry, has been an important traditional herbal medicine for over 3,000 years.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] <italic>W. Somnifera</italic> is a densely pubescent shrub up to 1 m tall belonging to the family of <italic>Solanaceae</italic>. Its root contains flavonoids and many active ingredients like alkaloids and steroidal lactones, which are commonly called withanolides. The chemical constituents of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> include three natural powerful antioxidants, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidise. It is an ingredient in many formulations prescribed for a variety of musculoskeletal conditions (e.g., arthritis, rheumatism), and as a general tonic to increase energy, improve overall health and longevity, and prevent disease in athletes, the elderly, and during pregnancy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>According to the pharmacodynamic principles of Ayurveda, this herb possesses the <italic>rasa</italic> (~ taste) of <italic>tikta</italic> (~ bitter), <italic>katu</italic> (~ pungent), and <italic>madhura</italic> (~ sweet). Further its <italic>gunas</italic> (~ properties) are <italic>laghu</italic> (~ light) and <italic>snigdha</italic> (~ unctuous), <italic>vipaka</italic> (~ effect observed after digestion)is <italic>madhura</italic> and <italic>virya</italic> (~ potency / active principle) is <italic>usna</italic> (~ hot). Its <italic>karma</italic> (~ action) is to correct the deranged bodily humor <italic>vata</italic> ( ~ functional element of nervous system / circulatory system) and <italic>kapha</italic> (~ mucoid / fluid substance, etc.).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>It is also a <italic>rasayana</italic> drug,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] whose action is to clear all channels of the body, provide optimum nutrients to cells of the body at the micro level and to keep all the tissue/systems, sense organs/physiological functions of the body in healthy condition. Apart from this, according to Ayurvedic principles, each drug has some specific effects, which cannot be predicted, and they are likely to happen because many properties/active principles exist in a combination naturally. Considering such properties and actions of <italic>W.Somnifera</italic>, the drug is supposed to act on increasing cardiorespiratory and vascular endurance.</p><p>Many pharmacological studies have been conducted to investigate the properties of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> in an attempt to authenticate its use as a multipurpose herb. Several studies have suggested that <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> improves the hemoglobin (Hb) count and red blood cell (RBC) count,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] which are important factors determining the cardiovascular performance of an elite athlete.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The increase in RBC mass leads to an increase in the capacity of blood to transport oxygen at a greater capacity to the peripheral system, thus ensuring a greater VO<sub>2</sub> max.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] </p><p>Despite the long tradition of use of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> by medical practitioners and sportsmen in India, randomized controlled trials investigating its effects on key aspects of performance such as aerobic capacity in trained athletes is rare. Though a study by Sandhu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] in 2010 in young sedentary adults suggested an improvement in VO<sub>2</sub> max after eight weeks of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> supplementation, there have been no such studies on athletes. Thus this study aims to investigate the efficacy of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> supplementation as an ergogenic aid in enhancing the aerobic performance of elite Indian cyclists.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty elite Indian cyclists (20 males and 20 females) were randomly selected for this study from around the northern Punjab region.

Lin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] in 1999 elaborated that nutritional supplements have been long and widely used in the sports arena to increase performance; hence, athletes and coaches search for new options and alternatives to increase their endurance capacity in a healthier way. This was when the consumption of Ayurvedic herbs began. Analytical reports on <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> suggest that this herb has a rich array of a diverse spectrum of bioactive compounds.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] The abundance of phytochemicals with antioxidant properties, such as phenolic, flavonoids, and carotenoids may be held responsible for the rejuvenating activity of this medicinal herb. This explains the inclusion of this herb in the Indian system of Ayurvedic lists in promoting longevity and other pharmacological effects and earning the title of the &#x02032;queen of Ayurvedic herbs.&#x02019;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> is said to increase one's stamina and has many other beneficial properties. In spite of the many properties attributed to <italic>Ashwagandha</italic>, there is a paucity of clinical scientific evidence for its use in athletes. This study was designed to provide a scientific basis for the use of this supplementation by athletes.</p><p>In our study, we found that the baseline VO<sub>2</sub> max of the Indian elite cyclist was in the range of 39.0 to 52.0 mL/ kg/ min, with the mean value of 45.5 mL/ kg/ min [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Studies in Western countries have indicated higher VO<sub>2</sub> max values, as in Spain: 72.0 mL/kg/min,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] France: 70.9 mL/kg/min,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] and Greece: 69.7 mL/kg/ min.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Various factors might have contributed to these differences. These include genetic disposition[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] variations in muscle fiber types[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] and composition of enzymes,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] and a difference in body fat percentage and lean tissue, as well as training.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] There are indications that almost 10-30% of the variations in VO<sub>2</sub> max is genetically determined after accounting for differences in the volume and intensity of training.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>]</p><p>After the eight-week supplementation with <italic>Ashwagandha</italic>, the atheletes showed an increase of 13% in VO<sub>2</sub> max, a statistically significant improvement from 46 mL/kg/min to 52 m/ kg/ min [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>], that is, an increase of 13% [<italic>P</italic> value of 0.000; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Contrary to this, the athletes in the placebo group did not show any improvement. Therefore, this statistical improvement verifies the potency of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> in increasing VO<sub>2</sub> max. Though there are many factors that could contribute to the increase in the maximal oxygen consumption, we believe that an increase in the count of RBCs and Hb could have played a role; a study by Ziauddin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] in 1996 indicated that <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> increased both the RBC and Hb count. The increase in RBC mass leads to an increase in the capacity of the blood to transport oxygen directly to the exercising muscles, thereby enhancing the aerobic capacity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] directly, enhancing the aerobic capacity. Further studies on RBC and Hb count would provide conclusive evidence regarding the mechanism of the ergogenic effect of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic>.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Intergroup comparison of experimental and placebo groups by Levene's test</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JAIM-3-209-g002"/></table-wrap><p>As reported by Hautier <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] fatigue in cycling may be because of thermoregulatory, psychological, cardiovascular, or centrally governed factors. Providing an antifatigue medication may help reduce the negative effect of these factors, thereby increasing the aerobic capacity. <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> has been proved to have an anti-fatigue action.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] This was demonstrated by the significant improvement in the time to exhaustion of the experimental group in the VO<sub>2</sub> max test from a mean pretest time of 15.79 minutes to a post-test time of 16.93 minutes [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, P &#x0003c; 0.000].</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Mean values (&#x000b1;SD) of pre-post readings of experimental and placebo groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JAIM-3-209-g003"/></table-wrap><p>An effect attributed to <italic>Ashwagandha</italic>, similar to caffeine, is an improvement of clarity and focus. In Ayurveda, this is also known as <italic>rasayana</italic> or the &#x02018;rejuvenation&#x02019; effect. This property is also expected to boost physical and mental health, revitalizing the body.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] Though it was not our aim to explore the site of fatigue at which the action of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> was most potent, yet it is hypothesized that, similar to caffeine, it may have increased the free fatty acid oxidation hence conserving glycogen stores.</p><p>Comparing genders, women have a lower VO<sub>2</sub> max than men. Yet, apart from gender and genetics, other factors that influence variations in VO<sub>2</sub> max values include age, training status, exercise modes, and body composition.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Though the study population comprised an equal number of males and females, a significant difference was noted in the experimental group. In percentage, time to exhaustion in males had increased by 10.7%, in comparison to females in whom it increased by only 4.3%, thus also resulting in higher VO<sub>2</sub> max values of 16.1% in males as compared to 9.0% in females [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. Statistical analysis revealed that both parameters were highly significant with a P value of 0.000 [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>]. This implies that males were more responsive to the supplementation than females, perhaps mediated by an effect of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> on the endocrine system. An animal study done by Abdel-Magied <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] on Wistar mice reported that the effect of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> was evident as it had increased the testicular weight of these animals.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Mean percentage (%) difference of pre-post readings of males and females</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JAIM-3-209-g004"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Analysis of variance of pre-post readings in males <italic>vs.</italic> females of the experimental group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JAIM-3-209-g005"/></table-wrap><p>This research only aimed to investigate the effects of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> on the aerobic performance of the elite Indian cyclist. Thus, the effect of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> on blood biochemistry and hormonal status was not investigated. No side effects were reported during this study however, it was noted that one athlete from the experimental group complained of mild indigestion during the first week of supplementation, though we cannot directly attribute this to be the effect of the herb intake.</p><p>Though majority of the parameters changed significantly after supplementation of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> the RER value was not significant. RER refers to the ratio of carbon dioxide produced to oxygen consumed during a particular activity of time, which is usually above 1.00 in exhaustive exercises.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>This study provides definite evidence for the improvement of aerobic performance of elite cyclists with the dosage used. Yet, research regarding dose-time effects as well as the principle mechanism of action, that is its effects on physiological parameters such as hormonal status, blood chemistry including RBC, Hb and so on were not studied. A longer study of perhaps 16 weeks with different dosages and with change in the above parameters being recorded every two weeks, would increase clarity on how this herb affects physiological parameters and the time of point at which it demonstrates an improvement. This would also clarify the minimum period of time that is required to affect various systems, allowing the physician to make definite recommendations regarding its duration and dosage for performance enhancements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>To date, most of the properties of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> have been studied, investigated and reported only in sedentary healthy subjects having low fitness levels. Thus, this study was designed to analyze its effectiveness in improving performance in well-trained athletes.
