Additional therapeutic options with mechanisms of action that complement existing therapies may help achieve and maintain better glycemic control. Agents that can improve glycemic control without increasing hypoglycemia while promoting weight loss and improving &#x003b2;-cell function are desirable, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may prove to be such agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>SGLT2 is expressed primarily in the early proximal renal tubule and is responsible for most of the glucose reabsorption in the kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Inhibition of SGLT2 decreases glucose reabsorption in the renal tubule and increases glucose excretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Partitioning of glucose out of the body through increased urinary glucose excretion (UGE) directly reduces elevated glucose concentrations and, by loss of calories (since each gram of glucose lost is equivalent to 4 calories), tends to lead to weight loss.</p><p>Canagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor currently in phase 3 development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, has been shown to reduce the renal threshold for glucose reabsorption, increase UGE, reduce plasma glucose, and lead to weight loss in a short-term study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Following this, the objective of the current study was to determine the dose-response efficacy and safety of canagliflozin during a 12-week period in subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.</p><sec id="s2"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, dose-ranging study.

Sitagliptin was included as an active-reference treatment group to provide clinical perspective. The study periods included a 3- to 4-week pretreatment screening phase, a 12-week double-blind treatment phase, and a 2-week posttreatment phase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-1926/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>).</p><sec id="s3"><title>Study population</title><p>Eligible subjects were men and women 18&#x02013;65 years of age who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for at least 3 months, had an A1C level &#x02265;7% and &#x02264;10.5%, were on metformin monotherapy at a stable (&#x02265;3 months) dose of &#x02265;1,500 mg/day, had a stable body weight and BMI 25&#x02013;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (24&#x02013;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for those of Asian descent), and had serum creatinine levels &#x0003c;1.5 mg/dL for men and &#x0003c;1.4 mg/dL for women.</p><p>The study protocol was reviewed and approved by institutional review boards and independent ethics committees.

Secondary end points included change from baseline to week 12 in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), overnight urinary glucose-to-creatinine (U<sub>Glucose</sub>-to-U<sub>Creatinine</sub>) ratio, and body weight, as well as a change in the percentage of subjects with A1C &#x0003c;7.0% and &#x0003c;6.5% after 12 weeks of treatment. Other end points included change in fasting serum lipids (triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and total cholesterol&#x02013;to&#x02013;HDL cholesterol ratio). &#x003b2;-Cell function was indirectly assessed by changes in homeostasis model assessment 2 (HOMA2) index of &#x003b2;-cell function (HOMA2-%B).

To account for differences in plasma glucose and glomerular filtration rate, the overnight renal threshold for glucose excretion (RT<sub>G</sub>) was calculated from UGE, plasma glucose, and estimated glomerular filtration rate using an approach similar to that used to calculate the renal threshold for phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). &#x003b2;-Cell function was assessed using HOMA2-%B, HOMA2 calculator version 2.2 (Oxford, U.K.), with fasting glucose and C-peptide values at baseline and at week 12.</p><p>Safety and tolerability assessments included collection of adverse event (AE) reports, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms, physical examinations, and safety laboratory assessments. Self-administered vaginal swabs for <italic>Candida</italic> culture and urine cultures were to be obtained from all subjects at baseline and week 12. Vaginal swabs for <italic>Candida</italic> culture were also to be obtained at the time of a vulvovaginal AE (VVAE).

Efficacy analyses were based on the intent-to-treat analysis set (all randomized subjects), and safety analyses included all intent-to-treat subjects who received at least one dose of the study medication. The primary efficacy analysis of canagliflozin and placebo was based on an ANCOVA model that included terms for treatment, the baseline value as a covariate, and the stratification factor of whether the subject participated in the mixed-meal tolerance test. The between-group differences were assessed by testing the difference in the least squares mean change from baseline at week 12 versus placebo, and Dunnett procedure was used to adjust for the multiple treatment comparisons. Similar models were used to analyze the continuous secondary end points. No statistical comparisons were made with canagliflozin versus sitagliptin, which was used to provide a benchmark clinical perspective. Missing values in the efficacy end points were imputed using the last observation carried forward. Safety and tolerability were assessed by a review of safety parameters.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s7"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s8"><title>Subject disposition and baseline characteristics</title><p>The intent-to-treat analysis set included 451 subjects randomized at 85 study sites in 12 countries.

Except for a modest increase in serum collagen type 1 &#x003b2;-carboxy-terminal telopeptide (0.06&#x02013;0.11 ng/mL), a marker of bone resorption, with canagliflozin treatment, no changes were seen in markers of either bone formation or resorption in canagliflozin treatment groups relative to placebo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-1926/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 4</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s17"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This dose-ranging trial demonstrates that canagliflozin, a novel oral antihyperglycemic agent, at all doses studied, significantly improved glycemic control without an increased occurrence of hypoglycemia in subjects with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control with metformin. The extent of improvement in A1C observed with canagliflozin is particularly notable given the mild baseline hyperglycemia in the subject population studied. Improvements in glycemic control, with reductions in A1C and FPG, were observed at 100 mg QD with further improvement seen up to a 300-mg QD dose, as well as modestly greater weight reduction at the top once-daily canagliflozin dose. Notable in this observation is the fact that UGE (ratio of U<sub>Glucose</sub> to U<sub>Creatinine</sub>) did not appear to be substantively greater at the 300-mg relative to the 100-mg QD doses, similar to observations in other studies of canagliflozin, suggesting that the higher dose may provide an additional mechanism of glucose lowering. Perhaps an effect in slowing the rate of glucose absorption after a meal (through inhibition of luminal SGLT1 in the proximal small intestine) as has been suggested at higher canagliflozin doses, including at 300 mg, may explain the tendency for greater effects with these higher doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). However, this mechanism remains speculative and is under active study. Whether 300 mg QD provides greater efficacy compared with 100 mg, as well as the mechanisms responsible for the greater efficacy, requires further dosage studies of canagliflozin.</p><p>Canagliflozin treatment provided significant and clinically meaningful weight loss at all doses studied. The most likely mechanism of weight loss is through the increased UGE partitioning out calorie equivalents: each gram of glucose excreted translates to a loss of 4 kcal. Early studies in subjects with type 2 diabetes showed UGE of &#x0223c;60&#x02013;100 g/day&#x02014;equivalent to &#x0223c;240&#x02013;400 kcal/day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Longer-term treatment studies are necessary to determine whether the weight loss observed in this study will persist beyond the short treatment period examined here.</p><p>In this study, canagliflozin improved a fasting indirect measure of &#x003b2;-cell function (HOMA2-%B). Canagliflozin-induced improvements in &#x003b2;-cell function have also been previously observed after a 2-week treatment period in subjects with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Weight loss has been shown to improve &#x003b2;-cell function, likely by reducing insulin resistance. In a similar manner, reduced &#x003b2;-cell demand, such as through pharmacologic interventions, also improves &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The increased glucose excretion with canagliflozin both reduced weight and likely directly reduced demand for insulin secretion and may explain the &#x003b2;-cell functional improvements we observed. Reversal of glucotoxicity may also have contributed to the observed improvement, which cannot be excluded without a concurrent active control that does not directly enhance insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Additional studies of canagliflozin, with direct measures of insulin secretion, are necessary to understand the observation of improved &#x003b2;-cell function and whether this provides long-term benefits, such as improved glucose control durability.</p><p>Canagliflozin was well tolerated in this study, with no evident increase in overall AE incidence compared with placebo, across the once-daily treatment groups except for increased incidence of genital infections in female subjects. This included both symptomatic and asymptomatic reports (the latter reporting positive vaginal <italic>Candida</italic> cultures). The symptomatic infections were reported as mild and responded to standard oral and topical antifungal treatments. All women with a vaginal culture at the time of the VVAE were positive for yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The symptomatic infections were reported as mild and responded to standard oral and topical antifungal treatments. While baseline A1C, FPG, and BMI were not significant predictors of VVAEs in the pooled canagliflozin groups in a logistic regression analysis, positive cultures at baseline as well as location in the North American region predicted the occurrence of VVAEs in women treated with canagliflozin (odds ratios 9.1 [95% CI 2.4&#x02013;34.0] and 4.2 [1.2&#x02013;14.4], respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). By increasing UGE, SGLT2 inhibitors increase vaginal colonization with <italic>Candida</italic> species, and the increase in colonization may be the etiology for the increased VVAEs seen in women treated with canagliflozin.</p><p>There appears to be no higher rate of urinary tract infections with canagliflozin treatment. These observations may suggest that an increase in UGE raises the risk of genital mycotic infections but apparently not of urinary tract infections. This is consistent with the observation that the incidence of mycotic genital infections is higher with poorly controlled diabetes (especially vulvovaginal candidiasis and balanoposthitis) but without a clear increase in bacterial or candidal urinary tract infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). However, evidence from the phase 3 dapagliflozin development program indicated an increase in events suggestive of urinary tract infections with dapagliflozin versus comparators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Larger and longer studies will be needed to better define the incidence of both types of infections and the impact, if any, on renal function in patients treated with canagliflozin.</p><p>RT<sub>G</sub> was lowered with canagliflozin (maximal reduction of 77 mg/dL) but remained above the hypoglycemic threshold (usually considered to be 60&#x02013;70 mg/dL). Since minimal UGE occurs below the RT<sub>G</sub>, hypoglycemia would not be expected, and was not observed, above the rate reported for placebo in this study.</p><p>Although the increase in UGE would be expected to lead to osmotic diuresis, no evidence of clinically important volume depletion was observed; in particular, the incidence of AEs suggestive of volume depletion (e.g., orthostatic dizziness and hypotension) was not increased, and only a small reduction in blood pressure&#x02014;with no change in heart rate&#x02014;was observed. In a similar manner, few AEs suggestive of osmotic diuresis (such as polyuria and pollakiuria) were reported. These observations may relate to the fact that the extent of osmotic load is relatively modest, not leading to more marked changes in volume or urinary output, with compensatory mechanisms contributing to maintaining normal volume. Consistent with a slight decrease in intravascular volume was a modest increase in blood urea nitrogen, hemoglobin, and hematocrit in the canagliflozin treatment groups relative to the placebo group. There was a reduction in serum urate concentrations similar to what has been described with other SGLT2 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The SGLT2 inhibitor&#x02013;induced decreases in serum urate concentrations may be mediated by glucosuria facilitating urate efflux into the tubular lumen by the high-capacity urate transporter SLC2A9 (GLUT9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, canagliflozin added onto metformin monotherapy provides clinically valuable improvements in glycemic control associated with weight loss and low hypoglycemia risk. An increase in genital infections in women (particularly VVAEs suggestive of vulvovaginal candidiasis) was seen, but these appeared to be generally mild to moderate and responded to usual antifungal therapies. Future long-term studies examining the efficacy of canagliflozin with other antihyperglycemic medications will be needed; however, the unique and distinct mechanism of glucose lowering with canagliflozin suggests that combination efficacy may be observed when this agent is added to other classes of agents.</p><p>Phase 3 studies of canagliflozin are now under way to better define the efficacy profile across multiple uses, including in monotherapy and various combinations, and to better understand the longer-term safety and efficacy profile of this agent. The profile of effective glucose lowering, weight loss, improved &#x003b2;-cell function, and low risk of hypoglycemia suggest that canagliflozin may be a clinically useful new antihyperglycemic agent.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
