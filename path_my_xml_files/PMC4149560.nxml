Although these regimens are potent and well tolerated, some concerns have emerged over the long-term bone and renal toxicities of tenofovir-containing regimens, particularly in the aging HIV-infected population, and those with significant comorbidities and increased fracture risk <xref rid="pone.0106221-Bedimo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The primary alternative nucleoside abacavir (ABC) has been associated with hypersensitivity reactions and increased cardiovascular risk in some observational cohorts <xref rid="pone.0106221-DAD1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106221-SMARTINSIGHT1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These issues, together with concerns about lower virologic potency observed in a clinical trial <xref rid="pone.0106221-Sax1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> have tempered enthusiasm for abacavir use as first line therapy, except when combined with the new integrase inhibitor dolutegravir. This has led to an interest in designing studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nucleoside-sparing regimens. Regimens that combine a boosted PI with efavirenz are complex due to frequent pharmacokinetic interactions and associated with increased hyperlipidemia <xref rid="pone.0106221-Riddler1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Given the potency of raltegravir (RAL) in na&#x000ef;ve individuals <xref rid="pone.0106221-Lennox1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, combining RAL with a boosted PI in HIV-1 became an obvious target. The first of such regimens to be evaluated in a longitudinal study was RAL with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV), which was associated with similar virologic and immunologic efficacy as tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) and RAL for up to 96 weeks in the PROGRESS study <xref rid="pone.0106221-Reynes1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106221-Reynes2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Following this, the SPARTAN study showed higher rates of hyperbilirubinemia and RAL resistance with the ATV/RTV + RAL regimen despite achieving similar virologic efficacy at 48 weeks as TDF/FTC + ATV/RTV <xref rid="pone.0106221-Kozal1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Finally, a single-arm study (ACTG 5262) <xref rid="pone.0106221-Taiwo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> demonstrated high rates of virologic failure and RAL resistance with a regimen of ritonavir-boosted darunavir (DRV/RTV) + RAL, mostly in patients with high baseline viremia. The absence of a comparator arm, however, precluded conclusive evaluation of the efficacy of DRV/RTV + RAL. This surprising lack of potency has become an anticipated observation of most non-NRTI-containing regimens.</p><p>The initiation of NRTI-containing antiretroviral therapy has been consistently associated with an initial decline in bone mineral density (BMD) that tends to stabilize over time, and these changes have been associated with a rapid increase in bone turnover markers (BTMs), which probably explain the decrease in BMD <xref rid="pone.0106221-Cazanave1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0106221-vanVonderen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Compared with ABC, TDF is associated with greater increases in BTMs <xref rid="pone.0106221-Stellbrink1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106221-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. HAART containing TDF has also demonstrated a faster decline in BMD than non-TDF-containing HAART <xref rid="pone.0106221-Gallant1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106221-McComsey1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. NRTI-sparing regimens may avoid the long-term adverse skeletal effects of NRTI. While patients on an NRTI-free regimen showed smaller decline in BMD than those on TDF-containing HAART in the PROGRESS study <xref rid="pone.0106221-Reynes1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106221-Reynes2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, comparative data between NRTI-containing and NRTI-sparing regimens investigating the relationship between BTM and BMD changes are lacking.</p><p>We hereby report the results of the RADAR study, an open-label randomized, 48-week pilot study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RAL + DRV/RTV compared with TDF/FTC + DRV/RTV in antiretroviral-naive subjects with HIV-1 RNA&#x02265;5,000 copies/mL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106221.s003">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106221.s007">Protocol S1</xref>.

This was the standard antiretroviral study analysis when the study was conceived, and has been substituted recently by the snapshot analysis <xref rid="pone.0106221-Food1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. All subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of the study drugs were included in the analysis (intention to treat, ITT analysis). Another analysis was performed censoring participants lost to follow-up or who died without previously meeting the definition of virologic failure (&#x0201c;on treatment&#x0201d;, OT analysis). We repeated the analyses using the newer FDA Snapshot methodology, where participants with viral suppression at week 48 were classified as successes. Participants missing HIV RNA data at week 48 analysis, or who discontinued study drug before week 48 were classified as failures.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Bone health assessment</title><p>All patients underwent whole-body DXA scanning (Hologic, QDR 4500A) at baseline (week 0) and at week 48 to assess total body and subtotal (total minus head) BMD, as well as fat and lean body mass. Fasting plasma samples were collected and frozen at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C. Markers of inflammation and bone turnover were measured at weeks 0, 16, and 48. All assays were performed blinded to treatment group and BMD measurements. Inflammatory markers measured were: soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, interleukin 1b (IL1-B), and IL-6 (Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD). BTMs measured included C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX, marker of bone resorption), and N-terminal type 1 procollagen (P1NP, marker of bone formation). CTX was measured using a luminometric assay on Elecsys 2010 (Hoffmann-La Roche); reference range: men 0.158&#x02013;0.584 ng/mL, pre-menopausal women 0.162&#x02013;0.573 ng/ml, post-menopausal women 0.330&#x02013;1.008 ng/ml; Inter-assay coefficient of variance &#x0003c;8.9%.

Both regimens led to similar changes in inflammatory markers over time but had distinctly different effects on bone turnover markers and BMD. TDF/FTC use led to an early increase in bone turnover markers, which was associated with a decline in BMD, whereas RAL use did not significantly impact bone health.</p><p>Our study was originally designed with a non-inferiority comparison in mind. We accept, however, that our sample size was inadequate to have had any reasonable power to establish non-inferiority using typical non-inferiority deltas of 12% or 15%. Our results, though, show fewer treatment failures for TDF/FTC + DRV/RTV at week 48, albeit the majority of these failures were due to lost to follow-up and treatment discontinuation rather than true virologic failure.</p><p>The virologic response rate to RAL + DRV/RTV was similar to that observed in ACTG 5262 <xref rid="pone.0106221-Taiwo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106221.s002">Table S1</xref>). All but three treatment failures in the RAL group resulted from loss to follow-up or withdrawal of consent. While the twice-daily administration for RAL in the RAL + DRV/r regimen could have resulted in a lower acceptance rate and sub-optimal adherence, there was no significant difference in self-reported medication adherence between the two regimens in our study. The recently completed ANRS 143/NEAT 001 study (NCT: NCT01066962) &#x02013; with similar design as RADAR but much larger sample size &#x02013; will likely contribute to more definitively answering the question of whether a difference in treatment efficacy exists.</p><p>The two regimens achieved comparable immunologic response, but patients in the TDF/FTC arm had smaller increases in total cholesterol. This is in line with other studies confirming a lower impact on serum cholesterol &#x02013; or possibly a cholesterol-lowering property &#x02013; associated with TDF <xref rid="pone.0106221-Tungsiripat1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Except for TC, there were no statistically significant differences in lipid changes from baseline between the two groups. There was also no statistically significant difference in the mean changes in serum creatinine and eGFR between groups.</p><p>Similar to the PROGRESS study, changes in BMD were significantly worse in the TDF arm than in the NRTI-sparing regimen. Furthermore, patients in the TDF arm had significant sustained increases in BTMs at week 16 and 48 while RAL patients did not. Changes in BTMs at week 16 were predictive of BMD decline at week 48. If confirmed in additional studies, early changes in BTMs may be useful to predict long-term BMD decline and allow providers to make regimen changes in a timely manner and also simplify the monitoring of bone safety in large antiretroviral trials. As the standard of care is DXA scans, the enrollment in studies monitoring BMD becomes more complex and expensive since sites need access to a good radiology center and central reading, biasing enrollment towards tertiary referral centers and a relatively small subset of the participants. If the observation that changes in BTM predict changes in BMD is confirmed &#x02013; as appears to be the case in a recently published study <xref rid="pone.0106221-Cotter1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> &#x02013; the monitoring of trials could be done by evaluation of BTM, which would allow enrollment of a large proportion of participants, reduce selection bias, and increase generalizability. Bone resorption (CTX) appears to increase much earlier than formation (P1NP), suggesting the latter is compensatory. This appears to confirm the hypothesis of a &#x0201c;catabolic window&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0106221-vanVonderen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> following initiation of HAART that might lead to decreased BMD. The STEAL and ASSERT studies <xref rid="pone.0106221-Stellbrink1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106221-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> have previously shown a lower increases in BTMs with ABC/3TC compared to TDF/FTC, each in combination with boosted protease inhibitors. Furthermore, there were greater increases in the resorption marker CTX among patients receiving ATV/RTV vs. Efavirenz (EFV) in combination with TDF/FTC <xref rid="pone.0106221-Foca1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In the only previous evaluation of BTMs in an NRTI-free regimen, patients randomized to the nevirapine (NVP) arm still had significant elevations in BTMs from baseline, albeit lower than those randomized to zidovudine/lamivudine (AZT/3TC) <xref rid="pone.0106221-vanVonderen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an antiretroviral regimen without significant changes in BTMs at week 48 suggesting that NRTI-sparing regimens could potentially be bone neutral. This finding also suggests that the initial bone loss associated with antiretroviral treatment most likely represents a direct effect of medications, rather than a general phenomenon of immune reconstitution.</p><p>It is widely assumed that increased HIV-associated inflammation and immune activation are the drivers of many non-AIDS complications. Accordingly, bone demineralization has been postulated to result from enhanced inflammation resulting in excessive stimulation of osteoclastogenesis leading to a net surplus of bone resorption <xref rid="pone.0106221-Yin1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, as illustrated by our study, the pathogenesis of osteoporosis is likely more complex as both regimens were associated with similar changes in inflammatory markers over time but had distinctly different effects on viral kinetics, BTMs, and BMD.</p><p>There are several limitations to our study that call for caution in interpreting the data presented. First, our study had a relative sample size that only allowed for the detection of larger differences between the arms. Second, we did use total and subtotal BMD, which are less precise than site-specific BMD. Also, while the measurements of bone turnover markers have been presented in HIV-infected patients in previous studies, reference ranges in this population are still unclear. Finally, the overwhelmingly male composition of the study population might limit its generalizability. Nonetheless, our findings appear to be in line with previous studies evaluating the nucleoside-free regimens such as ACTG 5262 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106221.s002">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>In summary, while not achieving a comparable virologic response, the NRTI-sparing regimen RAL + DRV/RTV was significantly more bone neutral than standard HAART with TDF/FTC + DRV/RTV. As bone health becomes more relevant in an aging HIV population, this potential benefit of NRTI-sparing regimens deserves closer examination.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Previous Presentations of the Data</title><p>Bedimo R, Drechsler H, Cutrell J, Jain M, Tebas P, and Maalouf N.
