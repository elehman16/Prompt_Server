With the constantly increasing availability of CCTA capable scanners worldwide, the number of examinations is likely to show further substantial increase. However, high radiation dose with conventional retrospective (electrocardiogram) ECG-gating draw much attention because of the usage of slow helical pitches and the x-ray beam being turned on throughout the cardiac cycle. To decrease the radiation dose, ECG controlled tube current modulation was developed. Despite this improvement, retrospective ECG-gating still leaves patients exposed to substantial radiation dose (8&#x02013;19 mSv) <xref rid="pone.0065025-Hausleiter1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065025-Einstein1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Prospective ECG-triggering, which combines step-and-shoot axial data acquisition and an incrementally moving table with adaptive ECG-triggering, represents the most effective approach with significant reduction of radiation dose by 60&#x02013;80% when compared with retrospective ECG-gating <xref rid="pone.0065025-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065025-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065025-Hausleiter2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

Patients with heart rate more than 70 bpm even after medications, heart rate variability more than 5 bpm or frequent ectopy were excluded from this study. Patients with known contradiction to iodinated contrast agent, inability to sustain a breath hold in the allotted time, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure and pregnant and lactating women were also excluded.

The scan sequences included a scout scanogram, a low dose calcium-scoring scan, a test-bolus (TB) scan, and a CCTA scan. The minimal z-axis coverage necessary to cover the entire coronary arteries was determined by calcium-scoring scan with the goal of minimizing radiation exposure.</p><p>Prior to each CCTA scan, TB scan was obtained every 2 s for 30 s after administration of the test bolus of 20 ml iodinated contrast (Ultravist 370; Schering, Berlin, Germany) at 5 ml/s. The timing for CCTA acquisition was determined by adding 4 s to the time of peak contrast enhancement in the center of aortic root at the level of the left main artery. The TB scan parameters were as following: 1&#x000d7;5 mm collimation, axial scan mode, 100 kV, 60 mA, 1.0 s rotation speed, display field of view (DFOV) of 250 mm, 512&#x000d7;512 matrix size, and slice thickness of 5 mm.</p><p>All scan parameters except the tube current were kept constant among the three different CCTA protocols, including 120 kV tube voltage, 64&#x000d7;0.625 mm collimation, 0.35 s rotation speed, DFOV of 250 mm, 512&#x000d7;512 matrix size, and 0.625 mm slice thickness. 60 ml of the iodinated contrast was injected followed by 40 ml saline at a rate of 5 ml/s for CCTA scan. All images were reconstructed using the same reconstruction kernel (standard). Three or four scan blocks per examination with 5 mm overlapping between blocks that can cover either 105 mm or 140 mm in the z-axis were available in our institution. A widening of the data acquisition window with the prospective scanning, also known as &#x0201c;padding&#x0201d;, was manually adjusted depending on the heart rate just before CCTA scan. In this study, 50 ms padding was used in patients with heart rates less than 65 bpm with a targeted cardiac phase at 75% of the R-R interval, while 180 ms padding in patients with heart rates between 65&#x02013;70 bpm with a targeted cardiac phase at 60% of the R-R interval. After each scan, additional retrospective reconstructions at different cardiac phases were performed for patients using 180 ms padding. Specifically, 70&#x02013;80% of the R-R interval (mid-diastole) was selected for heart rates less than 65 bpm during scan, while 30&#x02013;45% of the R-R interval (end-systole) for heart rates between 65&#x02013;70 bpm. 0 padding was not used even in patients with heart rates less than 65 bpm before CCTA scan in case of heart rate variability.</p><p>Tube current was fixed at 600 mA for all patients in Group 1, and was patient-depended on the noise of test bolus image in Group 2 and Group 3. For CCTA data reconstruction, FBP was applied for Group 1 and Group 2; and IR was applied for Group 3. IR applied in this study was ASIR (Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA), which was performed from both the projection data and image data. Only a limited number of iterations were required to complete an entire analysis for ASIR, so the average reconstruction time was approximately 40&#x02013;60% longer with the ASIR than with the standard FBP.

These findings illustrated the capability of a substantial reduction in radiation exposure by combining a noise-based tube current reduction method with IR in prospective ECG-triggered CCTA.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Prospective ECG-triggered CCTA</title><p>A worldwide radiation dose survey indicated that CCTA scan was associated with a median dose of 12 mSv <xref rid="pone.0065025-Hausleiter3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The increasing number of CCTA examinations has led to concerns regarding the risk of malignancies induced by the application of medical ionizing radiation. What&#x02019;s more, high radiation dose with retrospective ECG-gating draws much attention because of the usage of slow helical pitches and the x-ray beam being turned on throughout the cardiac cycle.</p><p>Prospective ECG-triggering is performed in a non-helical way with the acquisition of a series of axial images instead of volumetric data. Thus, radiation is administrated only at the pre-defined cardiac phases rather than throughout the entire cardiac cycle, which may reduce radiation exposure by approximately 60&#x02013;80% compared with the conventional retrospective ECG-gating <xref rid="pone.0065025-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065025-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065025-Hausleiter2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. A widening of the data acquisition window with prospective ECG-triggering, also known as &#x0201c;padding&#x0201d;, was recommended for all patients in our study. For low heart rate (less than 65 bmp) before CCTA scan, a narrower padding (50 mm) was used in prevention of heart rate varies during exam <xref rid="pone.0065025-Steigner1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. But if heart rate was high (more than 65 bpm) before exam, a wider padding (180 ms) was generally used. Then, additional reconstructions at different cardiac phases were obtained to find a cardiac phase with less cardiac motion. Therefore, application of padding helps to generate images with less motion artifacts in patients with higher heart rate or apparent heart rate variability. However, this leads to an increase of effective dose by up to 42% when compared to that without padding groups <xref rid="pone.0065025-Weigold1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Our multi-linear regression analysis demonstrated that the use of a wider padding (180 ms) was associated with a considerable (24.7%) increase of effective dose while adjusting for other scan characteristics. Thus, a low and regular heart rate is necessary for reducing dose in prospective ECG-triggering. In addition, the use of a shorter scan range of 105 mm (3 scan blocks) in our study population was associated with a decrease of effective dose of approximately 6.2%. Instead of rigidly scanning from the carina to diaphragm, scan range should be adjusted individually according to a prior performed low-dose scan (calcium scoring) <xref rid="pone.0065025-Hausleiter3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Noise-Based Tube Current Reduction Method</title><p>In CCTA with a fixed tube current (600 mA), either radiaton exposure would have been excessive for small patients to obtain aesthetic image quality or inadequate for large patients to produce poor image quality. Thus, the adjustment of tube current individually is essential for radiation dose optimization. BMI is the most commonly used parameter to determine tube current in clinical CCTA <xref rid="pone.0065025-Tatsugami1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, this method sometimes lacks precision and accuracy due to variation of the chest attenuation among patients <xref rid="pone.0065025-Blankstein1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In our study, BMI had a small effect (1.2%) on effective dose. The noise-based tube current reduction method directly reflects the chest attenuation in each patient, and more accurate tube current selection and dose optimization can be achieved for CCTA <xref rid="pone.0065025-Qi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Meanwhile, image noise could be precisely maintained at the desired level and more consistent image quality could be obtained across the patient populations. In line with our prior study <xref rid="pone.0065025-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, image noise was well kept at 35HU with small amount of variability [(IQR, 35.00&#x02013;35.03HU) with FBP and (IQR, 34.99&#x02013;35.02HU) with IR], which leads to more uniform qualitative image quality than that with a fixed tube current. Tube current modulation dose not necessarily mean tube current reduction in all cases, and in some cases (patients with high BMI) a higher tube current are required <xref rid="pone.0065025-Hur1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, it does reduce the overall tube current while imparting a statistically significant reduction in radiation exposure for the entire patient population. Our results show that effective dose was reduced by 20% for protocol using noise-based tube current compared with fixed tube current with the same FBP algorithm, which was higher than the percentage of dose reduction (14%) in our previous study <xref rid="pone.0065025-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The higher relative dose reducing may be due to the higher percent of cases with 180 ms padding in the fixed tube current group in this study (21.2% versus 13.8%) making the baseline slightly higher than the previous study.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Iterative Reconstruction Algorithm</title><p>In consistence with the ERSIR study <xref rid="pone.0065025-Leipsic2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, our study demonstrated that IR had a leading association (approximately 26%) with effective dose while adjusting for other scan characteristics. By iterative comparison of each synthesized forward projections to the actual measurements and modeling system statistics (photon statistics and image noise), IR is known for the potential to selectively reduce image noise without compromising signal intensity and spatial resolution <xref rid="pone.0065025-Hara1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The noise reduction properties of IR may permit the use of lower tube current with stable image noise and quality when compared with FBP using higher tube current, despite the decreased number of photons. Another advantage of IR is that it is supplemental to other radiation reduction techniques, and thus it is not necessary to compromise the choice of protocol. Our study showed that the noise-based tube current reduction method with IR reduced tube current by 40.59%, leading to a 38% decrease in effective dose without compromising image quality compared with that using FBP. This was similar to the finding of Leipsic et al. <xref rid="pone.0065025-Leipsic1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, who reported that noise reduction properties of IR (40%ASIR) would theoretically permit a tube current reduction of approximately 30&#x02013;40%, resulting in a proportional decrease in the effective dose without altering image noise and thus image quality. In our present study, the noise-based tube current reduction method with IR reduced 51% effective dose with the median effective dose of 1.8 mSv compared with the fixed tube current protocol, which was higher than the relative dose reduction (41%) in our previous study <xref rid="pone.0065025-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The higher relative dose reducing in this study may also be due to the higher percentage of cases with 180 ms padding in the fixed tube current group in the current study (21.2% versus 19.8%). Since sequential scan mode performed for all patients and fixed tube current (600 mA) used in the control group in our study, higher effective dose reduction (51% versus 44%) was achieved than the ERSIR study <xref rid="pone.0065025-Leipsic2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Another study by Hou et al. <xref rid="pone.0065025-Hou1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> achieved a higher reduction in effective dose (63%) with IR (1.2 mSv) compared with FBP (3.2 mSv). This might be related to the different scanner (256-slice muti-detecter CT) and different type of IR technique (iDose, Philips Healthcare) employed in their study. Although in their study no significant difference in objective image noise and image quality score was found between the IR and FBP groups, the standard deviation for the objective image noise was relatively large in both groups. On contrast, in our stuy, image noise was precisely maintained at the disired level (35HU) and more uniform image quality was achieved.</p><p>There were several limitations in our study. First, patient inclusion was limited to those with heart rates lower than 70 bmp because of the temporal resolution of the 64-slice single-source CT system. However, with careful patient selection and screening and with effective use of &#x003b2;-blocker for heart rate control, prospective ECG-triggering can be used in a high percentage of CCTA exams. Second, radiation dose data presented here were for the CCTA scan only, the examination also included scout scanogram, calcium-scoring scan and TB scan, which added an additional 0.73 mSv (IQR, 0.67&#x02013;0.78 mSv) to the exam. However, these pre-control scans are necessary for CCTA and present a smaller fraction of the total dose. Third, the IR algorithm used in our study represents a modified and limited form of IR. More advanced IR techniques can further improve image quality with substantial decreased image noise, allowing more aggressive reduction in radiation exposure <xref rid="pone.0065025-Scheffel1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, high computational cost and long reconstruction time remains a barrier for the complete IR in daily clinical application.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Noise-based tube current reduction method with IR maintains image noise precisely at the desired level individually and achieves consistent image quality across the entire patient population. In addition, with the former technique, overall radiation dose reduction is up to 51% but only for the patients who qualified. Based on our prospective randomized study, we recommend the use of the noise-based tube current reduction method in prospective ECG-triggered CCTA for patients with heart rates less than 70 bpm.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Dr Jianying Li, Huizhi Cao and Shichen Liu for technique suggestions and language revision.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0065025-Miller1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
