We tried to compare the effectiveness of intramuscular and subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (INF-&#x003b2;1a) in combination with oral doxycycline among patient with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS).</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods</title><p>A double-blind clinical trial study was conducted at Hamedan University of Medical and Health Sciences in Iran. Sixty patients with definite diagnosis of RRMS or SPMS were treated with doxycycline and 44 &#x000b5;g subcutaneous IFN-&#x003b2;1a three times a week or 30 &#x000b5;g intramuscular IFN-&#x003b2;1a once a week for six months.

Plaques of white matter, caused by demyelination and loss of axon in this area, are characteristics of MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref></sup> Exact pathogenesis of MS is not well understood. However, various theories including immune defect, genetic capacity, infectious diseases, mental stress, biochemical agents, diet, vitamin deficiency, and allergic reaction have been suggested.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref></sup>
</p><p>There are 5-10 cycles of hidden action in the course of MS that can be uncovered with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition, the disease manifests with clinical signs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref></sup> The most important factor in determination of disease process is relapse rate. Relapse is defined as acute or subacute clinical disorders that usually occur days to weeks after a cycle of recovery. Nearly 15% of the patients do not experience relapse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref></sup> Recurrent relapses in the first two years, advanced progress from beginning, male gender, and cerebellar or motor disorders can predict a poorer clinical course of the disease. On the other hand, female gender, dominant sensorial symptoms, and optic neuritis may have better prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref></sup> Based on disease pattern and progression, MS is categorized as relapsing-remitting MS (RPMS), primary-progressive MS (PPMS), secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), and progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS). Nowadays, the most common scales to assess disability of patients with MS is Kurtzke expanded disability status scale (EDSS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref></sup>
</p><p>The aim of treatment in patients with MS is to regulate the clinical course and reduce the complications of the disease. While acute attacks are usually treated with corticosteroid, interferon beta-1a (IFN-&#x003b2;1a) is reserved for the regulation of the clinical course. Probable mechanisms for MS treatment with IFN-&#x003b2;1ainclude the inhibition of adhesion, synthesis, and transfer of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and antigen blocking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref></sup>
</p><p>There is accumulating evidence that MMPs play a key role in the pathogenesis of many neuroinflammatory diseases. MMPs can be subdivided intocollagenase, gelatinase A and B, stromelysins-1, and inhibitors like plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). The activity of other MMPs is closely regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref></sup> MMP-9 is a well-known gelatinase B which is the most known protease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref></sup> The roles of MMP-9 are disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB), prevention of T cell migration into the CNS, and myelin destruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref></sup> Increased MMP-9 serum levels and decreased tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) serum levels provoke BBB rupture and T cell entrance to the nervous system which result in the formation of new lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref></sup>
</p><p>Nearly all previous studies have focused on T cell penetration to the nervous system. However, the role of B-cells in the nervous system cannot be overlooked. In fact, although T cells appear in the beginning of inflammation, there will be no demyelinationin the absence of B-cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref></sup> Treatment with IFN-&#x003b2;1a decreases MMP mRNA. It thus reduces T cell penetration to the CNS and cures the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref></sup>
</p><p>Boz et al. showed that body can rebalance MMP-9/TIMP-1after six months of treatment with IFN-&#x003b2;1a.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref></sup> Milanese et al. reported 20.5% decline in disability progression following beta interferon therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref></sup> Multiple studies in many regions have reported that the use of beta interferon in MS for two years significantly reduced MRI changes, clinical relapses, and yearly attacks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref></sup> A systematic review article on 21 studies from 1993 to 2001 reported IFN-&#x003b2;1a (Rebif, Avonex) to be significantly more effective than interferon beta-1b (IFN-&#x003b2;1b; Betaferon) in reducing the disability course of MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref></sup>
</p><p>In recent years, neuroprotective effects of tetracycline have been clearly shown in animal models with acute or chronic neurodegeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref></sup> This recent finding presented a new point of view about the cellular and molecular mechanisms through which tetracycline protects neurons and oligodendrocytes. However, only the second generation of tetracyclines is usable since they contain minocycline and doxycycline which are semisynthetic. Among the characteristics of these drugs are passing BBB easily and inhibiting MMP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref></sup> Doxycycline is absorbed rapidly and completely from the gastrointestinal tract. Since it is lipid soluble, it highly penetrates to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Doxycycline is tolerated much better than minocycline and is a strong MMP inhibitor. Since MMP-9 can cleavage and deactivate IFN-&#x003b2;, it can cause relapse during treatment. Therefore, relapse reduction can be expected following treatment with doxycycline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref></sup>
</p><p>Minagar et al. investigated combined therapy with IFN-&#x003b2;1a and doxycycline in 15 patients with RRMS. Individuals with RRMS taking IFN-&#x003b2;1a with breakthrough disease activity took 100 mg doxycycline daily for four months. During the study, only one patient experienced a relapse and adverse effects were little. There were no unexpected or synergistic adverse effects associated with combination therapy. The authors thus concluded that a combination of intramuscular IFN-&#x003b2;1a and oral doxycycline treatment is effective, safe, and well tolerated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref></sup>
</p><p>Until now, evidence about latest treatments to prevent the progressive course of MS has been contrasting. Therefore, we designed a trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a combination of doxycycline and IFN-&#x003b2;1a in treatment of MS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>On the base of Poser et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref></sup> and McDonald et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref></sup>diagnostic criteria, 14-51 year-old patients with definite diagnosis of MS were enrolled.

SPMS was defined as a deteriorative course and independent relapse that lasted for at least six months following one course of RRMS. Inclusion criteria for SPMS patients was EDSS scores less than 5.5, more than two relapses in the history of patients, and one point increase on the EDSS during the past two years.</p><p>Patients in both groups were excluded in case of receiving corticosteroid therapy during the three months before the study, receiving immunosuppressive therapy with cytotoxic agents, pregnancy, breastfeeding, or intolerance or sensitivity to doxycycline.</p><p>Demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants were recorded in a questionnaire after obtaining informed consents from all 60 patients (7 men and 53 women).

Both methods were combined with 100 mg doxycycline once daily for six months. Patient outcomes were evaluated with relapse rate on the basis of corticosteroid pulse and EDDS point changes.</p><p>Changes and deterioration in clinical disability after of six months of treatment were assessed by brain MRI before and after therapy. Standard brain MRI was taken from each patient with a 1.5-T scanner (imaging protocol: T1 sagittal, T1 and T2 axial, fluid attenuated inversion recoveryimages).

We found that a combination of intramuscular IFN-&#x003b2;1a and oral doxycycline could reduce relapse rate and EDSS scores in MS patients. However, the combination could not reduce contrast-enhancing lesions on brain MRI.</p><p>An open-label study assessed 11 patients with RRMS who had received doxycycline and intramuscular IFN-&#x003b2;1a for at least six months. The authors reported that lower number of lesions on brain MRI and reduced mean EDSS score (3.9 vs. 1.4) after treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref></sup> Another research surveyed the effectiveness of a 4-month combination therapy with doxycycline and IFN-&#x003b2;1a among 15 patients with RRMS.

</p><p>Changes in the appropriate balance of MMP-9/TIMP-1 are pathological effects that lead to inflammation and demyelination. As MMP-9 increases and TIMP-1 decreases, BBB rupture occurs and T cells arrive into the nervous system and make damage. In course of active MS, IFN-&#x003b2; therapy increases serum level of MMP-9. However, MMP-9 can reduce the effectiveness of interferon. Since doxycycline is a potent inhibitor of MMP-9, its usage is expected to decrease relapse rate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="S0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, data from this cohort study suggest that the combination of oral doxycycline and IFN-&#x003b2;1a may reduce relapse rate and EDSS scores in patients with MS. Nevertheless, it was not found to reduce the number of lesions on the brain. Further controlled clinical trials with larger sample size are warranted to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the mentioned combination over a longer
