A combination of interventions targeting multiple steps in the continuum is needed to achieve the full beneficial impact of HIV treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>Link4Health, a cluster-randomized controlled trial, evaluated the effectiveness of a combination intervention strategy (CIS) versus the standard of care (SOC) on the primary outcome of linkage to care within 1 month plus retention in care at 12 months after HIV-positive testing. Ten clusters of HIV clinics in Swaziland were randomized 1:1 to CIS versus SOC. The CIS included point-of-care CD4+ testing at the time of an HIV-positive test, accelerated antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation for treatment-eligible participants, mobile phone appointment reminders, health educational packages, and noncash financial incentives. Secondary outcomes included each component of the primary outcome, mean time to linkage, assessment for ART eligibility, ART initiation and time to ART initiation, viral suppression defined as HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c; 1,000 copies/mL at 12 months after HIV testing among patients on ART &#x02265;6 months, and loss to follow-up and death at 12 months after HIV testing. A total of 2,197 adults aged &#x02265;18 years, newly tested HIV positive, were enrolled from 19 August 2013 to 21 November 2014 (1,096 CIS arm; 1,101 SOC arm) and followed for 12 months. The median participant age was 31 years (IQR 26&#x02013;39), and 59% were women. In an intention-to-treat analysis, 64% (705/1,096) of participants at the CIS sites achieved the primary outcome versus 43% (477/1,101) at the SOC sites (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.52, 95% CI 1.19&#x02013;1.96, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002). Participants in the CIS arm versus the SOC arm had the following secondary outcomes: linkage to care regardless of retention at 12 months (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.97&#x02013;1.21, <italic>p</italic> = 0.13), mean time to linkage (2.5 days versus 7.5 days, <italic>p</italic> = 0.189), retention in care at 12 months regardless of time to linkage (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.18&#x02013;1.86, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002), assessment for ART eligibility (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07&#x02013;1.34, <italic>p</italic> = 0.004), ART initiation (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.96&#x02013;1.40, <italic>p</italic> = 0.12), mean time to ART initiation from time of HIV testing (7 days versus 14 days, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), viral suppression among those on ART for &#x02265;6 months (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.88&#x02013;1.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.55), loss to follow-up at 12 months after HIV testing (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40&#x02013;0.79, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002), and death (<italic>N</italic> = 78) within 12 months of HIV testing (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.46&#x02013;1.35, <italic>p</italic> = 0.41).

However, in order to achieve epidemic control, further optimization of the HIV care continuum is needed so as to achieve the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 90/90/90 targets, which require that 90% of individuals with HIV are aware of their diagnosis, that 90% of those aware of their HIV infection are initiated on ART, and that 90% of those on treatment achieve and maintain viral suppression [<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Findings from HIV programs indicate that linkage to and retention in HIV care currently fall far short of the desired goals [<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

In brief, Link4Health was an implementation science study using a cluster site-randomized trial design. The study unit of randomization consisted of a public secondary-level HIV clinic paired with its largest affiliated public primary-level HIV clinic. Ten study units were selected from a total of 11 existing secondary-level HIV clinics in the country, based on clinic patient volume. Study units were pair matched, first by implementing partner (matching the 2 study units from implementing partner A) and then by location (urban [<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] versus rural [<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]) and clinic size, based on the estimated number of adults testing HIV positive in the 2 years prior to study implementation (&#x0003c;50 versus &#x0003e;50 per month for rural study units and &#x0003c;100 versus &#x0003e;100 per month for urban study units). Matched study units were randomized by a computerized random number generator to the CIS or standard of care (SOC) study arm. A cluster design was chosen to avoid disruption of service delivery, enable better fit within the routine workings at the clinical site, and allow the clinic staff to more easily implement the study. The study staff and clinic providers at each study unit were not blinded to the assigned arm for the site.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Study setting and population</title><p>Swaziland is located in Southern Africa and has the world&#x02019;s highest HIV prevalence, with HIV as the leading cause of death in the country [<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

We estimated that approximately 2,750 adults would be eligible for study enrollment based on historic HIV testing volume and the proportion of individuals testing HIV positive at the study units in the year prior to the study start. Assuming 80% of eligible individuals would consent to enrollment, we estimated an average enrollment of 220 participants per study unit or 2,200 in total (1,110 per study arm). With this sample size and 5 study units per study arm, we then estimated the minimum difference in the primary outcome we could detect with 80% power, 2-sided alpha of 0.05, assuming an interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.05. In a post hoc analysis, we estimated the ICC of the primary outcome using the method outlined by Snijders and Bosker for binary outcome data [<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>An intent-to-treat analysis compared the relative risk (RR) of achieving the primary outcome between study arms, with each having 5 clusters per arm. Within study unit clustering was accounted for using random-intercept multilevel models. For dichotomous outcomes, log-Poisson models with robust standard error were used. For continuous outcomes, random-intercept linear regression models were used. Assessment of potential confounding despite cluster randomization was performed by constructing multivariable random-intercept regression models including covariates found statistically different between treatment arms at an alpha of 0.01. Additionally, we conducted a per-protocol analysis comparing the RR of achieving the primary outcome among participants who received the full package of the CIS for the duration of study participation. Sensitivity analysis assessed any changes to the intent-to-treat analysis after including self-reported linkage and retention obtained from follow-up surveys.

The robustness of this outcome is supported by the consistent findings in the per-protocol analysis, in sensitivity analyses, and across subgroups of participants. In addition, the combination strategy was associated with improvements across multiple steps of the care continuum, with an increased proportion of participants who were assessed for ART eligibility, decreased time to ART eligibility assessment, decreased time to ART initiation, increased retention at 12 months after HIV testing regardless of time to linkage and ART status, and decreased mortality among participants prior to ART initiation. However, high rates of viral suppression were similar among ART patients by study arm.</p><p>In our study, the effect noted on the primary outcome appeared to be largely driven by enhanced retention rather than by the linkage-to-care component. This finding may be due to the high proportion of participants in both study arms who linked to care within 1 month of HIV testing in both arms of the study (87% in the SOC arm and 92% in the CIS arm), and thus, our sample size was insufficient to show a difference between the arms. The high proportion of participant linkage was likely influenced by a national campaign to improve linkage that was implemented during the study period [<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The combination strategy significantly reduced loss to follow-up among participants regardless of whether they were in pre-ART care or on treatment. Loss to follow-up, in both study arms, was higher among pre-ART participants, as compared to participants who had initiated ART. This is consistent with findings from other studies, including those from a large study of 390,603 HIV-positive adults in Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Tanzania, in which 34.8% of all patients who had not initiated ART were lost from care at 12 months, compared to 5.8% among patients on ART [<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While the pre-ART care phase should largely be minimized with the release of the recent WHO guidelines that recommend offering ART to all HIV-positive individuals irrespective of CD4+ count or WHO disease stage, evidence suggests that retention in care and on ART remains a challenge even in the context of &#x0201c;treatment for all&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. For example, while adoption of Option B+, which entails initiation of ART for all HIV-positive pregnant women, has been associated with an increase in the number of pregnant women on ART, loss to follow-up has remained a challenge. Among 21,939 HIV-infected pregnant women who started ART as per Option B+ in Malawi, 17% were lost to follow-up at 6 months after treatment start, with a 5-fold higher loss to follow-up compared to those who initiated ART at a more advanced stage of HIV disease [<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Thus, the findings from our study remain relevant even though the study was conducted at a time when a CD4+ count threshold was recommended for ART initiation.</p><p>In this study, viral suppression was high among all participants on ART for a minimum of 6 months, irrespective of study arm. This confirms the potency of the first-line regimen, consisting of tenofovir, lamivudine, and efavirenz or nevirapine, and suggests that participants were highly adherent to their medications. These findings build upon those from the Population-based HIV Impact Assessment Project surveys that were conducted recently in Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Swaziland, which included nationally representative samples of individuals in which 87% of HIV-positive adults who reported being on ART were virally suppressed (HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c; 1,000 copies/ml) [<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Findings from this project survey in Swaziland showed that among adults who were aware of their HIV-positive status and who indicated being on ART, 92% had a suppressed viral load [<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The finding of similarly high proportions of viral suppression among participants in both arms of our study suggests that the sample size was insufficient to detect a difference. In addition, it is important to note that the interventions used in this study were not designed with a focus specifically on enhancing medication adherence and viral suppression. Design of future combination strategies may prioritize the use of interventions that focus specifically on enhancing adherence to ART, such as the use of financial incentives to improve viral suppression [<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>Every effort was made to ascertain accurate loss to follow-up and mortality outcomes in our study. It should be noted that reporting of accurate loss to follow-up and mortality outcomes by HIV programs has been a controversial topic. This is due to the fact that when tracing was done for individuals reported as lost to follow-up by HIV programs, a substantial proportion were found to have either died or transferred care to another health facility [<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. We feel confident that it is unlikely that such misclassification occurred in our study as home tracing was conducted for all study participants to ascertain their outcomes at the end of the 12-month follow-up period. While the study was not powered to detect a difference between the study arms in terms of mortality, the combination strategy appeared to have a meaningful&#x02014;albeit not statistically significant&#x02014;effect, with as much as 50% lower mortality noted among pre-ART patients. This may be due to better retention in care among participants in the intervention arm. Poor retention in care has been demonstrated to be associated with increased mortality, likely due to missed clinic visits that deprive patients of clinical and laboratory assessments for diagnosis of early complications and delay prompt initiation of ART [<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>We observed substantial heterogeneity in the primary outcome across clinics in both the CIS and SOC study arms. This may reflect clinic-level differences such as clinic size and location. For example, the CIS study unit with the lowest achievement of the study&#x02019;s primary outcome was the largest clinic in urban Swaziland. It is possible that individuals who test HIV positive at such a large clinic may seek ongoing care at clinics closer to their homes. Other reasons could be differences in patient-level factors, such as sex, age, and immunological status, which warrant further analyses.</p><p>To date, most intervention studies to address gaps in the HIV care continuum have focused on 1 step in the continuum, largely that of ART initiation. The Rapid Initiation of Treatment trial showed that single-visit ART initiation that included POC CD4+ count testing was associated with significantly higher ART initiation (97%) compared to the standard of care (72%) [<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The START-ART trial was a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial of 20 clinics in Uganda that evaluated an intervention aimed at improving ART initiation among eligible patients; this intervention was associated with a higher proportion of patients initiating ART (80%) within 14 days after determination of ART eligibility compared to 38% in the control group [<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Finally, the Same Day ART Initiation Study in Haiti, which evaluated the effect of same-day ART initiation on the day of HIV diagnosis among asymptomatic HIV-positive adults with CD4+ count &#x02264; 500 cells/uL and WHO stage I or II disease, noted that a higher proportion (53%) of participants randomized to same-day ART initiation were retained in care at 12 months with viral suppression compared to those in the standard of care arm (44%) [<xref rid="pmed.1002420.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Our study had several strengths, including the use of a pragmatic approach consistent with implementation science design. Specifically, it utilized broad eligibility criteria, was conducted within established health facilities, tested feasible interventions that were delivered primarily by available staff rather than research staff, and assessed the primary outcome largely through routinely available data. In addition, the study included the majority of clinics in Swaziland and involved cluster-randomized design rather than randomization of individual participants, which allowed for ease of implementation and avoided disruption of services within the clinics. The study also uniquely assessed the effect of the delivery of multiple interventions packaged in 1 strategy aimed at multiple steps in the HIV care continuum. Thus, implementation of the study strategy has the potential to achieve not only prompt ART initiation but also better retention in care and on ART, consequently enhancing individual and society benefits from the &#x0201c;treat all&#x0201d; approach.</p><p>The primary limitations of this study included a limited number of clusters, although it was inclusive of all the available clusters in the country. At the time of study initiation, there were only 11 secondary health facilities offering HIV services in Swaziland, and we selected 10 of these for participation in this study. Consequently, it is possible that the cluster randomization did not evenly distribute all determinants of linkage and retention other than the study interventions between treatment arms. While it is encouraging that analyses adjusting for individual-level differences between treatment arms did not appreciably change the results, we cannot definitively rule out residual confounding as a potential explanation of the findings. In addition, the design focused on evaluation of a package of interventions as 1 strategy and, thus, it did not allow for evaluation of the effectiveness of individual components of the combination approach. Another limitation was use of self-reported linkage and retention at other clinics to ascertain undocumented transfers to other clinics outside of the study unit.</p><sec id="sec024"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The Link4Health study demonstrated that a combination strategy of evidence-based interventions, aimed at gaps in various steps of the HIV care continuum, was highly effective in enhancing linkage of HIV-positive individuals to care plus increasing their retention in care and on ART. The study also showed that once participants initiated ART, viral load suppression was high irrespective of the study arm. Cost effectiveness and qualitative analyses are ongoing in order to inform decision makers considering adoption of this strategy. Our findings offer an effective strategy that can advance the quality of HIV programs in Swaziland and that can be adapted to other similar contexts.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002420.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002420.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002420.s002"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Link4Health deidentified dataset.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002420.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002420.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Primary outcome by prespecified participant subgroup.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002420.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ART</term><def><p>antiretroviral therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CIS</term><def><p>combination intervention strategy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DBS</term><def><p>dried blood sample</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p>interclass correlation coefficient</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PITC</term><def><p>provider-initiated testing and counselling</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>POC</term><def><p>point of care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RR</term><def><p>relative risk</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SMS</term><def><p>short message service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOC</term><def><p>standard of care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SU</term><def><p>study unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TB</term><def><p>tuberculosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UNAIDS</term><def><p>Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VCT</term><def><p>voluntary HIV counselling and testing</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pmed.1002420.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>McNairy</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name>, <name><surname>El-Sadr</surname><given-names>WM</given-names></name>. <article-title>The HIV care continuum: no partial credit given</article-title>. <source>AIDS</source>. <year>2012</year>;<volume>26</volume>(<issue>14</issue>):<fpage>1735</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>8</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1097/QAD.0b013e328355d67b">10.1097/QAD.0b013e328355d67b</ext-link></comment> .<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22614888</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pmed.1002420.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">UNAIDS.
