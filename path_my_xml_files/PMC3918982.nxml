All patients referred to Papworth Hospital, UK for non-urgent angiography were eligible for the study. Inclusion criteria were: established or suspected chronic stable angina and a positive exercise tolerance test result with subsequent referral for angiography. Exclusion criteria were: recent MI (&#x0003c;3&#x02005;months), revascularisation (&#x0003c;6&#x02005;months); urgent need for revascularisation; contraindication to adenosine or CMR; inability to exercise.</p><p>Trial design was of four parallel arms with a 1:1:1:1 randomisation ratio. Randomisation was computer generated and stratified according to Pryor risk assessment.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Within each Pryor risk group, randomisation was in blocks of length 6 or 8. Sequentially numbered group designation was held in the research and development (R&#x00026;D) office and was not available to trial personnel. Patients were randomised to their initial diagnostic test&#x02014;stress SPECT, stress CMR, stress echocardiography or angiography&#x02014;by R&#x00026;D within 4&#x02005;weeks of recruitment and only after they had given consent and been registered.</p><p>Non-invasive imaging results were returned with a recommendation to proceed with angiography only when reported as &#x02018;positive&#x02019; for inducible ischaemia. Protocol adherence to this recommendation was not mandated by trial design and patients proceeded to angiography if considered clinically indicated.

If necessary, 300&#x02013;600&#x02005;&#x003bc;g of atropine were added at peak stress to achieve 90% of target heart rate. Images were acquired in standard planes in the final minute of each 3&#x02005;min stage. Intravenous microspheres were used to delineate the endocardial surface.

This assumes that the instantaneous risk of death (hazard) for a reference value of a covariate will vary through time, but that the hazards for other values of the covariate will be a constant multiple of this baseline hazard, and this multiple will not vary through time. This assumption was tested using Schoenfeld residuals and there was little evidence against it. The diagnostic test was entered into the Cox regression as a four-level fixed covariate, with angiography as the reference category. In sensitivity analysis CABG and PCI were included in the regression analyses as time-varying covariates, taking a value 0 up to the time of intervention and 1 thereafter, to ensure that any differences between the groups was not due to differences in treatment. Inclusion of treatment (CABG/PCI) did not affect comparison of diagnostic strategies and results of these analyses are not included here.</p><p>Patient-specific hospital resource use was collected for 2&#x02005;years post-<italic>treatment</italic> with revascularisation or medical management. Costs were based on National Health Service reference costs 2005/2006 prices. An annual discount rate of 3.5% was applied to all costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) after 12&#x02005;months postrandomisation. Resources costed were: imaging tests; revascularisation; inpatient/outpatient episodes; adverse events; cardiac-related medications. Patient-reported admissions for MI were verified with the admitting hospital and adjudicated.</p><p>Quality-adjusted survival and cost-estimates were censored at the last follow-up at 2&#x02005;years after treatment, resulting in varying duration of follow-up from the time of randomisation to the different diagnostic strategies, so that mean values over a range of time horizons were estimated using inverse weighting methods.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This method allows for differing follow-up times between patients by splitting follow-up time into intervals, and up-weighting the observed quality-adjusted survival and costs in an interval in proportion to the inverse of the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the proportion observed during the interval. In the base case we used a time horizon of 3&#x02005;years since it was the longest period over which results were stable, with acceptable precision. CIs for costs and QALYs were estimated using bootstrapping with 5000 samples.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Sensitivity analysis</title><p>Sensitivity of cost-utility results for different time horizons was assessed by re-estimating results up to 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48&#x02005;months after randomisation. In addition, cardiologists were divided into those who did and did not perform PCI as part of their routine clinical practice, and the results were recalculated for each subgroup. With the exception of this post hoc data interrogation, all other results presented derive from the intention-to-treat analysis.</p><p>The study had Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and full written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

To the best of the authors&#x02019; knowledge there has been no comparable outcomes trial published on this scale evaluating three independent non-invasive &#x02018;gatekeeper&#x02019; modalities versus initial angiography in stable chest pain. The trial is also unusual in the length of prospective follow-up extending to 6&#x02005;years for mortality outcomes.</p><p>We have demonstrated that use of any one of stress CMR, stress ECHO or stress SPECT as the initial test for a stable chest pain patient leads to non-inferior outcomes in quality of life and cost-utility compared with patients randomised to upfront invasive CA. Typically, non-invasive tests perform well in low-risk populations because of a negative predictive value which is usually better than the positive predictive value. However, the patient risk profile was relatively high in our study, and despite this there was no significant difference between an initial functional or anatomic approach.</p><p>There are several reasons why initial angiography may not have led to clear benefit in our study. First, although angiography has stood at the heart of the diagnostic chest pain pathway, the traditional binary cut-off values of 50% or 70% stenosis by visual estimation were shown in the FAME study to bear little relation to the true physiological significance of luminal narrowing.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Second, data from various countries suggest that not only is CA often inappropriate when formally rated by expert observers<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> but that disparate national or regional rates of angiography do not translate into clear mortality benefits between countries<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;28</xref> and on occasion may even demonstrate an inverse relationship.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Contemporary US data from approximately 500&#x02005;000 PCI procedures collected prospectively in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry demonstrated that, of 145&#x02005;000 elective PCI cases, roughly 12% were judged inappropriate. Furthermore, the rate of inappropriate elective PCI between hospital sites ranged from 0% to 55% suggesting significant variability in practice.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The data suggest that a better way of selecting patients for invasive investigation is needed.</p><p>Ischaemia-driven revascularisation has been shown to be of benefit in a number of trials, most recently in the FAME study in which an invasive method of measuring the flow reserve of the microcirculation (Fractional Flow Reserve, FFR) was used to allocate patients to intervention or observation versus a clinical decision on intervention based on angiography alone.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> At 2&#x02005;years of follow-up there were clear survival and MACE benefits to the FFR-based approach.</p><p>The ACRE study reported that, up to 6&#x02005;years after diagnosis, medical management was a more cost-effective strategy for angina compared with PCI.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The lack of evidence for survival from revascularisation was also seen in the COURAGE trial.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Critics have suggested this may be because randomisation to PCI versus optimal medical therapy was made <italic>after</italic> CA had been performed, potentially leading to a recruitment bias of patients with less severe disease. In the CECaT trial this bias was avoided by randomisation to a management strategy defined by the non-invasive test result for each of the three functional arms of the trial. In a relatively high-risk population, we demonstrated no clinically significant survival or economic detriment from using non-invasive imaging as a gate-keeper to catheterisation. Similarly, quality of life was not significantly different across all four groups and these differences extended to a warranty period of at least 3&#x02005;years.</p><p>We did observe a marginal decrease in survival in the CMR arm. The reasons for the difference are unclear but do not relate to patient characteristics or management with CABG or PCI. Although statistically significant, the mean survival difference from the other groups was only 4&#x02005;weeks over 3&#x02005;years and is unlikely to be clinically meaningful. Since recent work has established a strong correspondence between FFR measurements and stress CMR perfusion indices it would be surprising if CMR were genuinely inferior to other modalities for risk stratification.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Indeed several recent publications have highlighted the incremental prognostic data (above that obtained from clinical variables) derived from several thousand perfusion CMR studies.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>Given the recent publication of the CEMARC trial<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> in which a clear diagnostic superiority was demonstrated for stress CMR over SPECT, it is interesting that our data nonetheless show an equivalence in functional health status between those randomised to SPECT versus CMR in the CECaT trial. The implication may be that although CMR detects the presence of <italic>any</italic> ischaemia with a greater sensitivity it is the <italic>overall burden</italic> of ischaemia that alters a patient's prognosis. As such, it has not yet been demonstrated that the higher diagnostic accuracy of CMR translates into better long-term patient outcomes&#x02014;a fact acknowledged by Greenwood<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> subsequent to CEMARC's publication. In this context the CECaT nuclear results are congruent with numerous past publications and reconfirm the reassuring warranty period of a normal SPECT study.</p><sec id="s6a"><title>Cost-effectiveness</title><p>There was no significant difference in cost-effectiveness between the angiography-as-default group and the non-invasive test groups up to 3&#x02005;years, perhaps relating to the higher-than-anticipated rate of referral for angiography after negative functional tests. Protocol deviation of this kind is not infrequent in trials of non-invasive technology. In the recent PARR-2 study of patients undergoing fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for the assessment of viability, roughly 25% of the study population did not adhere to the protocol.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> The willingness of a cardiologist to defer referral for CA in the face of a normal non-invasive study may in part reflect individual prejudices and job description (interventional vs non-invasive) as demonstrated in a recent survey of cardiology attitudes<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and was also reflected in our own data.</p><p>In CECaT, 20&#x02013;25% of patients receiving a non-invasive test did not go on to have angiography. A proportion of the additional cost in the non-invasive arms related to angiography and PCI in the patients with a <italic>negative</italic> test, although only very few subsequently required CABG&#x02014;a robust marker of significant disease&#x02014;during follow-up. This readiness to employ PCI in a group in whom the indication/benefit is debatable was also seen in the ACRE trial<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and reflects understandable clinical response to uncertainty but also the easy access to PCI in healthcare systems without barriers to self-referral.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Similarly, studies from the USA have demonstrated a greater willingness to use CA when available &#x02018;on site&#x02019; as is increasingly seen even in small-to-medium sized hospitals.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41&#x02013;43</xref></p></sec><sec id="s6b"><title>Cost-effectiveness of each non-invasive technique</title><sec id="s6b1"><title>Nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging</title><p>The END study used propensity matching to compare a large cohort of patients referred for either gate-keeper myocardial perfusion imaging or upfront angiography&#x02014;this non-randomised study demonstrated a significant cost-reduction in the nuclear arm.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> In contrast to this and other work<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45&#x02013;47</xref> we were unable to show a significant difference in cost-effectiveness in our own study. To some extent this reflected the participating physician bias towards angiography during the period of trial recruitment (2001&#x02013;2006) with many patients referred for angiography despite normal perfusion studies. This continues in the contemporary era with Chan <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> demonstrating that almost 80% of Delphi-adjudicated inappropriate elective PCIs were performed following either low-risk ischaemia imaging in mildly symptomatic patients or intermediate risk imaging in entirely asymptomatic patients.</p><p>In the CECaT study, when PCI was performed despite a negative initial non-invasive test, this occurred because subsequent angiography indicated &#x02018;significant&#x02019; stenosis.

<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Further improvement in cost-effectiveness could likely have been achieved in the nuclear arm of the trial. Our post-trial practice is to perform the stress SPECT first&#x02014;and if this is negative&#x02014;cancel the rest test, likely augmenting the relative cost-effectiveness of SPECT.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></p></sec><sec id="s6b2"><title>CMR</title><p>There are relatively few data available regarding the cost-effectiveness of CMR. One recent mathematical modelling study estimated that CMR likely has greater cost-effectiveness/utility compared with SPECT despite greater base case cost of the former.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> The economic superiority of CMR was also recently described by the CEMARC group, although interestingly the base case costs employed for CMR and SPECT in their analysis differed by only a few pounds. Their own sensitivity analysis in fact demonstrated that if the costs of the two tests varied by more than 100 pounds (which was the case in our study) then in fact&#x02014;as we found&#x02014;SPECT became the dominant strategy in a low-to-intermediate risk population.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></p></sec><sec id="s6b3"><title>Stress ECHO</title><p>Stress echocardiography may be a more cost-effective strategy than angiography for men aged 50&#x02013;60 with CAD prevalence of 50%.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>

This might be interpreted as reflecting a need for greater physician education since we showed a clear difference in onward referral rates for angiography after a negative test between interventional and non-invasive cardiologists.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6c"><title>Clinical effectiveness</title><p>We demonstrated that SPECT can obviate the need for CA for a significant number of patients without any clinical detriment. In the stress ECHO group clinical outcomes were also comparable to the angiography subgroup at 18&#x02005;months. The CMR group had statistically marginally poorer survival and this follows our earlier finding that CMR patients had significantly worse exercise tolerance at 18&#x02005;months after randomisation.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This is difficult to explain on the basis of Pryor risk score or other baseline clinical variables. However, the mean difference in survival between the CMR arm and the other groups was only 4&#x02005;weeks and thus of marginal clinical significance. More importantly, the CMR group were not otherwise disadvantaged&#x02014;compared with the angiographic control group&#x02014;with respect to major adverse events, other resource use, or quality of life.</p></sec><sec id="s6d"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study was carried out in a single specialist cardiothoracic centre with a significant proportion of high risk, predominantly white European, male patients.
