Patients with edentulous mandibles received two Straumann Bone Level implants (diameter 3.3&#x000a0;mm, SLActive&#x000ae;), one of TiZr (test) and one of Ti Grade IV (control), in the interforaminal region. This follow-up study recruited patients from the core study and evaluated the plaque and sulcus bleeding indices, radiographic crestal bone level, as well as implant survival and success 60&#x000a0;months after implant placement.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 91 patients who initially received implants, 75 completed the 36&#x000a0;month follow-up and 49 were available for the 60&#x000a0;month examination. Two patients were excluded so that a total of 47 patients with an average age of 72&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;years were analysed. The characteristics and 36-month performance of the present study cohort did not differ from the non-included initial participants (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). In the period since the 36-month follow-up examination, no implant was lost. The cumulative implant survival rate was 98.9&#x000a0;% for the TiZr group and 97.8&#x000a0;% for the Ti Grade IV group. Crestal bone level changes at 60&#x000a0;months were not different in the test and control group (TiZr &#x02212;0.60&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.69&#x000a0;mm and Ti Grade IV &#x02212;0.61&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.83&#x000a0;mm; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.96).

This presents the dental profession with more edentulous patients, where physiological ageing and multimorbidity often dominate the dental treatment planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Age-adequate treatment planning requires easy to manage and reversible treatment concepts which take into consideration a reduced hand grip strength, dexterity, vision and tactile sensitivity of the patient. Prospective planning is required in view of a potential future functional decline which may render the patient dependent for the activities of daily living. The implant mandibular overdenture with two interforaminal implants presents a multitude of functional and psycho-social improvements for the edentulous patient when compared to a conventional complete denture, which often falls short in fully restoring impaired oral function after tooth loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Encouraged by long-term success of implant-overdentures, the indications of endosseous implants are more extended to clinically challenging situations in terms of available bone volume for implant anchorage as well as compromised general health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Progress in the implant surfaces have allowed for shorter healing times and improved osseointegration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. New alloys have been developed with improved mechanical properties which allow diameter-reduced implants being inserted even in clinically unfavourable anatomical conditions and thus further extend the indications for implant restorations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is important that implants are designed to have the possibility for a &#x0201c;back-off&#x0201d; strategy if a less retentive and sophisticated restoration is needed in end of life care. In this aspect, two-piece implants present the advantage that the abutment can be removed and exchanged for a lower retention abutment or even a healing cap when functional decline renders denture management or denture wearing difficult. As neuroplasticity is diminished in old age, treatment planning includes avoiding comprehensive changes of dental restorations in very old age, thus preferring versatile and transformable prosthodontic restorations.</p><p>Titanium is considered the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; for dental implants due to its corrosion resistance and biocompatibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but titanium alloys containing zirconium show even better tensile and fatigue strength than pure titanium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. For increasing the strength for small-diameter two-piece implants, titanium-zirconium (TiZr) alloy (Roxolid&#x000ae;; Institut Straumann AG, Basel, Switzerland) implants with the SLActive&#x000ae; surface have been introduced. 36&#x000a0;months non-inferiority of Roxolid&#x000ae; implants was reported for mandibular overdentures in a multi-center RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The present study aims to confirm the safety and long term clinical performance in terms of crestal bone level change, physical stability and peri-implant health of Roxolid&#x000ae; implants after 60&#x000a0;months in the previously reported patient cohort provided with two-implant-based overdentures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was designed as prospective 5 to 10&#x000a0;years follow-up of a randomized, controlled, double-blind, split-mouth, multi-centre clinical trial that came to its end after 36&#x000a0;months (core study). The materials and methods of the core study have been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and will be briefly summarized here. The core study has been conducted at eight sites in five countries (Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland). The follow-up study was conducted at 6 sites in 4 countries (Belgium, Germany, Italy and Switzerland). The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (ISO 14155:2011) and approved by the Independent Ethics Committees of the coordinating investigator and all study sites. All participating patients gave their written informed consent. The study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (registration no.

The exclusion criteria essentially referred to various medical conditions and can be consulted in the first publication of the core study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. All patients had presented with an edentulous mandible and had received two Straumann Bone Level implants (Institut Straumann AG, Basel, Switzerland) in the interforaminal region, randomly allocated to one side in a double-blind, split-mouth design. Both implants had exactly the same design with a diameter of 3.3&#x000a0;mm and a SLActive surface, the test implant was fabricated from titanium-zirconium (TiZr) and the control implant from Grade IV titanium (Ti Grade IV).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Clinical procedure</title><p>In the core study, surgery had been performed under local anaesthesia following a standard surgical procedure. Implants of 8, 10, 12 and 14&#x000a0;mm length had been inserted and healing abutments had been installed to allow for trans-mucosal healing. Sutures had been removed 1 to 2&#x000a0;weeks after surgery and the healing abutments had been replaced by Locator abutments (Zest Anchors LLC, Escondido, CA, USA) 6 to 8&#x000a0;weeks after implant placement. Within two weeks following abutment connection the removable dentures were relined to incorporate the female Locator parts. No metal framework was placed. The patients had attended follow-up visits at 6, 12, 24 and 36&#x000a0;months. Patients from 6 centres who consented for the follow-up study were recalled for the 60&#x000a0;month clinical visit.

Adapted from the Buser criteria, implant success was defined as follows: The possibility for restoration, the absence of persistent patient complaints (pain, foreign body sensation and/or dysesthesia), the absence of recurrent peri-implant infection with suppuration, the absence of implant mobility and the absence of continuous radiolucency around the implant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Peri-implant bone level</title><p>Standardized panoramic radiographs had been taken at baseline and 6, 12, 24, 36 and 60&#x000a0;months after implant placement (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Both types of implants had a SLActive surface. After an observation period of 60&#x000a0;months, no significant differences in crestal bone level change, clinical parameters or survival and success rates were found between the groups. The outcomes seen at 12 as well as 36&#x000a0;months continued until 60&#x000a0;months, indicating that TiZr implants in this clinical setting were comparable to Ti Grade IV implants.</p><p>Long-term observations are highly relevant when recommending a medical device for clinical use, even more so for elderly patients, where prosthodontic restorations should be designed for long-term survival, as renewal of prostheses might become difficult with increasing frailty and multimorbidity. Adjustments which may become necessary to adapt the prosthodontic restoration to functional decline should rather be performed by a simple alteration of the denture to minimize the challenges to an elderly person&#x02019;s neuroplasticity and capacity of adaptation. Complications or failures in late life can be minimized when using only well documented and high quality materials for dental restorations. Biological complications may still occur, as the overall risk of implant failure seems influenced by biological parameters like history of periodontal disease or residual periodontal pockets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Patient behaviour such as smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] unfavourable oral hygiene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] or the absence of an adequate peri-implant width of keratinized and attached mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] may also play a role. Technical aspects such as implant design and surface may also largely vary the clinical outcome, as was recently demonstrated in a large-scale industry independent study on implant survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In this study the mentioned risk factors were confirmed, and in addition, implant length and implant brand were identified as relevant factors for implant survival and success.</p><p>The present data confirm that Roxolid&#x000ae; implants were comparable to the traditional Grade IV titanium alloy in 3.3&#x000a0;mm diameter implants for an implant-supported mandibular overdenture over a 60&#x000a0;months period. This confirmation is of particular importance with regard to the above mentioned concern about safety and quality of implant materials in pre-elderly and elderly patients. The peri-implant bone loss, modified Plaque Index, modified Sulcus Bleeding Index as well as implant success and survival are not statistically different between the two implant materials. One of the strengths of this study is the split-mouth design, which provides an identical biological environment to the test and control implant. Another strength is the use of 3.3&#x000a0;mm diameter implants in a region, where the bone volume might often, but not always be available for larger diameter implants. Even the right- or left handedness of a patient or the preferred chewing side may not have influenced the results, as the side-attribution of the test and control group was randomized. However, any clinical study has inherent inconsistencies, as one patient may vary from the other in a multitude of aspects. A further substantial shortcoming is that not all of the 92 patients who originally received implants were available for all follow-up visits. The core study was planned for 36&#x000a0;months, and ethical permission and insurance had expired after this follow-up period and renewal was necessary. One centre had only one participant recruited, and it seemed unreasonable to undergo the effort of study submission to the Ethics Committee for this single case. A further centre did not obtain ethical approval in time. A total of 26 patients was lost for recruitment for the present study. A worst-case survival rate was therefore calculated at 53.8&#x000a0;%. However, knowing that 10 patients were not included for formal reasons, and taking into account that the included patients did not differ statistically from the not-included participants from the core study at baseline as well as at 12, 24 and 36&#x000a0;month follow-up, it seems reasonable to assume that this worst-case scenario is unrealistic. The crestal bone level changes reported in the present study are within the range reported in the literature for similar clinical indications. A recent meta-analysis on marginal bone level changes at dental implants after an observation period of 60&#x000a0;months concludes that the annual bone loss is below or much below what hitherto has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The marginal bone loss noted in the present patient cohort after 60&#x000a0;months was &#x02212;0.60&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.69&#x000a0;mm for the TiZr group and &#x02212;0.61&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.83&#x000a0;mm in the Ti Grade IV group, respectively. The reported bone level changes after 60&#x000a0;months are in between the one reported by Laurell end Lundgren for the Straumann Dental Implant System (0.48&#x000a0;mm (95&#x000a0;% CI &#x02212;0.598, &#x02212;0.360) and the Br&#x000e5;nemark System with 0.75&#x000a0;mm (95&#x000a0;% CI &#x02212;0.802, &#x02212;0.693). When comparing these results with the ones from the meta-analysis, one has to keep in mind that both, elderly and edentulous patients are at particular risk for reduced oral hygiene measures. Around one third of this study&#x02019;s patient cohort did present with modified Plaque Index and modified Sulcus Bleeding Index scores above zero. However, little is known on the impact of biofilm on the peri-implant bone level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], especially for elderly patients with an aged immune system. The relation between peri-implantitis and oral hygiene will be of increasing importance for the dental profession, as a growing number of patients with implants will age, hence poor oral hygiene seems pre-programmed.</p><p>The benefits of implant overdentures for edentulous patients are well documented and the cost-effectiveness of this treatment protocol has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Compared to conventional dentures, the chewing efficiency may be significantly improved, given that new implant-supported removable overdentures are manufactured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The chewing muscles seem more trained due to the improved chewing performance and after stabilizing a lower denture by means of implants the muscle bulk can be re-gained, even in very old adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A similar effect of training and re-training was shown also for the leg muscles in a geriatric context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Further improvements of overdentures compared to conventional complete dentures comprise denture satisfaction and Oral Health Related Quality of Life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], although these outcome measures are complex and may vary between cultures and personalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Elderly persons are in general less demanding concerning an improvement of their denture performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], yet do in general appreciate an improvement of their chewing performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Nevertheless, around one third of edentulous patients reject implant insertion because they object the surgical intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Low-diameter implants may not only have a positive effect on the preservation of the residual alveolar ridge and therefore be biologically favourable in certain clinical situations. They may also avoid invasive bone augmentation procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] whereby patient&#x02019;s morbidity as well as treatment costs and time can be reduced significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and the smaller the intervention, the more likely is the acceptance in edentulous patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion it can be stated that the TiZr alloy (Roxolid&#x000ae;) implants provide a long-term safe and reliable alternative to the available portfolio of dental implants, traditionally manufactured from Ti Grade IV. The improved mechanical properties of TiZr may extend the indications in implant therapy to more challenging clinical situations and allow promoting a minimal invasive treatment approach which is particularly suitable for elderly patients.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>Adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Intent to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mPI</term><def><p>Modified plaque index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mSBI</term><def><p>Modified sulcus bleeding index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PP</term><def><p>Per protocol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>Serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TiZr</term><def><p>Titanium-zirconium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Ti Grade IV</term><def><p>Titanium grade IV</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.
