Blood markers of muscle damage (skeletal muscle slow troponin I, sTnI; myoglobin, Mb; creatine kinase, CK), and inflammation (tumor necrosis factor, TNF-&#x003b1;), and functional measures of muscle damage (delayed onset muscle soreness, DOMS; pressure pain threshold, PPT; knee extensor joint range of motion, ROM; isometric torque, MVC) were assessed pre- supplementation (baseline), and multiple time points post-supplementation (before and after muscle damaging exercise).

Delayed-onset muscle soreness is generally considered a hallmark sign of EIMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and it is thought that DOMS is partially related to direct muscle fiber damage, and its magnitude appears to vary with the type, duration and intensity of exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The inflammatory response to EIMD results in the release into blood of reactive species from both neutrophils and macrophages, and an array of cytokines from the injured muscle including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2; and IL-6, which contribute to a low-grade systemic inflammation and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The pro- inflammatory and pro-oxidant response can provoke secondary tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], thus prolonging the regenerative process, which is generally characterized by a restoration of muscle strength and resolution of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Exercise-induced muscle damage and DOMS can potentially hinder performance in activities ranging from basic physical activity to athletic training and competition. There are a number of strategies that have been used to attenuate EIMD and DOMS such as anti-inflammatory medication, cryotherapy, massage, stretching, hyperbaric oxygen, homeopathy, ultrasound, rest, light exercise and electrotherapeutic modalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The use of non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and continued exercise appear to be the most commonly used methods to treat DOMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, while the use of NSAIDs has been shown to decrease perceived muscle soreness and pain associated with DOMS, they fail to impact the length or degree of muscle weakness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], may be detrimental to muscle cell repair and adaptation by decreasing satellite cell activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and have been shown to suppress the protein synthesis response in skeletal muscle after eccentric resistance exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Due to the fact that there appears to be no completely effective treatment for preventing/reducing EIMD and treating DOMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], the use of complimentary therapy, in particular nutraceuticals (e.g. tart cherry juice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], curcumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and quercetin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]) that possess anti-inflammatory properties and have the potential to attenuate EIMD-induced oxidative stress, have become of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>One class of nutrients that appears to possess both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties are the long-chain omega (<italic>n</italic>)-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), such as eicosapentaeoic acid (EPA; 20:5 n-3)) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:5 n-3), found in fish oil. Numerous studies have shown that <italic>n</italic>-3 LC-PUFA administered at doses greater than one gram per day have beneficial actions in many inflammatory diseases, cancer, and human health in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and that <italic>n</italic>-3 LC-PUFA may act as important energetic molecules that can modulate immune, inflammatory, and oxidative stress responses to exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A small number of studies have sought to evaluate whether fish oil supplementation can reduce the degree of skeletal muscle injury, inflammation and oxidative stress following eccentric exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although more studies have demonstrated a positive effect of <italic>n</italic>-3 LC-PUFA in relation to ameliorating muscle damage, DOMS, inflammation, and oxidative stress following eccentric exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], some investigations have shown no effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It is likely that the diversity in testing protocols, supplementation dosage and duration, subject population, timing of measurements and selection of biomarkers contribute to the discrepancies in the findings between studies. However, it is possible that different forms of marine oils may have varying effects on these responses, since these oils contain a variety of lipid mediators as well as a different amount of <italic>n</italic>-3 LC-PUFA.</p><p>PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Lyprinol&#x000ae;/Omega XL&#x000ae;) is a nutritional supplement comprising of a patented extract of a very condensed form of stabilized marine lipids from the New Zealand green lipped mussel, <italic>Perna canaliculus</italic>, combined with olive oil and vitamin E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This marine oil lipid and <italic>n</italic>-3 PUFA blend is a multifarious mixture of sterol esters, sterols, polar lipids, triglycerides, EPA and DHA (split between the triacylglycerol and polar lipid classes), and free fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and has been shown to exert its anti-inflammatory effects via furan fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and 5-lipoxyeganse (LOX) pathways for the metabolism of arachidonic acid, thereby leading to a subsequent reduction in pro-inflammatory leukotriene, prostaglandin, and cytokine production from inflammatory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A number of human and animal studies have shown that the green-lipped mussel oil blend may have beneficial effects in treating inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and exercise- induced bronchoconstriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. These preliminary findings support the potential for supplementation with the green-lipped mussel oil blend in order to attenuate muscle damage and inflammation that can occur following muscle damaging exercise.</p><p>Therefore, the primary aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of supplementation with a green-lipped mussel oil blend on indirect markers of muscle damage, inflammation, and quadriceps fatigue following muscle damaging exercise in untrained men. We hypothesized that supplementation with a green-lipped mussel oil blend, compared to placebo, would significantly reduce blood markers of muscle damage and inflammation, and modulate quadriceps fatigue and functional measures of muscle damage following downhill running designed to induce muscle damage in untrained men.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Forty untrained males volunteered to participate in the study, and of these thirty-two subjects (aged 22.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2 y, height 176.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.0&#x000a0;cm, body mass 70.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.8&#x000a0;kg, maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) 46.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.1&#x000a0;mL&#x02219;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02219;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) completed the study. Reasons for the non- inclusion of eight subject data sets in the final statistical analysis were (1) subjects failing to show up at testing sessions (incomplete data; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3), (2) inability of the investigators to obtain a blood sample (incomplete data; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3), and (3) identification of erroneous recordings of data (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2). Subjects were classified as &#x02018;untrained&#x02019; if they exercised less than three times per wk for less than 30&#x000a0;min during each session. Subjects were excluded if they had a history of significant pain in hips or knees, had participated in a strength training program within 60 d prior to study participation, or regularly used nutritional supplements and over-the-counter and prescription anti-inflammatory medication. All subjects were screened for coronary artery disease risks factors as per the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Subjects were instructed to refrain from downhill running, stair running, resistance training, plyometric or other mode of exercise that could potentially cause muscle damage, and to refrain from modifying their exercise habits during the course of the study. Adherence to these instructions was confirmed at each visit to the laboratory. The study was approved by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects, and written informed consent for all subjects was obtained prior to participation in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was conducted as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trial over 30&#x000a0;days. This design was chosen over a crossover design in order to avoid the repeated-bout effect acting as a confounding variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Subjects were randomly assigned to either a green-lipped mussel oil blend (PCSO-524&#x000ae;) supplementation group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) or a placebo group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;16). Supplementation with the green-lipped mussel oil blend and placebo began 26&#x000a0;days before an eccentric exercise bout (downhill running, designed to induce muscle damage) and continued for 4&#x000a0;days following the muscle damaging exercise bout. An activity diary and food frequency questionnaire was completed by each subject during the course of the study.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Pre-supplementation measures</title><p>After subjects provided written informed consent for participation and the investigators explained the study protocol, all subjects underwent an exhaustive 20-min cycle ergometer familiarization test (T1&#x000a0;day &#x02212;21), followed one week later (T2&#x000a0;day &#x02212;14) by an incremental treadmill load test of their maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>), in order to determine the intensity (70% VO<sub>2peak</sub>) the subjects will exercise at for the eccentric exercise test. One week (T3&#x000a0;day &#x02212;7) following the VO<sub>2peak</sub> test an initial (baseline) blood draw was taken in order to measure baseline blood markers of muscle damage, inflammation and DNA oxidative stress, along with baseline functional measures of muscle damage [i.e. isometric torque (MVC), knee flexion (joint range of motion), limb girth (swelling), muscle soreness, and muscle pain], which were followed one week later (T4&#x000a0;day 0) by measures of quadriceps muscle fatigue (quadriceps twitch force measured via femoral magnetic nerve stimulation before and after a 20-min exhaustive cycle ergometer test).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Post-supplementation measures</title><p>Following the 26&#x000a0;days of supplementation a venous blood draw was taken and functional measures of muscle damage conducted (T5&#x000a0;day 26), which was directly followed by the downhill running protocol specifically designed to induce muscle damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] (T6&#x000a0;day 26). Immediately (T7&#x000a0;day 26) and 2&#x000a0;h following the muscle damaging exercise a venous blood draw was taken (T8&#x000a0;day 26), followed by additional blood draws and functional measures of muscle damage at 24&#x000a0;h (T9&#x000a0;day 27), 48&#x000a0;h (T10&#x000a0;day 28), 72&#x000a0;h (T11&#x000a0;day 29) and 96&#x000a0;h (T12&#x000a0;day 30) post-muscle damaging exercise. Quadriceps muscle fatigue was measured 24&#x000a0;h following the muscle damaging exercise bout (T8&#x000a0;day 27). The timing of this measurement was chosen in order to correspond with expected decrements in muscle strength, range of motion and significant increases in swelling, tenderness and soreness. On testing days T3 day &#x02212;7, T5 day 26, T9 day 27, T10 day 28, T11 day 29 and T12 day 30 the sequence of procedures comprised the following order: blood draws, DOMS, range of motion, pressure pain threshold, thigh girth (swelling) and isometric torque (MVC). On testing T9 day 27 only, subjects underwent the protocol for the measurement of quadriceps muscle fatigue before and after the 20-min exhaustive cycle ergometer trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Supplementation</title><p>Subjects ingested either 8 capsules per d of PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Lyprinol&#x000ae;/Omega XL&#x000ae;; Pharmalink International Ltd, Hong Kong) (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;16), which equaled 800&#x000a0;mg olive oil, 400&#x000a0;mg lipid extract (~58&#x000a0;mg EPA and 44&#x000a0;mg DHA) and 1.8&#x000a0;mg vitamin E (d-alpha-tocopherol) or 8 placebo capsules containing olive oil (1200&#x000a0;mg olive oil) (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) for 30 d. Each PCSO-524&#x000ae; capsule contains 50&#x000a0;mg lipid extract (fatty acids), 7.3&#x000a0;mg (14%) EPA, 5.5&#x000a0;mg (11%) DHA, 100&#x000a0;mg olive oil and 0.225&#x000a0;mg vitamin E, and 1 placebo capsule contains 150&#x000a0;mg olive oil. The active PCSO-524&#x000ae; capsules containing the green-lipped mussel oil blend were identical in size, color, texture and taste to their respective placebo counterpart. Product specification was provided to the investigators by the trial sponsor (Pharmalink). Cawthron Laboratories (Nelson, NZ), an independent laboratory, completed the fatty acid analysis of the raw material, and Chemisches Labor (Hannover, Germany) conducted the final fatty acid testing of the finished PCSO-524 &#x000ae; capsuled product.

Of the 91 fatty acids reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], 16 represented more than 1% of the total FA. In decreasing order of abundance, these were EPA, C16:0 (Palmitic acid), DHA, C14:0 (Myristic acid), C16:1n-7 (Palmitoleic acid), C18:0 (Steroic acid), C18:1n-5, C18:4n-3 (Stearidonic acid), C18:2n-6 (Linoleic acid), C20:4n-6 (Arachidonic acid), C18:3n- 3 (Alpha-linoleic acid), C16:1n-5, C20:1n-9 (Eicosenoic acid), C18:1n-9 (Oleic acid), C15:0 (Pentadecanoic acid), and C16:1n-9 (7-(hexadecenoic acid). PCSO-524&#x000ae; is a natural product subject to variations in the New Zealand Marlborough Sounds ecosystems.

The protocol started with a warm-up period of 5&#x000a0;min, in which subjects chose a comfortable running speed that they would be expected to be able to continue on a level treadmill for 15&#x000a0;min; selected speeds ranged from 7.2 &#x02013; 13.8&#x000a0;km/h.

Subjects were seated in a chair, secured with a belt across the legs and chest, and their left leg secured to a force transducer (Model Z Tension Load Cell, Dillon, Fairmont, MN) with a non-compliant strap. Subjects were familiarized with the equipment by performing three warm-up contractions (two submaximal, 1 maximal) separated by 10&#x000a0;seconds of rest, followed by a 5&#x000a0;min recovery. After the recovery period, subjects performed 3 maximum voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the quadriceps, interspersed with a 10&#x000a0;s recovery interval between contractions.

The assessment of fatigue protocol consisted of six repetitions of potentiation and magnetic stimulation with 30&#x000a0;s of rest between repetitions. For each repetition, subjects performed a maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) of the quadriceps muscle for 5&#x000a0;s.

In addition, although blood markers of muscle damage and inflammation, sTnI, CK-MM, MB, and TNF-&#x003b1;, significantly increased following eccentric exercise in both groups, the rise in these blood markers were significantly suppressed on the green-lipped mussel oil blend supplemented diet compared to the placebo diet at most time points following muscle damaging exercise. No significant changes occurred between the green-lipped mussel oil blend and placebo group following eccentric exercise for swelling (thigh girth), and serum h-FABP, cTnI and 8-OHdG concentrations. Our findings may have implications for those who train regularly, especially since it has recently been shown that EPA and DHA levels (Omega-3 Index: percentage of EPA and DHA in total erythrocyte fatty acids) were low in a cohort of German elite winter endurance athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and importantly that <italic>n</italic>-3 LC-PUFA supplementation leads to a higher Omega-3 index level and decreased incidence of DOMS in healthy college aged individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>To date only two studies have been conducted in order to determine the efficacy of supplementation with this specific green-lipped mussel oil blend (PCSO-524&#x000ae;) on markers of EIMD and DOMS following muscle damaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and exhaustive exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. While Baum et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] found that 11 wk. of the green-lipped mussel oil blend supplemented diet reduced DOMS following an exhaustive 30&#x000a0;km run in male and female trained distance runners, Pumpa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] found no effect of 8 wk of supplementation with this specific green-lipped mussel oil blend on DOMS and functional and blood markers of EIMD following downhill running in trained men from a variety of sports. The divergent findings between the present study and the Pumpa et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] are difficult to reconcile, but is likely related to Pumpa and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] using a lower dose (600&#x000a0;mg/day) of green-lipped mussel oil blend supplementation compared to the present study (1200&#x000a0;mg/day), and using a downhill running protocol of insufficient intensity to promote muscle damage and a robust inflammatory response in trained individuals.</p><sec id="Sec31"><title>Effect of green-lipped mussel oil blend supplementation on delayed onset muscle soreness and pain threshold</title><p>We observed a significant decrease in DOMS at 96&#x000a0;h following muscle damaging exercise on the green-lipped mussel oil blend supplemented diet compared to the placebo diet, which is in agreement with some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], but not all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], that have shown that supplementing the diet with <italic>n</italic>-3 LC-PUFA prior to muscle damage attenuates DOMS following eccentric exercise and a 30&#x000a0;km run [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

However, in the placebo group perceived pain increased significantly 24&#x000a0;h following muscle damaging exercise compared to before muscle damaging exercise. These data seem to suggest that the green- lipped mussel oil blend supplemented diet may have afforded a protective effect against perceived pain developing in the quadriceps, and may be partially explained by the attenuation in muscle damage and the inflammatory response that occurred in this group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. While Tartibian et al.

Eccentric-biased downhill running protocols typically generate 10-30% force loss after exercise, and that the reduction in MVC torque resulting from injury persists until the muscle function returns to its pre-injury condition (~24&#x000a0;h) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Strength losses following eccentric exercise are likely due to the effects of muscle damage, and evidence suggests that excitation-contraction coupling failure plays a role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In the present study there were no significant change observed for MVC torque at all-time points between groups or within the placebo group. However, MVC torque significantly increased compared to baseline (pre- supplementation) at 96&#x000a0;h following muscle damaging exercise on the green-lipped mussel oil blend supplemented diet. In support of this finding of an increase in muscle strength, Rajabi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] observed a significant increase in isotonic voluntary contractile strength of the quadriceps 24, 48 and 72&#x000a0;h following leg press eccentric exercise on a 30&#x000a0;day <italic>n</italic>-3 LC-PUFA supplemented diet compared to a placebo diet. Conversely, Gray et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] observed no changes in MVC torque following 200 eccentric knee contractions, while Pumpa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and Lenn et al.

The mechanism to explain this decrease has been attributed to an increase in resting cytosol calcium levels, ultrastructure damage and/or an increase in fluid accumulation (swelling), and the measurement of joint ROM in muscle damage studies has been used as an indicator of passive muscle stiffness and soreness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Our data indicate that muscle damaging exercise induced no loss of ROM in the green-lipped mussel oil blend group. However, within the placebo group ROM was significantly reduced (~4&#x000a0;deg) at 96&#x000a0;h post-muscle damaging exercise compared to baseline, and was significantly less (~4.9&#x000a0;deg) at 96&#x000a0;h following muscle damaging exercise on the placebo diet compared to the green-lipped mussel oil blend supplemented diet&#x000ae;. The protective effect provided by the <italic>n</italic>-3 LC-PUFA rich diet against ROM loss in the present study is similar to Tartibian et al.

Rodenburg et al.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] has demonstrated that eccentric exercise (downstairs running) does induce muscle fiber swelling (soleus muscle), but it emerges at 7&#x02013;8 d, and not at 2&#x02013;3 d post-eccentric exercise when DOMS peaked.

Myoglobin is an oxygen-binding heme protein found in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and thus is not specific for skeletal muscle, and h- FABP, which is involved in the transport and metabolism of fatty acids, is found in higher concentrations in the heart compared to human skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. However, both myoglobin and h-FABP have been proposed as useful markers of skeletal muscle injury in the absence of cardiac damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In the present study we did not observe any significant change in serum cTnI or h-FABP following muscle damaging exercise at any time point within either group, which suggests that the increase in serum myoglobin following muscle damaging exercise was likely the result of skeletal and not cardiac muscle damage.</p><p>Myofibrillar CK-MM is a cytosolic enzyme specifically bound to the myofibrillar M-line structure located in the sarcomere, and is also found in the space of the I-band sarcomeres where it provides support for muscle energy requirements.

A number of studies assessing the efficacy of <italic>n</italic>-3 LC-PUFA supplementation on EIMD and DOMS have not used serum CK-MM, but rather total serum CK concentration as an indirect marker of muscle damage. Given that total serum CK has not been shown to correlate with histological evidence of skeletal muscle damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] it is not surprising that considerable variability is observed in this blood marker among studies assessing the impact of <italic>n</italic>-3 LC-PUFA supplementation on muscle damage and DOMS following eccentric exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>An important aspect associated with the initiation and amplification of acute inflammation is the production of cytokines that are synthesized de nova by lymphocyte&#x02019;s and monocytes at the site of muscle injury, and aid in directing inflammatory-related events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. At the onset of inflammation there is an upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1&#x003b2;, and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;. While IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; are most likely released by resident macrophages at the site of injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], and initiate the inflammatory response, TNF- &#x003b1;, in particular, has been shown to play a significant role in the muscle regeneration phase following muscle injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].

Serum 8-OHdG has been shown to increase following eccentric isokinetic exercise in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], but not after downhill running in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] or humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. In the present study we observed no significant increase in serum 8-OHdG following muscle damaging exercise in both groups compared to baseline, and no significant difference in serum 8-OHdG between groups at any time point. The lack of change in serum 8-OHdG following muscle damaging exercise does not exclude the possibility that changes in this marker were present in the active skeletal muscle, as the serum concentration 8-OHdG may be diluted in comparison with the actual site of generation (within muscle). In addition, the intensity/duration of the stimulus may not have been sufficient to overwhelm the body&#x02019;s endogenous antioxidant system, and/or an upregulation of protective mechanisms against DNA damage developing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], may have also played a role. It is surprising that serum 8- OhdG was not increased following muscle damaging exercise, especially given that structural protein within skeletal muscle was damaged (i.e. increase in serum sTnI). Changes in oxidative stress observed following muscle damaging exercise may not be the same when comparing blood and skeletal muscle, and thus we acknowledge that a limitation to our study is that we did not include additional biomarkers of oxidative stress.</p><p>While inflammation contributes to fibrosis, and causes pain and may well impair skeletal muscle function it does appear that inflammation represents a critical aspect of skeletal muscle repair and regeneration, and therefore blocking the inflammatory response with either pharmacological drugs or nutraceuticals may well hinder recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. With this in mind an important question that needs to be resolved is whether the most beneficial course of treatment should be to inhibit the inflammatory response or to let it progress naturally. Therefore, if there is a benefit in blocking inflammation, when is the appropriate time to do so and for how long post-muscle injury? While post-treatment of skeletal muscle injury is likely a more practical tactic, regardless of whether the injury is acute or slower to materialize such as with repetitive use injuries, it is not known at present whether <italic>n</italic>-3 LC-PUFA supplementation would be as effective in ameliorating EIMD and the inflammatory response if delivered post-injury only. This is an important question to answer since in some cases of skeletal muscle injury pre-treatment with anti-inflammatory agents for long periods of time is not always a realistic option for an individual.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action of PCSO-524&#x000ae;</title><p>In the present study the attenuation of a number of indirect markers of EIMD and inflammation cannot be explained entirely by the EPA and DHA content of PCSO-524&#x000ae;, since the total amount of EPA and DHA content consumed daily was 58&#x000a0;mg and 44&#x000a0;mg respectively, which are considerably lower amounts than previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] that have demonstrated a positive effect of <italic>n</italic>-3 LC-PUFA supplementation (0.3 - 2.0&#x000a0;g EPA/day and 0.2 &#x02013; 1.0&#x000a0;g DHA/day) on mitigating EIMD, DOMS and inflammation.

The green-lipped mussel oil blend contains polyphenols (oleuropein and hydroxtyrosol) and oleic acid, which are anti-inflammatory, and postulated to reduce risk factors for heart disease, lower cancer mortality, and reduce inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. It has been shown that furan fatty acids, which are a minor component of the green- lipped mussel oil blend, exhibit more potent anti-inflammatory activity than EPA in a rat model of adjuvant-induced arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and which possess potent free-radical scavenging abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], may explain, at least in part, why in the present study the green-lipped mussel oil blend was effective in attenuating EIMD, DOMS and inflammation, given the very low dose of EPA and DHA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec36" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the present study has shown that supplementing the diet of untrained men for 30&#x000a0;days with 1200&#x000a0;mg/d of a marine oil lipid and <italic>n</italic>-3 LC PUFA blend (PCSO-524&#x000ae;), derived from the New Zealand green lipped mussel, attenuated indirect markers of muscle damage and inflammation following downhill running designed to induce muscle damage, and may represent a useful therapeutic agent for mitigating muscle damage and inflammation following unaccustomed and/or eccentric exercise.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>JS, DP collected the study data, contributed to data interpretation and assisted in the drafting the manuscript.
