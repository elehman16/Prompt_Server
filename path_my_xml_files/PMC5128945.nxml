India has the highest proportion of global undernutrition-related morbidity and mortality. This protocol describes the planned economic evaluation of a community-based intervention to improve growth in children under 2&#x02005;years of age in two rural districts of eastern India. The intervention is being evaluated through a cluster-randomised controlled trial (cRCT, the CARING trial).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A cost-effectiveness and cost&#x02013;utility analysis nested within a cRCT will be conducted from a societal perspective, measuring programme, provider, household and societal costs. Programme costs will be collected prospectively from project accounts using a standardised tool. These will be supplemented with time sheets and key informant interviews to inform the allocation of joint costs. Direct and indirect costs incurred by providers will be collected using key informant interviews and time use surveys. Direct and indirect household costs will be collected prospectively, using time use and consumption surveys. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) will be calculated for the primary outcome measure, that is, cases of stunting prevented, and other outcomes such as cases of wasting prevented, cases of infant mortality averted, life years saved and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of results.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>There is a shortage of robust evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of strategies to improve early child growth. As this economic evaluation is nested within a large scale, cRCT, it will contribute to understanding the fiscal space for investment in early child growth, and the relative (in)efficiency of prioritising resources to this intervention over others to prevent stunting in this and other comparable contexts. The protocol has all necessary ethical approvals and the findings will be disseminated within academia and the wider policy sphere.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN51505201; pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cost-effectiveness</kwd><kwd>stunting</kwd><kwd>undernutrition</kwd><kwd>India</kwd><kwd>PUBLIC HEALTH</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>099708/Z/12/Z</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical Research Council</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K007270/1</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department for International Development</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000278</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This protocol will contribute to the limited evidence regarding cost-effective strategies to improve early child growth.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This replicable protocol can assist in designing economic evaluations for similar complex public health interventions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study design will contribute to our understanding of fiscal space for investments in early child growth.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The design of the economic evaluation will allow societal, household and provider costs to be disaggregated.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Community-based interventions may require piloting and modification for use in other settings.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><sec id="s1a"><title>Burden of child undernutrition</title><p>Undernutrition affects an estimated 165 million children globally and contributes to an estimated 45% of all child deaths worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Stunting, that is, low length-for-age or height-for-age in young children, is a marker of chronic undernutrition. It is the result of multiple determinants, including long-term consumption of a low-quality diet in combination with morbidity, infectious diseases and environmental risks.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref></p><p>Stunting in early childhood is associated with subsequent adverse consequences, including poor cognitive and educational performance, reduced work capacity and lower wages in adulthood.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> It also contributes to the intergenerational transmission of poverty.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> It is estimated that individual productivity losses attributable to undernutrition are more than 10% of lifetime earnings, and losses to gross domestic product (GDP) may be as high as 2&#x02013;3% (World Bank, 2006). The burden of undernutrition disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations in low and middle income countries (LMICs).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The WHO has set a global target to reduce stunting by 40% by 2025,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> while the 2014 Global Nutrition Report emphasises the importance of nutrition as the foundation on which healthy lives, &#x02018;resilient livelihoods&#x02019; and &#x02018;thriving economies&#x02019; are built.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Approximately one-third of the world's stunted children live in India. Stunting in India is most prevalent among the poorest households, Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Scheduled Caste (SC) communities.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The Government of India has targeted undernutrition through the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) and the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). The ICDS distributes supplementary food to children through a network of village-based workers known as &#x02018;Anganwadi&#x02019; workers. Launched in 2005, the NRHM (now renamed National Health Mission or NHM) aims to provide accessible, affordable and quality healthcare services to the rural population and vulnerable groups.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Although ICDS services have nationwide coverage, they mainly target children aged 3&#x02013;6&#x02005;years, by which time many of the adverse effects of early childhood undernutrition may already be established.</p><p>The Indian Government has recently undertaken several reforms in the structure of the ICDS. These include providing supplementary foods to pregnant women, children under 3&#x02005;years of age and their mothers and improving mothers' feeding and caring practices. The introduction of an additional community-based worker to support these efforts is also being considered. As these reforms are in the earliest stages, evidence on their likely effect is scarce, as is evidence of their cost-effectiveness relative to alternative strategies.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>CARING trial</title><p>CARING is a cluster-randomised controlled trial (cRCT) located in two districts of Jharkhand and Odisha, eastern India. The trial aims to assess the effectiveness of a complex public health intervention that mirrors the proposed government reforms described above. The intervention involves recruiting and training a new community-based health worker engaged in improving feeding, infection control and caregiving practices for children under 2&#x02005;years of age through monthly home visits to all children under 2. This new community-based worker also supports monthly women's groups meetings working through a &#x02018;undernutrition-focused&#x02019; participatory learning and action cycle. The participatory learning and action cycle involves monthly group meetings for women. The new community-based health worker facilitates the meetings and a problem-solving approach is used to help groups identify community-level health and nutrition problems, and find locally feasible strategies to address the problems identified.</p><p>The trial aims to establish whether the intervention is effective and cost-effective in reducing stunting in children under 2, morbidity and mortality, when compared with current practice. In all study areas, we also attempt to strengthen Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committees (VHNSCs) as a common benefit to intervention and control clusters.</p><p>The CARING trial is described in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The purpose of this article is to fully describe the methodology for the economic evaluation of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Economic evaluations of community interventions to improve children's growth</title><p>Although there is strong evidence demonstrating a significant positive contribution of early childhood nutrition interventions to child survival, growth and development, existing literature provides little data about the cost-effectiveness of such interventions.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The scarcity of empirical cost-effectiveness data for these interventions is particularly acute in LMICs.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Policymakers require this information, in addition to evidence on the efficacy and effectiveness of programmes, in order to make investment decisions.</p><p>A recent review of the literature on the cost-effectiveness of early child nutrition interventions identified six studies from LMICs.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Two studies examined the cost-effectiveness of breastfeeding interventions in Southern Africa;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> a cohort study in KwaZulu-Natal, and Uganda,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and a cRCT in Mbale district, South Africa. Both studies were conducted from the provider perspective. Cost-effectiveness ratios were reported as the cost per mother counselled or cost per visit in Uganda.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In South Africa, the total cost of the implementation was reported, along with the cost per supported month of exclusive breast feeding and the cost per additional or increased month of exclusive breast feeding.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> These ratios are not comparable between the two trials and the findings are unlikely to have direct relevance to the Indian context or to the CARING trial, which proposes a more comprehensive nutrition intervention.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>The same literature review also identified four trials that have attempted to improve the nutritional status of children more broadly;

The India and Peru studies reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per case of stunting averted of $34.67<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">i</xref></sup> and $55.16, respectively. The Peru study reported the cost per death averted at $1952. In Pakistan and Malawi, cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted from the provider perspective and as such their findings cannot be compared directly with the other two studies. They did, however, report a cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted of $12.20 and $42, respectively, which can then be compared with other &#x02018;DALY averting&#x02019; interventions. In addition, the Pakistan study reported a cost per death averted of $406.</p><p>The proposed economic valuation of the CARING trial will be the first to assess the cost-effectiveness of combining participatory women's groups with home visits to reduce stunting. This economic evaluation will also employ a societal perspective, thus adding significantly to our understanding of the cost-effectiveness of this intervention and the likely fiscal space needed for its wider implementation. ICERs will be reported for cases of stunting averted, deaths averted and DALYs averted, in order to maximise comparability with other trials and ensure the usefulness of the economic evaluation as a resource allocation tool.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Aim and objectives</title><p>The aim of the CARING economic evaluation is to measure the cost-effectiveness of a community intervention that includes participatory learning and action with women's groups and home visits to improve the growth of children under 2.

AWWs provide supplementary nutrition to pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers and children aged 6&#x02005;months to 6&#x02005;years. ASHAs support community members in accessing essential healthcare services and promote institutional deliveries. ANMs provide services such as childhood immunisation and essential medicines. Community-based services are supplemented with care from primary care centres, MTCs that specialise in the treatment of SAM and hospitals.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study population</title><p>The CARING trial area includes 120 geographic clusters of around 1000 population, typically a village and any nearby hamlets. These clusters were purposively selected based on their population size. The study participants are pregnant women identified in the third trimester of pregnancy and all children born to pregnant women recruited between 1 October 2013 and 10 February 2015. Mothers and their children are followed up for a period of 18&#x02005;months after the birth of the child.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Trial design</title><p>In the CARING trial, a total of 120 purposively selected geographical clusters, with an estimated total population of 121&#x02005;531, were randomised to the two trial arms. The 60 clusters in the intervention arm received home visits, participatory learning and action meetings and support to VHNSCs as described further below. The 60 clusters in the control arm received only the support to VHNSCs. Study participants are pregnant women identified in the third trimester of pregnancy and their children (n=2520). The randomisation, which took place in July 2013, was stratified by district and by number of hamlets per cluster. The trial is ongoing and is due to finish in 2016.</p><p>In the intervention clusters, a community intervention to improve children's growth involving home visits to all children under 2 and monthly participatory learning and action meetings with women's groups, combined with VHSNC strengthening activities, is being implemented. In the control clusters, only VHSNC strengthening is implemented. In the following section, we present a brief description of the intervention strategies. A full description of the intervention design within the CARING trial is described in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Community intervention to improve children's growth</title><p>The community intervention involves a community-based worker (known as Suposhan Karyakarta or SPK) carrying out two main activities: (1) undertaking monthly home visits and (2) facilitating monthly women's group meetings. An SPK will visit all pregnant women at least once during their pregnancy, and all mothers of children under 2 on a monthly basis, to counsel mothers on appropriate feeding, infection control and care giving. She also facilitates a cycle of monthly women's groups, where the discussions will follow a participatory learning and action cycle focused on maternal health, child health and nutrition. A four phase &#x02018;participatory learning and action cycle&#x02019;, adapted from previous studies,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> will guide the groups to identify and prioritise maternal and child health and nutrition problems, decide on locally appropriate solutions, then implement and evaluate the solutions. These meetings primarily target pregnant and lactating mothers, mothers of children under 2 and adolescent girls. In home visits and women's group meetings, the SPK uses a problem-solving approach.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Strengthening Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committees (VHSNCs)</title><p>In intervention and control areas, activities are undertaken to strengthen the capacity of VHSNCs, which are village-level government-mandated bodies. VHSNCs are responsible for assessing the health needs of their community, preparing and implementing village health plans and monitoring the delivery of local health and nutrition services. During the study, several participatory meetings will be held with VHSNCs. These meetings will primarily aim to sensitise VHSNCs on issues related to inequity and exclusion in service provision, in addition to identifying and addressing gaps in health and nutrition services within their community.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Measurement of health outcomes/effectiveness</title><sec id="s2g1"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcome of the CARING trial is children's length-for-age z-scores.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The trial was powered to detect a 0.15 SD difference in LAZ between intervention and control at the 0.05 significance level. A greater sample size would be required to detect a realistic change in the prevalence of stunting: our sample size allows us to detect a 13% reduction in stunting prevalence, which is an unfeasible effect for a 24&#x02005;months intervention without food supplementation. Cost-effectiveness analyses focusing on cases of stunting averted would be useful to inform policymakers' decisions. We therefore propose to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis for cases of stunting averted if there is evidence of impact on the prevalence of stunting in children at 18&#x02005;months at the 0.1 significance level or below. Using these z-scores, we will calculate the prevalence of stunting among children at 18&#x02005;months and calculate the number of cases of stunting averted. Cases averted will be calculated as the difference between the expected and the actual number of cases using the adjusted OR.</p></sec><sec id="s2g2"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>The trial has a number of secondary outcomes described in detail in the trial protocol.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Cost-effectiveness analyses will be conducted for any reduction in three key secondary outcomes&#x02014;underweight, wasting and infant mortality&#x02014;where a significant impact on these outcomes is observed at the 0.1 level.</p><p>ICERs will thus be calculated for wasting, underweight and infant mortality, if a significant effect is observed at a p value of 0.1 or less.

Cost data are entered regularly into the tool, which is adapted each year to reflect the changing cost structure of the trial at different phases of activity. Using a step-down method, the main worksheets for entering data allocate costs to one of the following categories: staff, material, capital and joint costs. Costs are also divided into start-up and implementation costs, and between intervention, monitoring and evaluation and research costs. As these data are financial or accounting costs, they are converted to economic costs. This means that capital costs are annualised over their expected useful life, and any donated goods or volunteer time appearing as a zero costs in accounting data&#x02014;or not appearing in the accounting data in any form&#x02014;will be added to the cost sheets and assigned their current market value.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40&#x02013;42</xref> Key informant interviews with project leads assist in identifying any donated goods requiring revaluation and in allocating joint costs between programme components.

Differences in admissions between intervention and control areas will be attributed to the trial activities. Primary data on the average unit cost of care for SAM will be collected from the two MTCs in the project area.

Changes in the quantity, variety or quality of food fed to pregnant women and young children, may increase household expenditure on food. The intervention may also increase care seeking. The effect on health spending of this change may be positive or negative. Increases in care seeking from a very low base may increase total spending on care. Conversely, a shift from curative to preventive care seeking may decrease spending on care. Similarly, improved early child nutrition that averts severe malnutrition and related illnesses, may also reduce the need for care seeking. Finally, as the intervention seeks to change health and nutrition-related activities, it may also change the allocation of time to these activities. Participation in women's group meetings and in home visits will also have a direct time &#x02018;cost&#x02019;.</p><p>Changes in food expenditure are measured with a comprehensive household consumption and expenditure survey conducted on a random subsample of 300 households (150 per trial arm). The consumption and expenditure model is conducted twice for each participating household, with the two data collection points 1&#x02005;year apart. This allows the measure of interest to be the change in expenditure over a 1-year period, with that change compared between intervention and control areas.</p><p>Changes in health spending are measured with a set of questions on care seeking collected from all the mothers recruited in the project. Care seeking data are also collected at two time points in the trial; first when the pregnant mother is recruited and again when the baby is 18-month old. In this instance, the measure of interest is not the change in spending over that time period, but a comparison of absolute levels of spending between intervention and control families with children of the same age.</p><p>Finally, the time cost of group participation, participating in the actions taken by the group, engaging with home visits or changing health, nutrition or stimulation behaviours will be measured using a time use survey to be conducted on a subsample of 120 women, equally distributed across the intervention and control arms.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title><p>The cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted as a within-trial analysis using the intention-to-treat results, and will be presented in terms of ICERs, calculated as the arithmetic mean difference in cost between the community intervention combined with VHNSC strengthening versus VHNSC strengthening only, divided by the arithmetic mean difference in effect.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>

Trial groups are encouraged to publish protocols in order to improve the rigour of any subsequent impact assessment. If economists were encouraged to publish the protocols for complex economic evaluations in the same way, we may see a similar rise in the rigour of the conduct of these studies, along with greater comparability between findings.</p><p>The proposed analyses aim to assess the cost-effectiveness of a community intervention to improve children's growth. The protocol, which will adhere to internationally recognised guidelines for conducting and reporting economic evaluation studies,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> serves to heighten the transparency of the economic evaluation and planned analyses. The findings from this study will inform policymakers about the relative value for money of this intervention and the likely fiscal space required to scale up the intervention in three stages; (i) to all rural populations in Jharkhand and Odisha, (ii) to other states with a high burden of undernutrition and (iii) national scale up. This evidence will contribute significantly to the scarce evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of community interventions in reducing child undernutrition.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Jolene Skordis-Worrall at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/JSkordis">@JSkordis</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JS-W, HH-B and RS designed the protocol for the Economic Evaluation and prepared the first draft of the paper.
