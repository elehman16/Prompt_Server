Here we investigated the biobehavioral effects of baclofen in a sample of anxious alcohol-dependent individuals. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, human laboratory study in non-treatment seeking alcohol-dependent individuals with high trait anxiety (<italic>N</italic>=34). Participants received baclofen (30&#x02009;mg per day) or placebo for at least 8 days, then performed an experimental session consisting of alcohol cue-reactivity followed by alcohol administration procedure (alcohol priming, then alcohol self-administration). Total amount of alcohol self-administered was the primary outcome; alcohol craving, subjective/physiological responses and mood/anxiety symptoms were also evaluated. There was no significant medication effect on the total amount of alcohol consumed during the alcohol self-administration (<italic>P</italic>=0.76). Baclofen blunted the positive association between maximum breath alcohol concentration during priming and the amount of alcohol consumption (significant interaction, <italic>P</italic>=0.03). Ratings of feeling intoxicated were significantly higher in the baclofen group after consuming the priming drink (<italic>P</italic>=0.006). During the self-administration session, baclofen significantly increased ratings of feeling high (<italic>P</italic>=0.01) and intoxicated (<italic>P</italic>=0.01). A significant reduction in heart rate (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and a trend-level increase in diastolic blood pressure (<italic>P</italic>=0.06) were also detected in the baclofen group during the alcohol laboratory session. In conclusion, baclofen was shown to affect subjective and physiological responses to alcohol drinking in anxious alcohol-dependent individuals. These results do not support an anti-craving or anti-reinforcing effect of baclofen, but rather suggest that baclofen may act as a substitution medication for alcohol use disorder.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic relapsing disorder with significant medical, social and economic consequences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Treatment of AUD may include psychosocial, behavioral and/or pharmacological interventions; however, therapeutic options are limited in number and efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Increased understanding of the neurobiology of AUD has led to efforts focused on developing pharmacological treatments for this disorder. Prominent among these are medications that act on the GABAergic system. The GABAergic system modulates acute and chronic pharmacological and behavioral effects of alcohol and is involved in various stages of addiction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> GABA receptors are widely expressed in brain regions involved in alcohol intake and reinforcement (for example, ventral tegmental area, amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex). In particular, the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor has been investigated as a &#x02018;druggable' target for AUD, using orthosteric agonists and positive allosteric modulators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup></p><p>The prototypic selective GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist, baclofen, has been studied as a potential pharmacotherapy for AUD. While baclofen suppresses acquisition, maintenance and reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior in rodents,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> results from human studies are conflicting. A few randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have reported that baclofen reduces alcohol drinking and craving,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> while others did not find positive effects on alcohol-related outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> One plausible explanation for these conflicting findings may be the heterogeneity of AUD and individual variability in treatment response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Secondary analyses of RCTs indicate that baseline anxiety levels may predict response to baclofen treatment for AUD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Also, in some of the previous RCTs, baclofen significantly reduced anxiety levels in alcoholic individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> These observations are consistent with the role of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor in the neural circuits of anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> and suggest that baclofen may be particularly efficacious in anxious alcoholic patients. However, this medication has not been tested in a study where alcoholic individuals with high anxiety levels were prospectively enrolled.</p><p>Further research is also warranted on the biobehavioral effects of baclofen to better understand how this medication works. Some of the previous RCTs indicate that baclofen may reduce naturalistic alcohol craving.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> On the other hand, a pilot laboratory study suggested that baclofen may influence subjective responses to alcohol, with no effect on alcohol- or cue-induced craving.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> Given the limited number of studies, all with small sample sizes, characterizing baclofen's effects in relation to alcohol drinking is worth further investigation. Human laboratory studies conducted in well-controlled settings represent a cost-effective and ecologically valid approach to study the putative biobehavioral processes targeted by a specific medication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> The goal of this laboratory study was to investigate the biobehavioral effects of baclofen in anxious alcohol-dependent individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study design and setting</title><p>This was a randomized, between-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled, human laboratory study conducted at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD, from January 2013 to January 2016.

Baclofen-treated participants reported greater ratings of feeling high and intoxicated after alcohol intake. Notably, there was no medication effect on BrAC during the alcohol administration procedure, ruling out the possibility that the observed subjective effects might be due to changes in alcohol pharmacokinetics. Although baclofen did not reduce the amount of alcohol consumed in this study, it did blunt the positive association between blood alcohol levels during the priming phase and subsequent alcohol consumption during the ASA. These findings suggest a potential biobehavioral mechanism of how baclofen may affect alcohol intake. Hypothetically, amplification of subjective responses to alcohol after an initial drink may reduce the amount of subsequent alcohol drinking as the desired effects have been already achieved. This is in agreement with the previous preclinical reports on the efficacy of baclofen to prevent priming-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> however, this hypothesis requires further investigation in the alcohol field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> and does not explain how baclofen may promote abstinence, as shown in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup></p><p>Contrary to some of the previous RCTs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> baclofen did not reduce the amount of alcohol consumed in this study, for which different reasons may be hypothesized. First, the whole sample reported a significant reduction in alcohol drinking during the period between screening and randomization, that is, before the study medication was started. This potential floor effect may have obscured a difference between the two groups during the ASA session. Second, the sample of this study differed in important ways from patients enrolled in previous treatment trials where baclofen reduced alcohol drinking. Our participants were not seeking treatment and had less severe dependence, mild or no alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and no significant liver impairment. Noteworthy, the severity of alcohol dependence and withdrawal have been identified as possible predictors of better response to baclofen;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> also, baclofen seems to be particularly effective in alcohol-dependent patients with liver cirrhosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Third, the ASA paradigm applies a behavioral economic approach where alcohol is considered a commodity whose reinforcing value is estimated by the cost that a consumer is willing to pay for. This approach evaluates a specific aspect of alcohol-related behavior, and may not capture other factors that contribute to excessive drinking behavior in alcohol-dependent individuals.</p><p>The central finding of this study, that is, baclofen affects alcohol-related subjective experiences, is of potential importance. Subjective response to alcohol plays an important role in shaping the pattern of alcohol drinking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> This is a multidimensional construct; an exploratory factor analysis by Ray and colleagues revealed a three-factor model for subjective responses to alcohol: (1) stimulation and other pleasant effects; (2) sedation and other unpleasant effects; (3) alleviation of tension and negative mood;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> an additional factor (craving/motivation) was also identified in another study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> The present study applied a diverse set of assessments trying to investigate different dimensions of subjective response to alcohol. Several factors such as genetics, level of drinking and stage of alcoholism contribute to the individual variability in response to alcohol;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> in the present study, we controlled for this heterogeneity by adding the baseline Self-Rating of Effects of Alcohol score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> as a covariate in the initial run of each model. Notably, this variable was not found to be a significant covariate in any of the analyses.</p><p>Subjective response to alcohol is a potential biobehavioral target and a marker of early efficacy in medication development for AUD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> While decreasing the pleasant effects of alcohol and/or increasing its unpleasant effects have typically been considered the main mechanisms for reducing alcohol drinking, this dichotomous classification is too simplistic and unable to fully explain the effects of some medications. For example, responses like feeling &#x02018;intoxicated' do not fall in either category. Also, the desired direction of change in responses like feeling &#x02018;high' may not be clear-cut from a medication development perspective. In fact, the amplification of subjective responses to alcohol observed in this study is in line with a previously proposed notion that baclofen might act through alcohol mimicking properties, representing a substitution or complementarity therapy for alcohol use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> Importantly, GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, especially at the presynaptic sites, play a central role in responsiveness to alcohol by regulating the synaptic ethanol sensitivity on one hand,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> and modulating the release and effects of other key neurotransmitters in the brain on the other hand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup></p><p>Some of the previous treatment trials indicate that baclofen reduces alcohol craving.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> In the present study, we did not find a medication effect on cue- or alcohol-induced craving. These conflicting findings may be due to differences in (1) methodologies: cue- and alcohol-induced craving assessed in real time versus non-elicited craving assessed retrospectively, (2) settings: experimental laboratory versus naturalistic environment, (3) populations: non-treatment versus treatment seekers. It is also important to note that the present study did not investigate all potential factors that may elicit craving for alcohol;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> for example, a stress manipulation procedure <italic>per se</italic> was not employed. While previous RCTs with baclofen in alcohol-dependent individuals suggest an anxiolytic effect,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> we did not find significant changes in anxiety, neither pre- to post randomization, nor during the alcohol laboratory session.</p><p>In spite of important methodological differences with the present study, previous human laboratory studies have also shown an effect of baclofen on subjective responses to alcohol, and no effect on cue- or alcohol-induced craving.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> Specifically, one study tested acute effects of single doses of baclofen (0, 40 or 80&#x02009;mg) administered before an alcoholic (0.75&#x02009;g/kg) or placebo beverage in 18 non-dependent heavy drinkers and found increased ratings of &#x02018;high' when baclofen and alcohol were co-administered. Baclofen alone dose-dependently increased ratings of &#x02018;elevated mood', &#x02018;drug strength', &#x02018;good drug effects' and &#x02018;bad drug effects' as well. There was also a trend-level increase in sedation when baclofen was combined with alcohol. Finally, no significant change in alcohol-induced craving was found in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> Another pilot study was conducted in 14 alcohol-dependent heavy drinkers and used the same design and dosage as the present work. During the alcohol administration procedure, the baclofen group reported higher stimulation and sedation on the BAES. Neither cue- nor alcohol-induced craving showed a significant medication effect; no other measurements of subjective response to alcohol were performed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup></p><p>The present study did not find increased sedation with baclofen. In fact, lower rates of &#x02018;sleepiness' were reported in the baclofen than the placebo group. Given the well-known sedative effects of baclofen, these findings are unexpected. A possible reason may be related to the specific population enrolled in this study. It is conceivable that alcohol-dependent individuals, particularly those with high anxiety, may have enhanced tolerance to the sedative effects of baclofen, mainly due to a possible cross-tolerance with the sedative effects of alcohol. This conclusion, albeit not driven directly from our findings, is consistent with the previous rodent experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> and clinical observations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> While enhancement of subjective responses to alcohol might raise a concern about abuse liability of baclofen, this is unlikely. Importantly, baclofen did not affect the DEQ items that are more indicative of abuse liability (&#x02018;Do you like the effects you are feeling now?' and &#x02018;Would you like more of what you received, right now?'). Moreover, baclofen has been used in several clinical trials for longer periods of time in populations addicted to different drugs of abuse, and none of these studies have reported cases of baclofen abuse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup></p><p>Individuals randomized to baclofen in this study had higher HR and lower BP than the placebo group at baseline (pre-medication). This pattern persisted after receiving baclofen/placebo for 1 week, but was reversed during the alcohol administration procedure: baclofen, combined with alcohol, decreased HR and increased diastolic BP and mean arterial pressure. These findings are inconsistent with Evans and Bisaga's study, where they found a significant increase in HR with both baclofen alone and in combination with alcohol, as well as a small increase in systolic BP with baclofen alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> Previous studies with baclofen have reported different and contrasting hemodynamic effects (for example, hypo/hypertension, brady/tachycardia), and the magnitude/direction of these effects remain unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup> Sophisticated pharmacological and mathematical models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref></sup> are required to disentangle central versus peripheral and direct versus feedback mechanisms involved in the hemodynamic responses to baclofen itself and in combination with alcohol, a set of questions that is beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>This study should be seen in light of its strengths and limitations. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the biobehavioral effects of baclofen in anxious alcohol-dependent individuals and after the medication has been taken for a reasonable period of time to reach steady state. Combining the alcohol cue-reactivity, fixed-dose priming, and free-choice self-administration procedures in a well-controlled laboratory setting and using a comprehensive set of assessments/time-points provided a strong platform to study the potential effects of baclofen on several alcohol-related outcomes. Study limitations include: (1) only one dose of baclofen (30&#x02009;mg per day) and one dose of alcohol were tested, and the findings cannot be generalized to other scenarios. Higher doses of baclofen and/or longer period of administration could be tested in future studies in combination with different doses of alcohol; (2) although oral administration of alcohol represents the natural route alcohol is consumed, it also results in high variability in blood alcohol concentrations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref></sup> which may subsequently affect individuals' response to alcohol. We controlled for this variability by covarying for the max-BrAC of the priming phase in the analyses of the alcohol administration procedure; (3) due to safety reasons, the maximum number of mini-drinks was limited to eight and the session could not be continued if individuals wanted to drink more; (4) given the small number of females, possible sex differences in the effects of baclofen could not be investigated; nevertheless, gender was included among the covariates of our analyses; (5) the sample size of this study was relatively small; we had neither a less anxious control group, nor a non-alcoholic control drink. A logical follow-up would be a larger experiment with a fully factorial 2 (baclofen/placebo) &#x000d7; 2 (alcohol/placebo) &#x000d7; 2 (high/low anxiety) design.</p><p>In conclusion, the present human laboratory study showed that the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist baclofen affects subjective and physiological responses to alcohol drinking in anxious alcohol-dependent individuals. Future studies are needed to further investigate these biobehavioral effects and their potential implications in using baclofen as a medication for AUD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the clinical and research staff involved in data collection and support at the NIH Intramural Research Program, in particular staff in the joint NIAAA/NIDA CPN section, NIAAA clinical program of the Division of Intramural Clinical and Biological Research and NIH Clinical Center (Nursing, Nutrition and Pharmacy Departments).
