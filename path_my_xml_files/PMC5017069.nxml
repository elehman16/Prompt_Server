However, due to the lack of an interventional study in our region on the effects of peer interaction on adolescents&#x02019; adaptation to disease, this study was considered necessary.</p><p>This study was conducted to determine the effect of interactive education with group interaction on adaptation to disease in adolescents with T1DM by using a control group experimental design with pre and posttests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the ethics committee (25.01.2010/B.30.2.ERC.0.20./18) and the institution where the study was conducted. The researchers also explained the aims of the study to the adolescents with T1DM and their mothers and obtained their consent both verbally and in writing.</p><p>The study was conducted at a university hospital in the Aegean Region of Turkey using an experimental design with pre/post-tests and control group. Before the study, the outpatient records of the recent years were examined, and a total of 55 adolescents with T1DM between the ages of 12 and 14 years were determined. Forty of these adolescents who met the criteria for inclusion in the study (accepting to participate in the study, receiving quadruple insulin treatment, having no other chronic disorders, and having been diagnosed with T1DM for at least one year) were involved in the study. 20 of the adolescents were assigned to the study group and another 20 of them were assigned to the control group randomly. Two subjects were excluded from the study group since they could not be reached after the first interview. The study was completed with 38 adolescents (study group n=18, control group n=20).</p><p>When the post-power statistical analysis of the total pre/post-training scores that the T1DM adolescents in the study group obtained from the &#x0201c;Coopersmith Self-Esteem Scale&#x0201d; was carried out, the power, with alpha= 0.05, was calculated to be 1.00 respectively. With these results, the sample size was determined to be sufficient. The age, gender and income levels of the adolescents in the control and study groups were taken as matching criteria, and no significant difference was found between them (p&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p>The information form contains 14 questions regarding introductory information about the adolescents with T1DM. Children&#x02019;s social support appraisal scale<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> (cronbach&#x02019;s alfa = 0.930) is made up of a total of 41 items. Maximum score that can be obtained from the scale is 205. In the study, Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha was found to be 0.850 for the study group and 0.947 for the control group. Self-esteem inventory<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> (cronbach&#x02019;s alpha = 0.620, r = 0.65, r = 0.76) consists of 25 &#x0201c;yes-no&#x0201d; questions, and scores range from 0 to 100. In the study, the cronbach&#x02019;s alpha values were found to be 0.885 for the study group and 0.954 for the control group. The diabetes mellitus knowledge test was created by the researchers in order to evaluate the adolescents&#x02019; diabetes training and measure the level of their general knowledge related to the disease. It is made up of twenty multiple choice questions. Maximum score that can be obtained from the test is 100, and a high score indicates a high level of knowledge. The opinions of four experts were sought when formulating the questions. Diabetes Education Guide for Adolescents (DEG) contains general information and advices about T1DM. The form of the guide was used after obtaining the opinions of four experts and making necessary adjustments.</p><p>The information form and scales were administered to the adolescents with T1DM in both study and control groups at the beginning of the study (the first month of the study).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>The Training stage of the study</title><p>The study group (n=18) was divided into 4 small groups of 4-5 subjects so that the training stage could be carried out interactively and effectively. The training of the groups, designated by drawing lots, took four sessions (each session took 35-45 minutes), and then the adolescents were given a training guide. There were breaks between the sessions for giving snacks to the adolescents. The training sessions started with small warm-up games, and then methods such as narrating, question-answer, demonstration, discussion and role-play were employed. One month after the training (the third month of the study), the scales were re-administered to the study and control groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Social Adaptation and Consultation Stage</title><p>Social adaptation (peer interaction, interviews with family and counselors) and counseling activities were provided to the adolescents in the study group in order to monitor their peer interaction and adaptation to the disease.
