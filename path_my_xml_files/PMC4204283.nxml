Prevalence of major depression in general population is estimated at 5% worldwide. At present 121 million people are estimated to suffer from depression. An estimated 5.8% of men and 9.5% of women experience a depressive episode in their lifetime.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Suicide attempts occur in approximately 15% of depressive patients, specially young and elderly men.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Several different pharmacologic classes of medications are used to treat depression. Oldest agents are tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and the newer agents include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Although both TCAs and MAOIs are effective, their use is limited, primarily because of adverse effects. TCAs are associated with cardiac, anticholinergic, sedative and hypotensive side effects, as well as there is potential for severe toxicity with overdose. MAOIs require adherence to dietary restrictions. Newer agents, SSRIs are also associated with side effects like somnolence, sexual dysfunction, diarrhea and weight gain.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Only one-third of depressed patients who are treated with a single antidepressant achieve remission (i.e., complete resolution of symptoms).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Although the currently prescribed drugs provide some improvement in clinical condition of patients, it is at the cost of having to bear the burden of their adverse effects. In addition, it is difficult to predict which patient will respond to any given treatment.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Treatment resistant depression is a significant problem in up to two-thirds of patients with major unipolar depression.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Hence there is a definite need for development of new antidepressants.</p><p>It was thought to be worthwhile to test indigenous drugs derived from plants in search of newer treatments of depression. In Ayurveda, formulations containing multiple herbal and herbo-mineral ingredients are often used for many different conditions based on the concept that they provide synergistic therapeutic effect and help to minimize adverse effects of major drugs.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] One such multi-ingredient plant-based herbo-mineral formulation is &#x02018;<italic>Saraswatarishta</italic>&#x02019;. It consists of 18 plants as depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>;[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] some of which include Ashwagandha, Brahmi and Shatavari which are <italic>Medhyarasayanas</italic>. <italic>Medhyarasayanas</italic> are used to improve memory and cognitive deficits.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] <italic>Saraswatarishta</italic> is claimed to be useful to treat acute anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, partial loss of memory, low grasping power, slurred speech etc.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In view of the central nervous system effects of <italic>Saraswatarishta</italic> described in Ayurveda, it was of interest to study whether it has antidepressant potential. Hence, present study was planned to study effect of <italic>Saraswatarishta</italic> alone and its combination with the commonly prescribed antidepressants of two classes, namely imipramine and fluoxetine in animal models of behavior despair.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Ingridients of <italic>Saraswatarishta</italic></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JAIM-5-141-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Institutional Animal Ethics Committee permission was obtained before initiating the study.

However, effects produced by imipramine were found to be better when compared to other two drugs <italic>viz</italic>. fluoxetine and <italic>Saraswatarishta</italic>. This may be attributable to the additional anticholinergic and antihistaminic activity of imipramine since anticholinergics and antihistaminics also show positive results in FST model.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] <italic>Saraswatarishta</italic> was found to decrease the immobility time in both the models of behavioral despair. Reserpine pretreated rats when subjected to FST showed further prolongation of immobility time than those subjected to FST alone.

Reserpine pretreatment dampened locomotion and rearing, which was reversed by all the study drugs. Again the rise in locomotion and in rearing among the study drug groups were found to be comparable. The responses to OFT were consistent in chronic FST in reserpine pretreated animals in Part 2B-II. The changes produced in OFT by <italic>Saraswatarishta</italic> were similar to the modern medicines in all four experiments. The findings of no overt motor dysfunction due to <italic>Saraswatarishta</italic> in OFTs confirm possibility of its antidepressant like effect and rule out its nonspecific stimulant or depressant effect.</p><p>The concurrent administration of imipramine with <italic>Saraswatarishta</italic> failed to exert better effect than either drugs alone in acute and chronic version of FST. There was a small trend towards better effect with combination of fluoxetine with <italic>Saraswatarishta</italic> than the individual drug groups chronic version of FST, and in acute FST in reserpine pretreated rats, fluoxetine with <italic>Saraswatarishta</italic> group showed a trend towards better effect as compared to fluoxetine alone. It is unclear why the effect of this combination was not consistent throughout all experiments of the study and also why the combination of <italic>Saraswatarishta</italic> with imipramine did not show such a trend. It can be speculated that imipramine and <italic>Saraswatarishta</italic> share same mechanism of action and hence there was no enhanced effect, whereas fluoxetine and <italic>Saraswatarishta</italic> complement effects of one another in some way.</p><p>At this stage it is not possible to speculate mechanism/s by which &#x02018;<italic>Saraswatarishta</italic>&#x02019; exerts its effects. FST serves as a stressor and induces alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis to increase corticosterone levels in blood.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Various types of stressors that induce hormonal alterations in experimental animals also produced similar effects in human as observed in depressed patients.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Perhaps estimation of monoamine levels in the brain (neurochemical mechanism) and monoamine oxidase activity (biochemical mechanism) and studies with mediators of HPA axis would help in unraveling the mechanism by which &#x02018;<italic>Saraswatarishta</italic>&#x02019; acts and then its effects can be better interpreted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Thus, present study proved that <italic>Saraswatarishta</italic> exerts antidepressant effects on its own. Concomitant administration with imipramine did not enhance its anti-depressant effect. Effect of coadministration of <italic>Saraswatarishta</italic> with fluoxetine appears promising but needs to be evaluated further to study their precise interaction.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil,</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shalam</surname><given-names>Md</given-names></name><name><surname>Shantkumar</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Narasu</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pharmacological and biochemical evidence for the antidepressant effect of the herbal preparation Trans-01</article-title><source>Indian J Pharmacol</source><year>2007</year><volume>39</volume><fpage>231</fpage><lpage>4</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Modabernia</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Tehrani</surname><given-names>HS</given-names></name><name><surname>Fallahi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Shirazi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Modabbernia</surname><given-names>AH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevalence of depressive disorders in Rasht, Iran: A community based study</article-title><source>Clin Pract Epidemiol Ment Health</source><year>2008</year><volume>4</volume><fpage>20</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18601715</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>O&#x02019;Donnell</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Shelton</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Brunton</surname><given-names>LL</given-names></name><name><surname>Chabner</surname><given-names>BA</given-names></name><name><surname>Knollmann</surname><given-names>BC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Drug therapy of depression and anxiety disorders</article-title><source>Goodman and Gillman's The pharmacological basis of therapeutics</source><year>2011</year><edition>12th ed</edition><publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc><publisher-name>McGraw Hill</publisher-name><fpage>400</fpage><lpage>3</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adams</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>KE</given-names></name><name><surname>Zylstra</surname><given-names>RG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pharmacologic Management of Adult Depression</article-title><source>Am Fam Physician</source><year>2008</year><volume>77</volume><fpage>785</fpage><lpage>92</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18386592</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Little</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Treatment-Resistant Depression</article-title><source>Am Fam Physician</source><year>2009</year><volume>80</volume><fpage>167</fpage><lpage>72</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19621857</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bhattacharya</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Behavioural Studies on BR-16A (Mentat), A Herbal Psychotropic Formulation</article-title><source>Indian JExp Biol</source><year>1994</year><volume>32</volume><fpage>37</fpage><lpage>49</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8045603</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><collab>Atha Vajikaranaprakaranam</collab><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Shastri</surname><given-names>RV</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bhaisajyaratnavali, Vidyotini &#x02013;
