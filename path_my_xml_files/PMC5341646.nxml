All patients were administered IVRA in this prospective, double-blind, randomized study. Patients enrolled in the study were randomly divided into two groups of thirty each. Group M-received 40 ml of 0.5% lignocaine with midazolam 50 &#x003bc;g/kg and Group D-received 40 ml of 0.5% lignocaine with dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg.

Different agents have been used as additive to local anesthetic for IVRA including phencyclidines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, and muscle relaxants.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is approximately eight times more selective toward the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptors than clonidine. It decreases anesthetic requirements by up to 90% and induces analgesia in patients.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It has been used successfully in combination with local anesthetics for procedures such as spinal, epidural, brachial blocks, and intravenous regional anesthesia. A large number of studies have shown that dexmedetomedine when added to lignocaine improves the quality of anesthesia and perioperative analgesia in intravenous regional anesthesia without causing side effects.</p><p>Midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, is roughly 1.5&#x02013;2 times as potent as diazepam and has a greater hypnotic effect than diazepam because it interferes with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) reuptake.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Midazolam is primarily used preoperatively as an anxiolytic and sedative-hypnotic agent. It is available in IV, intramuscular, oral, sublingual, rectal, and intranasal preparations. The role of midazolam in regional anesthesia has been successfully studied. Midazolam has been shown to improve the quality of anesthesia and perioperative analgesia when added to lignocaine in IVRA without causing side effects. GABA receptors have also been found in peripheral nerves and midazolam reduces A-delta and C-fiber-evoked activity when given IV.</p><p>No study till date has compared the analgesic efficacy of dexmedetomidine and midazolam as additives in IVRA. We compared the onset and duration of analgesia during IVRA using lignocaine with midazolam, and lignocaine with dexmedetomidine and assessed postoperative analgesic requirement of the patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This prospective randomized study was conducted after obtaining clearance from the Institutional Ethics Committee, and written informed consent from all patients. Patients of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical Status I and II, aged between 18 and 65 years scheduled for forearm and hand surgeries in the distal region of upper limb under IVRA, were included in this study after fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria. Those with a history of allergic reaction to lignocaine, significant cardiovascular disease, sickle cell disease, highly nervous and uncooperative patients, patient with crush injury or open wound, history of opioid dependence, drug or alcohol abuse, psychiatric disorder, peripheral vascular disease, and neurological diseases were excluded from the study. At the preoperative visit, in the evening before surgery, the visual analog scale (VAS) scoring system was explained to all the patients.</p><p>Sample size calculation was done on the basis of the previous study. The primary outcome was taken as pain-free period and assuming 85% of study power and 5% &#x003b1; error; the minimum sample size was calculated to be 27 patients per group were required. Therefore, thirty patients in each group were planned. Patients were assigned randomly into two groups by computer-generated random number chart, and patients were assigned respective group by sealed opaque envelope technique. The anesthesiologist who prepared the study solution for Bier's block did not participate in the study. Attending anesthetist was not aware of the composition of the drug composition used for block. Patients in Group M received lignocaine along with midazolam (50 &#x000b5;g/kg), and Group D received lignocaine and dexmedetomidine (1 &#x000b5;g/kg). The lignocaine used in the study was 2% preservative-free and constant (200 mg) in all groups. To make the total volume of test solution 40 ml, normal saline (NS) (0.9%) was added.</p><p>No premedication was given to any of the patients. Standard monitoring was used in all patients, which included noninvasive blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram, and pulse oximetry. Before administration of IVRA, an infusion of 0.9% NS was started in the normal limb. A 20-gauge IV cannula was inserted into the distal vein of the extremity that was to be operated. Two tourniquets were placed, and arm was exsanguinated using an Esmarch bandage. The proximal tourniquet was inflated to 100 mmHg above the systolic pressure of the patient. The absence of radial artery pulsations and failure of pulse oximetry tracing in the ipsilateral index finger was confirmed. Forty milliliters of test solution was injected over 90 s by an anesthesiologist who was blinded to the drug being administered.</p><p>After the injection of different study solutions, the onset of sensory block (defined as loss of pain sensation) was determined by the pin prick method, with a 22-gauge hypodermic needle, distal to the proximal tourniquet. The distal tourniquet was inflated followed by the deflation of proximal tourniquet. Assessment of tourniquet pain score was made on the basis of VAS (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain). If the patient had complained of tourniquet pain, 1 &#x003bc;g/kg of fentanyl with 0.1 mg/kg ondansetron was given IV and in case of persistent pain, same dose of fentanyl was repeated after 5 min. Time to first analgesic demand, and sedation score (Ramsay sedation score) were compared. Postoperatively, patients received diclofenac 75 mg IV if VAS was &#x0003e;5.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size was chosen after reviewing many randomized control studies on the same subject.

The advantages of IVRA are high indices of reliability, rapid onset of analgesia, and good muscle relaxation. The main limitations of IVRA are tourniquet pain, limited duration of surgery, and absence of postoperative analgesia.</p><p>In several studies, it was tried to find a local anesthetic mixture that allows relief from tourniquet pain and prolonged duration of analgesia after tourniquet release. NSAIDs (ketorolac, ibuprofen, dexketoprofen, paracetamol, lornoxicam), opioids (morphine, fentanyl, tramadol, and pentazocine), and the combination of opioid and muscle relaxant (atracurium, mivacurium, pancuronium) have been studied without demonstrating clear advantage.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Holmes, Janardhan, and Venkata Rao had advocated the use of double tourniquet method with the second tourniquet on the anesthetized portion on the extremity distal to the proximal one to prevent tourniquet pain and discomfort.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Hence, in the present study, double tourniquet was used.</p><p>In this study, mean time of onset of sensory block was 8.01 &#x000b1; 4.02 min in Group D and 6.49 &#x000b1; 4.26 min in Group M, which was statistically insignificant.</p><p>According to Tahawy <italic>et al</italic>., the mean time of onset of sensory block was 2.93 &#x000b1; 0.86 min in dexmedetomidine group, who received 20 ml of 1% lignocaine with 0.5 &#x000b5;g/kg dexmedetomidine diluted with NS to make total volume of 40 ml and was 3.07 &#x000b1; 0.86 min in magnesium sulfate group, who received 20 ml of 1% lignocaine with 5 ml of 20% magnesium sulfate diluted with 15 ml NS to make total volume of 40 ml. The difference between two groups regarding mean time of onset of sensory block was statistically insignificant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.554). They observed that mean time of onset of sensory block was less in dexmedetomidine group in comparison to magnesium sulfate group. In contrast with present study, mean time of onset of sensory block was delayed in dexmedetomidine group (8.01 &#x000b1; 4.02 min) as compared to midazolam group (6.49 &#x000b1; 4.26 min). This may be because of premedication with midazolam 0.5 mg/kg orally in contrast to our study where no premedication was given. Local anesthetic property of midazolam and its synergistic action with lignocaine and dexmedetomidine can explain the early onset of sensory block in their study. They concluded that dexmedetomidine was superior to magnesium sulfate as an adjuvant regarding tourniquet pain and hemodynamic stability. Hence, the findings of our study are in accordance with observations made by Tahawy <italic>et al</italic>. regarding hemodynamic stability in Group D.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>According to Kumar <italic>et al</italic>., the mean time of onset of sensory block was 6.5 &#x000b1; 0.88 min in Group L (control group), who received 10 ml of 2% lignocaine diluted with NS to make a total volume of 20 ml and was 1.15 &#x000b1; 0.50 min in Group LK, who received 0.5 mg/kg ketamine along with 2% 10 ml of lignocaine diluted with NS to make total volume 20 ml and was 4.30 &#x000b1; 0.60 min in Group LD, who received 1 &#x000b5;g/kg dexmedetomidine along with 2% 10 ml of lignocaine diluted with NS to make total volume 20 ml. Differences between LK and LD were statistically significant. That means onset was delayed in Group LD (4.30 &#x000b1; 0.60 min). In contrast to the present study, it was 8.01 &#x000b1; 4.02 min in dexmedetomidine group, which can be explained by the concentration of lignocaine. Kumar <italic>et al</italic>. used 1% in contrast to our study, it was 0.5% lignocaine. Similarly, in this study, results were in favor of observations made by Kumar <italic>et al</italic>. that addition of dexmedetomidine as an adjunct in IVRA improves the quality of anesthesia and perioperative analgesia without causing side effects.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Abosedira compared clonidine and dexmedetomidine in IVRA, and he concluded that significantly lesser number of patients required reduced amount of analgesics (fentanyl) in dexmedetomidine group.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Kashefi <italic>et al</italic>. and Honarmand <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that midazolam (50 &#x000b5;g/kg) when added to lignocaine for IVRA shortens the onset of sensory and motor block and improves the quality of anesthesia and postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>One study by Memis <italic>et al</italic>. was conducted in 2004 on dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to lignocaine in IVRA, which was having level of evidence II for improving the quality of anesthesia in IVRA.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Various adjuvants had been added from time to time to local anesthetics to prolong the period of analgesia and to improve the quality of anesthesia, but no study had been done for comparison of dexmedetomidine and midazolam when added to lignocaine in IVRA.

However, the onset of sensory block was earlier with midazolam (6.49 &#x000b1; 4.26 min vs. 8.01 &#x000b1; 4.02 min), and duration of analgesia was longer with dexmedetomidine (93 &#x000b1; 28 min vs. 84 &#x000b1; 28 min).
