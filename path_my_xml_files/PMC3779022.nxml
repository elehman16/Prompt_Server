Therefore, we conducted a mechanistic study using an ET receptor antagonist to determine if it could alter the homogeneity of myocardial perfusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Included subjects demonstrated a low myocardial perfusion homogeneity index (HI) compared to normal volunteers. Four serial cardiac positron emission tomography Rb-82 scans were performed 2&#x000a0;weeks apart.

However, their effect on myocardial perfusion homogeneity has not been studied. Therefore, we performed cardiac PET before and after ET blockade with darusentan, an oral antagonist of the ET type A receptor. Our primary hypothesis was that darusentan would increase homogeneity of myocardial perfusion at rest, thereby demonstrating one mechanism for perfusion heterogeneity. Secondary aims were to assess the reproducibility of perfusion homogeneity, the duration of perfusion changes after darusentan administration, and if its effects on heterogeneity were mediated by altering absolute myocardial flow and coronary flow reserve (CFR).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p>Our study utilized an investigator-initiated, single center, crossover, placebo-controlled, blinded trial with 1:1 randomization. It was performed at the Weatherhead PET Center for Preventing and Reversing Atherosclerosis of the University of Texas Medical School at Houston and Memorial Hermann Hospital. Each subject gave written informed consent approved by the institutional review board.</p><p>Subjects underwent four sequential cardiac PET scans: baseline, placebo, darusentan, and final. Placebo and darusentan scans occurred second and third, ordered randomly when study eligibility had been confirmed from the baseline labs and PET. Drug administration had to occur within 4&#x000a0;weeks of the baseline PET scan, although all cases started the next day except 1 subject (3&#x000a0;weeks). Each drug was taken for 14&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;days. Fasting blood work (complete blood count, comprehensive chemistry panel, serum uric acid, phosphorous, lactate dehydrogenase, and &#x003b3;-glutamyl transpeptidase) and urinalysis were performed at most 4&#x000a0;weeks before the baseline PET and on the day of the final PET. A lipid profile was performed at baseline.</p><p>Randomization of the placebo and darusentan order allowed for assessment as follows. Subjects whose placebo scan immediately followed the baseline scan provided information on the test-retest reproducibility of myocardial homogeneity. Subjects whose placebo scan instead followed the darusentan scan provided information on late washout. However, all subjects had baseline, darusentan, and washout studies.

Inclusion criterion was a rest myocardial heterogeneity at least 2 standard deviations below originally published normal limits based on an older, rotating rod PET scanner used at that time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref> During the study, this criterion was relaxed to at least 1.5 standard deviations to increase enrollment. See the next section for explicit cutoffs based on our measure of homogeneity. Exclusion criteria broadly included uncontrolled or severe comorbidity, inability to undergo serial PET scans, or contraindication to darusentan.</p><p>Specific exclusion criteria were: acute heart failure, sustained and symptomatic hypotension (systolic &#x0003c;90&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;Hg), uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &#x02265;170&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;Hg or diastolic &#x02265;100&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;Hg), unstable angina, major adverse cardiac event in prior 6&#x000a0;months (acute myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or mechanical revascularization), primary valvular disease, significant vascular aneurysm, history of renal or liver failure (elevated serum creatinine, total bilirubin &#x02265;3&#x000a0;mg/dL, or serum liver aminotransferase enzyme levels above twofold the upper limit of normal), active malignancy, life expectancy under 12&#x000a0;months, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or complications of gastroparesis or severe neuropathy, substance abuse within the last 2&#x000a0;years, active or recent participation within 1&#x000a0;month of enrollment in another clinical research study, planned surgical procedure during study, certain herbal food supplements (<sc>l</sc>-carnitine, <sc>l</sc>-arginine, Ginko biloba), prior serious adverse event attributed to treatment with any ET receptor agonist, or female subjects who are pregnant or with the potential for child-bearing, lactating, or treated with hormone therapies.</p><p>Potential subjects who had undergone prior PET studies were contacted by mailings after a preliminary chart review. Those who were interested signed informed consent and underwent fasting blood work in advance of the baseline PET scan. If laboratory testing and medical review did not identify any exclusion criteria, then the baseline PET scan was performed to determine the resting perfusion homogeneity. Only subjects who met the baseline inclusion criterion underwent randomization.</p><p>Assignment of subjects to study drug order (placebo then darusentan or darusentan then placebo) was performed by the dedicated research pharmacy at our institution using simple 1:1 randomization. An allocation sequence was created using a random number generator by a statistician not associated with the study. A printed list of the allocation sequences was concealed in the research pharmacy and used sequentially for each randomized subject. Investigators, study subjects, and PET center staff performing imaging were blinded to treatment assignment during the entire trial.</p><p>Medications were dispensed in pill bottles containing either 18 tablets of darusentan 100&#x000a0;mg or identical placebo. Each subject was given one bottle during a treatment period and returned unused pills on the day of the associated PET scan. Pill counts performed by the research pharmacy assessed compliance and found no significant deviations. Subjects were instructed to take one pill each morning including on the day of a PET scan. Although no study drug intolerance was identified, the protocol mandated withdrawal of any subject unable to take the study drug, as dose reduction was not permitted. During the study, subjects were instructed to continue all concomitant medications consistently. At each PET scan, subjects reported on any symptoms noted while taking the study medication. Symptoms were classified without knowledge of treatment assignment as headache, congestion, flushing, and other (including chest tightness, sore throat, edema, myalgia, nervousness, lightheadedness).</p><p>A required sample size of about 40 subjects was estimated based on a paired <italic>t</italic> test with <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.80, and a projected increase from 0.37 to 0.43, which is approximately half a standard deviation of the normal range for our previously published<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref> index of myocardial homogeneity (described next). No interim analyses or stopping guidelines were considered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Homogeneity Index (HI)</title><p>We previously developed the unitless HI using Markovian analysis of relative uptake images.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref> In brief, the HI quantifies the intuitive, visual notion of homogeneity. Values near HI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1 occur when relative uptake is completely uniform. Values near HI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0 occur when every uptake pixel differs from its neighbors. To avoid quantifying heterogeneity in areas of scar or normal myocardium, uptake values below 50% or above 85% of maximum are set to 50% or 85%, respectively. By design, the HI favors small uptake differences among adjacent pixels, for example those present at interfaces among normal myocardium, scar, and perfusion defects. Four basal slices were not used for HI analysis due to low counts in the membranous interventricular septum. Two apical slices were not used for HI analysis due to potential partial volume errors caused by partial thickness slices through the LV apex and apical motion.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Enrollment flow diagram.

Due to slight asymmetry of the HI distribution in normal volunteers imaged by PET-CT, only 2 (10%) of the 20 randomized subjects had an entry rest HI that would not be considered an outlier using box-and-whisker plots, as detailed in a subsequent figure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>PET Acquisition and Reconstruction Protocol</title><p>Our imaging protocol has been described previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref> In brief, subjects were instructed to fast for 4&#x000a0;hours and abstain from caffeine, theophylline, and cigarettes for 24&#x000a0;hours. Cardiac PET was performed using a Discovery ST 16-slice PET-CT machine (GE Healthcare) in two-dimensional mode with settings for an in-plane resolution of approximately 6-7&#x000a0;mm full-width at half-maximum.</p><p>Rest emission images were obtained over 7&#x000a0;minutes beginning immediately upon intravenous injection of 1,110 to 1,850&#x000a0;MBq (30 to 50&#x000a0;mCi) of generator-produced Rb-82 (Bracco Diagnostics). The first 2&#x000a0;minutes of emission images were binned to form arterial input data. The last 5&#x000a0;minutes of emission images were binned to form myocardial uptake data. Immediately after completion of the resting scan, dipyridamole (142&#x000a0;mcg/kg/minute) was infused for 4&#x000a0;minutes. Four minutes after completion of dipyridamole infusion, the same dose of radiotracer was given. Stress emission images were acquired for 7&#x000a0;minutes and binned into arterial and myocardial images as for the resting scan. Dipyridamole-induced symptoms were treated with intravenous aminophylline.</p><p>CT scans for attenuation correction were acquired before rest and after stress emission imaging. Protocols for attenuation CT acquisition have been previously reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref> Fusion images superimposed PET emission and CT transmission scans in horizontal, coronal, and sagittal views. Co-registration was optimized by shifting as needed. PET images were reconstructed using filtered backprojection with a Butterworth filter (cutoff 0.55&#x000a0;cycles/cm, rolloff 10&#x000a0;dB/decade, pixel size 3.27&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;3.27&#x000a0;mm). After attenuation correction and reconstruction, transaxial PET images were exported for analysis on CARDIAC software (Positron Corporation) to generate true short- and long-axis views, perpendicular and parallel to the long-axis of the LV. Circumferential profiles of maximum radial activity for each true short-axis slice were used to construct two-dimensional topographic views of the entire LV in lateral, inferior, septal, and anterior quadrant views.</p><p>In one case, the GE scanner required maintenance and the subject could not reschedule for logistic reasons. Instead, an mPower rotating rod PET scanner (Positron Corporation) was used for imaging. In another case, the GE scanner suffered a technical malfunction during stress acquisition so that only rest data was available. For the last subject, the Rb-82 generator was recalled after the third PET scan. In this case, the final PET scan took place 29&#x000a0;days later using N-13 ammonia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Primary and Secondary Endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint was the change in rest myocardial perfusion homogeneity as quantified by the unitless HI. Calculation of HI was completely automated by software and occurred on the day of the PET scan, without subsequent reprocessing or alteration.</p><p>Secondary endpoints were stress HI (computed as for rest HI but on the stress uptake images), absolute myocardial flow, and CFR. Originally planned secondary endpoints of relative uptake perfusion defects and the base-to-apex longitudinal gradient<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref> were modified since we developed the technical ability to measure absolute flow routinely. Peak integrated activity over an approximate 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;mm circular area in the left atrium or thoracic aorta was determined from transaxial images acquired during the first 2&#x000a0;minutes after each radiotracer injection. Integrated myocardial activity during the next 5&#x000a0;minutes was determined from topographical maps of the LV. For each of 64 radial segments at each of 21 short-axis slices, integrated arterial input and myocardial uptake were used to compute absolute myocardial flow using an established model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref> implemented using custom software. The 21&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;64 pixel topographic flow map was smoothed using a 5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;5 pixel average to suppress noise introduced by the flow model. CFR was computed as the stress-to-rest ratio on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Rest flow was adjusted for baseline pressure-rate product (PRP) by dividing its measured value by the systolic blood pressure and heart rate, then multiplying by 7,000&#x000a0;bpm&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;Hg (approximately the average resting PRP at baseline).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using R version 2.13.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Continuous variables are expressed as mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;standard deviation. Frequency variables are expressed as number (percent). All continuous variables were found to be approximately normal on inspection of quantile-quantile plots. ANOVA from a linear mixed effects model with random effects within subjects assessed changes in primary and secondary endpoints among baseline, darusentan, and washout PET scans. If this ANOVA was significant, then a Tukey all-pair comparison was performed to determine which PET scan(s) were different. A paired <italic>t</italic> test compared reproducibility to baseline (for subjects randomized to placebo first), late image to washout (for subjects randomized to darusentan first), and baseline and final laboratory values (for all patients).

To our knowledge, we are the first to modulate ET directly in humans for the purpose of studying myocardial perfusion homogeneity. Treatment with the ET antagonist darusentan significantly improved resting myocardial perfusion homogeneity.</p><p>Improved perfusion homogeneity with darusentan occurred as average absolute resting flow increased, especially when accounting for a slightly lower PRP. As darusentan has been shown to lower blood pressure,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref> the observed decrease in these parameters during its administration is expected and consistent. Normally, however, PRP and resting flow are directly related. Therefore, the flat or even inverse relationship between PRP and resting flow in this data suggests that ET blockade increases flow by an alternative mechanism, likely vasodilation.</p><p>Note that if ET blockade raised all flows by the same amount, homogeneity would remain largely unchanged as it depends on relative differences. Only altering flow differentially will decrease heterogeneity, as variation among regions diminishes. Thus, improved homogeneity with darusentan provides an important physiologic insight distinct from the obvious and known vasodilation known to occur with ET antagonism.</p><p>Our HI was reproducible under test-retest conditions, which supports its use as an imaging biomarker. Darusentan did not produce any lasting clinical changes in rest perfusion homogeneity, blood pressure, or laboratory values beyond the study period. Late washout values of HI did not differ from those obtained after a typical washout period, consistent with the known biologic 12.5&#x000a0;hour half-life of darusentan.</p><p>While darusentan improves rest HI, it does not reach levels seen in young, normal volunteers, suggesting residual factors that produce heterogeneity. This improved but persistent heterogeneity after darusentan parallels our prior animal study in which <italic>intravenous</italic> adenosine improved but did not normalize myocardial perfusion defects produced by intracoronary ET-1, whereas <italic>intracoronary</italic> adenosine eliminated the residual perfusion images remaining after intravenous adenosine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref> Higher doses of darusentan (up to 300&#x000a0;mg can be given daily) may have produced additional increases in perfusion homogeneity beyond those seen by our 100&#x000a0;mg dose. Additionally, permanent structural changes in the myocardium may have developed due to risk factors or manifest heart disease that prevent normalization of rest HI.</p><p>In a minority of subjects, the rest HI on darusentan either did not increase or even decreased. No predictors of this response were found in a post hoc analysis. By analogy, about half of subjects with resistant hypertension randomized to 100 or 300&#x000a0;mg did not reach blood pressure goals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref> Also, certain polymorphisms of the mediating G-protein beta3 subunit may modulate the vasoconstrictor effect of the ET system,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref> and therefore be important determinants of treatment response to darusentan. Future work should examine the subgroup of nonresponders for additional mechanistic insights.</p><p>Some potential contributors to perfusion heterogeneity arise from the imaging technique: Poisson counting statistics inherent to radioisotopes, scatter and attenuation of photons, PET camera noise, selected reconstruction algorithm, and the applied smoothing filter. Our demonstrated lack of correlation between the rest HI and injected dose or body mass index, as well as good test-retest reproducibility, suggest that these mechanisms are not dominant.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Comparison to Existing Literature</title><p>To our knowledge, perfusion heterogeneity in humans has not been studied previously in the setting of ET blockade. However, changes in myocardial perfusion from endothelial dysfunction have been previously demonstrated in 20 subjects undergoing invasive coronary physiology evaluation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref> Technetium-99m was injected into the coronary artery immediately before the highest dose of the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine. Perfusion defects were noted on imaging in all 7 subjects with a decrease in coronary blood flow, compared to 0 subjects whose flow increased. Even using a more relaxed cutoff of &#x02264;50% increase in coronary blood flow, 7 of 11 subjects showed a perfusion defect compared to 0 of 9 subjects without endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, our findings of darusentan-induced changes in myocardial perfusion have precedent in this model using intracoronary delivery of acetylcholine.</p><p>Invasive coronary physiology was assessed at baseline and after 6&#x000a0;months in 47 subjects randomized to daily placebo vs an ET antagonist.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref> While baseline flow increased by 15.3&#x000a0;cc/minute in treated subjects compared to 5.6&#x000a0;cc/minute in those taking placebo, this trend did not reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.25). However, it mirrors the increase in rest flow seen in our study while taking darusentan. Long-term ET antagonism significantly increased endothelium-dependent flow using acetylcholine (39.7% with blockade compared to &#x02212;2.2% with placebo, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.001) but not endothelium-independent CFR using adenosine (&#x02212;0.3 in both groups, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.65). Our study antagonized ET receptors for a much shorter period of time (2&#x000a0;weeks compared to 6&#x000a0;months) and did not differentiate between endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent pathways.</p><p>A study of 19 community volunteers measured rest and hyperemic blood flow using cardiac PET before and during treatment with a selective ET type A antagonist.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref> ET blockade did not alter the PRP, but increased resting blood flow from 0.63 to 0.85&#x000a0;cc/minute/g. However, no change in hyperemic blood flow was noted during adenosine infusion. These results are similar to our findings in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> that ET antagonism increases resting blood flow without increasing the PRP, but hyperemic flows are not changed.</p><p>Prior work has studied the anti-hypertensive effects of darusentan in refractory hypertension. Our observed mean decrease in blood pressure of 9/7&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;Hg (systolic/diastolic) after 2&#x000a0;weeks (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.001 compared to baseline) mirrors observations with the same dose of darusentan after 14&#x000a0;weeks in 81 patients with refractory hypertension of 9/5&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;Hg when offset by the placebo group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref> However, our observed mean increase in resting heart rate of 4&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;7&#x000a0;bpm (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.021) was not seen in that study. A mild decrease in hemoglobin due to hemodilution has been reported in other studies of ET antagonists,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref> although our final labs were performed at least 10&#x000a0;days after the last dose of darusentan.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Limitations</title><p>For pragmatic reasons we changed the enrollment HI cutoff value during study recruitment. However, relaxing the HI cutoff to include more homogeneous values would, if anything, tend to reduce the observed effect size compared to including more heterogeneous values as originally intended. Since 19 of the 20 subjects were male, our results apply essentially to that gender.</p><p>We did not measure serum levels of ET at baseline or during darusentan treatment. Our motivation for not doing so was the unclear relation between intracoronary effects and venous levels of ET. However, variations in baseline ET might explain the differential response to darusentan seen in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. For example, a subject with low levels of ET might not be expected to respond to its antagonism, as seen in several subjects with flat HI values between baseline and active treatment. ET levels might have provided a mechanistic explanation for varying treatment response. However, prior work in volunteers did not find an association between circulating ET-1 levels and changed rest flow with ET antagonism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Homogeneity of resting myocardial perfusion measured by cardiac PET improved when taking the ET antagonist darusentan. A potential mechanism for improved homogeneity is increased and more uniform rest flow despite a slightly lower PRP. Our translational results support a mechanistic role for ET in regulating perfusion homogeneity in the human coronary circulation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Internal funding was provided by the Weatherhead PET Center for Preventing and Reversing Atherosclerosis.
