Herein, we tested cell therapy using early outgrowth cells (EOCs) or their conditioned media (CM) to protect the retina of diabetic animal models (type 1 and type 2) and assessed the mechanisms by <italic>in vitro</italic> study. Control and diabetic (db/db) mice (8 weeks of age) were randomized to receive a unique intravenous injection of 5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup>EOCs or 0.25 ml thrice weekly tail-vein injections of 10x concentrated CM and Wystar Kyoto rats rendered diabetic were randomized to receive 0.50 ml thrice weekly tail-vein injections of 10x concentrated CM. Four weeks later, the animals were euthanized and the eyes were enucleated. Rat retinal M&#x000fc;ller cells (rMCs) were exposed for 24 h to high glucose (HG), combined or not with EOC-conditioned medium (EOC-CM) from db/m EOC cultures. Diabetic animals showed increase in diabetic retinopathy (DR) and oxidative damage markers; the treatment with EOCs or CM infusions significantly reduced this damage and re-established the retinal function. In rMCs exposed to diabetic milieu conditions (HG), the presence of EOC-CM reduced reactive oxygen species production by modulating the NADPH-oxidase 4 system, thus upregulating SIRT1 activity and deacetylating Lys-310-p65-NF&#x003ba;B, decreasing GFAP and VEGF expressions. The antioxidant capacity of EOC-CM led to the prevention of carbonylation and nitrosylation posttranslational modifications on the SIRT1 molecule, preserving its activity. The pivotal role of SIRT1 on the mode of action of EOCs or their CM was also demonstrated on diabetic retina. These findings suggest that EOCs are effective as a form of systemic delivery for preventing the early molecular markers of DR and its conditioned medium is equally protective revealing a novel possibility for cell-free therapy for the treatment of DR.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado de S&#x000e3;o Paulo (FAPESP grants 2008/57560-0, 2010/11514-7, J.B.L.F.; 2013/04331-1, J.M.L.F.) and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico (CNPq).

The known pathways, including oxidative stress, increased formation of AGEs, and activation of protein kinase-C and hexosamine pathways [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], appear to cross-talk. For this reason, new strategies to prevent these devastating complications are needed.</p><p>Cellular therapies for the treatment of degenerative retinal diseases such as DR and age-relatedmacular degeneration have been developed recently using a variety of cell types, including pluripotent stem cell- retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), bone marrow- or umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells, foetal neural or retinal progenitor cells, and stem cell-derived adult RPE [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Among many proposed cell types, circulating or bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been the main cells used in clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The mechanisms by which these cells exert their beneficial effects remain unclear, and studies have documented only minimal retention of administered cells within organs that have nevertheless sustained functional and structural improvements [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. So-called early out growth cells (EOCs), defined by theidentification of their cell surface markers, have gained attention for their secretory feature of releasing antifibrotic and anti-oxidative stress factors [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Gilbert and colleagues described a successful treatment for diabetic nephropathy using a single infusion of EOCs in an experimental model of type 2 diabetes mellitusmice [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Similar findings were demonstrated in db/db mice treated with conditioned medium from EOCs, suggesting that the effects were mediated through released factors [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Mass spectrometric analysis of the EOC-conditioned medium (EOC-CM) identified proteins that regulate cellular functions implicated in fibrosis and proteins involved in stress responses, such as HSP-19, glutathione S transferase (GST1), peroxiredoxin, superoxide dismutase (SOD), thioredoxin, and heme oxygenase-1 [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These results indicate that EOCs display a great capacity for secreting soluble factor(s) with potent antioxidant activity that, when injected intravenously, replicate the salutary effects of the cells themselves.</p><p>Muller cell, the predominant glial cell in the retina, has its cell body residing in the inner nuclear layer and span all retinal layers, interacts with neighbouring neurons, being part of the outer and inner limiting membranes [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Due to this, Muller cells monitor the retinal structure and function. Muller cell processes wrap around retinal blood vessels thus controlling retinal barrier [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] but also mantain neurons by releasing trophic factors and recycling neurotransmitters and controlling ionic balance in the extracellular space [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These two both features are present in the pathogenesis of DR. Under sustained stress, as observed in diabetes, the Muller cells produce pro-inflamatory cytokines to restore the retinal homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] upregulating glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and VEGF [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] leading to a glial reaction and blood barrier hyper-permeability [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Sirtuins (SIRTs) are a family of deacetylases that require NAD+ as a cofactor for the deacetylation reaction. SIRT1 has been shown to play a role in gene silencing, apoptosis, senescence, and aging [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As it is NAD+ dependent, SIRT1 acts in some loci by removing the acetyl group from the histonechromatin [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], but it can also suppress other proteins by deacetylation, including the nuclear factor (NF)&#x003ba;B-p65subunit protein [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Under certain stimuli, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), SIRT1 is inactivated, thus suppressing its deacetylase activity [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This redox-sensitive particularity of SIRT1 is explained by a reduction in substrate NAD+ [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] or by the post-translational modification of the SIRT1 protein [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our group recently described the mechanism of glial reaction in M&#x000fc;ller cells under diabetic conditions through acetylation of the NF&#x003ba;B-p65subunit due to impairment of SIRT1 activity [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>In light of this evidence, the aim of this study was to investigate whether cellular therapy using intravenously injected cultured EOCs or their conditioned medium (CM) protect the retina of db/db mice and of experimentally diabetic WKY rats from the effects of the diabetic environment. To address the possible mechanism involved in the observed <italic>in vivo</italic> findings, retinal M&#x000fc;ller cells (rMC) were exposed to high glucose (HG) and treated with CM from db/m EOCs (EOC-CM). Our results indicate that the intravenous infusion of EOCs or their CM mitigates the early DR markers, namely GFAP and VEGF, and oxidative markers in diabetic retinas of db/db mice and fully restored retinal function (evaluated through eletrophysiological means) in diabetic WKY rats. In rMCs exposed to HG, EOC-CM led to a decrease in ROS production via NOX4 system. The equitable redox status re-establishes SIRT1 activity through prevention of the posttranslational modification of the SIRT1 molecule, which in turn deacetylates Lys-310-p65-NF&#x003ba;B and decreases glial reaction, preventing the early DR markers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animal model and experimental design</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Protocol 1</title><p>The animal study complied with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.

An immunofluorescence assay revealed that SIRT1, which is a nuclear factor in its active form, is highly expressed in normal conditions. HG exposure to rMCs induced a marked decrease in the nuclear expression accompanied by translocation to cytosol; treatments with EOC-CM re-established SIRT1 nuclear positivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147978.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). SIRT1 activity evaluated through a fluorometric assay revealed that rMC-1 cells exposed to the HG conditions displayed lower SIRT1 activity (P &#x0003c; 0.0001). The presence of EOC-CM prevented this abnormality (P = 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147978.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). To demonstrate the role of SIRT-1 activation on EOC-CM treatment effects, the rMCs were treated with siRNA for SIRT-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147978.g004">Fig 4B and 4D</xref>) orwith specific inhibitor EX-527 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147978.g004">Fig 4C and 4E</xref>). Cells exposed to HG conditions displayed an increase in total acetylated lysine protein with a 2.8-fold increment of Lys310-RelA/p65 acetylation (P&#x0003c;0.0001). The treatment with EOC-CM caused a decrease in this level (P = 0.004 and P = 0.002, respectively) indicating a significant improvement in SIRT1 activity. The presence of the siRNA or SIRT1 inhibitor thoroughly abolished this effect. As expected, the presence of either siRNA or EX-527 abolished the effects observed in rMC exposed to HG leading to increment of p65-NFkB subunit acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147978.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>, respectively).

As demonstrated that NOX4-NADPH subunit is upregulated in rMCs exposed to HG conditions, we aimed to investigate the cross-talk between SIRT-1 and NOX4-NADPH-oxidase systems.

The rMCs exposed to HG treated with EOC-CM showed improvement in SIRT1 activity through modulation of the NOX4&#x02013;NADPH oxidase subunit, thus reducing ROS formation. This process led to the deacetylation of Lys310-p65, which downregulated the expression of VEGF and GFAP proteins. The complete proteome analyses of the conditioned medium from EOCs shown previously by Gilbert and collaborators [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] described approximately 300 proteins, including GST1, Prdx, Trx, and NADP<sup>+</sup>, which contribute to the antioxidant effects observed in EOC-treated mice. The observation that NOX expression/activity can be modulated by antioxidant enzyme defences is supported by previous work in renal cells, where the NOX subunit is simultaneously the target and agonist of TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Indeed, most agents that improve renal pathology prevent the increase of NOX components [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The high antioxidant capacity of these cells, equilibrating the redox status, prevented the posttranslational modifications on the SIRT1 molecule from restoring its activity under diabetic conditions.</p><p>Since the landmark paper by Asahara [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], EPCs have been the center of regenerative medicine, mainly involving cardiovascular diseases and neovascularisation [<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0147978.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Herein, the treatment with systemic EOCs or their CM invoked protection of retinal tissue from diabetes insult due to its high antioxidant property, thus leading to reestablishment of SIRT1 activity. In conclusion, compelling evidence is provided that equally beneficial effects were observed in treatments using EOCs or their CM, promoting retinal protection from glucose-related oxidative damage. Further studies using conditioned media from EOCs are needed in order to provide evidences of possible efficiency for autologous EOC therapy in patients with diabetic retinopathy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>D.A.D. acquired the data, discussed the findings and wrote the manuscript M.M.R. and A.P., acquired the data.
