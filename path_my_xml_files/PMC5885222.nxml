Multigene expression profiles have significantly increased our ability to estimate distant recurrence in ER-positive breast cancer after surgery and endocrine treatment.<xref rid="coi170101r1" ref-type="bibr"/> These signatures are used in combination with different clinical characteristics to aid the selection of patients for whom chemotherapy may be appropriate based on prognosis. Several of these signatures are commercially available, including the Oncotype Dx recurrence score (RS) (Genomic Health), PAM50-based Prosigna risk of recurrence (ROR) (NanoString), Breast Cancer Index (BCI) (bioTheranostics), EndoPredict (EPclin) (Myriad Genetics), and MammaPrint Netherland Kanker Institute 70-gene signature (Agendia BV), are endorsed by several guidelines<xref rid="coi170101r2" ref-type="bibr"/> and are routinely used by clinicians.</p><p>The Translational Study of Anastrozole or Tamoxifen Alone or Combined (TransATAC) cohort was previously used to develop 2 prognostic algorithms, the Clinical Treatment Score (CTS), which includes clinicopathologic information, and the 4-marker immunohistochemical score (IHC4), which combines prognostic information of 4 widely used IHC markers.<xref rid="coi170101r6" ref-type="bibr"/> The following 4 gene expression&#x02013;based signatures were also evaluated in the TransATAC cohort: the RS,<xref rid="coi170101r6" ref-type="bibr"/> ROR,<xref rid="coi170101r7" ref-type="bibr"/> BCI,<xref rid="coi170101r8" ref-type="bibr"/> and EPclin.<xref rid="coi170101r9" ref-type="bibr"/> The RS and BCI include only molecular information in their signatures, whereas the ROR (tumor size) and EPclin (tumor size and number of positive nodes) integrate clinical information. All these signatures significantly estimated the risk of distant recurrence, particularly in women with node-negative disease, but with a varying amount of prognostic information for late distant recurrence (5-10 years). An important area of research remains to accurately estimate the risk of late distant recurrence in women with ER-positive disease, because more than 50% of recurrences occur after 5 years of endocrine treatment. Gene expression&#x02013;based signatures should show an improvement in prognostication when compared with standard clinical measures.<xref rid="coi170101r8" ref-type="bibr"/></p><p>To our knowledge, no direct and comprehensive comparison of multigene signatures has been performed in the same patient population with long-term follow-up data. We compared the prognostic performance of 6 signatures for distant recurrence in the 10-year period after diagnosis to assess the potential value of adding chemotherapy vs endocrine therapy alone and for late distant recurrence in years 5 to 10 to investigate the potential value of extended adjuvant endocrine therapy. Furthermore, the comparison was performed separately for women with node-negative disease and those with 1 to 3 positive nodes because the most significant prognostic clinical indicator for early-stage breast cancer is the presence or absence of lymph node involvement.</p></sec><sec id="H1-2-COI170101"><title>Methods</title><sec id="H2-1-COI170101"><title>Study Design and Patients</title><p>In this preplanned comparative analysis, tumor blocks from the TransATAC study were used from patients with hormone receptor&#x02013;positive early-stage breast cancer treated with 5 years of tamoxifen or anastrozole in the ATAC randomized clinical trial.<xref rid="coi170101r12" ref-type="bibr"/> Microdissection of the tumors and RNA extraction were performed by Genomic Health, Inc, and residual RNA was provided to collaborators for RNA expression profiling. Data were collected from January 2009, through April 2015. Women were excluded from the analysis if they received chemotherapy, did not have ER-positive disease, received the combination treatment (ie, anastrozole plus tamoxifen), or had 4 or more positive lymph nodes. This study was approved by the South-East London Research Ethics Committee. All patients provided written informed consent for their tissue to be used in translational research.</p></sec><sec id="H2-2-COI170101"><title>Procedures</title><p>The CTS and IHC4 were developed in the TransATAC study and have been described in detail previously.<xref rid="coi170101r6" ref-type="bibr"/> In brief, the CTS contains information on nodal status, grade, tumor size, age, and treatment (tamoxifen vs anastrozole). The IHC4 combines 4 commonly used IHC markers, including ER, progesterone receptor, Ki67, and <italic>ERBB2</italic> (formerly known as <italic>HER2</italic> [RefSeq <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/584277101">NM_001005862</ext-link>.2]). The commercial signatures are based on RNA expression profiling and were performed according to specifications by 4 of us (R.K., S.F., C.S., and F.L.B.) who were blinded to clinical outcome data. The RS<xref rid="coi170101r13" ref-type="bibr"/> is a 21-gene signature that was developed for patients with ER-positive, node-negative breast cancer. The RS risk groups were determined for patients with node-negative cancer as previously described,<xref rid="coi170101r13" ref-type="bibr"/> using predefined cutoffs of less than 18, 18 to 31, and greater than 31 to determine low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. The RS-pathology-clinical (RSPC) score was calculated using the website tool for patients with node-negative breast cancer.<xref rid="coi170101r14" ref-type="bibr"/> The BCI<xref rid="coi170101r15" ref-type="bibr"/> combines the 2-gene <italic>HOXB13</italic>:<italic>IL17BR</italic> ratio with the molecular grade index consisting of 5 proliferation genes in a linear model and was developed in postmenopausal patients with ER-positive, lymph node&#x02013;negative breast cancer.<xref rid="coi170101r8" ref-type="bibr"/> Cutoff points for the BCI were determined in a population with node-negative disease (low risk &#x0003c;5.0825; high risk &#x0003e;6.5025).<xref rid="coi170101r17" ref-type="bibr"/> The ROR<xref rid="coi170101r7" ref-type="bibr"/> incorporates 46 genes and was developed in premenopausal and postmenopausal women treated without any adjuvant systemic therapy and includes information on tumor size. The TransATAC cohort was used to determine the cutoff points of the ROR for risk stratification in patients with node-negative and node-positive disease separately. They correspond approximately to a point estimate of as much as a 10% distant recurrence rate for low risk and more than a 20% rate for high risk after 10 years of follow-up.<xref rid="coi170101r18" ref-type="bibr"/> The EPclin was developed in premenopausal and postmenopausal tamoxifen-treated patients with ER-positive, <italic>ERBB2</italic>-negative breast cancer. It incorporates the expression of 12 genes plus information on tumor size and nodal status.<xref rid="coi170101r19" ref-type="bibr"/> A predefined cutoff point (3.3, based on methods described by Filipits et al<xref rid="coi170101r19" ref-type="bibr"/>) was used for risk stratification, which corresponds to a 10% distant recurrence risk at 10 years.</p></sec><sec id="H2-3-COI170101"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The primary end point was the time to distant recurrence. Distant recurrence was defined as metastatic disease, excluding contralateral disease, and locoregional and ipsilateral recurrences. Death before distant recurrence was treated as a censoring event. We defined the following 2 primary analysis populations: patients with ER-positive, <italic>ERBB2</italic>-negative, node-negative breast cancer, and patients with ER-positive, <italic>ERBB2</italic>-negative breast cancer with 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes. The primary objective was the comparison of prognostic signatures in patients with node-negative and node-positive disease separately for overall (0-10 years) and late (5-10 years) follow-up periods.</p><p>We assessed overall distant recurrence in the first 10 years after diagnosis (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;774) and late distant recurrence within the subset of patients who remained free of distant recurrence for the first 5 years after diagnosis (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;689). Partial likelihood ratio (LR) tests based on Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to test the prognostic information of all signatures. The amount of prognostic information provided by each signature alone was assessed by C indexes. Furthermore, partial LR &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> values with a 2-sided 5% significance level (LR &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.84) are also presented. The improvement in distant recurrence prognostication of each signature compared with clinical and pathologic variables (CTS) was quantified by the increase in the LR &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> value (&#x00394;LR &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>; 2-sided 5% significance level). Predefined cutoffs were used to determine risk stratification for the 4 commercially available signatures. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the mean risk of distant recurrence after 10 years of follow-up in predefined risk groups. To compare the prognostic performance of all signatures, continuous scores were normalized to have unit variance, and the hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95% CIs were estimated from Cox proportional hazards regression models. All statistical analyses were 2-sided, and a <italic>P</italic> value of less than .05 was regarded as significant. All analyses were performed with Stata software (version 13.1; StataCorp).</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-3-COI170101"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 774 postmenopausal women with ER-positive, <italic>ERBB2</italic>-negative disease for whom all signatures were available were included in this analysis (mean [SD] age, 64.1 [8.1] years) (eFigure 1 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-COI170101-1-s">Supplement</xref>).

During years 0 to 10, all signatures provided significant prognostic information for women with node-negative disease in addition to clinical variables. For women with 1 to 3 positive nodes, the independent prognostic strength of the investigated signatures was weaker. Although fewer patients had node-positive than node-negative disease, the number of distant recurrences was similar and thus provided similar power. For late distant recurrence, the BCI, ROR, and EPclin provided independent prognostic information for women with node-negative disease and those with 1 to 3 positive nodes.</p><p>We previously published the results of the individual evaluations of the 4 commercial signatures and showed that all provide significant and similar prognostic information during the first 5 years after diagnosis.<xref rid="coi170101r6" ref-type="bibr"/> In this study, we revealed that the difference in prognostic performance between signatures during 10 years of follow-up may have been largely attributable to their differential ability to estimate distant recurrence from 5 to 10 years. Thus, the BCI,<xref rid="coi170101r8" ref-type="bibr"/> ROR,<xref rid="coi170101r23" ref-type="bibr"/> and EPclin<xref rid="coi170101r9" ref-type="bibr"/> may have molecular components in their signatures that are more specifically prognostic for late recurrence compared with the IHC4 and the RS. Of importance, combined genomic and clinical models showed enhanced prognostic performance particularly for patients with 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes and thus may be the preferred approach for the decision-making process for this patient group. Furthermore, the RSPC score provided significantly more prognostic value for distant recurrence in patients with node-negative disease than did the molecular RS alone.</p><p>In the adjuvant setting, the need for chemotherapy or extended endocrine therapy (for late recurrence) is an important clinical decision. We used predefined cutoffs to determine the 10-year distant recurrence risk for the commercial scores during years 0 to 10 (chemotherapy) and 5 to 10 (extended endocrine therapy). For node-negative disease, most of the women were categorized into the low-risk group by all 4 signatures, and women had a mean risk of less than 7%, for whom chemotherapy might not be indicated. The 2 signatures that contain clinical variables (ROR and EPclin) identified a sizeable group of women with 1 to 3 positive nodes who had a very low risk of distant recurrence at 10 years (mean risk, &#x0003c;6%), suggesting that chemotherapy would be of very limited benefit in these women.</p><p>None of the signatures were specifically developed to estimate late distant recurrences. However, the BCI, ROR, and EPclin demonstrated accurate prognostic value for these late events in our analysis. Wolmark and colleagues<xref rid="coi170101r24" ref-type="bibr"/> reported that the RS was significantly prognostic for late distant recurrence but only in patients with high <italic>ESR1</italic> levels. However, we did not observe an association between high <italic>ESR1</italic> levels and late distant recurrence with the RS in our data set. A few studies<xref rid="coi170101r25" ref-type="bibr"/> have investigated a series of extended endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitors to address the question of the ideal length of extended treatment. The MA17.R trial<xref rid="coi170101r25" ref-type="bibr"/> showed that 10 years of letrozole therapy resulted in significantly higher rates of disease-free survival compared with placebo. In the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP-B42),<xref rid="coi170101r26" ref-type="bibr"/> extended adjuvant aromatase inhibition after sequential endocrine therapy (DATA),<xref rid="coi170101r28" ref-type="bibr"/> and Investigation on the Duration of Extended Adjuvant Letrozole (IDEAL)<xref rid="coi170101r27" ref-type="bibr"/> trials, no significant improvement in disease-free or overall survival with extended endocrine therapy was observed. These data raise the question of whether patients need to be specifically selected for extended endocrine therapy (ie, based on high risk for late distant recurrence or high likelihood of benefit from extended therapy).</p><sec id="H2-6-COI170101"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>Strengths of our study include the mature clinical data with clinical outcome and long-term follow-up, well-characterized tissue samples, and data on 6 prognostic signatures for breast cancer. For all RNA analyses, the same extraction methods for RNA were used. For all commercial signatures, standardized quantitative methods and analyses were used, and all collaborators were blinded to clinical outcomes. Limitations include that our results are only applicable for chemotherapy-free and postmenopausal women. An unintended selection bias might have occurred because sample analyses might have only been possible where sufficient amounts of RNA were available, but all assays yielded reportable results. The IHC4, CTS, and in part the RSPC score were trained in the TransATAC cohort, and thus their performance may have been overestimated in this analysis. The risk group cutoffs of the ROR were defined in the TransATAC cohort for women with node-negative and node-positive disease separately, therefore optimizing the cutoffs to identify a low-risk group with less than 10% risk and a high-risk group with greater than 20% risk. Finally, our current analysis was not able to assess the ability of these signatures to predict the benefit from chemotherapy or extended endocrine therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-COI170101"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The prognostic signatures evaluated provided significant information to help determine appropriate candidates consisting of patients with ER-positive, <italic>ERBB2</italic>-negative breast cancer, for whom chemotherapy and extended endocrine therapy might not be indicated. In patients with node-negative disease, all multigene signatures provided significant and clinically meaningful prognostic information beyond clinical factors. The combination of clinical and molecular information enhanced prognostic performance, particularly for women with node-positive disease. All signatures performed similarly during the first 5 years of follow-up, but we found differences during years 5 to 10, when these tests may be valuable for decision making with regard to extended endocrine treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-COI170101"><title>References</title><ref id="coi170101r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name name-style="western"><surname>Massagu&#x000e9;</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group>
