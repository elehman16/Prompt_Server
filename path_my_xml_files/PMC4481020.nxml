The prevalence of MetS in the adult population is 20% to 30% in most countries.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In Mexico, its prevalence has been reported to be 36.8%, with a higher prevalence in women (42.2%). In women aged 50 to 59 years, most of whom have already gone through menopause, the prevalence of obesity and abdominal obesity is highest.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Because of hormonal and metabolic changes in these women, body weight increases and visceral fat accumulates. Insulin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol concentrations are usually altered in postmenopausal women, with a 60% higher risk of having MetS.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Even for women receiving pharmacologic treatment, lifestyle changes are not only the starting strategy but also the foundation for MetS treatment. Lifestyle management of MetS should focus not on transient modifications but on permanent changes.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Lifestyle changes that focus on diet and physical activity can successfully modify both metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Promotion of healthy dietary behaviors has become the cornerstone of the prevention and treatment of obesity and MetS. A variety of individual foods and nutrients (eg, fats, meat, fruits, vegetables, fish, and dietary fiber) have been reported to be associated with MetS, but evidence is still scarce.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>A Western dietary pattern has been associated with increased risk of MetS. On the other hand, a diet characterized by higher intakes of fruits/vegetables, whole grains, fish, low-fat milk, and dairy have shown favorable effects on metabolic abnormalities.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension dietary patterns have been associated with benefits for some MetS components.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>The effects of changes in specific dietary behaviors on MetS components within a clinical intervention have not been studied in depth. In a recent clinical trial, Perichart-Perera et al<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> compared a structured hypocaloric diet with a behavioral therapy (BT) intervention in Mexican postmenopausal women with MetS. An important and significant decrease in MetS prevalence was observed in each group after 6 months, and significant improvements in weight and waist circumference were found in both groups. Differences in metabolic outcomes were observed between groups. The remaining question is whether achievement of specific target dietary behaviors within a nutrition intervention results in positive metabolic outcomes. This article presents the results of a dietary analysis within a clinical trial to evaluate the association between positive dietary changes and improvement of individual MetS components in postmenopausal women.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Ethics and study participants</title><p>This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Overall, these two nutrition interventions were effective in achieving the recommended intakes of fruits/vegetables, low-fat dairy, added sugars, soda and sweetened beverages, and/or high-energy refined grains. The observed improvements in food intake throughout the intervention seem to have positive effects on metabolic components such as glucose, blood pressure, and HDL cholesterol.</p><p>Our findings on fruits/vegetables intake and lipid profile may seem contradictory. Women in group 2, who ate at least five servings of fruits/vegetables daily, were more likely to have altered LDL cholesterol, although this probability did not reach statistical significance. In Mexico, intake of high-glycemic-index fruits is very frequent, and this factor could influence the effect on LDL cholesterol. Some evidence has shown an inverse association between dietary glycemic index/glycemic load and total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>; this effect has been reported in Hispanic postmenopausal women.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Another factor that may affect this association is the fact that we quantified total fruits/vegetables intake without specifying type or preparation. In Mexico, it is common to eat fruits with yogurt, honey, or syrups; thus, the addition of other foods, such as high-fat dairy and added sugars, may be exerting a negative effect on LDL cholesterol. On the other hand, some studies have reported a lack of effect of increased fruits/vegetables intake on lipid profile in the studied population.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>We also found a higher probability of achieving normal fasting glucose at 6 months with elimination of high-energy refined grains from the diet (not statistically significant); the intake of these types of grains also correlated positively with waist circumference. Refined grains tend to be high in energy and low in nutrient density (fiber, magnesium, vitamin D, folic acid, and potassium) and may be associated with insulin resistance and excess weight.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Fiber may act in a protective manner by slowing absorption and digestion of carbohydrates, leading to a reduced demand for insulin and lowering glucose responses.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In previous studies, high intake of refined grains has been associated with insulin resistance, higher waist circumference, and various components of MetS, leading to higher risk of T2DM and cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>We observed that avoiding consumption of high-fat dairy decreases by 60% the risk of having impaired fasting glucose, after adjusting for energy intake and study group. This finding is in line with the fact that promoting the exchange of high-fat dairy to low-fat dairy may be a promising strategy for preventing and/or controlling T2DM. Overall, there is evidence for the beneficial effect of dairy intake on glucose homeostasis. Observational studies have found that eating higher amounts of dairy products decrease the risk of T2DM by 8% to 14%.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In other clinical trials, a high-dairy diet (&#x02265;3 servings) resulted in improved insulin sensitivity, lower plasma insulin, decrease in total body fat, decrease in waist circumference, decrease in trunk fat, and increase in lean mass.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Dairy products are good sources of vitamins (A, D, K<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>, and riboflavin) and minerals (calcium, magnesium, and potassium), which may play a role in insulin sensitivity and/or resistance. The protective effect of dairy products could also be explained by their whey content, which may stimulate insulin secretion.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Another link could be that, in addition to medium-chain saturated fatty acids, dairy fat contains bioactive lipids, including conjugated linoleic acid, that have the potential to improve insulin resistance.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>-<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>Another finding was the positive correlation between high-fat dairy and blood lipids. Whole-fat dairy products are a major source of saturated fat, which has been associated with higher risk of MetS and cardiovascular disease, mainly by increasing total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in blood. Although some studies have found higher concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol with a high-fat dairy diet versus a low-fat dairy diet,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> the latest evidence has failed to demonstrate this link.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Further research is needed to clarify the role of different bioactive substances in dairy products and their interactions with other macronutrients in the diet.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>The BT intervention (group 2) was designed to promote gradual behavioral change and was conducted according to individual women&#x02019;s baseline food behaviors and their motivation to commit to specific diet and lifestyle goals. BT is an excellent approach that may promote healthy dietary behaviors, similar to a stricter, less individualized diet intervention. Increasing evidence highlights the importance of including behavioral and motivational strategies to improve adherence because the latter remains an issue of concern when treatment involves diet and/or exercise.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Women in the BT group were able to meet similar dietary goals (fruits/vegetables, low-fat dairy, and sugars) as women following the structured hypocaloric diet. Considering these results, the BT intervention seems to be an excellent approach to promoting cardioprotective dietary behaviors.</p><p>The main limitation of this study is the small sample size. The primary outcome of the clinical trial was the effectiveness of two different dietary strategies on the prevalence of MetS, and not the achievement of specific dietary changes that influence MetS components. Therefore, the sample size in each group and the low event rates may partially explain some inconsistent findings from this study and the difficulty of establishing strong associations. The observed associations from bivariate analysis may be confounded, but the study did not have enough power to conduct multivariate analysis. In addition, we could not perform cluster or factor analysis to evaluate dietary patterns. This methodology would have been ideal because we do not eat isolated nutrients but a variety of foods that are consumed in many complex combinations and may synergically interact to reduce MetS risk. We analyzed foods as separate entities and how they can affect some biochemical makers, and this relationship may be confounded by other factors.</p><p>On the other hand, our dietary data were obtained by two 24-hour recalls. Although a well-trained dietitian uses food replicas, kitchen utensils, and other methods to help reduce bias in serving estimation, this method relies mainly on the participant&#x02019;s memory. The multiple-pass methodology has been shown to improve the accuracy of recalls.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Finally, underreporting may be an issue. When nutrition education is given within a period, it is probable that the individual may be reporting what she learned rather than what she ate.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Another limitation is the lack of long-term data. It would have been interesting to evaluate whether the dietary goals achieved could be maintained for a longer period and whether the BT intervention would promote better sustainment of the observed behaviors.</p><p>The different associations between dietary and metabolic changes observed in both study groups should be taken into consideration when designing nutrition interventions. Nutrition care at clinic level should be flexible, with individualized dietary recommendations based on metabolic risk factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>A structured hypocaloric diet and a BT intervention promote achievement of cardioprotective dietary goals for fruits/vegetables, sugars, soda and sweetened beverages, low-fat dairy, and high-energy refined grains, which result in improvement of some MetS components.</p><p>Elimination of high-fat dairy from the diet decreases the risk of impaired fasting glucose, independent of total energy intake and the nutrition intervention.</p><p>Dietary strategies should be flexible and individualized based on metabolic risk factors. Empowerment to achieve self-confidence and to develop motivation is essential for promoting healthy food choices and behavioral change.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Dr. Karime Haua, Dr. Felipe Vadillo, LN Ana Licea, LN Lorena Pantoja, LN Marien Garza, Qu&#x000ed;mica Ma.
