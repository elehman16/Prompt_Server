Home visiting programmes have been advocated as a strategy for improving outcomes for disadvantaged mothers and children, such as the Nurse-Family Partnership for young, socially disadvantaged first-time mothers. However, no evidence-based programme is available for multiparous women or older first-time mothers. The New Baby Programme was developed in Northern Ireland. It augments the universal health visiting service available in the UK with a content designed to promote maternal health and well-being in pregnancy, maximise secure attachments of children and parents and enhance sensitive parenting and infant cognitive development.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">This pilot study is designed to investigate whether it is possible to recruit and retain socially vulnerable mothers in a randomised trial that compares the effects of the New Baby Programme with standard antenatal and postnatal care. Feasibility issues include the referral/recruitment pathway (including inclusion and exclusion criteria), the consent and randomisation, the ability to maintain researcher blinding, the acceptability of the intervention to participants, and the feasibility and acceptability of the outcome measures. The results of the study will inform a definitive phase-3 RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Trials of complex social interventions often encounter challenges that lead to the trial being abandoned (e.g. because of problems in recruitment) or present considerable analytic challenges relating to dropout, attrition and bias.

Of the women who died, those with socially complex lives were less likely to contact maternity services early or to stay in regular contact. Compared with women who booked before 20&#x000a0;weeks into their pregnancy, those who booked late or missed more than four regular appointments were more likely to be black African or Caribbean, experiencing domestic abuse, misusing substances, known to child protection services, or unemployed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par6"><italic>Perinatal Mortality</italic> (2009) highlighted the disparity in rates of stillbirth and neonatal death between white women and those from ethnic minority groups in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

Some of these are associated with poor maternal health during pregnancy and/or behaviours that can adversely impact on the developing child. Key concerns include smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], substance misuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], intimate partner violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], mental ill health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], socio-economic deprivation and a history of maltreatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Despite a small reduction in inequality of pregnancy outcomes between the most deprived and better off women in the UK population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the problem remains a significant one, with serious implications for the many children living with parents coping with social complexities.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Home visiting programmes</title><p id="Par9">Home visiting programmes have been advocated as a strategy for improving the health of disadvantaged children, and in 2006, the prime minister, Tony Blair, identified home visiting programmes as an &#x02018;early intervention&#x02019; that could help combat social exclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Unlike universal health visiting, home visiting programmes often start antenatally and may continue for 2&#x000a0;years postpartum. Typically, they involve structured visits by those experienced in child health and development. Some programmes use professionals as home visitors (on the grounds that parents value &#x02018;expert&#x02019; and &#x02018;confidential&#x02019; advice and support), whilst others use trained and supervised lay visitors (on the grounds that those who have &#x02018;been there&#x02019; are better able to engage those who are experiencing difficulty). Home visiting programmes may target maternal smoking, poor attachment, poor nutrition, the under-stimulation of children, lack of social support and a range of factors known to increase risk for maltreatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. They may seek to improve the economic status of families by helping mothers complete their education, secure employment and plan for any future pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Home visiting programmes are often designed specifically to engage women who are traditionally found &#x02018;difficult to engage&#x02019; by routine services. Intervention takes place within the home because this is where most parenting takes place. As well as providing natural opportunities to model, practice, and reinforce good parenting, home visiting maximises the chances of parental engagement. Reduced caseloads enable staff to visit more frequently to be available between scheduled visits and to provide a wider range of support services, such as help with practical tasks (e.g. arranging and keeping appointments with other agencies, negotiating with welfare agencies, general advocacy). Staff usually receive additional training in order to deliver these programmes. This may include enhancing their understanding of the wider context of parenting (e.g. how childhood maltreatment or mental health problems can influence parenting) and developing skills associated with enhancing parental engagement (e.g. motivational interviewing).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP)</title><p id="Par11">NFP is based on a number of psychological theories, such as theories of cognitive development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], attachment theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and social learning theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], organised within an ecological framework. NFP operates on the understanding that successful programmes must be able to make significant impacts on &#x02018;the enduring environment in which the family is functioning&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] (p.12). The programme assumes that new parents are committed to the well-being of their child and that most will act in ways they deem to be appropriate during pregnancy and subsequent years. Failures of parenting are therefore assumed to reflect a lack of knowledge about what their children need or to arise from other factors such as mental illness or life stressors. NFP is targeted solely at first-time mothers on the basis that it is at this point that mothers are maximally motivated to engage in behaviour change to promote the well-being of their child.</p><p id="Par12">NFP has been evaluated in three randomised trials, in three locations in the USA. Each sample was different, but all were socially disadvantaged. Outcomes and measures differ across the three trials, and the programme developers were responsible for these three evaluations (and have been involved in the small number of more independent evaluations). Generally, the three trials were well designed and implemented and indicate positive impacts in a range of maternal and child outcomes. However, recent trials have found no evidence of impact in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. NFP has been commissioned for use within the UK, where it is known as the Family-Nurse Partnership (FNP). As a licenced programme, the cost is considerable, and there is currently no comparable provision for the significant numbers of older and/or multiparous mothers presenting with complex social factors. The New Baby Programme (NBP) aims to bridge this gap.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The New Baby Programme</title><p id="Par13">The NBP was developed within the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust in Northern Ireland. It aims to promote maternal health and well-being in pregnancy, maximise secure attachments and enhance sensitive parenting and infant cognitive development. In setting these aims, the programme drew on evidence concerning the importance of maternal health and well-being in pregnancy for optimal in utero development (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]) and the importance of secure attachments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and ensuring healthy social and emotional development in the early years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Exposure to the same stressor does not necessarily lead to the same outcome for all who experience it (multifinality). Similarly, there are many paths to the same type of outcome (equifinality). Consequently, interventions such as home visiting are necessarily broad-brush in some respects. Promoting optimal prenatal health will require a different strategy for a mother who does not smoke or drink than one who does; it will look different for a mother who is homeless than one who is not, and so on. The logic model underpinning the NBP reflects this complexity (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The programme seeks to combine a core curriculum of evidence-based advice, information and interventions with the opportunities and flexibility afforded to health visitors with small caseloads, additional training and specialist supervision.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Logic model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40814_2018_235_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par15">A service evaluation of the NBP, conducted in 2013, identified the programme as a promising intervention, well received by staff and parents, but needing further work to describe and manualise the intervention and to more tightly specify the training and supervisory needs of those delivering it. This work has been undertaken. The Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland wishes ultimately to secure an independent evaluation of the programme using a randomised controlled trial (RCT). The primary objective of an RCT would be to determine whether the NBP, compared with routine antenatal and postnatal care, can improve infant attachment and maternal sensitivity among pregnant women with complex social factors and the quality of maternal-child relationships. The secondary objectives would be to determine whether the NBP can improve maternal mental health and outcomes for children, at birth and during the first year of life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Aims of the study</title><p id="Par16">This pilot study is designed to test the feasibility of an RCT to investigate the effectiveness of the New Baby Programme for pregnant women of any age presenting with socially complex circumstances.

They will briefly inform all eligible women about the study and invite them to take part. They will also provide eligible mothers with accessible, written information and inform them that a specialist nurse may telephone them to provide more details of the study. A senior nurse (a trust manager) from the Ulster Hospital will then telephone mothers to confirm eligibility and establish if the pregnancy is still viable. Women who are not eligible will be thanked for their time. The specialist nurse will ask eligible mothers if they would be interested in taking part and, if so, whether they are willing to be contacted by a named researcher (details of all members of the research team will be included on the information sheet).

The primary outcome targeted by the New Baby Programme is the parent (primarily the mother)-child relationship, assessed by measuring both maternal sensitivity and child attachment. In the event that the father is the primary carer, we will focus on his relationship with the child. We have chosen to use two measures as together they provide a better assessment of what is a complex, relational outcome. Attachment has been selected because of (i) the links between insecure and disorganised attachment and other parenting dimensions, such as maternal depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], substance misuse, neglect and maltreatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], and (ii) the centrality of attachment to healthy infant development, as indicated by the association between disorganised attachment and subsequent pathology, such as behaviour problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and poor self-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].

The NBP seeks to address similar issues and achieve comparable outcomes, albeit targeted at a different (primarily older) group of pregnant women, making direct comparisons of particular interest. The scheduling of data collection is designed to minimise the burden on participants, and is based on a tried and tested schedule used in a recent study of group Nurse-Family Partnership in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p id="Par43"><italic>Child attachment</italic> will be measured using the Ainsworth Strange Situation Procedure (SSP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].

This observational measure uses a 3-min video recording of mother-child play and measures three aspects of maternal behaviour (sensitivity, covert and overt hostility, and responsiveness) and four aspects of infant behaviour (cooperativeness, compulsivity, difficultness, and passivity). These are highly correlated with attachment and also differentiate between abusing, neglecting, abusing and neglecting, marginally more treating and adequate dyads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. This means that they will allow us to assess the impact of the NBP on the participant&#x02019;s parenting profile.</p><p id="Par45"><italic>Maternal depression</italic> will be assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) when the infant is 2, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. This is a well-validated 12-item measure of postnatal depression with high reliability (0.88) and internal consistency (0.87), 86% sensitivity and 78% specificity. The questionnaire will be scored within 24&#x000a0;h of its administration, and any woman scoring above the recommended cut-off (indicating a risk of depression), or who responds affirmatively to the question asking about self-harm, will be brought to the attention of a healthcare professional so that appropriate support can be provided.</p><p id="Par46"><italic>Antenatal stress</italic> will be measured at baseline using The Revised Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (NUPDQ). This is a 17-item measure of pregnancy-specific distress including physical discomforts, financial resources to care for children and pain during delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p id="Par47"><italic>Postnatal anxiety</italic> will be measured using the Strait Trait Anxiety Inventory Short Form-6 (STAI-6) at baseline and when the infant is 2, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The 6-item short-form of the STAI (STAI-6) has an acceptable reliability (0.82) and produces scores that are similar to those produced with the full-form 20-item STAI across participating&#x000a0;groups manifesting normal and raised levels of anxiety. The STAI shows strong criterion, discriminant and predictive validity in perinatal populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p id="Par48"><italic>Parental stress</italic> will be assessed using the Aberdeen Parenting Stress Index, Short Form (ASI-4-SF) at baseline and when the infant is 2 and 12&#x000a0;months old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. This is a well-validated 36-item measure of perceived stress in the parenting role. The 36 items are divided into three domains: parental distress, parent-child dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child, which combine to form a Total Stress Score. The ASI-4-SF has a robust test-retest reliability (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.84) and internal consistency (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.91).

The PSOC assesses parental competence on two dimensions: Satisfaction and Efficacy, established by factor analysis in a normative nonclinical sample, each with acceptable internal consistency (from 0.62 to 0.72). This is a 16-item Likert-style questionnaire (with a 6-point scale ranging from &#x02018;strongly agree&#x02019; to &#x02018;strongly disagree&#x02019;).</p><p id="Par51"><italic>Maternal health-related quality of life</italic> will be assessed using the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L. This is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQol group that provides a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The EQ-5D-5L consists of two pages. The first presents five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) and asks respondents to indicate their health status by ticking one of the following: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The second presents a visual analogue scale that goes from 0 (worst health you can imagine) to 100 (best health you can imagine) and asks respondents to indicate with an &#x02018;X&#x02019; where on the scale they see themselves. Responses can then be converted to a multi-attribute utility score by applying a UK tariff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p><p id="Par52"><italic>Social support</italic> will be assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Social Support Survey, a 20-item scale measuring four dimensions of support, established using a confirmatory factor analysis: emotional support, tangible support, positive interaction, and affection. Each has an internal consistency of 0.91 or above, and the measure provides a total support score (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha 0.97). Stability over time is high for each scale (ranging from 0.72 to 0.78) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].

The Mullen Scales comprise of five scales (Gross Motor, Visual Reception, Fine Motor, Expressive Language and Receptive Language) which are used for targeting strengths and weaknesses in children. The Mullen test is generally used for evaluating intellectual development and school readiness. Instrument assessments have supported various reliabilities. The median split-half internal consistency was above 0.80 for 3 of the subscales, but 0.79 and 0.75 for Visual Reception and Fine Motor. Test-retest intervals of 1 to 2&#x000a0;weeks and 1 to 24&#x000a0;months scored coefficients of 0.80 and 0.70, respectively.</p><p id="Par54">Overall,&#x000a0;response cards will be used for questions that provide a number of response options.

These semi-structured interviews will explore their experiences of either the NBP or usual services, using a topic guide. Key issues will be the acceptability of the programme, its perceived helpfulness and their experiences of the trial process, including recruitment and follow-up. Women will also be asked about their experiences of randomisation and of data collection. Questions regarding data collection will encompass the frequency of data collection, the time required and the measures themselves. Particular attention will be given to the Strange Situation Procedure, which will be conducted at a specialist facility outside the home.</p><p id="Par58">Women who decline to participate in the trial will also be asked if they are willing to take part in this qualitative study.

Women have been asked not to disclose their allocation status to those collecting data, and the latter remind women of this prior to each visit. Outcome assessors are also asked to record any indication given of the allocation status of participants during each contact with participants. These will be reported and taken into account as an indication of potential bias.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p id="Par61">Economic data, including resource use and unit costs, will be collected in parallel with the trial.

Data collected will include demographic data (e.g. age, ethnicity, marital status) and social complexities present. We will record details of women who decline to participate and use these data and those data available on NIMATS/CHS of those approached and those recruited, using age, parity and reasons for social complexity (where recorded, e.g. domestic violence, substance misuse, mental health problems).</p><p id="Par68">The uptake rate of women agreeing to the intervention will be based on an assessment of the ratio of women randomised to the intervention group who then meet with the NBP health visitor on at least one occasion, relative to those who agree to take part in the trial and are randomised to NBP but do not attend the first (or any subsequent) meeting. The attrition rate will be calculated on the basis of the percentage of women who drop out relative to those who continue in either randomised group, together with those who subsequently decline to meet with their health visitor, irrespective of whether or not they continue to meet with the study researchers. Analyses of retention and compliance rate will inform estimates of likelihood of adverse events (e.g. withdrawal from the study), which will be important in designing the phase 3 RCT.</p><p id="Par69">Whilst the sample size in this pilot study is not sufficient to inform the power calculations that will be required for a phase 3 study, we will use the available data to estimate variability of the outcomes, as this will help inform those calculations (see NIHR guidance on feasibility studies).

No significance tests will be conducted to explore baseline differences. For continuous variables, we will report the mean, standard deviation, median, range and number of observations. Categorical variables will be reported in numbers and percentages.</p><p id="Par73">The unit of analysis will be the individual participant. All primary analyses will be conducted according to intention-to-treat principles, irrespective of participants&#x02019; exposure to the programme, e.g. irrespective of how many home visits were achieved. The research team will endeavour to secure outcome measures for all participants, including those that move out of the area, or who subsequently decline to accept the programme. Examination of missing data (both case and item) will be undertaken on outcome measures and covariates, and particular attention will be paid to differential attrition and the possible reasons for this.</p><p id="Par74">In the event of marked differential attrition or large amounts of missing data, we will consider methods such as inverse probability weighting to account for this. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted for all primary outcomes. Minimally, these will explore the potential impact of outliers and of missing data and the impact on the results of excluding participants who do not receive the programme, for whatever reason (because intention-to-treat analyses may underestimate the potential efficacy of an intervention).</p><p id="Par75">We will use multiple regression modelling, with appropriate generalised linear models (GLMs) to explore the impact of the intervention, adjusting for the outcome measures at baseline. A statistical analysis plan will be developed in advance of the completion of data collection. This will include a small number of secondary analyses that either test emerging hypotheses (for example, concerning the programme&#x02019;s impact on particular subgroups of mothers) or explore the effect of dose or compliance. We will conduct these analyses as an aid to estimating interval estimates (e.g. 95% confidence intervals) and variability in outcomes, in particular, to estimate between- and within-group variability: this information will be useful in planning the phase 3 RCT.</p><p id="Par76">We do not anticipate undertaking any subgroup analyses in this pilot trial. We will, however, use the pilot trial to assess the feasibility of recruiting different subgroups that might be particularly important for the analyses of the main trial. In the main trial, we would anticipate using subgroup analyses to explore the moderating effects of factors such as nature of social complexity (e.g. presence or absence of substance misuse; presence or absence of history of maltreatment) or family status (e.g. primaparous, multiparous; maternal age).</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Analyses of economic data</title><p id="Par77">The economic evaluation will explore the incremental cost-effectiveness of the NBP compared to Management as Usual (MAU) at the 12-month follow-up. Firstly, a total cost per case per parent-infant dyad will be calculated to allow for a mean cost per case per trial arm for the intervention and control group, with rates of significance of difference between arms. Secondly, cost-effectiveness will be measured in terms of health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) to determine incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year. Non-parametric bootstrapping will be used to generate a distribution of mean costs and effects for the two trial arms and develop confidence intervals around the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. This process will also generate acceptability curves to illustrate the uncertainty associated with the estimate of costs and effects combined and estimates of affordability given potentially different decision-maker cost thresholds. The probability that the NBP could be more cost-effective compared with MAU for a range of maximum monetary values will then be explored.</p><p id="Par78">In the main trial, longer-term implications of NBP will be explored with data from the main trial extrapolated and supplemented with data from the literature using decision analytic modelling techniques.

To date, the focus in the UK has been primarily on young, socio-economically disadvantaged women who are expecting their first child. The Nurse-Family Partnership programme developed by David Olds and his colleagues in the USA enjoys the strongest evidence base to date and has been trialled in the UK (as the Family Nurse Partnership, FNP) in both its original mode of delivery (one home visitor to one mother, with visits taking place in the mother&#x02019;s home) and in a group-based version in which mothers meet in groups of around eight, led antenatally by a midwife and health visitor, and postnatally by a health visitor. Both models are being evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. The NFP was developed in a context without universal services available to pregnant women and mothers, free at the point of delivery and, with some exceptions in its group format, has not been available to multiparous or older pregnant women. In contrast, the New Baby Programme is designed to augment the UK&#x02019;s universal service and to meet the needs of a significant group of women who are ineligible for FNP. Before seeking funding for a full trial, it is important to ensure that the research processes and procedures are feasible and acceptable and indicate whether or not a full trial is justified. This pilot trial is designed to address both issues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Determining the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial</title><p id="Par80">Experimental evaluations of complex social interventions with hard to reach groups are challenging on a number of fronts. This pilot study will help us to identify optimum recruitment procedures, the likely time it will take to recruit a sufficiently powered sample size (in conjunction with other studies using the primary outcome measures), what the barriers and facilitators of study participation might be (e.g. does a &#x000a3;20 voucher assist with retention) and whether the intervention is acceptable to participants and relevant professional staff.</p><p id="Par81">In the main trial for which this study is a pilot, the optimum measures for the primary outcome include two measures of a child-parent interaction: the Infant CARE-Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] and the Strange Situation Procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Whilst the first can be undertaken in the family home and comprises only a 3-min video recording of mother-child play, the Strange Situation Procedure is an eight-step laboratory-based procedure which will require parents to attend somewhere equipped to conduct it. The sequence of steps, each of which lasts 3&#x000a0;min, is as follows: (a) parent and child are introduced to the room, and the procedure is briefly explained to the parent; (b) the parent and child are left alone; (c) a stranger joins the parent and child; (d) <italic>first separation</italic> (parent leaves the room); (e) parent comes back and the stranger leaves&#x02014;<italic>first reunion</italic>; (f) <italic>second separation</italic> (parent leaves the room); (g) stranger comes in; and (h) parent comes back into the room&#x02014;<italic>second reunion</italic>.
