Substantial evidence has shown that family caregivers suffer from significant health problems arising from the demands of caregiving. Although there are programs supporting caregivers, there is little evidence regarding their effectiveness. Acupressure is an ancient Chinese healing method designed to restore the flow of Qi (vital energy) by applying external pressure to acupoints. A randomized, wait-list controlled trial was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-administered acupressure intervention on caregiver stress (primary objective) and stress-related symptoms of fatigue, insomnia, depression, and health-related quality of life (secondary objectives) in Chinese caregivers of older family members.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Two hundred Chinese participants, aged&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;21&#x000a0;years, who are the primary caregivers of an older family member and screen positive for caregiver stress and symptoms of fatigue/insomnia/depression will be recruited from a community setting in Hong Kong. Subjects will be randomized to receive either an immediate treatment condition (self-administered acupressure intervention) or a wait-list control condition. The self-administered acupressure intervention will include (i) an individual learning and practice session twice a week for 2&#x000a0;weeks, (ii) a home follow-up visit once a week for 2&#x000a0;weeks, and (iii) 15-min self-practice twice a day for 6&#x000a0;weeks. The wait-list control group will receive the same acupressure training after the intervention group has completed the intervention. We hypothesize that Chinese family caregivers in the intervention group will have lower levels of caregiver stress, fatigue, insomnia, depression, and higher health-related quality of life after completion of the intervention than participants in the wait-list control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will provide evidence for the effectiveness of self-administered acupressure in reducing stress and improving symptoms of fatigue, insomnia, depression, and health-related quality of life in Chinese family caregivers. The findings will inform the design of interventions to relieve negative health effects of caregiving. Furthermore, the results can raise community awareness and serve as a basis for policymaking, planning, and allocation of resources regarding empowerment of family caregivers for self-care.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02526446?term=NCT02526446&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02526446</ext-link>.

With increasing population age, non-communicable diseases increase in prevalence, including chronic disease and disability. This leads to an increased demand for care, and the primary caregiver role often falls on family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In this study, the primary caregiver of an older family member is defined as one who provides unpaid care to the care recipient for no less than 14&#x000a0;h per week, and the care recipients are older family members (aged&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;65&#x000a0;years) irrespective of their health problems/disabilities.</p><p>While caring for an older family member can be rewarding for some, evidence shows that family caregivers are at risk of emotional, mental, and physical health problems arising from the complexity and strains of caregiving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Caregiver stress, defined as &#x0201c;the burden or strain that caregivers face when caring for a person with a chronic disease,&#x0201d; is prevalent and associated with stress-related symptoms, notably fatigue, insomnia, and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Fatigue is often the initial and most difficult problem resulting from the stressful caregiving process, and leads to sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It is estimated that more than one-third of family caregivers suffer from poor health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Not only does caregiver stress put family caregivers at risk for poor health outcomes, it may also affect their quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and hinder their ability to provide care, with negative consequences for their care recipients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The adverse impact of caregiver stress on the health and safety of both caregivers and care recipients can lead to increased social and healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite the recognition that stress-related health symptoms among family caregivers is a public health priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], there is little evidence about the effectiveness of symptom management for these caregivers.</p><p>We aim to study Chinese family caregivers because China comprises 19&#x000a0;% of the world&#x02019;s population and is expected to have an older population of 25&#x000a0;% by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, with 90&#x000a0;% of older Chinese living at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], much of the caregiving responsibilities are likely to fall on their family members. Although the Confucian value of filial piety may buffer the demands of caregiving, Chinese family caregivers are not exempt from caregiver stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, these caregivers, similar to their Western counterparts, are in need of effective, achievable, and acceptable interventions to help them manage caregiver stress.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Acupressure and symptom management</title><p>Acupressure, defined as the application of pressure on acupoints using the hands, fingers, or thumbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], is a non-invasive technique based on the meridian theory of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). TCM theory holds that meridians, which are channels in a network of energy pathways throughout the body, regulate the flow of Qi (vital energy) and the unbalanced flow of Qi results in disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. By applying pressure to acupoints (trigger or active points) on the surface of the skin, acupressure stimulates the meridians, resulting in the opening of the channels and balancing of energy, thus restoring health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Because acupressure uses the application of pressure to acupoints without penetrating the skin, it is non-invasive and painless [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The use of acupressure for positive symptom management in healthy people and patients by trained practitioners has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the administration of acupressure by trained practitioners, self-administered acupressure has also been used for symptom management. Self-administered acupressure is acupressure performed by the recipients themselves after undergoing appropriate training. This technique has a number of advantages including flexibility, low cost, and empowerment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Studies have reported on the clinical application of self-administered acupressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, systematic reviews of the effect of self-administered acupressure for symptom management have been conducted. These reviews included perceived stress, insomnia, and sleep disturbances, and the studies found positive effects and safety. However, attention was also drawn to the need for well-designed randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Self-administered acupressure is likely to suit the family caregivers because their caregiver responsibilities often leave them with little time and flexibility to seek their own treatment. Once they have mastered the technique of self-administered acupressure, they can choose when and where to conduct the intervention to suit their caregiver activities and their own needs.</p><p>In the present study protocol, we detail a self-administered acupressure intervention protocol for Chinese family caregivers with caregiver stress based on our previous study on: (i) a similar model of self-administered acupressure previously tested in women with osteoarthritic knee pain that was shown to be feasible and safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; (ii) factors aggravating or buffering caregiver stress among Chinese family caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; (iii) a case management approach to improve the health outcomes of Chinese family caregivers of dementia patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; and (iv) the scientific basis of symptom management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In light of the needs of these caregivers and the little evidence on the effectiveness of self-administered acupressure in symptom management, a specifically designed self-administered acupressure intervention for Chinese family caregivers will be implemented and evaluated in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>The primary aim of this randomized, wait-list controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-administered acupressure intervention on caregiver stress among Chinese caregivers of older family members. The secondary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the self-administered acupressure intervention on the Chinese family caregivers&#x02019; stress-related symptoms of fatigue, insomnia, and depression and their health-related quality of life.</p><p>We hypothesize that, on completion of a self-administered acupressure intervention, and as compared with the wait-list control group, Chinese family caregivers in the intervention group will have:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(i)</label><p>lower levels of caregiver stress, as measured by the Caregiver Burden Inventory;</p></list-item><list-item><label>(ii)</label><p>lower scores of fatigue symptoms, as measured by the Piper Fatigue Scale;</p></list-item><list-item><label>(iii)</label><p>lower scores of insomnia symptoms, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;</p></list-item><list-item><label>(iv)</label><p>lower scores of depression symptoms, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire; and</p></list-item><list-item><label>(v)</label><p>higher scores of health-related quality of life, as measured by the SF-12 Health Survey.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a randomized, wait-list controlled trial. There will be two groups: an intervention group and a wait-list control group. The participants randomly assigned to the intervention group will receive an immediate treatment condition (the self-administered acupressure intervention), while those assigned to the wait-list control group will receive a wait-list control condition (the same self-administered acupressure intervention but after the intervention group has completed the treatment condition). The design allows all participants to receive the intervention eventually but at the same time also controls the confounding variables that could cause spurious causality.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 200 participants will be recruited for the study.

Justifications: an ability to command the Chinese language (Cantonese or Putonghua) is essential because the acupressure protocol is written and conducted in Chinese. Furthermore, the intervention requires participants to have the self-discipline for compliance, hence the decision to select more mature participants of age&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;21&#x000a0;years.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Primary caregiver of an older family member aged&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;65&#x000a0;years. Justifications: the literature has shown that caring for an older family member is a key source of caregiver stress, hence our decision to adopt a more inclusive approach to target older family members who are the care recipients, irrespective of their health problems/disabilities. We recognize that the older care recipients likely have different health problems/disabilities, which may affect their dependency on the caregivers and the level of caregiver stress. Therefore, we will take into account the care recipients&#x02019; health problems/disabilities in the data analysis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Providing unpaid care to the care recipient at no less than 14&#x000a0;h per week.

The introduction will be followed by a demonstration of self-administered acupressure by the trainers (15&#x000a0;min). Self-administered acupressure will then be practiced, until proficient, by the participant under the guidance of the trainers (30&#x000a0;min). The trainers, made up of a senior year TCM student and a senior year nursing student, will be trained and certified by a licensed TCM practitioner from the researchers&#x02019; School of Chinese Medicine.</p><p>For monitoring of compliance, during the 5<sup>th</sup> through 8<sup>th</sup> weeks of the intervention, once a week, phone calls will be made by the same team of trainers to remind the participant to perform the self-administered acupressure with feedback for any questions or expressed concerns. Any medical incidents (e.g., visits to hospital or doctor for caregiver health problems) will be documented. Each participant will use an &#x0201c;acupressure&#x0201d; diary to record the frequency, duration, and time of the acupressure conducted each day, and the record will be checked by the trainer during the telephone calls.</p><p>Training materials will be provided to each participant. The self-administered acupressure protocol (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), a poster illustrating the acupoints, and stickers used to label each acupoint will be provided to the participant at the first training session. Acupoint selection will be demonstrated step-by-step by the trainers, and the participants will be asked to find the selected acupoints by themselves under the guidance of the trainers. Once they have mastered the location of the selected acupoints, the participants will be guided, with assistance from the trainers as required, to perform the self-administered acupressure as described in the protocol. An audio-recorded step-by step procedure of the self-administered acupressure will be provided to the participants for reinforcement of learning. The audio recording, protocol, posters, and stickers are designed to enhance accuracy and compliance during home practice.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Standard protocol- self-administered acupressure for symptom management</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Sequence/acupoint</th><th colspan="2">Location</th><th>Function</th><th>How-to-do</th><th>Frequency (Times/duration)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.Baihui (GV20, &#x0767e;&#x06703;)</td><td>On the vertex of the head at the sigittal midline of the scalp at the midpoint of the line connecting the apexes of both ears</td><td>

This will be the first randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of self-administered acupressure in reducing the stress of caregivers and improving their stress-related symptoms of fatigue, insomnia, depression, and health-related quality of life.</p><p>The emotional and physical strain of caregiving and its adverse impact on family caregivers&#x02019; health and well-being is recognized as a serious public health problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Although a variety of pharmacological and psychosocial interventions have been developed to alleviate caregiver stress, the therapeutic benefits are modest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Therefore, there is a need to find interventions that are not only effective but also acceptable to caregivers. Providing interventions to these caregivers is challenging; not only may their motivation be hampered by the stress of never-ending caregiving responsibilities, but their needs often have to take second place after those of their care recipients. If proven effective, the self-administered acupressure intervention would open up an attainable avenue for family caregivers to release their caregiving stress in a safe, feasible, and affordable manner. By reducing the burden of caregiver stress, it is intended that the self-administered acupressure intervention will not only alleviate health declines, but also lower health and social care costs for these caregivers and their care recipients. Furthermore, the realization of what they can achieve in promoting health and well-being through self-administered intervention may also empower the caregivers to make optimal lifestyle choices.</p><p>This study has the potential of informing health and social care providers about the design and implementation of interventions to buffer the adverse effects of caregiver stress. In addition, the trial findings will also provide the much-needed evidence to apprise policy-makers of the need for socioeconomic policies to more effectively empower family caregivers to take care of themselves and their care recipients.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>C-CBI</term><def><p>Chinese version of the Caregiver Burden Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>C-PFS</term><def><p>Chinese version of the Piper Fatigue Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>C-PHQ</term><def><p>Chinese version of the Patient Health Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>C-PSQI</term><def><p>Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>C-SF-12v2</term><def><p>Chinese version of the SF-12 version 2 Health Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DQ</term><def><p>Demographic questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HEA</term><def><p>Health economics assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NGO</term><def><p>Nongovernment organization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SP</term><def><p>Study programmer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPSS</term><def><p>Statistical Package for the Social Sciences</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TCM</term><def><p>Traditional Chinese medicine</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the staff of HKSKH Lady MacLehose Centre for their advice on the implementation of the intervention.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This study is funded by the Health and Medical Research Fund, Food and Health Bureau of the Hong Kong SAR Government (Project Number 13143191).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>Conceptualization and design of the study: AT, LL, AXMW, MKPS, DSFY, TYSL, HYKYF, ZJZ, and JWFY.
