Unfortunately, based on evidence, it has been demonstrated that the majority of children with CHD are at an increased risk of &#x0201c;non-cardiac&#x0201d; problems. Effective exercise therapy could improve their functional status significantly. As studies identifying the efficacy of exercise therapy are rare in this field, the aims of this study are to (1) identify the efficacy of a home-based exercise program to improve the motor function of children with CHD with cardiac catheterization, (2) reduce parental anxiety and parenting burden, and (3) improve the quality of life for parents whose children are diagnosed with CHD with cardiac catheterization through the program.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A total of 300 children who will perform a cardiac catheterization will be randomly assigned to two groups: a home-based intervention group and a control group. The home-based intervention group will carry out a home-based exercise program, and the control group will receive only home-based exercise education. Assessments will be undertaken before catheterization and at 1, 3, and 6&#x000a0;months after catheterization. Motor ability quotients will be assessed as the primary outcomes. The modified Ross score, cardiac function, speed of sound at the tibia, functional independence of the children, anxiety, quality of life, and caregiver burden of their parents or the main caregivers will be the secondary outcome measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The proposed prospective randomized controlled trial will evaluate the efficiency of a home-based exercise program for children with CHD with cardiac catheterization. We anticipate that the home-based exercise program may represent a valuable and efficient intervention for children with CHD and their families.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>

Over the last three decades, dramatic changes have occurred in pediatric cardiac catheterization, and cardiac catheterization is now the main procedure for pediatric cardiac disease. In comparison with traditional cardiac surgical procedures (open heart surgery), therapeutic cardiac catheterization has several advantages, including being simpler and safer, and it is associated with an improved outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Hence, pediatric therapeutic cardiac catheterization has increased recently because of numerous innovative catheter techniques, the increased number of persons and centers using these techniques, and the increased number of lesion types thought to be amenable to catheter therapy. It has been considered as the regular procedure clinically in dealing with patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, and atrial septal defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Progress in medical diagnosis and new surgical techniques imply that the majority of children with complex CHD (80%) now enter adulthood successfully [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. With increased survival rates, emerging evidence has highlighted that &#x0201c;non-cardiac&#x0201d; problems have increased rapidly in survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated that abnormal hemodynamics during fetal gestation and hypoxia in utero might play an important role in the risk of long-term adverse neurological outcomes in children with critical CHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A distinctive pattern of neurodevelopmental and behavioral impairments has been noticed over the years; these are characterized by delayed motor development, cognitive impairments, and other abnormal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Many school-aged survivors adapt poorly to their school life because of low physical activity levels and poor academic performance, and these problems may persist into young adulthood, leading to a low quality of life for these children and their families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Motor delays are common in children with CHD because of various reasons. Studies demonstrate that cardiac problems are not the only reason responsible for development delays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; overprotection of parents or main caregivers is also a factor. Parents are the most concerned caregivers for their children, and overprotection of children with CHD has been observed with most parents and teachers. These attitudes and the anxiety of overprotective parents might restrict the physical activity of their children and reduce their children&#x02019;s exposure to their peers, and this, in turn, might influence the social competence and motor development of these children. As a result, children may develop a sedentary lifestyle, and this may lead to increased risks of additional cardiovascular diseases and complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Without intervention, these development deficits may persist into adolescence and adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Mothers of children with CHD are more concerned and anxious about their children&#x02019;s behaviors than parents of children without such health issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. They often exaggerate the risk of adverse events or medical prognoses of CHD, and they may underestimate the adaptability of their children. The consequence of such overprotection may be reduced physical, emotional, psychosocial, or cognitive functioning in their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>A few studies have developed interventions to improve growth development in children with CHD, but there is still limited evidence in the literature to support the potential benefits of rehabilitation for these children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Only one study implemented a home-based training program for 20 toddlers, aged 12 to 26&#x000a0;months, after either a superior cardiopulmonary connection procedure or an arterial switch operation. The study revealed that a home-based training program could improve motor abilities and increase children&#x02019;s rates of development to age-appropriate norms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. But these studies focus on complex CHD. Even though cardiac catheterization is a minimally invasive procedure, it causes damage to the body; moreover, the patients are very young, with poor psychology and compliance, which make post-surgery management difficult. It is reported that a better inpatient environment with enough emotional support for the parents during the pre- and post-procedure phase, as well as exercise therapy for the children post-procedure, could relieve pain and reduce complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Overall, little research relates to growth in the development of therapeutic intervention for CHD with cardiac catheterization.</p><p>This parallel randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of a home-based exercise program and whether it could improve the motor abilities of children with CHD with cardiac catheterization, reduce parental anxiety and parenting burden, and improve the quality of life for the children&#x02019;s parents through the program, which may represent a valuable and efficient intervention for children with CHD and their families.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this research study are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To evaluate whether a home-based exercise program may improve motor abilities in CHD children with cardiac catheterization</p></list-item><list-item><p>To identify whether a home-based exercise program may reduce parental anxiety and caregiver burden and promote parents&#x02019; quality of life.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>Children with CHD who are planning to perform a cardiac catheterization procedure will be recruited from the Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Xinhua Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China.</p><p>The study will be implemented at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. Before participation in the study, parents/legal guardians will be asked to sign a written informed consent. First, patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be recruited for the study through echocardiography results. Second, patients will undergo baseline evaluations including motor abilities, cardiac function, modified Ross score, sound of speed at the tibia, and functional independence level, and their parents will complete three questionnaires about their anxiety levels, quality of life, and caregivers&#x02019; burden. Children with CHD will be allocated by a physician using computer-generated block randomization into two groups: an intervention group and a control group after the catheterization process. The allocations will be concealed in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes through a signature across the sealing point. A trained research assistant, who will be blinded to the allocation, will enroll patients and assign them to interventions. All evaluations will be carried out by the evaluation team. Another team, composed of experienced pediatric physiotherapists, will teach parents the home-based exercises, remind them to perform the exercises, and provide valuable information about the details of the exercises. The evaluation team will be blinded in this program; however, the intervention team will not be blinded, as they must communicate with parents and offer informed consent in order to obtain the parents&#x02019; signatures. The intervention group will receive a home-based exercise program, while the control group will only receive home-based education (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). All children and parents will be evaluated by the trained evaluation team before the procedure and 1, 3, and 6&#x000a0;months after the cardiac catheterization. Micro Message Public Platform dissemination and collaboration with staff of the Department of Pediatric Cardiology was established to facilitate enrollment to reach the target sample size. All parents will be added into a CHD group of the Micro Message Platform created by the intervention team to remind them to bring their children for clinic visits in order to promote patient retention.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram showing home-based exercise program for children with CHD following interventional cardiac catheterization</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1773_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

The home-based exercise program will be designed by the pediatric cardiologist, rehabilitation physician, and intervention team with input from the parents. The home-based exercise program will be individualized to each child&#x02019;s developmental age, severity, and degree of developmental delay. The baseline assessment results will be used to identify age-appropriate skills that the children have not yet mastered. The exercise program will be designed so that parents can choose how to incorporate these activities into their daily schedules and preferred behaviors. First, a member of the intervention team will provide the parents with one-on-one rehabilitation program training until the parents master the skills. In addition, the parents will be given a home-based game reader and the Micro Message Public Platform to guide them. At least one of the children&#x02019;s parents will be asked to complete the entire exercise program, and the rest of the family members must agree and support the home-based exercise program.

Function change of left and right ventricles, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and pulmonary valve pressure difference will also be tested. The left ventricular end-systolic volume, left ventricular end-diastolic volume, and left ventricular short axis shortening rate are used to evaluate the left ventricular function. The tricuspid valve systolic peak velocity is used to check the right ventricular function.

It is an 18-item, 3-domain questionnaire that measures a child&#x02019;s consistent performance in essential daily functional skills. Three main domains (self-care, mobility, and cognition) are assessed by interviewing or by observing a child&#x02019;s performance of a task to criterion standards. Each item is rated on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from 7 (complete independence) to 1 (total assistance). The WeeFIM is a psychometrically sound instrument in terms of its reliability, validity, and responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

We will implement appropriate guidelines and supervision for the home-based exercise program; for example, we will call the parents to remind them to carry out the rehabilitation program weekly and to answer any questions or concerns. In addition, we will hand out brochures and disks to share exercise education materials. Our study may provide replicable evidence that a home-based exercise program can improve motor abilities in children with CHD and improve parental anxiety, caregiver burden, and the overall quality of life.</p><sec id="Sec34"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The first strength of our study is that it will be the first randomized controlled trial that focuses on home-based exercise for young children with CHD and cardiac catheterization. Second, except for the important elements of cardiac function, our study focuses more on growth development at an early stage for children with CHD. Third, we used GPower 3.1.9.2 software for the sample calculation to ensure its scientific validity. Fourth, our study will last for 6&#x000a0;months, with three re-evaluations, in order to update the patients&#x02019; recovery and development status in time. Fifth, our study develops a detailed and individual home-based exercise program for each patient, and provides a one-on-one guide for the parents, until they master the skills. Moreover, there is a close home-based monitoring process, which could ensure the quality of implementation of the home-based exercise program to a certain extent. Sixth, our intervention will not solely focus on the children, as their parents will also be educated in home-based exercise and other appropriate educational and care guidelines for children with CHD.</p><p>Several limitations exist in our trial: (1) the age of subjects is limited to 0 to 5&#x000a0;years; (2) we only recruit patients with cardiac catheterization for our trial; we will not group the children according to their specific CHD subtypes or the treatment approach to CHD; (3) we will not evaluate language and speech development or cognitive development directly, only motor development; thus, our trial cannot be used as a comprehensive evaluation of all types of home-based exercise programs for CHD children with cardiac catheterization; and (4) our study includes a short follow-up duration of 6&#x000a0;months.</p><p>In conclusion, our study design for delayed motor development of CHD children with cardiac catheterization developed a home-based exercise program as the main intervention approach after the procedure. It is crucial to address whether a home-based exercise program could improve the patients&#x02019; motor abilities and improve parental anxiety, burden, and quality of life. The findings will be beneficial for children with CHD and their families, research collaborators, physicians, and the general public.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Trial status</title><p>Patient recruitment is ongoing.
