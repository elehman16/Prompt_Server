On the other hand, these children have normal intelligence quotient, but they are less than their peers in educational aspects.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] LD includes disorders in reading, writing, or mathematics.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Reading disorder (RD) is a specific developmental disorder with symptoms that can be persistent until adulthoods. About 4%&#x02013;5% of children and adolescents experienced this disorder around the world.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Reading ability is very important in life and learning this ability takes times like the other abilities, and it should be considered as one of the important goals of education in children because having reading ability is essential for learning school and nonschool subjects.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Although children with RD have normal intelligence, they usually did not experience satisfactory academic progress or continued their education with difficulties or dropped out which had negative economic, social, cultural, emotional, and mental effects on children and society.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Treating RD includes explaining disorder for RD children's parents and teachers and justifying them. Treatment duration depends on the severity of disorder and psychological symptoms. RD therapy has two parts as followed: education of reading and spelling out practices and treating accompanied psychological disorders.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Studies demonstrated that pharmacological treatment is not considered for RD and it is useful just when other psychiatric disease such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is present and treating this psychiatric disease can improve reading disabilities remarkably.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] There are several studies suggested that using methylphenidate (Ritalin) improves RDs, but it cannot be considered as a complete treatment for this disease.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Other studies evaluated meclizine as an antimotion sickness medication in RD children, but it has not significant effects, and there are limited case reports with positive effects of this drug special in children with both RD and ADHD.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] According to other evaluation, Piracetam was effective in improving RD in children.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Memantine is widely used in treating Alzheimer disease and sometimes prescribed in autism and obsessive&#x02013;compulsive disorder (OCD) patients.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This drug is a nonselective antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and modulates glutamate activity as a neurotransmitter involving in memory and learning. In normal situation, glutamate attached to NMDA receptor and allows calcium to enter the cell. Supra-activation of these receptors causes excessive calcium entering to neuronal cells which leads to nerve cell deaths and may result Alzheimer dementia. Memantine inhibits these processes partially and protects cells. This drug well tolerated by patients without any psychotic side effects.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Studies showed the efficacy of this drug in treating children with pervasive developmental disorders and ADHD and improving eye contact, repetitive actions, attention, and language.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>There are some issues about RD such as: high costs of employing private teacher for affected children, lack of exact pharmacological treatment for this disorder and need for finding a drug as a treatment with low side effects. Therefore, this hypothesis was raised that Due to the efficacy of memantine in some psychiatric disorders, whether this drug is useful in treating RD or not? The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of memantine in treating RD children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>In this randomized clinical trial study, 62 children with RD who referred to Pediatric Psychiatry and psychology Clinics in Noor and Ali-Asghar Hospital in Isfahan from 2015 to 2016, were participated [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

These medications were provided by Abidi pharmacological company and Pharmacy Department of Iran University of Medical Sciences (IUMS) for this study. One and three months after starting intervention, all participants in both groups were done reading and dyslexia tests again, and the score of each subtest was recorded separately. If each patient showed any side effects of using memantine or placebo, they treated and then excluded from the study.</p><p>Educational program contains ten sessions as followed: in the first session, psychologist evaluated education prerequisites including memory, and attention; in the second session, psychologist improved children's visual and auditory memory and trained two syllable words; in the third session, visual and auditory memory, frosting test, and learning two syllable words were practiced and training three syllable words was beginning; in the fourth session, practices were done for improving attention abilities and learning three-syllable words and training four syllable words was started; in the fifth session, practices for improving accuracy were done and word making is completely practiced by making two, three, and four syllable words; in the sixth session, frosting practices were done and training two-part word was beginning; in the seventh session, sequence memory and fluent reading were practiced; in the eighth session, sequence memory, fluent reading, recognition, and comprehension were practiced; in the ninth session, visual accuracy, recognition, fluent reading, and comprehension were practiced; and in the tenth session, all these practices were reviewed.

Glutamate is a main motivated neurotransmitter in brain that activates postsynaptic receptors such as NMDA receptors which has a specific role in memory and learning processes.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] One of neuropsychological features which is important in reading skill progression is working memory. Working memory is a vital ability for primary recognition of reading and then reading perception. Studies showed that children with RDs have poorer functions in neuropsychological tests including immediate memory, memory for names, face memory, and working memory compared to children without RD.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In children with dyslexia, poor performance or dysfunction of memory for saving data about phonological structure of language causes problems in reading.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In addition, these children have problems for reminding data that maybe is due to failures in function of short-term memory.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>According to discussion above the role of memory impairment in reading disorder is obvious. On the other hand the effect of memantine in improving memory has been proved, So one can conclude that efficacy of memantine in improving RD is due to the effect of this drug in improving children's memory.</p><p>In our study, mean score in the majority of subtests in intervention groups during the time of study increased significantly and there was just one subtest (reading non-words) which did not show any significant changes. In this subtest, the mean score was increased during the study, but this increase was not statistically remarkable. In nonintervention group, the mean score of most subtest showed significant changes during the study except reading nonwords and category fluency subtests. These findings demonstrated that educational practices with or without using memantine have significant effects in improving reading skills in different aspects in children.</p><p>In three domains of nonintervention group, the score of 1 and 3 months after intervention was statistically different, but in intervention group, there was no significant difference between 1 month after intervention and 3 months after intervention, this can suggest that using memantine can be speeder in treating process, and in nonintervention group after 3 months, significant result was acquired, and in intervention group after 1 month, significant result was acquired.</p><p>About educational and psychological treatments, there are several studies that showed psychological intervention can improve reading functions in children with RDs.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] There are other studies which assessed educational practices in treating RDs and demonstrated that the best way is to employ a private teacher to practice reading abilities with children based on asking question by teacher and self-asking question strategies.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In addition, using educational techniques for improving reading skills in school-age children who are at risk for RD can remarkably decrease the incidence of RD.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Interventions based on reading fluency may have positive effects in RD children in improving reading skills,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] but according to our knowledge despite all of the studies mentioned above, there is not any study that demonstrated the effects of any drug on children's reading skills.</p><p>RD is a combination of disabilities and problems that affected learning processes in several aspects and accompanied with problems in processing speed, short-term memory, visual, auditory, and speech perception and sequences, and motor skills.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] There are limited studies that evaluated the effects of education and medication on all domains of reading and dyslexia. Similar studies evaluated some parts of these abilities, but the Nama test which was used in this study evaluated all aspects of disabilities mentioned above.</p><p>Children with RD have inadequacy in selective attention, and they have small attention span and visuospatial and phonemic defects.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] One study in 14 children with pervasive developmental disorder using memantine showed improvement in 28% of children with most effects in memory aspects and improvement in eye contact, visual processing, and increasing focuses.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In other studies, memantine has been useful in OCD patients.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Hence, other studies in children have evaluated the effect of memantine on other psychiatric disorders.</p><p>One of the limitations of this study is its small sample size, and for further researches, a greater and universal sample size is needed. In addition, in this research, the effects of memantine were evaluated when it is added to educational practices and for assessing the exact effects of this drug and its mechanism it is better to evaluate its effects in improving reading problems separately.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Adding memantine to educational practices is effective in improving RD in school-age children with LD.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lerner</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Learning Disabilities: Theories, Diagnosis, and Teaching Strategies</article-title><year>1989</year><edition>6th</edition><publisher-loc>Boston: Massachusetts</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH)</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alizadeh</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Bahmani</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Mofidi</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A Comparative study on writing skills achievement in 1st grade elementary students with and without attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder</article-title><source>Q Educ Psychol</source><year>2007</year><volume>8</volume><fpage>115</fpage><lpage>34</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cantwell</surname><given-names>DP</given-names></name><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Association between attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder and learning disorders</article-title><source>J Learn Disabil</source><year>1991</year><volume>24</volume><fpage>88</fpage><lpage>95</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2010679</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shaywitz</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name><name><surname>Shaywitz</surname><given-names>BA</given-names></name><name><surname>Fletcher</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Escobar</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevalence of reading disability in boys and girls.
