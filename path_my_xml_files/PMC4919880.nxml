However, this has not been tested in a definitive clinical trial and results cannot be generalised from general population studies as epilepsy tends to be more severe and to involve additional clinical comorbidities in adults with ID. This trial investigates whether nurses with expertise in epilepsy and ID, working proactively to a clinically defined role, can improve clinical and quality of life outcomes in the management of epilepsy within this population, compared to treatment as usual. The trial also aims to establish whether any perceived benefits represent good value for money.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The EpAID clinical trial is a two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial of nurse-led epilepsy management versus treatment as usual. This trial aims to obtain follow-up data from 320 participants with ID and drug-resistant epilepsy. Participants are randomly assigned either to a &#x02018;treatment as usual&#x02019; control or a &#x02018;defined epilepsy nurse role&#x02019; active arm, according to the cluster site at which they are treated. The active intervention utilises the recently developed Learning Disability Epilepsy Specialist Nurse Competency Framework for adults with ID. Participants undergo 4&#x000a0;weeks of baseline data collection, followed by a minimum of 20&#x000a0;weeks intervention (novel treatment or treatment as usual), followed by 4&#x000a0;weeks of follow-up data collection. The primary outcome is seizure severity, including associated injuries and the level of distress manifest by the patient in the preceding 4&#x000a0;weeks. Secondary outcomes include cost-utility analysis, carer strain, seizure frequency and side effects. Descriptive measures include demographic and clinical descriptors of participants and clinical services in which they receive their epilepsy management. Qualitative study of clinical interactions and semi-structured interviews with clinicians and participants&#x02019; carers are also undertaken.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The EpAID clinical trial is the first cluster randomised controlled trial to test possible benefits of a nurse-led intervention in adults with epilepsy and ID. This research will have important implications for ID and epilepsy services. The challenges of undertaking such a trial in this population, and the approaches to meeting these are discussed.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN96895428">ISRCTN96895428</ext-link> version 1.1.

However, this has not been tested in a definitive clinical trial and results from previous studies within the general population cannot necessarily be generalised to adults with ID given the often relatively greater severity and complexity of epilepsy and associated morbidities in that group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Epilepsy and intellectual disability</title><p>Nearly one million adults in England have an ID and epilepsy is the most common medical illness in this group; affecting around 26&#x000a0;%, with higher rates in those with more severe ID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Individuals with ID have a worse outcome than those with epilepsy in the general population with increased seizure frequency, higher frequency of multiple anti-epileptic drug use and side effects, higher treatment costs, higher rates of mortality and greater incidence of behavioural problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Reflecting these observations, it has been reported that between 2005 and 2009 the most common cause of avoidable acute hospital admissions for people with ID was seizures associated with poorly controlled epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A survey by the Improving Health and Lives: Learning Disabilities Observatory (IHAL) reported that the second most frequent potentially preventable cause of death in those with ID was epilepsy or convulsions (13&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These observations highlight the need to improve outcomes for people with epilepsy and ID.</p><p>Currently in the UK, secondary care of epilepsy and ID is generally provided by community learning disability services, or hospital-based neurological services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is common for people with ID to be on multiple therapies and they are likely to have tried several anti-epileptic medications to reduce seizure severity and frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Only around 30&#x000a0;% of this population will achieve seizure freedom compared to 70&#x000a0;% of the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, in most people with epilepsy and ID, the aim of anti-epileptic medication is to reduce seizure severity and frequency whilst keeping associated side effects to a minimum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Achieving this balance is often difficult in adults with ID due to the epilepsy&#x02019;s severity and complex associated morbidities. Associated morbidities of epilepsy in adults with ID include difficulty understanding, mobility problems, communication difficulties, attentional deficits and a range of emotional, cognitive and behavioural problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore identifying and differentiating presenting symptoms from the individuals&#x02019; ID, epilepsy and medication side effects can be problematic. There are often additional challenges for treating clinicians in communicating effectively with the individual with ID; putting them at ease and providing the most effective treatment and management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], resulting in the highest possible overall quality of life for the individual. Unfortunately, epileptologists may be limited in being able to provide the necessary clinic time and often have limited training in ID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Individuals with epilepsy and ID are also at greater risk of lacking capacity to understand and make decisions regarding their treatment, meaning that &#x02018;best interest&#x02019; decisions may be required, often involving tripartite discussion between the individual, their family or paid carer and treating clinician [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This suggests that a multidisciplinary, holistic approach, with judicious use of expert nurses may improve support and access to healthcare in this group, who are often excluded from clinical research and overlooked by health services.</p><p>The aim of the trial described in this article is to test the hypothesis that an epilepsy nurse-led intervention is able to cost-effectively reduce seizure severity and improve overall quality of life for patients and those that provide care for them in the community.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Epilepsy Specialist Nurses (EN) role</title><p>Epilepsy Nurses (ENs) offer a broad spectrum of services to patients with epilepsy. They contribute, depending on their level of training and expertise, to activities that may include patient assessment, medication management and ordering and interpreting investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. They also provide education, support and counselling to patients and families, often overlooked by other clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. ENs may also have more time to speak to patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and may improve continuity of, and accessibility to care, with the potential to improve communication between people with epilepsy and their primary healthcare services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, it is predicted that ENs would be ideally placed to champion the unpredictable, complex and long-term needs of people with epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>However, a Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] of five trials of epilepsy nurse specialists found no convincing evidence across the general population that ENs improve overall outcomes for people with epilepsy. Nevertheless, a recent open prospective survey, published after the Cochrane review, of the effects of introducing a paediatric EN, suggested ENs might reduce emergency admissions by as much as 50&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus a state of clinical equipoise may be considered to exist with respect to the question of whether it would be effective and cost-effective to systematically employ ENs to manage epilepsy in adults with ID.</p><p>In terms of financial costs, a trial reported by Meads et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], in patients recruited from a hospital-based epilepsy service of whom just under 10&#x000a0;% had an ID, noted that the use of an epilepsy nurse cost less than standard care, with reduced numbers of outpatient clinic hospital attendances with doctors and a potential decrease in GP consultations after 6&#x000a0;months.</p><p>The great majority of previous research into the use of ENs has been in the general population, in studies that have completely or largely excluded adults with ID. However, it is known that people with ID have been subject to a range of health inequalities. Advocacy organisations and especially Mencap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] have highlighted inequalities in healthcare noting that clinicians regularly fail people with ID - failing to consult with or involve parents and family members in care and treatment decisions. Despite these observations, a survey of epilepsy services for a community sample of adults with ID and epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] found that just 34&#x000a0;% of respondents had seen an EN. This low exposure rate is despite the perception that ENs may enhance the care of people with ID and epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The Epilepsy and Intellectual Disability (EpAID) Trial - aim</title><p>The EpAID Trial aims to address two specific objectives. The primary objective is to establish whether nurses with expertise in epilepsy and ID, working to a clinically defined role outlined by The Learning Disability Epilepsy Nurse Competency Framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], can reduce seizure severity in adults with ID compared to treatment as usual.</p><p>The secondary objectives are to establish whether any observed benefits of clinical and quality of life outcomes justify any additional resource requirements, from the perspective of Health and Social Services.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Primary objective</title><p>To establish whether nurses with expertise in epilepsy and intellectual disabilities (ID), working to a defined clinical role, can improve epilepsy-related clinical and quality of life outcomes in the management of epilepsy in adults with ID compared to treatment as usual.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Secondary objective</title><p>To establish whether any clinical benefits found justify the provision of additional resources associated with EN input after consideration of the costs associated with the intervention from the perspective of Health and Social Services. Additional secondary outcomes comprise measures of carer strain and quality of life to examine how the use of the competency framework, compared to treatment as usual, impacts on relationships critical in delivering ongoing care for adults with ID and epilepsy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Trial design</title><p>The study is a cluster randomised trial with two arms; a &#x02018;treatment as usual&#x02019; control and a novel &#x02018;defined epilepsy nurse (EN) role&#x02019; trial arm, complying with CONSORT guidelines for cluster randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

The measure is completed at the end of the 4-week baseline period and again after 24&#x000a0;weeks in the trial. The baseline period refers to the 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to treatment beginning (whether this be continuation of treatment as usual or the beginning of the nurse-led intervention). The ELDQoL-SSS is designed for use as a proxy measure; it is completed by carers and provides a detailed measure of the physical severity of seizures experienced in the preceding 4&#x000a0;weeks, including any associated injuries and the level of distress manifest by the patient after a seizure.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>The secondary outcome measures include an economic evaluation of the EN intervention. This takes two forms: a cost-utility analysis based on utility data collected using the EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L and a cost-benefit analysis in which benefit is assessed by contingent valuation of the service by carers. Differences in resource use are estimated using a modified Client Service Receipt Inventory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], collected over the baseline period and again for 4&#x000a0;weeks after 24&#x000a0;weeks of intervention.

Following recruitment of a site, members of the direct clinical care team supported, where appropriate permissions have been gained, by nurses from the local clinical research network, screen all potential participants. An anonymised list of eligible potential participants is sent to the clinical trials unit (CTU) supporting the trial, who provide the research team with a sequence in which to contact them. The first 34 potential participants are contacted in the first instance. If any potential recruit does not wish to participate then the next person in the sequence is approached. Participant recruitment is completed before site randomisation.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Methods: assignment of interventions</title><sec id="Sec25"><title>Group allocation</title><sec id="Sec26"><title>Sequence generation</title><p>Randomisation of the clusters is undertaken independently by the CTU using block randomisation with fixed block sizes. A minimum of two sites are randomised at a time to preserve allocation concealment.

The majority of the data collection is undertaken over the telephone by Research Assistants. Research Assistants mostly talk to carers of participants, due to the nature of the questions being asked. This also bypasses any issues which may arise for participants whose level of intellectual disability is too severe for them to provide details for the data collection. The use of telephone interviews allows a more convenient and low-cost method of data collection than face-to-face interviews. Participants/carers are sent the questionnaires in advance of the telephone call and then their answers are noted by the research assistant during the prearranged talk. Qualitative interviews are conducted and audio-recorded over the telephone for later transcription. A willingness-to-pay health economic questionnaire is also collected over the phone during the follow-up phase.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Data management</title><p>The trial employs an electronic case report form (eCRF) created using the InferMed Macro database system.

A linear mixed-effects model is used with a random effect for cluster to account for the trial being cluster randomised. Baseline patient covariates to be included as fixed-effects are ELDQoL-SSS, age, level of intellectual disability (mild, moderate, severe or profound), mean number of seizures per month averaged over the 4&#x000a0;weeks preceding entry to the trial, and living circumstances (independent; with family; in group home). Cluster level covariates included as fixed-effects are the deprivation index of the cluster area, seniority level of the nurse (&#x02018;novice&#x02019;, &#x02018;competent&#x02019; or &#x02018;expert&#x02019;) to investigate possible therapist effects, and overall caseload of the nurse (number of patients). Whether a nurse is a nurse-prescriber is also recorded. The seniority criteria are such that a nurse-prescriber is rated as &#x02018;expert&#x02019;. However, preliminary data indicate that fewer than 10&#x000a0;% of nurses are prescribers and it is unlikely that prescriber status will be independently considered as a covariate. A Wald test for effect of intervention is used as the primary analysis.</p><p>Missing data on the ELDQoL-SSS are dealt with using a missing at random assumption. Where &#x0003e;3&#x000a0;% of data are missing, multiple imputation is used for the primary analysis. Five imputations are used unless the percentage missingness is greater than this. In this case the number of imputations is equal to the percentage missingness. Multiple imputation is also performed on missing covariate and outcome data for all secondary clinical analyses in a similar way to the primary analysis.</p><p>Secondary outcomes are analysed using a suitable mixed-effects model (linear mixed-effects model for continuous outcomes, and a Poisson generalised linear mixed-effects model for count data) or accounting for the clustering using robust Huber-White standard errors. Secondary clinical endpoints include the change in Carer Strain Index, the number of seizures and the other subscales of the ELDQoL measurement (side effects, mood and behaviour). The covariates used for the analysis of the secondary outcomes are the same as those included in the primary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Economic analyses</title><p>A cost-utility analysis is used to evaluate effectiveness. The cost-utility analysis will allow comparison of cost-effectiveness against commonly accepted thresholds of acceptability in terms of the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, given the potential for a lack of sensitivity of the EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L to benefits of the intervention for carers and for participants, we will also undertake a cost-benefit analysis. The time horizon of each evaluation is 6&#x000a0;months and the primary perspective is Health and Social Services.</p><p>A sensitivity analysis will consider a broader societal perspective. Cost differences across the two arms of the trial are estimated from questionnaires assessing provision of health and social care at baseline and after 6&#x000a0;months, and from time diaries completed by ENs. QALY gains are estimated at 0.5* health-related quality of life (QoL) at 6&#x000a0;months after controlling for QoL at baseline, ELDQoL-SSS, age, level of ID, mean number of seizures per month (calculated as above), and living circumstances (as above). Willingness-to-pay data are collected as open-ended responses with the use of prompt cards showing a range of values. Bootstrapping is used to estimate uncertainty in mean cost and outcomes, and to facilitate construction of cost-effectiveness acceptability curves for the cost-utility analysis. Bootstrapping refers to a statistical technique to estimate uncertainty around a parameter without assuming a parametric distribution for the population distribution of that parameter.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Qualitative analysis</title><p>The semi-structured interviews are analysed using a systematic process of indexing - thematic framework development; charting; mapping and interpretation.

The patient group involved in the EpAID study present difficulties in terms of representation as individuals with severe intellectual disabilities are more likely to have epilepsy. They are thus more likely to make up a large proportion of the participant group recruited for this trial. The Trial Advisory Group (TAG) for this study has attempted to overcome these challenges and ensure the views of those with severe ID are represented, along with their families and paid carers and the general public, through the experience and expertise of its members.</p><p>TAG members include the mother of a young woman with a severe ID and complex epilepsy and a home manager with experience of care for people with ID and epilepsy. The advisory group also consists of a representative from the charity Epilepsy Action who is able to consult through volunteer and adviser contacts and find family carers or members of the public to give views about specific questions as they arise. Joining the TAG are a Learning Disability Nurse with experience in the management of epilepsy, the trial CI, Co-ordinator, Research Assistants and other members of the research team as required.</p><p>The group address issues relevant to recruitment, retention and dissemination of findings. They advise on how to interact with participants and carers and help to make sure that important outcomes are not overlooked. Meetings happen at intervals of approximately 3&#x000a0;months but remain flexible to incorporate each stage of the research process. Advice gained through the TAG is acted upon and reported by the research team throughout the trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec43" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The EpAID Trial investigates whether an EN-led epilepsy management programme is effective and represents good value for money for people with an ID and epilepsy compared to current management (treatment as usual).</p><p>The trial methodology brings both strengths and weaknesses. Cluster randomisation protects against contamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Within each cluster the EN(s) will manage participants using just one approach. There are 16 individual cluster sites across England, Scotland and Wales, increasing the external validity of the trial. The inclusion of multiple different healthcare delivery organisations (NHS Trusts) within the trial increases the diversity of the population being studied, increasing the generalisability of the study.</p><p>However, the complex intervention to be trialled cannot be delivered and assessed in a double-blind manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Although participants will not be told which arm of the trial they are in, it is possible that they and their caregivers could notice a difference in their management. Moreover, the Hawthorne effect has the potential to influence this study, as clinicians in both arms may try to improve the management they provide for patients involved in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], possibly overshadowing effects of the intervention.</p><p>Fidelity of delivery of the intervention is assessed by examination of activity diaries completed by the ENs. ENs could have large numbers of diaries to fill, so there is a chance that information could be omitted or forgotten. Previous studies have found this not to be the case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, these studies did not have the volume of participants included in the EpAID Trial and it is possible that this could be detrimental to the accuracy and consistency of diary entries.</p><p>The following steps to minimise attrition are included as part of the trial design; (i) participation in the trial makes very few active demands on the participants, (ii) participants are eligible because they have ongoing seizures, meaning that they are likely to be agreeable to remaining in the trial, (iii) participation in the trial does not preclude receipt of any other clinically indicated treatment, (iv) the research team follows a flexible participant-led approach to gathering baseline and follow-up data &#x02013; with contacts being at times and locations suggested by participants and respondents, and with, as far as possible, contacts being either face-to-face, by telephone or by post as preferred by respondents. There are, however, issues that may arise when using telephone contact to complete questionnaires. Questionnaire interviews conducted over the phone may be more readily misunderstood than face-to-face interviews, even if the participant has a copy of the relevant questionnaire in front of them (which may not always be possible). On the other hand, telephone calls may be more convenient for participants and carers as they can be scheduled around the needs of the participant, reducing the risks of failure or delay in obtaining baseline or follow-up measures.</p><p>There is a growing importance in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of clinical interventions alongside their efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This allows decision-makers to prioritise investment in a manner which reflects efficiency as well as equity concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This importance is recognised by the EpAID Trial, which will involve two complementary economic evaluations: a cost-utility analysis capturing gains in participant QoL and allowing comparison against accepted thresholds (&#x000a3;20,000 per QALY), and a cost-benefit analysis that has the scope to capture a broader range of benefits to participants and their carers. These evaluations will provide the necessary data for commissioners of health services to assess whether to implement an EN service given the constraints of a limited budget.</p><p>The EpAID Trial investigates treatments for epilepsy in adults who also have an intellectual disability. As noted in the introduction, there is a clear need for research to improve epilepsy management in this group. However, undertaking a clinical trial in this population brings several challenges that need to be overcome. These include recruiting individuals who lack capacity to provide informed consent to participate and identifying appropriate consultees for these individuals. Some individuals have been in residential care for many years, occasionally with limited or no contact with family members. To overcome these challenges we work closely with the community teams who deliver care to this patient group, and through them, aim to constructively involve carers, particularly family carers. The importance of this approach is illustrated in a previous qualitative study of parents of adults with ID and epilepsy, which observed that, in their role as gatekeepers for access by health services to their grown-up children, the extent to which parents facilitated their offspring&#x02019;s participation in therapeutic activities depended on the parents&#x02019; views, as opposed to clinicians&#x02019; views, of those activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Further issues may be related to participants being in group homes. Informed consent can be more difficult to gauge when the participant is reliant on others. The participant&#x02019;s choices may be limited &#x02013; they may be used to saying &#x02018;yes&#x02019; or &#x02018;no&#x02019; to every option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], which clouds their ability to make a judgement related to informed consent. Furthermore, the researcher may be seen as an authority figure, leading to acquiescence &#x02013; the person in authority makes a decision and the participant simply goes along with it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p>The EpAID research could have important implications for ID and epilepsy services. If the intervention is found to be effective and cost-effective it will improve epilepsy outcomes for service users with ID, as they will receive more effective treatments. If on the other hand the intervention is found to be no more effective than current treatments, this knowledge will enable service commissioners and managers to deploy clinicians to other roles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study began in October 2013, recruitment commenced in October 2014.</p><sec id="Sec45"><title>Trial protocol</title><p>Date 30 July 2015, Version 1.5.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec46"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CI, Chief Investigator; CTU, Clinical Trials Unit; DMEC, Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee; eCRF, Electronic case report form; ELDQoL-SSS, Epilepsy Learning Disability Quality of Life-Seizure Severity Scale; EN, Epilepsy Nurses; EpAID, Epilepsy And Intellectual Disability; GCP, Good clinical practice; ICC, Interclass correlation coefficient; ID, Intellectual disability; ISRCTN, International Standardised Randomised Controlled Trial Number; NHS, National Health Service; NIHR, National Institute of Health Research; PI, Principal Investigator; QALY, quality-adjusted life-year; QoL, Quality of life; REC, Research Ethics Committee; TAG, Trial Advisory Group</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec47"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1429_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>EpAID Trial SPIRIT checklist.
