Few obesity prevention programs for low-income preschoolers and their parents have been rigorously tested, and effects are modest. We are testing a novel obesity prevention program for low-income preschoolers built on the premise that children who are better able to self-regulate in the face of psychosocial stressors may be less likely to eat impulsively in response to stress. Enhancing behavioral self-regulation skills in low-income children may be a unique and important intervention approach to prevent childhood obesity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The Growing Healthy study is a randomized controlled trial evaluating two obesity prevention interventions in 600 low-income preschoolers attending Head Start, a federally-funded preschool program for low-income children. Interventions are delivered by community-based, nutrition-education staff partnering with Head Start. The first intervention (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;200), Preschool Obesity Prevention Series (POPS), addresses evidence-based obesity prevention behaviors for preschool-aged children and their parents. The second intervention (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;200) comprises POPS in combination with the Incredible Years Series (IYS), an evidence-based approach to improving self-regulation among preschool-aged children. The comparison condition (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;200) is Usual Head Start Exposure. We hypothesize that POPS will yield positive effects compared to Usual Head Start, and that the combined intervention (POPS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IYS) addressing behaviors well-known to be associated with obesity risk, as well as self-regulatory capacity, will be most effective in preventing excessive increases in child adiposity indices (body mass index, skinfold thickness). We will evaluate additional child outcomes using parent and teacher reports and direct assessments of food-related self-regulation. We will also gather process data on intervention implementation, including fidelity, attendance, engagement, and satisfaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The Growing Healthy study will shed light on associations between self-regulation skills and obesity risk in low-income preschoolers. If the project is effective in preventing obesity, results can also provide critical insights into how best to deliver obesity prevention programming to parents and children in a community-based setting like Head Start in order to promote better health among at-risk children.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01398358</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Obesity prevention</kwd><kwd>Low-income children</kwd><kwd>Preschoolers</kwd><kwd>Head start</kwd><kwd>Incredible years series</kwd><kwd>Self-regulation</kwd><kwd>Intervention study</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The Institute of Medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] identifies childhood obesity as an urgent problem; nearly 1 in 5 young children are obese and socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in obesity rates appear even during the preschool years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Once established, childhood obesity typically persists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and predicts health problems including cardiovascular disease and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Preventing obesity is essential, yet few programs for young children have been rigorously tested, and effects are modest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The goal of the Growing Healthy trial is to test the effectiveness and feasibility of two obesity prevention interventions. The first intervention is an education curriculum promoting obesity prevention behaviors, and the second intervention places this curriculum in the context of an additional intervention to enhance behavioral self-regulation. Both interventions are delivered to low-income preschoolers and their parents by community-based, nutrition-education specialists partnering with Head Start (HS) staff.</p><p>The education curriculum, Preschool Obesity Prevention Series (POPS), is designed to promote empirically-tested obesity prevention behaviors informed by expert recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and the American Dietetic Association (ADA; now Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics) guidelines for Pediatric Weight Management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The ADA supports increased fruit and vegetable (FV) intake based on intervention trials that found FV intake associated with reduced adiposity indices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption is consistently associated with body mass index (BMI) and child obesity in prospective studies and intervention trials, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and inversely associated with milk intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Dietary variety is related to greater FV intake and dietary quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and AAP recommend that screen time be limited to less than 2 hours per day, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] based on intervention trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, POPS focuses on increasing FV intake, reducing SSB consumption and eating a diet rich in calcium (following United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommendations on low-fat dairy), increasing dietary variety, and reducing screen time. POPS involves both children and parents in learning about obesity prevention behaviors and building skills to enact them, which is critical for a comprehensive approach, yet not common in existing programs.</p><p>Improving behavioral self-regulation (i.e., inhibiting impulses, calming down when upset) may also be important for preventing childhood obesity. Stress can lead to increased appetite and a shift in preference to foods high in added sugar and fats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Obesity is more common in children who engage in emotional eating, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] disinhibited eating, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] or eating in the absence of hunger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Children who cannot cope with stress well may engage in such stress-eating patterns as a way to self-regulate emotion and behavior, and over time become obese. The literature supports this impression; children who have difficult temperaments, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] behavior problems, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] tantrums over food, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] impulsivity, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and difficulty delaying gratification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] are more likely than their peers to be obese. The preschool years are an important period for the development of eating behavior, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] lifelong obesity risk, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] and self-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Thus, developing effective interventions for children this age that integrate these domains &#x02013; and, importantly, include parents &#x02013; could be a promising new direction for obesity prevention.</p><p>The Growing Healthy Study tests this novel combined approach to obesity prevention. First, the POPS intervention is designed to provide developmentally appropriate, empirically-validated, and coordinated obesity prevention messages to preschoolers and their parents. Second, we embed POPS within a self-regulation framework by implementing the Incredible Years Series (IYS), an evidence-based program shown to enhance self-regulation in young, low-income children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. With an emphasis on modeling positive behavioral management techniques and parenting as part of IYS, the IYS&#x02009;+&#x02009;POPS intervention will teach children behavioral self-regulation strategies (e.g., ways to calm down without relying on food), and also give parents new techniques for managing child behavior (e.g., responding to children&#x02019;s tantrums in ways that do not involve food). Thus, the IYS&#x02009;+&#x02009;POPS intervention may not only prevent obesity through directly reducing stress-eating as a form of self-regulation, but also lay the groundwork for better overall &#x02018;absorption&#x02019; of information in the POPS curriculum by enhancing child self-regulation and improved parent&#x02013;child interactions. Our conceptual model is outlined in Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Conceptual model.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2458-12-1040-1"/></fig><sec><title>Study aims and hypotheses</title><p>The primary aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness and feasibility of the two obesity prevention interventions described above: 1) POPS and 2) POPS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IYS, as delivered by community-based nutrition educators and HS staff to low-income preschoolers and their parents. Hypotheses are that across an academic year, compared to Usual HS Exposure: (1) POPS will result in improved obesity-related health behaviors and adiposity indices; (2) POPS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IYS will result in the greatest improvement in obesity-related health behaviors and adiposity indices, and this greater effect will be mediated in part by increased child self-regulatory capacity. A process evaluation to assess the feasibility, fidelity, parental engagement, and educational effectiveness of the POPS and POPS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IYS interventions will also be conducted.

Classrooms (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;75) are randomized through an automated system to one of 3 study arms (200 children per arm): (1) POPS; (2) POPS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IYS; or (3) Usual HS Exposure. Each HS program hosts all 3 study arms, and all children in an individual classroom participate in only one arm. Only one classroom participates per physical school site to prevent cross-contamination across study arms and ensure that participants are blind to group assignments. Families are assigned to study arm as a function of their classroom assignment. Every effort is made to match intervention and comparison classrooms on demographic characteristics in order to minimize differences not due to the intervention (e.g., % minority race/ethnicity, teacher education).</p><p>Data are collected pre-intervention (in the fall) and post-intervention (in the spring). Interventions occur between October and April of the academic year. Process implementation data are collected throughout the study. Children are enrolled in each of 4 academic years, with 50 children enrolled into each of the 3 study arms per year. Data collectors are separate from the interventionists, and blinded to the study arm to which participants in a classroom are assigned.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>Participants are from three HS programs in mixed rural and urban areas of Michigan. These programs serve 3,222 children (67% white, 28% black; ethnicity 23% Hispanic; 12.6% English as second language) per year in 184 half-day classrooms. The prevalence of overweight (BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;85th percentile and&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;95th, based on US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reference growth curves for age and sex), 16.2%) and obesity (BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;95th percentile, 17.0%) in these programs is similar to other HS cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Inclusion criteria are that the child is aged 3 or 4 years at study enrollment. Exclusions are significant developmental disabilities that would preclude participation, child is a foster child, or parent is non-English-speaking. Almost all families in the participating HS programs have annual household incomes below the federal poverty line, as this is an eligibility requirement for 90% of the children enrolled.</p><p>Families are told about the study during classroom open houses and through flyers in children&#x02019;s backpacks, and compensated for returning an initial enrollment packet, including a signed written informed consent form. They are then contacted by telephone to review eligibility criteria that they reported in the enrollment packet and to confirm complete understanding of the study and validate informed consent. Next, a data collector (blind to study condition) completes pretest assessments. Appropriate compensation, tokens of appreciation and regular contact from project staff are incorporated to enhance retention.</p></sec><sec><title>Research ethics approval</title><p>This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Boards of both collaborating universities, the University of Michigan Medical School Institutional Review Board (UM-IRBMED) and Michigan State University Social Science / Behavioral Education Review Board (MSU-SIRB). We follow the usual standards of a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan as required by the National Institutes of Health for an RCT.

Each lesson offers opportunities for parents to develop and practice skills, and a discussion of strategies to overcome challenges and problem-solving techniques, with an emphasis on building knowledge and self-efficacy about preventing childhood obesity. Recipes and hands-on activities are included in each lesson. Lessons are implemented by community-based, master&#x02019;s level trained Extension Educators from Michigan State University (a land-grant institution). Consistent with the land-grant mission to translate research findings into community-based practices, Extension Educators help people improve their lives through an educational process that applies knowledge to critical issues, needs and opportunities, Extension Educators regularly collaborate with scholars and work with parents, schools and community organizations, and each POPS Educator has extensive experience working with parents in the community on nutrition education issues.</p><p>The POPS-Child component uses children's stories with embedded obesity prevention themes related to behavioral goals (e.g., more FV consumption; less screen time). Six lessons are delivered over 12 weeks by the HS teacher and Extension Educators. Activities include classroom cooking experiences, games/activities associated with story themes, and goal setting. "Family Links" and "Parent Pages" are sent home to reinforce content from school to home. Each lesson runs on a two-week cycle in which the classroom teachers read the selected book (featuring one or more of the POPS obesity prevention behaviors) and introduce reinforcing classroom activities. The following week, the Extension Educator revisits the story and implements a hands-on cooking/tasting activity with the children.</p></sec><sec><title>POPS training, quality control, and implementation fidelity</title><p>To ensure consistency in the implementation of the curriculum, we conduct a 2-day training for Extension Educators and a shorter training for HS teachers (with booster sessions each year). Training covers curriculum specifics as well as strategies for promoting parent self-efficacy for behavior change and importance of fidelity. Fidelity of POPS delivery in the field is assessed by observing at least one session per group (including classroom activities and parent sessions) and documenting any deviations from the curriculum. Phone support from trainers is also available as needed. Child and parent engagement in POPS classroom and parent sessions, respectively, are documented by extension educators.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Incredible Years Series (IYS)</title><p>IYS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] is a widely-used, evidence-based program that includes Parent, Teacher, and Child components designed to promote self-regulation and prevent behavior problems in children. IYS uses observational learning and reinforcement techniques, and emphasizes behavior change strategies such as descriptive commenting about child behavior, praise, role-plays, and coaching to encourage and model positive behavior for parents and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>].

Concepts are discussed using video vignettes about parenting challenges. Parents complete homework and receive follow-up phone calls. IYS-Parent sessions are delivered by master&#x02019;s-level mental health specialists (MHS) (one per HS program, employed by HS).</p><p>For the IYS-Child component, sixty 15&#x02013;20 minute lessons are delivered throughout the year during "Circle Time" in HS classrooms, followed by small group activities. Lessons address self-regulation skills, problem-solving strategies, and prosocial behavior, and use child-size puppets to teach skills and engage children. IYS-Child lessons are delivered by the MHS, and HS teachers direct small group activities after each lesson. Teachers are mentored by MHS in delivering IYS-Child, so that delivery can slowly progress from delivery by MHS, to co-delivery by MHS and teacher, to sole delivery by the teacher over time, which is an effective model for dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. MHS and teachers also receive training in classroom management strategies (e.g., handling transitions effectively), which is the IYS-Classroom component.</p></sec><sec><title>IYS training, quality control and implementation fidelity</title><p>MHS and teachers receive extensive training in all components that they deliver, as required by IYS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. MHS communicate extensively to share ideas and coordinate efforts across sites, and receive monthly supervision from IYS trainers about their delivery of IYS components, and consultation as needed. MHS also work with teachers within their own site to develop lesson plans and small group activities. Fidelity of IYS intervention delivery is assessed via videotape, and covers the same elements as our POPS fidelity assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison group: &#x0201c;Usual Head Start Exposure&#x0201d;</title><p>In the Usual HS Exposure group, classes are taught by a teacher and teacher&#x02019;s aide. HS performance standards require nutrition and parenting curricula, but not intensive programs like POPS or IYS. Nutrition information is delivered to parents primarily via newsletter and each HS program contracts with a dietitian to review menus and individual child needs; these activities are documented for all programs.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection procedures</title><p>Data collectors (blind to family intervention status and not involved in implementation) are trained by Study Directors in all protocols. Data collection quality is monitored (e.g., surveys completed fully; child weight/height in appropriate range). Data collectors are trained to respond appropriately with referral information if parents make such requests.</p><p>Prior to intervention start in the fall, data collectors make a home visit to measure maternal weight and height, gather questionnaires, and obtain the first of three 24-hour dietary recalls (24HR; remaining 24HR are completed by phone). Children are weighed, measured, and participate in a 15-minute videotaped self-regulation task in a private room at school. Teachers complete questionnaires for each child. In the spring, mothers, children, and teachers repeat the same tasks as post-intervention assessments.</p><p>Questionnaires are completed using computer-assisted interviewer administration. Data are saved to a master database after each home visit, or double entered and any data entry errors corrected. Video-recordings of self-regulation tasks (see below) are coded by undergraduates trained to reliability (Cohen&#x02019;s kappa&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.70) by Study Directors.

Additional focal outcomes are dietary intake, TV viewing, ATDG, emotional eating, and food-related tantrums. Baseline comparability of the 3 groups will be assessed. To account for clustering of children within a classroom, Proc Mixed in SAS with a random intercept for classroom will be used to analyze continuous outcomes, and General Estimating Equations (GEE) techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>] will be used to compare the prevalence of obesity and overweight across the 3 groups. Analyses will be conducted both with and without adjustment for baseline characteristics such as age, sex, race, and baseline BMI or BMI z-score. All models will incorporate covariates that are related to the outcomes to reduce residual variance and thus help reduce Type II error. Significance will be assessed using a two-sided test at &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05.</p><p>Analyses will be based on the intention to treat principle where all randomized participants, including dropouts, are included in the analysis based on their randomized intervention group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>]. Given that a substantial portion of participants will likely have only partial adherence to the intervention (e.g., only attend some parent sessions), dose&#x02013;response analyses will also be performed where dose corresponds to number of sessions attended.</p><p>As outlined in the conceptual model (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), analyses will be conducted to test whether the effect of POPS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IYS on obesity-related health behaviors and adiposity indices is mediated by self-regulation (using parent-reported, teacher-reported, and direct child assessment measures). As a secondary analysis, models will also be examined separately for boys and girls, white and non-white children, and children who are overweight or obese versus non-overweight at baseline.</p><p>Finally, process data on recruitment, retention, participant engagement in the intervention, participant and educator satisfaction, and implementation fidelity will be analyzed using descriptive and qualitative approaches, to inform continued collaborations with HS and allow more effective dissemination of findings.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The Growing Healthy study will provide: 1) increased knowledge about self-regulation promotion as a strategy for obesity prevention in preschoolers, which will add to the scientific literature; 2) demonstration of the feasibility of an intervention delivered by HS staff and Extension educators; and 3) a research-based, empirically-tested obesity prevention curriculum product appropriate for use by HS and Extension staff. Thus, the study should advance fundamental science as well as translational research by generating new knowledge of the behavioral factors that influence childhood obesity, and by delivering this science to people who serve children through education and extension efforts.</p><p>POPS and POPS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IYS are theory-based, multi-component interventions that have the potential to be sustainable, given that they are being implemented in existing infrastructures and by community-based educators. By providing POPS and IYS in partnership with such agencies, the potential exists to enhance programming nationwide through broad-based dissemination. Analysis of the effective components of the POPS and POPS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IYS interventions may thus have important implications not only for early childhood curricular practices within Head Start but also in other early childhood programs.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>POPS: Preventing Obesity in Preschoolers Series; IYS: Incredible Years Series; USDA: United States Department of Agriculture; NIFA/AFRI: National Institute of Food and Agriculture/Agriculture and Food Research Initiative; HS: Head Start; AAP: American Academy of Pediatrics; ADA: American Dietetic Association; FV: Fruit and vegetable; SSB: Sugar-sweetened beverage; BMI: Body mass index; CDC: Centers for Disease Control; RCT: Randomized controlled trial; UM: University of Michigan; MSU: Michigan State University; MHS: Mental health specialist; 24HR: 24-Hour dietary recall; ATDG: Ability to Delay Gratification.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>ALM, JCL, MAH, HBH, KEP, and DC conceived the project, contributed to the development of the study design and obtained funding, developed the interventions and conceived of the study design, and drafted the manuscript.
