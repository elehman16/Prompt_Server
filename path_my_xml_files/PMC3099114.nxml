Although numerous restorative materials have been tried in order to achieve adequate strength, restore aesthetics, and conserve the remaining tooth structure, a perfectly ideal restorative material has still eluded researchers.</p><p>Dental amalgam is versatile, with clinically acceptable mechanical properties and a long experience associated with its serviceability in the oral environment,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] although it does not strengthen the remaining tooth structure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Other restorative materials such as resin-based composites require conservative cavity preparation to increase the fracture resistance of the teeth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] However, the material shows an inability to achieve tight proximal contacts in the posterior teeth and polymerization shrinkage.</p><p>Thus, many researchers have proposed combined amalgam and composite resin restoration to achieve the advantages of both restorative materials.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Presented a clinical case in which a mandibular premolar was restored with composite and amalgam, to mask the unaesthetic buccal surface of the amalgam restoration; keeping proximal contact with the silver amalgam. Another clinical study in which the maxillary posterior teeth were restored with amalgam and composite, reported that 11 out of 12 restorations scored excellently after 6.4 years.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] A case was reported wherein the mesiobuccal part of the extensively carious premolar was restored with a hybrid composite Z250 and the remainder class II cavity was restored with silver amalgam.</p><p>The study evaluated the clinical performance of combined composite &#x02013; amalgam restorations in extensively carious posterior teeth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>One hundred carious permanent maxillary and mandibular premolars and molars were randomly divided into four groups of twenty-five teeth each. Informed consent was obtained from all the subjects who participated in the clinical research after the nature of the procedure and possible discomforts and risks had been fully explained.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Group A: Hybrid composite Filtek Z250 (3M, ESPE) using self-etch adhesive Adper Prompt (3M, ESPE) and silver amalgam FusionAlloy (Heraeus Kulzer).</p><p>Group B: Posterior packable composite Surefil (Dentsply) using Prime and Bond NT (Dentsply) and silver amalgam FusionAlloy (Heraeus Kulzer).</p><p>Group C: Posterior packable composite Surefil (Dentsply) using Prime and Bond NT (Dentsply).</p><p>Group D: Silver amalgam FusionAlloy (Heraeus Kulzer).</p><p>The combined amalgam&#x02013;composite restorations were divided into two groups (A and B), so as to evaluate the self-etch and total-etch techniques of bonding. Therefore, a composite resin was selected, which corresponded to the same manufacturer as that of the bonding agent used.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study inclusion criteria</title><p>

</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Procedure</title><p>The tooth was photographed and an intraoral periapical radiograph was taken. The procedure was done under rubber dam isolation.</p><p>The cavities were prepared along with the removal of the undermined cusp with carbide fissure burs, at high speed, with water cooling [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The extent and design of the cavity preparation was according to the extent of the carious lesion. The cavity preparation included the occlusal surface, one proximal surface, and buccal and / or lingual / palatal surfaces. The faciolingual width of the cavity was more than one-fourth of the intercuspal distance. The depth of the cavity was determined by the extent of the carious lesion. The gingival margin of the proximal box was kept supragingival. The cavity was not beveled. There was no pulpal exposure in any of the cases. The tooth in which a carious lesion was evident on only one proximal surface was selected. The mesio-occluso-distal cavity was not included in any of the groups. The cusps with undermined enamel were also included in the cavity preparation. However, there was no definite value of depth or intercuspal width of the cavity in any of the cases, because of the complex nature of the cavity design.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Steps in restoring 46 DO with combined composite-amalgam restoration</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCD-14-46-g001"/></fig><p>Group A: The cavity preparation was complex and involved more than two surfaces, that is, the occlusal surface, any one proximal surface, and the buccal and / or lingual / palatal surfaces. The faciolingual width of the cavity was more than one-fourth of the intercuspal distance. The depth and design of the cavity was determined by the extent of the carious lesion. The cusps with undermined enamel were also included in the cavity preparation. Type II glass ionomer cement (Fuji II GC Corporation) was used as a base. A self-etch adhesive Adper Prompt was used as per the manufacturer's instructions. Filtek Z250 was placed in increments to restore the tooth. After restoring the tooth to its proper anatomic form, a class II cavity, for amalgam, was prepared. Using a sectional metal matrix band with a Bitine ring (The Palodent System, Dentsply), the cavity was restored with the silver amalgam FusionAlloy. Occlusal interferences if any, were adjusted. The restoration was polished, and the intraoral periapical radiograph and photograph were taken.</p><p>Group B: The procedure was similar to Group A, except that the prepared cavity was etched with 37% phosphoric acid for 15 seconds, followed by application of bonding agent Prime and Bond NT, which was light cured for 10 seconds. The tooth was restored with composite Surefil using the incremental technique. Next, a conventional class II cavity for amalgam was made and restored with amalgam FusionAlloy, as in Group A.</p><p>Group C: In this Group, the tooth was restored with composite Surefil using the total-etch technique and bonding agent Prime and Bond NT.</p><p>Group D: In this Group, the tooth was restored with silver amalgam FusionAlloy.</p><p>Postoperative instructions were given to the patients. The restorations were evaluated at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 15 months, using the Ryge criteria, for postoperative sensitivity, retention, marginal adaptation, contact and contour, marginal discoloration, and secondary caries [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

Restoring a damaged tooth to its normal form and function is a continuous challenge for the dental profession, especially when the tooth is extensively damaged by caries. Seventy-three out of 100 restorations were examined after 15 months. Three restorations failed in Group D.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Contact and contour</title><p>Combined restorations (Group A - 94.44% and Group B - 88.89%) and amalgam restorations (Group D - 94.11%) showed better results than composite restorations (Group C - 75%), although the difference among the groups was not statistically significant. The findings were concurrent with a study in which the amalgam restorations exhibited an anatomic form (100 and 98%) superior to the composite restorations (79 and 45%) after one and two years.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The results concurred with another study in which 6 and 4% of the cases of inadequate proximal contacts with amalgam and composite restorations, respectively, were reported after three years.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Due to the viscoelastic properties of the resin composites, condensation of the material into the cavity was impossible.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Marginal adaptation</title><p>Combined restorations gave superior marginal adaptation (94.44%), followed by composite (90%) &#x02018;and amalgam (88.23%) restorations.
