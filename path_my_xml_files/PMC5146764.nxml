Clinical reliability and longevity of composite restorations in stress-bearing posterior teeth area depend only when these materials sustain polymerization stress. However, polymerization shrinkage poses a problem leading to volumetric reduction within the material at the restoration-tooth interference.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Polymerization stress results in postoperative sensitivity, marginal staining, microleakage, gap formation, thus imposes its limitations in the application of direct restorations.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Many techniques and newer materials have been introduced to reduce polymerization stress such as incremental layering technique, soft-start polymerization, and use of low modulus of elasticity liner as an intermediary layer between restoration and tooth structure.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>When the remaining dentin thickness is &#x0003c;2 mm, liners are usually applied for pulp protection. Glass-ionomer and flowable composite liners are commonly used between tooth structure and composite restoration. This technique is commonly known as sandwich technique.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Recently introduced nanofilled composites have nanosized filler particles to increase weight percentage of composites. Nanofilled composites have certain advantages such as reduced polymerization shrinkage, increased fracture and wear resistance, and high polish and polish retention in stress-bearing areas. Tetric N-Ceram is one such nanohybrid composite which was introduced a few years back.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Smart dentin replacement (SDR) material is a recently introduced flowable composite which can be used as liner in Class I and Class II restorations. SDR resin provides an approximate 20% reduction in volumetric shrinkage and almost an 80% reduction in polymerization stress compared to a traditional resin system.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>GC Fuji II LC material, a resin-modified glass ionomer, can be used as a liner under the restorations, to reduce to some extent, the polymerization shrinkage stress of composite restorations. Basically, these liners either flowable composite or resin-modified glass ionomer provide better adaptation and act as a flexible stress-absorbing layer between restoration and tooth.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Randomized clinical trials are considered as a gold standard test for measuring the long-term performance of the materials in patients.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Thus, the aim of this randomized clinical trial is to check the clinical performance of nanohybrid composite (Tetric N-Ceram) either with flowable composite liner (SDR) or with resin-modified glass-ionomer liner (GC Fuji II LC).</p><p>The null hypothesis of this study is that there is no difference in clinical performance of Tetric N-Ceram at 12-month period whether it is used with SDR/GC FUJI II LC liner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethical Committee (RC.

At the beginning of the procedure, a block of four numbers was chosen randomly from random number table. In the four-number table, if the first number that was chosen was even, then flowable composite liner was placed in the first tooth based on the order of the tooth and the other tooth received resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (RMGIC) liner. If the number was odd, then RMGIC liner was given to the first tooth and the other tooth received SDR liner. Finally, both the teeth were restored with nanohybrid composite.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Operative procedure</title><p>All operative procedures were performed by the same operator. Before restorative procedures, periapical radiographs of the teeth to be restored were taken. Vitality tests were done using electrical pulp tester. After shade selection, the operative field was isolated with a rubber dam. Cavity design was restricted to eliminate carious lesion using #245 carbide bur (Diatech, Colt&#x000e8;ne/Whaledent) under constant cooling. Application of SDR liner (Dentsply Caulk, Milford, DE, USA), RMGIC liner (GC Fuji II LC, GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and Tetric N-Ceram (Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) composite was placed according to manufacturer's instructions. Details of the materials used are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The composite material was applied using the oblique layering technique, with each layer not exceeding 2 mm. Each layer was cured for 20 s using the LED curing light unit (Bluephase c8; Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan, Liechtenstein) with a light intensity of 800 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. The restorations were contoured using a superfine diamond bur (Diatech, Colt&#x000e8;ne/Whaledent) under an air-water coolant, and finally finishing and polishing of the restorations were done using Soflex discs.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Materials used in this study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCD-19-510-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Outcome evaluations</title><p>In the present study, the primary outcome measure was the clinical performance of the restorations which includes functional and esthetic aspects.

Many <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that the flowable composite liners and RMGIC liners act as a stress-absorbing layer to decrease polymerization shrinkage stress. The concept of stress absorption varies with flowable composite liner and RMGIC liner.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In the literature, clinical trials of Lopes <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Banomyong <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Loguercio <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Burrow and Tyas[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] have evaluated the clinical performance of posterior composites at different time periods. In these studies, they have tested different types of posterior composites with different types of adhesive techniques and tested composites such as Prodigy condensable composite, Filtek Supreme XT, Filtek Z 250, and Filtek Supreme XT, and stated that there is no difference in the clinical performance of composites in the posterior restorations.</p><p>The present randomized clinical trial was designed according to the guidelines of consolidated standards of reporting clinical trials (CONSORT guidelines). The aim of this clinical trial was to test the clinical performance of nanohybrid composite with single adhesive technique but with varying liners. During recent years, nanohybrid composite is gaining popularity because of their advantages such as reduced polymerization shrinkage, fracture and wear resistance, and high polish and polish retention in stress-bearing areas.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>The results of the present study have also shown that the clinical performance of the composite in relation to retention, color match, marginal adaptation, anatomic form, surface roughness, secondary caries, marginal discoloration, and postoperative sensitivity has no significant difference with SDR liner/GC Fuji II LC liner.</p><p>A randomized clinical trial by Banomyong <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Ernst <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] have stated that there is no difference in the clinical performance of composite with or without RMGIC liner/flowable composite liner.</p><p>In the present study, we have employed the study design with two different liners to test the clinical performance of composite, rather than with or without liner as the liners act as stress-absorbing layer to decrease polymerization shrinkage stress. Even our results have shown that there is no difference in the clinical performance of the restoration with RMGIC liner and flowable composite liner. The secondary outcomes such as marginal discoloration, surface roughness, marginal adaptation and anatomic form, and percentage of alpha ratings were more for the flowable composite liner. The more alpha ratings for these outcomes in flowable composite liner group do not have any significant difference in the results. The other secondary outcomes were retention, color match, postoperative sensitivity, and secondary caries; there was no difference in the alpha ratings of either of the groups.</p><p>A study by Burrow and Tyas[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] has stated that there is no significant difference in postoperative sensitivity of a composite restoration with or without RMGIC liner.</p><p>There was only a change in scoring with Bravo scores for surface roughness (5.4%), marginal adaptation (2.7%), anatomic form (5.4%), and marginal discoloration (2.7%) in RMGIC liner group, but this was not a statistically significant difference. All the restorations were clinically admissible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitation of this study, it was concluded that the secondary
