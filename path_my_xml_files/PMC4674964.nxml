Participants were randomized to receive Gla-300 as a standard cartridge formulation in the first treatment period, and as a formulation with enhanced stability through polysorbate-20 addition in the second treatment period, or vice versa.

Day-to-day reproducibility of exposure was high: the between-day within-subject coefficients of variation for total systemic exposure (area under the serum insulin glargine concentration time curve from time 0 to 24 h after dosing) and maximum insulin concentration were 17.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 15&#x02013;21] and 33.4% (95% CI 28&#x02013;41), respectively.

In people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) they replace endogenous insulin, whereas in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) they complement inadequate insulin secretion. The subcutaneous route of administration and once-daily injections, however, preclude the exact reproduction of physiological oscillating insulin secretion patterns. As a compromise, a long-acting insulin product should present with low diurnal fluctuation in exposure and high between-day reproducibility [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Such pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics could help to ensure effective insulin use, allowing accurate dosing and titration and potentially enabling improved glycaemic control while minimizing the risk of hypoglycaemia [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Insulin variability can be assessed using PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) variables, but variability attributable directly to insulin exposure is considered the more accurate measure [<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], as PD variables are influenced by non-insulin-specific factors [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therapeutic doses of basal insulin products are intended to control fasting glucose, whereas the higher basal insulin doses used in experimental settings are similar to lasting prandial insulin effects, overruling the endogenous metabolic equilibrium and requiring high compensatory glucose loads. The strong artificial responses of such high doses are accompanied by high reproducibility according to the sigmoid insulin exposure&#x02013;effect relationship, while therapeutic exposure results in low glucose demand and less reproducibility. In clinical practice, variability in glycaemic control is subject to lifestyle and treatment regimen, and so is only partly reflective of insulin product characteristics.</p><p>Insulin glargine 300 U/ml (Gla-300) has been shown to have more even and prolonged PK and PD profiles compared with glargine 100 U/ml [Gla-100 (Lantus&#x000ae;; Sanofi-Aventis, Frankfurt, Germany)] [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Gla-300 also exhibits a glucose-lowering effect similar to that of Gla-100, with a reduced risk of hypoglycaemia [<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For development purposes, Gla-300 is being investigated with two formulations; a standard formulation for use with insulin pen cartridges and a formulation for use with vials. Insulin pen cartridges remain airtight during use, whereas insulin contained in vials is exposed to the air, potentially affecting the stability of the insulin molecule [<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Polysorbate-20 is therefore added to the vial formulation to enhance stability, but should not affect insulin exposure or activity.</p><p>The aim of the present replicate-dosing study was to assess exposure to Gla-300 at steady-state conditions in people with T1DM and to demonstrate equivalence between formulations at therapeutic doses of 0.4 U/kg/day. This subsequently also allowed the assessment of within- and between-day variability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>The present study was a double-blind, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, crossover euglycaemic clamp study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). The study was performed in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, the Helsinki Declaration and local regulations. The protocol was approved by the ethical review board and all participants provided written informed consent. The study was registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">http://ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> under the number: NCT01838083.</p><p>Participants received 0.4 U/kg Gla-300, dispensed from a vial [with polysorbate-20; test (T)] in one treatment period and from a cartridge [reference (R)] in the other treatment period, in a randomized treatment order. Each treatment was administered as a subcutaneous injection, periumbilically using a 1-ml syringe with 1 U per 10 &#x000b5;l graduation (Beckton, Dickinson and Co., Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA; Product Number 305502). Injections were given by a trained professional once daily, at &#x0223c;20:00 h for 6 days. There was a washout period of 7&#x02013;21 days between consecutive treatment periods.</p><p>The total insulin dose was rounded to the nearest unit. Therefore, if not exactly divisible by 3, the Gla-300 dose needed to be rounded to the nearest graduation mark (1 unit of Gla-300 corresponding to 10/3 &#x000b5;l).</p><p>Participants were to abstain from using other basal or neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulins before and during the 6 days of treatment and the 24-h clamp. The last dose of usual basal insulin was to be taken &#x02265;48 h before first study treatment of Gla-300, and the last dose of NPH insulin was to be taken &#x02265;24 h before the start of Gla-300 treatment. Between discontinuing basal or NPH insulins and the first study dose of Gla-300, only short-acting subcutaneous insulins were to be used. All participants were instructed to adjust their own prandial insulin and caloric load, as needed according to blood glucose measurements and closely supported by the treating physician, on days 1&#x02013;5 and until 10:00 h on day 6. Participants were instructed to fast from 10:00 h on day 6, &#x0223c;10 h before administration of Gla-300.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Participants</title><p>The study enrolled men and women (n = 50) aged 18&#x02013;64 years with T1DM (duration &#x02265;1 year) as defined by the American Diabetes Association [<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] who were otherwise healthy. Inclusion criteria included total insulin dose &#x0003c;1.2 U/kg/day, basal insulin dose &#x02265;0.2 U/kg/day, body weight between 50 and 110 kg, body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, fasting negative serum C-peptide concentration &#x0003c;0.3 nmol/l, glycated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) concentration &#x02264;9% (&#x02264;75 mmol/mol) and a stable insulin regimen for at least 2 months before study inclusion. Key exclusion criteria included any history or presence of another clinically relevant disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Euglycaemic Clamp Procedure</title><p>On day 6 of each treatment period, participants underwent a 24-h euglycaemic clamp using the Biostator&#x02122; device (MTB Medizintechnik, Amstetten, Germany). Participants were attached to the Biostator &#x0223c;5 h before receiving medication (&#x0223c;15:00 h). Blood glucose level was adjusted to within a pre-clamp target of 4.4&#x02013;6.7 mmol/l (80&#x02013;120 mg/dl) by intravenous infusions of insulin glulisine (Apidra; Sanofi, Paris, France) and glucose. Infusions of glulisine were discontinued at least 30 min before administration of Gla-300. Prior to clamp start, the majority of participants required glucose infusion to reach the clamp target, in line with the mild hyperinsulinaemia caused by the previous fixed daily doses of Gla-300, which were slightly above participants' usual basal insulin dose. Rescue insulin (insulin glulisine) was to be given if blood glucose levels exceeded 13.9 mmol/l (250 mg/l) for &#x0003e;30 min, although this did not occur for any participant.</p><p>Serum insulin glargine concentration (INS) was determined using a validated radioimmunoassay with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 5.02 &#x000b5;U/ml [30.1 pmol/l (1 &#x000b5;U/ml = 6 pmol/l)]. Blood samples to assess insulin concentrations were collected 4 h before dosing, immediately pre-dose (time 0) and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20 and 24 h after glargine administration. To exclude falsely high pre-dose values attributable to residual prandial insulin contribution, insulin concentration values at time 0 were replaced by values obtained 24 h after injection of study medication, for statistical inferences and visualization of profiles.</p><p>To characterize Gla-300 pharmacologically in this study, an automated clamp was chosen over a manual clamp. Automated clamps establish tight glucose control and provide a bias-free assessment of glucose utilization, but the more frequent measurement of blood glucose levels and adjustment of glucose delivery compared with a manual clamp results in greater minute-by-minute variability of the glucose infusion rate (GIR); this requires mathematical smoothing techniques in order to visualize a glucodynamic profile.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Assessments</title><p>The INS profiles were characterized according to the area under the INS time curve from time 0 to 24 h post dosing (INS-AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>), the time to 50% of INS-AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>, as well as maximum INS concentration (INS-C<sub>max</sub>). Body-weight-standardized GIR profiles were characterized by the area under the unsmoothed GIR time curve from time 0 to 24 h post dosing (GIR-AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>), the time to 50% of GIR-AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub> and the maximum of the body-weight-standardized smoothed GIR profiles (GIR<sub>max</sub>).

For one participant under treatment R, all serum insulin concentrations were below the LLOQ, therefore, the total number of evaluable profiles for PK analysis was 99 (n = 49 for R and n = 50 for T).</p><p>The mean (s.d.) injected doses were 31.62 (5.03) and 31.68 (5.10) U, for treatment R and treatment T, respectively, after accounting for rounding.</p><p>Apart from two participants presenting with transitional dawn phenomena in both clamps and a further three in one clamp, blood glucose control aiming for 5.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl) was tight, with a median individual average of 5.6 mmol/l (101 mg/dl) at a median individual CV% of 6.4%. On average, participants' blood glucose levels remained &#x02264;5.8 mmol/l (105 mg/dl) for the full 24 h (median). The dose of 0.4 U/kg was well adjusted to the participants' needs, as attested by the low glucose demand of only 1.27 mg/kg/min (in total, a mean of 145 g glucose per participant was used during 24 h).</p><p>One participant had a very low GIR-AUC at sizeable INS values in one treatment period, with good blood glucose control; these data were included in the analyses as pre-specified. A second participant had no detectable INS at sizeable GIR values in one period, before (4 h pre-dose and time 0) as well as after Gla-300 administration, presumably as a result of technical issues; these INS values were set to missing, while otherwise INS values &#x0003c;LLOQ were set to zero for statistical inferences and visualization of profiles.</p></sec><sec><title>Bioequivalence: Reproducibility Between Formulations</title><p>For both systemic exposure to Gla-300 and its metabolic effect, bioequivalence between the two treatments was established, as the 90% CIs for the ratio of T : R were within the predefined 0.80&#x02013;1.25 range (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Equivalence of insulin glargine 300 U/ml formulations in exposure and activity</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">T (Gla-300 + polysorbate-20)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">R (Gla-300)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Point estimate (90% CI)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Variable</bold></td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Geometric mean</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Treatment ratio: T : R</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">INS-AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>, &#x000b5;U.h/ml</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">270</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">273</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.00 (0.95&#x02013;1.06)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">INS-C<sub>max</sub>, &#x000b5;U/ml</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.02 (0.91&#x02013;1.14)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GIR-AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>, mg/kg</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1531</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1495</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.02 (0.87&#x02013;1.20)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Median</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Hodges-Lehman shift: T &#x02212; R</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">T<sub>50%</sub>-INS-AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>, h</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.7</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.23 (0.01&#x02013;0.46)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">T<sub>50%</sub>-GIR-AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>, h</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0.33 (&#x02212;1.04 to 0.38)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Gla-300, insulin glargine 300 U/ml; CI, confidence interval; INS, serum insulin glargine concentration; INS-AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>, area under the INS time curve from time 0 to 24 h post dosing; INS-C<sub>max</sub>, maximum INS; GIR, glucose infusion rate; GIR-AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>, area under the GIR time curve from time 0 to 24 h post dosing; GIR<sub>max</sub>, maximum GIR (based on individually smoothed profiles, LOESS factor 0.06); T, test treatment; R, reference treatment.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Fluctuation: Within-Day Variability</title><p>The PK and PD profiles for each treatment period are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>, and profiles for each participant are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2</xref>.

Clinical experience with basal insulin supplementation stipulated the design of long-acting insulin products with the most even supply profile possible. Ideally, this low diurnal fluctuation should be accompanied by high day-to-day reproducibility, should allow flexibility in the preferred once-daily dosing interval, and yet should still allow quick dose adjustments. Gla-300 aims to achieve these goals. The more sustained activity beyond 24-h with Gla-300 versus Gla-100, and the short time to steady state, are reported elsewhere [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The present study demonstrated bioequivalence of two Gla-300 formulations in terms of PK and PD variables, showing that whether people administer Gla-300 using a vial and syringe, or using an insulin pen, the injected insulin has the same effect. In addition, the crossover design of this equivalence study allowed aspects of variability to be assessed.</p><p>Successful treatment with basal insulin products can be adversely affected by variability in glucose response resulting from variability in insulin supply in terms of large diurnal fluctuations and low reproducibility. Although insulin variability can be measured both in terms of exposure (PK) and metabolic effect (PD), only insulin concentrations are a direct measure of variability attributable to the insulin product [<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The PD response, by contrast, reflects not only the availability of insulin, but largely the within-subject variability in insulin sensitivity and demand, as well as the smoothing algorithm required to visualize the demand profile [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, PD response is not perfectly synchronized with changes in observed insulin concentrations [<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], as displayed by the subtle difference between ratios of INS- and GIR-AUC fractions in this and previous studies [<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Foremost, the results of this study suggest that a therapeutic dose of Gla-300 confers a low level of fluctuation at a high level of reproducibility in exposure, in steady-state conditions in people with T1DM. The bidirectional fluctuation in exposure around the average concentration of 11.3 &#x000b5;U/ml [68 pmol/l; close to a physiological 10 &#x000b5;U/ml (60 pmol/l)] was 3.3 &#x000b5;U/ml (20 pmol/l), which is reflected in a peak-to-trough fluctuation [as defined by the calculation (INS-C<sub>max</sub> &#x02212; INS-C<sub>min</sub>)/INS-C<sub>avg</sub>] of 0.6. This is less than the 1.6 observed with Gla-100 (calculated from a previous study [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]) and similar to the values that can be estimated for insulin degludec [<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and PEG-lispro [<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], assessed in similar studies.</p><p>The fairly even distribution of Gla-300 exposure over 24-h sees the weakly expressed maxima within the first 6 h, in line with a shift from &#x0223c;12 h for the first injection due to accumulation towards steady-state supply within 3&#x02013;4 days. Using a different retarding principle (formation of multi-hexamer complexes upon subcutaneous injection and subsequent binding to plasma albumin), insulin degludec is reported to show a similar even distribution of exposure and activity at steady state in people with T2DM [<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and T1DM [<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In a study of people with T2DM, Heise et al. [<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported an almost equal distribution (12-h fractions) of insulin degludec activity over 24 h at steady state, irrespective of dose (GIR-AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12</sub>/GIR-AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub> of 0.49, 0.53 and 0.50 at 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 U/kg), at exposure ratios (INS-AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12</sub>/INS-AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>) of 0.53 for all doses. In contrast, the 6-h fractions of total activity showed considerable variability (0.27, 0.22, 0.20 and 0.31) for a therapeutic dose of 0.4 U/kg, while the two higher doses present fractions that are more strongly aligned. Corresponding 6-h fractions of insulin degludec activity in people with T1DM maintained a fairly constant distribution across doses, but with the majority of activity apparently occurring between 6 and 18 h [<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Recently, a study comparing Gla-100 with a long-acting insulin product using hydrodynamic size as the absorption retarding principle, with strong albumin binding (PEG-lispro; LY2605541), presented Gla-100 activity with 0.25 for the first 6 h, declining to 0.17 for the 18&#x02013;24-h fraction, while PEG-lispro activity increased from 0.18 to 0.24 over the same time periods [<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Similarly, in Trial 1993 comparing insulin degludec with insulin glargine, most of the insulin glargine activity was observed in the first 12&#x02013;18 h after dosing (31, 29 and 23% for the first three 6-h periods, respectively, then declining to 17% from 18 to 24 h) [<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. By comparison, Gla-300 presents with sustained, and thus more evenly distributed, activity over 24 h compared with Gla-100. This is in line with a previous study showing that Gla-300 has more even PK and PD profiles than Gla-100, with a reduced swing in insulin concentrations [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the present study, within-day variability (fluctuation) in insulin exposure with Gla-300 was low over the entire 24-h period, and the swing was similar to that previously reported [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This low diurnal fluctuation in insulin exposure is expected to be of clinical relevance by reducing an individual's risk of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia. It is possible that a reduced hypoglycaemic risk may alleviate the fear of such episodes, helping to remove one of the main barriers to glycaemic management [<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>It should be noted that, although an even distribution of glucose utilization also suggests low fluctuation in activity, assessing this latter variable requires prior smoothing of raw data profiles by predefined algorithms, which can render the results arbitrary. Applying a conservative LOESS smoothing procedure (such as a factor of 0.06) to visualize GIR profiles therefore results in greater fluctuation compared with stronger smoothing.</p><p>The low variability in exposure with Gla-300 is related to the mechanism of protraction. The PK results indicate that, compared with Gla-100, Gla-300 has a more gradual and prolonged release of insulin glargine from the subcutaneous depot at the injection site [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The resulting apparent extended terminal half-life (INS-t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub>) of 17&#x02013;19 h confers accumulation of steady-state concentrations within 3&#x02013;4 days with Gla-300, compared with 2 days for Gla-100 with an INS-t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> of 12 h, flattening the exposure profile. In addition to demonstrating the low within-day fluctuation of Gla-300, the present study also shows that the between-day (within-subject) variability in total exposure to Gla-300 (CV% of INS-AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>) was numerically lower, at 17.4%, than previously demonstrated for Gla-100 in a similarly designed study [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In a clinical setting, high reproducibility would be a major advantage when titrating an individual's insulin dose, owing to a more predictable insulin exposure.</p><p>As expected, the reproducibility of PD variability was lower than that of PK variability, demonstrated by the between-day within-subject CV% values. It has previously been shown [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] that the glucodynamic response variability of clinically relevant doses in modestly hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp experiments is approximately twice that of the PK variability. This observation is confirmed by replicate studies in T1DM with rapid-acting insulin analogue products at 0.3 U/kg<sub>,</sub> presenting a PK variability of 7% at a PD variability of 17% (data not shown).</p><p>The latter observation also indicates that shifting the activity towards the linear portion of the insulin exposure&#x02013;effect relationship, as demonstrated with rapid-acting analogue products, reduces the impact of individual between-day differences in the metabolic state and lowers variability <italic>per se</italic>. Measuring and comparing PD variability is therefore prone to confounding from factors not related to insulin release, and so these results must be interpreted carefully.</p><p>For example, a recent study compared PD variability between insulin degludec and insulin glargine in people with T1DM [<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The results of that study suggested that insulin degludec was associated with a reduction in PD variability compared with Gla-100, using parameters derived from GIR profiles. Notably, the average glucose utilization was higher with insulin degludec. A previous study of Gla-100 in healthy individuals reported CV% values for GIR-AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub> and GIR<sub>max</sub> of 34 and 36%, similar to the 35 and 28% seen in the present study with Gla-300 in T1DM, rather than the 82 and 60% reported by Heise et al. [<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition to differing study populations, limitations of such comparisons lie in the different study designs used; parallel rather than crossover in the degludec trial, and quadruplicate [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] versus triplicate [<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] or duplicate readings (in the present study).</p><p>The strengths of the present study include: the fact that the euglycaemic clamp was performed under steady-state conditions, reflecting real life more closely than a single-dose scenario; the inclusion of only individuals with T1DM who had negligible endogenous insulin production, which might otherwise have interfered with PK measurements; and the calculation of variability derived directly from insulin exposure. The main limitation of the study relates to the experimental clamp setting, as it is difficult to extrapolate such results directly to blood glucose variation experienced by people with diabetes in clinical practice; however, the results reported are consistent with previous studies of Gla-300 showing less glycaemic excursion and lower within-subject variability [<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], as well as equivalent glycaemic control with less hypoglycaemia [<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], compared with Gla-100.</p><p>In summary, once-daily administration of Gla-300 at a therapeutic dose of 0.4 U/kg provides predictable and evenly distributed 24-h coverage, owing to low diurnal fluctuation in insulin glargine exposure at a high level of between-day reproducibility.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Medical writing and editorial assistance were provided by Simon Rees at Fishawack Communications Ltd and this service was supported by Sanofi.</p><p>These data were previously published in abstract form at the 74th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association, 13&#x02013;17 June 2014 and the 50th Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, 15&#x02013;19 September 2014, Vienna, Austria.</p></ack><sec><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>R.
