Across studies, both doses of prucalopride were statistically superior to placebo on the primary endpoint defined as an average of 3 or more spontaneous, complete bowel movements (SCBMs) per week over the treatment period. There were also significant benefits of prucalopride on other measures, including patient-reported outcome measures (e.g., satisfaction with treatment and with bowel movements, physical and psychosocial discomfort).

The study consisted of a 2-week drug-free screening/run-in phase, a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment phase, and a post-treatment follow-up 7 days following last dose of study drug.</p><p>The purpose of the screening/run-in phase (Visit 1) was to confirm patient&#x02019;s eligibility for the study. The investigator completed screening assessments. Patients were instructed to stop all laxative intakes, not to change their diet or lifestyle, and given a diary to note the date and time of their bowel movements (BMs) and record the consistency of each BM using the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFC), the need to strain while defecating, and the sensation of complete evacuation. If a colonoscopy was performed at Visit 1, patients waited 1&#x02013;4 weeks before starting the daily diary, and at least 3 weeks elapsed between Visits 1 and 2 for these patients. If the definition of constipation was not met during the run-in phase, the patient was ineligible for the treatment phase.</p><p>The double-blind treatment phase consisted of five visits every 2&#x02013;4 weeks (Weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12) over a 12-week period. Patients took the first dose of study drug on the first day after Visit 2 and then took one tablet daily before breakfast during the treatment period.</p><p>Patients recorded study drug and rescue medication dosing information and information related to bowel movements in a daily diary throughout the study. Patients completed efficacy assessments and questionnaires at specified visits and the investigator provided a global assessment of efficacy of treatment. Safety was monitored throughout the study. The end-of-treatment/early withdrawal visit was performed at Week 12 or at the time a patient withdraws from the study. A telephone post-treatment follow-up contact (or optional study visit, at the discretion of the investigator) was conducted for all patients approximately 7 days after the last dose of study drug to complete the evaluations.</p><p>The study was approved by the Independent Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board and was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, consistent with Good Clinical Practices, and applicable regulatory requirements. All the patients provided written informed consent before entering the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Study participants</title><p>Men and women aged 18&#x02013;65 years with a history of CC were eligible for the study. A history of CC for &#x02265;6 months before the screening visit was required to enter the run-in phase, and those who met the criteria during the 2-week run-in were eligible for randomization. History of CC was defined as follows: (i) &#x02264;2 spontaneous BMs (SBMs) per week on average, and (ii) &#x02265;1 of the following in &#x0003e;25% of BMs: very hard and/or hard stools, sensation of incomplete evacuation, straining at defecation, sensation of ano-rectal obstruction or blockade, or a need for digital manipulation to facilitate evacuation. These criteria were not met if SBM was preceded within 24 h by the intake of a laxative agent or by the use of an enema. Patients who never had SBMs were considered to be constipated. Constipation needed to be functional with no secondary causes of CC.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included the following: drug-induced constipation, patients suffering from secondary causes of chronic constipation, including endocrine, metabolic, or neurological disorders, surgical obstruction, megacolon/megarectum, or diagnosis of pseudo-obstruction. Other exclusion criteria were uncontrolled cardiovascular, liver and lung diseases, impaired renal function (serum creatinine &#x0003e;180 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), and clinically significant abnormal laboratory values.</p></sec><sec><title>Study drug and rescue medication</title><p>The trial medication, prucalopride or matching placebo, was provided by the sponsor. The film-coated tablets for oral administration contained prucalopride succinate equivalent to 2 mg prucalopride base. During the 12-week treatment phase, prucalopride tablets or matching placebo were taken orally in the morning before breakfast or in the morning if no breakfast. Bisacodyl (5, 10, or 15 mg) was allowed as a rescue medication if the patient did not have a BM for &#x02265;3 consecutive days. If the investigator decided to prescribe bisacodyl, and the dose was insufficient, an increase in dose was allowed up to a maximum single dose of 15 mg day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. If no BMs were passed after an increase in the amount of bisacodyl, an enema could have been administered. No bisacodyl was to be taken or enemas used within 48 h before or after the first dose of study drug. Patients recorded study drug and rescue medication usage in a daily diary throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy evaluations</title><p>Efficacy evaluations were based on information recorded in the patient daily diary and their global evaluation on changes of consistency of stool, severity of constipation, and efficacy of treatment, and the investigator&#x02019;s global assessment on efficacy of treatment.</p><p>Patients kept a daily diary during the study and recorded the following information: date and time of the intake of study drug; date and time a BM was produced and consistency of the stool, degree of straining, feeling of complete evacuation after a BM was passed; and date and time of the intake of bisacodyl and number of tablets, or use of enema.</p><p>The patient recorded the severity of symptoms occurring during the 2 weeks preceding the visit using the Patient Assessment of Constipation-Symptom questionnaire (PAC-SYM) and Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life questionnaire (PAC-QOL).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28"><sup>28</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29"><sup>29</sup></xref> The PAC-SYM contains three subscales: stool symptoms (five items), abdominal symptoms (four items), and rectal symptoms (three items). The PAC-QOL is a self-administered questionnaire for patients with constipation. The PAC-QOL contains 28 items within four subscales: physical discomfort (four items), psychosocial discomfort (eight items), worries and concerns (11 items), and satisfaction (five items). Changes (deteriorations or improvements) in symptoms captured by the PAC-SYM or PAC-QOL were not considered adverse events unless determined to be so by the investigator.</p><p>The investigator reviewed the patient daily diary and global evaluation on changes of consistency of stool, severity of constipation, and efficacy of treatment and then completed the global evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy endpoints</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients with an average of 3 or more SCBMs per week (Responders) during the entire 12-week double-blind treatment phase. The key secondary endpoint was the percentage of responders during the first 4 weeks of the double-blind treatment phase. Other secondary efficacy endpoints include percentage of patients with an average increase of &#x02265;1 SCBM per week over 12-week study treatment period, percentages and averages change of bowel movements based on data collected on the diaries, time (days) to first SCBM after first intake of trial medication, changes from baseline in patient&#x02019;s global assessments and PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL, and the investigator&#x02019;s global assessment on efficacy of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Treatment-emergent adverse events were monitored throughout the study. Physical examinations, 12-lead ECG recordings, and routine laboratory tests (hematology/biochemistry/urinalysis) were performed at Visits 1, 4, and 6, or at early withdrawal. Vital signs and body weight were measured at each visit.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical Methods</title><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Sample size estimation was based on the assumption that between-treatment difference in the primary endpoint was 12.3% (with 15% responders from the placebo group and 27.3% from the 2 mg group in the Asian population). A sample size of 237 patients per group was required to detect this difference with approximately 90% power (for a 2-sided test at 5% significance level). If approximately 5% of patients had insufficient diary data to be evaluated for the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set, 250 patients randomized to each treatment groups would be sufficient. The ITT analysis set included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug and was used for efficacy and safety data analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups (prucalopride or placebo) based on a computer-generated randomization schedule generated by the sponsor before the study. Randomization was balanced by using permuted blocks and stratified by investigator/country and run-in status of severity of constipation (i.e., &#x0003c;1 SBM and &#x02265;1 and &#x02264;2 SBM per week at baseline). The block size in randomization was unknown to the investigator sites and study team. Study drug was packaged and labeled based on the randomization schedule and treatment code. Treatment code for the patient was kept blind to the investigator. To maintain study blind, the study drug container had a multipart label and study drug information was not included.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy analysis</title><p>The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with an average of 3 or more SCBMs per week (responders) during the entire 12-week treatment phase. A Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared test for general association between the treatment and response during the treatment phase was performed controlling for effects of investigator/country and baseline severity of constipation. The baseline severity of constipation was defined as &#x02018;more severe&#x02019; if the patient had &#x0003c;1 SBM per week and as &#x02018;less severe&#x02019; if the patient had &#x02265;1 and &#x02264;2 SBMs per week at baseline. The between-treatment difference in percent of responders and the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference were estimated. Similar statistical analysis methods were applied in the analysis of the key secondary endpoint (responders during first 4 weeks of treatment) and other dichotomous variables, such as the number (%) of patients with average increase of &#x02265;1 SCBM per week, number (%) of patients rating their treatment as extremely or quite a bit effective, and other rates.</p><p>For continuous variables, an analysis of covariance (<sc>ancova</sc>) model with treatment, baseline severity of constipation, and investigator/country as factors and the baseline value as the covariate was used to assess the treatment effect as measured by the changes from baseline in the variable. The Van Elteren test controlling for investigator/country and baseline severity of constipation was used to assess the effect of treatment for the ordinal categorical variables. Time to first SCBM after first intake of trial medication was analyzed with the methods for survival data; Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimates were used to describe the distribution and the Log-rank test was performed for the between-treatment group comparison.</p><p>Odds ratio and the 95% CI for the placebo and prucalopride groups were estimated to assess the association between the response and several assessments: subjects&#x02019; evaluation of treatment as effective (&#x02018;quite a bit&#x02019; or &#x02018;extremely&#x02019; effective), improvement &#x02265;1 on PAC-SYM, and improvement &#x02265;1 on PAC-QOL Overall Score.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety analyses</title><p>Safety was evaluated by examining the incidence and types of adverse events, and changes in clinical laboratory test values, physical examination results, 12-lead ECGs, and vital sign measurements from the screening phase through study completion. Baseline was the last evaluation performed before study drug administration. Descriptive statistics of corrected QT (QTc) intervals and changes from baseline were summarized at each scheduled time point to detect individual QTc changes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>A total of 774 patients were screened at 46 sites in five countries/regions, and 501 patients randomized to placebo or prucalopride treatment arms took at least one dose of study drug and were included in the ITT population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). A total of 462 patients (92.2%) completed the double-blind treatment phase with a discontinuation rate of 7.8%.

The occurrence of prespecified treatment-emergent adverse events of interest (palpitations, cardiovascular ischemic events, QT prolongation, cardiac arrhythmias, and pregnancy-associated events) occurred at a similar low rate in the prucalopride and placebo groups.</p><p>In the prucalopride group, only one of the serious adverse events was considered possibly related to study drug (ECG signs of myocardial ischemia). In the placebo group, one serious event (intrauterine death) was assessed as possibly related to study drug and another (erysipelas) was assessed as doubtfully related. All serious events had resolved or were resolving, except for the event of intrauterine death in the placebo group which occurred after the completion of study. No deaths were reported during this study.</p><p>In the prucalopride group, the most common adverse event leading to study drug withdrawal was diarrhea. The adverse events leading to discontinuation in the prucalopride group resolved, with the exception of lichen planus which was ongoing as of final follow-up. In each treatment group, one serious adverse event led to study drug discontinuation (ECG signs of myocardial ischemia in prucalopride; dizziness in placebo).</p><p>The findings for hematology and blood chemistry analytes, pulse rate, blood pressure, and ECG parameters were generally similar in the placebo and prucalopride groups. Among patients in the placebo group with normal baseline values, four patients had an abnormally low postbaseline heart rate and three had an abnormally elevated PR interval postbaseline. Patients with prolonged QTcB and QTcF intervals were similar in the placebo and prucalopride groups. Few patients in either treatment group had a prolonged QTcB or QTcF classification value at Week 4 or Week 12. No patient receiving prucalopride had a normal baseline value and an abnormal value on any postbaseline heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval, or QT interval (see Supporting Information).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the 2 mg dose of prucalopride administered once-daily in patients with CC from the Asia-Pacific region. The therapeutic benefit of prucalopride <italic>vs</italic> placebo was demonstrated on the primary and secondary measures of efficacy. A significantly higher percentage of patients receiving prucalopride achieved normalization of BMs, defined as an average of 3 or more SCBMs per week, over the 12-week treatment period. This clinically meaningful treatment effect was consistently seen regardless of patient&#x02019;s gender (male, female), age (18&#x02013;40 and 41&#x02013;65 years), race (Asian, non-Asian), and prior laxative/enema use. The subgroup analysis of the male patient data was based on a relatively small sample size (approximately 10% of the patients), so interpretation should be made with caution. Further research to confirm the efficacy of prucalopride in male patients with chronic constipation is currently on-going in Europe. Once-daily administration of prucalopride showed a rapid onset of action and the treatment effects were maintained throughout the treatment period. The therapeutic benefit of prucalopride was also demonstrated by an average increase of &#x02265;1 SCBM per week, reduced use of rescue laxative/enema, improved constipation-related bowel symptoms, and enhanced quality of life.</p><p>Prucalopride was safe and well tolerated in patients in the Asia-Pacific region, and the study did not reveal any unexpected safety findings among treatment-emergent adverse events, laboratory values, vital sign measurements, or ECG recordings. Most adverse events were reported as mild or moderate in severity and were transient, and assessed by the investigators as not related to study drug. A low percentage of patients had adverse events that led to study discontinuation. The findings were generally similar in the placebo and prucalopride groups for all hematology and blood chemistry analytes, pulse rate and blood pressure, and ECG parameters. Prucalopride treatment was not associated with QTc prolongation. One patient without cardiovascular disease history was diagnosed with heart ischemia on ECG with no symptoms from the protocol-specified ECG at Day 28. The patient was seen by a cardiologist who indicated that the ECG change was only a non-specific T-wave abnormality but not significant, and did not require treatment. The investigator assessed this event as mild in intensity and possibly related to study drug.</p><p>This study was modeled after three identical double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal studies that enrolled patients with CC predominantly from Western populations and treated them with prucalopride at daily doses of 2 or 4 mg for 12 weeks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18 b19 b20"><sup>18&#x02013;20</sup></xref> The primary results of these three pivotal studies have been summarized in review articles of prucalopride as a treatment for constipation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p>Across the three pivotal studies, treatment with prucalopride 2 or 4 mg resulted in a significantly higher proportion of patients with normalization of BMs compared with placebo. Over the 12-week treatment period, 23.6% of patients receiving prucalopride 2 mg achieved &#x02265;3 SCBMs per week compared to 11.3% of placebo patients (pooled population). The beneficial effect of treatment was evident over the first 4 weeks and was maintained over the 12 weeks of the study. All three pivotal studies showed a statistically significant and consistent effect on a wide range of secondary endpoints that assess clinically relevant aspects of CC. The 2-mg dose provided comparable efficacy to the 4-mg dose for all efficacy parameters. Both 2 and 4 mg prucalopride were safe and well tolerated with no unexpected safety findings among treatment-emergent adverse events, laboratory values, vital sign measurements, or ECG recordings.</p><p>In summary, the overall efficacy and safety of prucalopride 2 mg as a treatment for CC appear similar for patients from the Asia-Pacific region and from Western populations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30"><sup>30</sup></xref> Ethnicity shows the potential to affect a drug&#x02019;s efficacy and safety profile, possibly as a result of pharmacokinetic and pharmacologic variations,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25"><sup>25</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26"><sup>26</sup></xref> this does not appear to be the case with prucalopride treatment for constipation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16"><sup>16</sup></xref></p><p>The aforementioned studies of prucalopride evaluated treatment for CC over 12 weeks. Patients who completed the three pivotal studies were invited to continue prucalopride treatment in two open-label, long-term, follow-up studies with similar design, and the pooled results show that the improvements in patient satisfaction with bowel movements and treatment, as observed after 4 and 12 weeks of double-blind treatment, was maintained for at least 18 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21"><sup>21</sup></xref> Based on an experience of 1464 patient-years exposure to prucalopride, 41&#x02013;50% of patients did not need laxatives in addition to prucalopride treatment to maintain satisfactory control of CC. Future studies may be beneficial to further evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of prucalopride.</p><p>The patients enrolled in this study had chronic disease and were dissatisfied with their previous treatment. Approximately 60% of patients had a history of constipation for greater than 10 years, and over half of the patients reported no adequate relief of their constipation with the use of laxatives and enemas. The majority of patients were women (90%), which is indicative of the higher prevalence of CC in women and the fact that women are more likely to consult their physician.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9"><sup>9</sup></xref> The therapeutic benefit of prucalopride as a prokinetic for constipation treatment occurred in women and men and other subgroups (e.g., age, race, prior laxative/enema).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In patients in the Asia-Pacific region with CC, prucalopride 2 mg given once-daily significantly improved bowel function, associated symptoms, and satisfaction in CC over a 12-week treatment period. Prucalopride was safe and well tolerated by patients in the Asia-Pacific region.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contribution</title><p>MK contributed to the conception and design of the research and assisted in protocol development; all authors were involved in the acquisition of data or analysis and interpretation of data, and were involved in the initial drafting of the manuscript.
