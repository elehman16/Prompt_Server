Testosterone (T) regulates nitric oxide synthase and is necessary to achieve an optimum response to PDE5 inhibitors. In the present study, we determined whether T replacement in men with low T levels receiving tadalafil to treat LUTS improved the response of tadalafil on LUTS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The present 12-week study was a randomized parallel study of clinical outcomes in men aged &#x02265;40 years with symptomatic BPH (IPSS &#x02265;12), prostate volumes &#x02265;30 mL, and testosterone levels less than 300 ng/dl. Eligible patients received a combination of tadalafil 5 mg once daily and placement of a transdermal gel containing 10 g T (n=44), or tadalafil alone (n=46). The primary outcomes were post-treatment IPSS, peak urinary flow rate, and post-void residual urine volume (PVR). Secondary outcomes were changes in IIEF-EF domain scores, Global Assessment Questionnaire (GAQ) scores, and Life Satisfaction Checklist (LSC) scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The extent of IPSS improvement from baseline to 12 weeks was the same in both groups (tadalafil+T &#x02013;5.2 <italic>vs.</italic> tadalafil &#x02013;5.0; P=0.634). Also, the changes in Q(max) and PVR from baseline were very similar in both groups. However, the tadalafil+T group showed a significantly greater change from baseline in the IPSS storage subscore, the IPSS-QoL score, and the IIEF-EF domain score. The tadalafil+T group showed significantly greater improvements in GAQ and LSC scores, as compared to the tadalafil-only group. The adverse event profiles of each group were similar to those of previous reports.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Tadalafil plus testosterone was superior to tadalafil alone in improving LUTS in men with BPH/LUTS and low testosterone levels. Further study is needed with more number of patients and longer duration study for support of present study.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords: </title><kwd>Lower urinary tract symptoms</kwd><kwd>benign prostatic hyperplasia</kwd><kwd>post-void residual urine volume</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
