This is a two-group, four-stage (assessment, planning, administration, and evaluation) and multivariable study with a before, immediately after, and 3 months after intervention design. Sampling in assessment stage was conducted through census sampling in which 100 women under coverage of well-being center and vulnerable women counseling centers were selected. Inclusion criteria were: Having at least one condition of being on methadone for cessation of addiction or prostitution, having complete consciousness, not taking psychotropic medications, being interested in participating in the study, age group between 18 and 49 years, having at least primary school education, and ability to answer the questions and discuss in educational classes. Absence in more than two sessions of educational classes, loss of interest to continue with the study, and being poisoned were considered as the exclusion criteria. Data were collected by a researcher-made questionnaire containing demographic characteristics (age, age at first marriage, age at the first sexual experience, level of education, and residence status) and a questionnaire assessing women's knowledge (24 items), attitude (12 items), and practice (12 items) about STDs. After literature review and primary designing, its content validity and reliability were confirmed by 10 experts pre-test and pos<italic>t</italic>-test with a 1-week interval and by 15 vulnerable women, respectively. Cronbach alpha was adopted for internal consistency of the questionnaire. It was 0.829 for knowledge, 0.796 for attitude, and 0.834 for practice. In the domain of knowledge, which had the options of &#x0201c;yes,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;no,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;no idea,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; was scored 1, and &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;no idea&#x0201d; were scored zero, with total scores ranging between 0 and 24. To have more clear results, the scores were multiplied by 100 and divided by 24 to obtain scores between 0 and 100. In the domain of attitude, the items were scored by a five-point Likert's scale (absolutely agree = 4 and absolutely disagree = 0) ranging between 0 and 48. The scores were converted to 0&#x02013;100 criterion for more convenience of understanding. In the domain of practice, there were three options of &#x0201c;I never do&#x0201d; (0), &#x0201c;I sometimes do&#x0201d; (1), and &#x0201c;I always do&#x0201d; (2), ranging between 0 and 24, which were converted to 0&#x02013;100 for more clarity. To measure subjects&#x02019; behavior change, the mean scores of knowledge, attitude, and practice concerning STDs were calculated in the intervention stage and were divided by 3 so that behavior change (outcomes of knowledge, attitude, and practice) was obtained.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Firstly, the researcher was introduced to the vice-chancellery for research and the vice-chancellery for health (communicable diseases department) as well as to Isfahan well-being organization, and after taking a written introduction letter, was referred to vulnerable women's counseling centers no. 1 and 2 authorities under coverage of vice-chancellery for health and to the authorities of Isfahan social security services office under coverage of well-being organization. Researcher explained the research goals to them. It there was needs assessment, the authorities were asked whether an identical education or a needs assessment-based education was conducted. Researcher's educational content was based on needs assessment. Based on Orem model, in the first stage (assessment), subjects&#x02019; needs concerning behaviors leading to STDs in the three domains of knowledge, attitude, and practice were determined and prioritized. In the second stage (planning), content of self-care need-based educational program was designed. It included women's anatomy and physiology, men's anatomy and physiology, function of uterine in menstruation and pregnancy and condition of having sex in this period, healthy and high-risk behaviors, post rape interventions, familiarization with types of contamination and transmission ways, diagnosis, and individuals&#x02019; care and treatment in STDs. In the third stage (administration), education and intervention were conducted from Jan 2014 to Oct 2014. Before intervention, during completion of personal characteristics, and knowledge, attitude, and practice concerning STD questionnaires, the time of administration and the subject and content of educational program were explained to the subjects. Then, education was administered by the researcher in the form of eleven 60-min sessions, through personal (face-to-face) and group education (lecture, group discussion, picture presentation, role play, and questions and answers).</p><p>After the end of each session, there was 1&#x02013;2 h of Q and A debugging. Finally, subjects&#x02019; questions were answered through phone calls and SMS for 3 months. In the control group, after the end of intervention, a 4-h session was held on general issues concerning diseases. In the fourth stage (evaluation), subjects (control and study groups) completed the knowledge, attitude, and practice questionnaire immediately after and 3 months after intervention. Collected data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential [Chi-square, Mann-Whitney, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), and independent <italic>t</italic>-test].

The age at first marriage was 17.44 (3.92) years and the age at first sexual experience was 17.46 (3.92) years. Subjects&#x02019; highest education was at primary school level (39%); their residential status was rented (49%), 64% were homemakers, and 49% were married. Repeated measures ANOVA showed no significant difference in mean scores of knowledge before, immediately after, and 3 months after self-care education about STD in the control group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.11).

Nonoyama <italic>et al</italic>., in a study on the effect of sex-related information for STD prevention, showed that education was effective on increasing adolescents&#x02019; knowledge.

Sari <italic>et al</italic>. showed that 61% of the women who had illicit sexual relationship, tear of condom, or unprotected sex referring to laboratory for STD test suffered from fear, concerns, and anxiety disorders (52% depression and 52% anxiety).[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>Ghaffari <italic>et al</italic>., in a study on the effect of educational program on HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, attitude, and behavioral intentions of male high school students, showed that subjects&#x02019; education had a positive effect on their attitude concerning safe sexual behaviors[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Results showed that vulnerable women's functioning was higher before and after intervention in the study group, compared to that in control group women. Jadgal <italic>et al</italic>., in a study on the effect of health education according to the theory of planned behavior on malaria-preventive behavior in Chabahar, Iran, showed that educational intervention had a significant effect on increase of safe sexual behavior during 2 months after intervention (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Hajiagha <italic>et al</italic>., in a study on the effect of education based on the theory of planned behavior skills in adolescents, showed no significant difference in subjects&#x02019; knowledge, intention, abstract norm, and perceived behavioral control before intervention, while there was a significant increase after intervention (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The above-mentioned studies prove that a health education program is effective on promotion of individuals&#x02019; knowledge, attitude, and positive function. Researcher believes that if education-based preventive interventions are based on the learners&#x02019; needs and culture, better learning occurs and learners step toward health more eagerly. Findings of the present study also showed that ability of self-care was more effective on behaviors leading to STDs in vulnerable women before and after intervention in the study group, compared to that in control group women. It seems that through administration of a self-care educational program, based on Orem model in regard with STDs, some high-risk behaviors are changed due to presentation of educational content based on individuals&#x02019; physical and mental needs.</p><p>It was also observed in the outcomes of subjects&#x02019; knowledge, attitude, and practice in the form of self-care ability. Youngkin and Lester, in a study on promoting self-care and secondary prevention in women's health concerning self-examination of bacterial vaginosis in USA, showed that subjects&#x02019; power in secondary prevention of this disease was improved through basic education and use of bacterial vaginosis self-examination kit.<sup>{34}</sup> Zamora <italic>et al</italic>., in a study on determination of educational program on STD and self-care behavior in adolescents, showed that educational program based on adolescents&#x02019; needs could act as the best tool to promote knowledge, attitude, and practice, and consequently, application of self-care behavior toward prevention of STDs and high-risk behavior.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Based on the results obtained in the present study and in other studies, it can be inferred that personal and group self-care educational sessions, conducted for those involved in or predisposed to STDs, can be a beneficial action to promote recognition and knowledge and to reduce self-care defects among vulnerable women in the society.
