The structure and properties of plant foods have been identified as critical factors in influencing nutrient bioaccessibility; however, the physical and biochemical disassembly of cereal food during digestion has not been widely studied.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aims of this study were to compare the effects of 2 porridge meals prepared from wheat endosperm with different degrees of starch bioaccessibility on postprandial metabolism (e.g., glycemia) and to gain insight into the structural and biochemical breakdown of the test meals during gastroileal transit.</p><p><bold>Design:</bold> A randomized crossover trial in 9 healthy ileostomy participants was designed to compare the effects of 55 g starch, provided as coarse (2-mm particles) or smooth (&#x0003c;0.2-mm particles) wheat porridge, on postprandial changes in blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide, lipids, and gut hormones and on the resistant starch (RS) content of ileal effluent. Undigested food in the ileal output was examined microscopically to identify cell walls and encapsulated starch.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide concentrations were significantly lower (i.e., 33%, 43%, 40%, and 50% lower 120-min incremental AUC, respectively) after consumption of the coarse porridge than after the smooth porridge (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). In vitro, starch digestion was slower in the coarse porridge than in the smooth porridge (33% less starch digested at 90 min, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, paired <italic>t</italic> test). In vivo, the structural integrity of coarse particles (&#x0223c;2 mm) of wheat endosperm was retained during gastroileal transit. Microscopic examination revealed a progressive loss of starch from the periphery toward the particle core. The structure of the test meal had no effect on the amount or pattern of RS output.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The structural integrity of wheat endosperm is largely retained during gastroileal digestion and has a primary role in influencing the rate of starch amylolysis and, consequently, postprandial metabolism.

Wheat is the main ingredient in a range of staple foods that form part of a healthy diet (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>); however, many wheat-based staples (e.g., certain breads and breakfast cereals) have a high GI (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Differences in glycemic responses to starch-rich foods such as wheat products depend highly on the rate and extent to which available starch is digested by &#x003b1;-amylase and made available for absorption in the small intestine (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Understanding the mechanisms of digestion and absorption in the small intestine may therefore suggest ways of manipulating existing foods and/or ingredients to control metabolic responses.</p><p>Compelling evidence reveals that food structure plays a critical role in influencing the bioaccessibility of starch and other macronutrients and the subsequent metabolic responses (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Currently, however, there is a lack of understanding of how foods are structurally disassembled during digestive transit. Many foods are consumed as plant tissues, consisting of nutrients enclosed within plant cells. Plant cell walls (dietary fiber) are resistant to digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract and may, if structurally intact, protect the enclosed nutrients from digestive enzymes, thereby delaying or limiting bioaccessibility (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Indeed, intact plant cells still containing nutrients (e.g., starch, lipid, &#x003b2;-carotene) have been identified in ileal effluent after plant foods were consumed (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Previous in vivo studies have also reported attenuated glycemia and insulinemia in healthy participants after ingestion of structurally intact foods compared with a destructured equivalent (e.g., mainly ruptured cells) (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>A common misconception is that any food containing whole grains, even in flour form, is slowly digested. However, the high GI of white and whole-meal wheat bread is linked to structural characteristics of the constituent flour, which contains mostly ruptured cells with high-bioaccessibility starch (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Previous studies suggest that inclusion of high proportions of intact whole grains or soluble dietary fiber in bread may attenuate glycemic responses (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, to what extent starch bioaccessibility and glycemia can be controlled by manipulating the structural integrity of wheat endosperm, the most commonly consumed dietary source of starch, is not yet known.</p><p>The aim of this postprandial ileostomy study was to provide insight into the structural and biochemical degradation of wheat endosperm (i.e., the starch storage tissue of wheat grain) during gastroileal digestion and its effects on metabolic responses (e.g., glycemia, insulinemia, and gut hormone release). We hypothesized that porridge prepared from coarsely milled wheat endosperm (containing intact cells) would be digested more slowly and therefore elicit a lower glycemic response than a nutritionally matched porridge prepared from finely milled endosperm (lacking intact cells). This unique study in healthy participants with an ileostomy has provided new insight into both the mechanistic aspects of starch digestion and its metabolic consequences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Healthy participants aged 20&#x02013;76 with ileostomies were recruited between September 2012 and July 2013 via the Ileostomy Association in London. All participants had undergone a proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis, pure colonic Crohn disease, or lower bowel cancer at least 1 y before taking part in the study. The study protocol was registered as ISRCTN40517475 and approved by the relevant ethics committee in the United Kingdom (REC 12/LO/1016). All volunteers gave their written informed consent after being provided with oral and written information about the aims and protocol of the study.</p><p>All participants had healthy small bowels with well-functioning ileostomies with &#x0003c;10 cm of small intestine resected. Exclusion criteria included the following: BMI (in kg/m<sup>2</sup>) &#x0003c;20 or &#x0003e;35, fasting plasma glucose &#x0003e;7 mmol/L, serum cholesterol &#x0003e;7.8 mmol/L, or serum triacylglycerols &#x0003e;3 mmol/L. Fasting plasma glucose concentration, BMI, blood pressure, liver function, and blood cell counts were confirmed to be within prescribed limits before enrollment in the study. All participants were otherwise healthy, with no history of diabetes or signs of diagnosed gastrointestinal conditions, as confirmed by means of a full medical history and examination. The usual dietary habits of individuals were assessed from a 3-d diet diary, and the nutrient intake was analyzed with the use of NetWisp v.3.0 (Tinuviel Software).</p><p>This study was one part of a 2-branch investigation (study 1 was on lipid bioaccessibility and study 2 on starch bioaccessibility) with common participant recruitment and screening processes for both branches. The participant characteristics, study details, and results presented in this publication are for the starch study only.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>A randomized crossover study design was used in which each participant received 2 experimental meals (in random sequence) separated by at least 1 wk. The random allocation of the treatment sequence was based on a computer-generated random number sequence. The study investigators generated the random allocation sequence, enrolled participants, and assigned participants to interventions. Because of the different physical appearance and texture of the test meals, study participants were not blinded; however, all samples were coded so that those investigators assessing outcomes (e.g., performing sample and data analysis) were blinded. All screening and study visits took place at the Clinical Research Facilities at St. Thomas&#x02019; Hospital, London.</p><p>On the day preceding the study, participants were provided with a standardized low-fiber evening meal and advised to drink plenty of water. Participants were also instructed to avoid food and drink high in sugar, caffeine, or alcohol and to refrain from strenuous exercise both on the day preceding the study and throughout the study period.</p><p>An overview of the study day protocol is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>. On the day of the study visit, participants arrived at the clinical research facilities after a 12-h fast. A cannula was inserted into a forearm vein, and a fasted venous blood glucose sample (&#x02212;15 min) was obtained. Participants were then required to either completely empty their ileostomy pouch or attach a new pouch. Additional fasted venous blood samples (time = 0 min) were then obtained for glucose, insulin, C-peptide, triacylglycerols, and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs), as well as gut hormone analyses, after which the test meal was consumed within 15 min. Blood samples thereafter were taken at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 240 min. Ileal effluent was collected at 2, 4, 8, and 10 h, and overnight.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1&#x02003;</label><caption><p>Blood and effluent collection time points and meal times. Fasting blood samples for baseline measurements were collected at &#x02212;15 min (glucose only) and, for all analytes, immediately before the test meal (0 min). Blood samples thereafter were collected at regular intervals up to 4 h, and ileal effluent was collected every 2 h up to 10 h. Overnight effluent samples (between 2200 and 1100 the next day) were collected at variable time points, at the participants&#x02019; convenience. Effluent samples were preserved in ethanol or by freezing at the time of collection to inhibit enzymatic and chemical deterioration of carbohydrates (e.g., starch).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ajcn106203fig1"/></fig><p>Meals low in resistant starch (RS) were provided after blood and effluent collections at 4 h, and again at 8 h (dinner with dessert), to minimize interference with ileal RS measurements. Participants were required to eat an identical menu for both study visits. Foods for all meals were purchased from Sainsbury&#x02019;s, London. Lunch (621 kcal) consisted of a leafy salad with cheese and either tofu, chicken breast, beef, or tuna, served with yogurt and juice (from concentrate), and contained &#x0003c;4 g starch. Dinner consisted of mashed potato with fish, chicken, lamb, or beef and cooked carrots, and was followed by a high-calorie (360&#x02013;420-kcal/portion) dessert. Dinner with dessert contained up to 50 g starch in total, but the majority (at least 85%) of the starch in this meal originated from mashed potato, which contained starch that previously was found to be readily digested and absorbed (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>For the a priori power calculations, we assumed a difference between mean glucose incremental AUC of at least 20% and an SD of the difference of 18%. These values were based on data from previous studies, as well as the observed differences in in vitro digestibility (i.e., a predictor of glycemia) of the specific test meals (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This calculation indicated that, with a repeated-measures study design, 9 subjects would give 90% power at an &#x003b1;-level of 0.05. Changes in plasma glucose concentrations and serum insulin and C-peptide responses were regarded as primary outcomes, and lipemic responses (triacylglycerols and NEFAs) and RS contents of ileal effluent were secondary outcomes. Changes in gut hormone concentrations, specifically plasma glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), polypeptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and cholecystokinin, were regarded as exploratory outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Formulation and preparation of test meals</title><p>Test meals consisted of 2 freshly prepared porridges made from 77 g durum wheat endosperm, cooked in water and flavored with 17 g low-sugar black currant jam (Sainsbury&#x02019;s Reduced Sugar Blackcurrant Jam) and 61 g jelly (Hartley&#x02019;s Low Calorie Ready To Eat Blueberry and Blackcurrant Jelly). Proximate analysis of the durum wheat (protein, fat, dietary fiber by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists method, ash, and moisture) was performed by Premier Analytic Services, and additional direct measurements of available carbohydrate (starch and sugar) contents were performed with the use of a modified Megazyme kit (Megazyme International) method (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). On the basis of data from proximate analysis of wheat and the nutrition declaration on food packaging (for the jam and jelly), each porridge meal (155 g solids with 449 mL water) provided a total of 57.8 g available carbohydrate (composed of 55.4 g starch and 2.4 g sugar), 5.2 g dietary fiber, 9.3 g protein, 1.6 g fat, and 0.2 g salt.</p><p>The durum wheat endosperm component of the meal was provided in the form of finely milled flour (&#x0003c;0.2 mm) to create a smooth porridge or coarsely milled macroparticles (&#x0223c;2 mm) to create a coarse porridge. The smooth and coarse porridges were predicted to be high- and low-bioaccessibility starch test meals, respectively. The endosperm material was prepared from de-branned durum wheat grains with the use of a Satake TH050 roller-mill (Satake Europe), as described previously (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Microstructural analysis (<bold>Supplemental Figure 1</bold>) confirmed that the coarsely milled particles contained a high proportion of intact cells, whereas particles &#x0003c;0.21 mm consisted almost entirely of ruptured cells. Durum wheat (<italic>Triticum durum</italic> L. &#x0201c;Svevo&#x0201d;), donated by Millbo, was selected for this study because its fracture properties make it particularly well-suited to the milling techniques used.</p><p>The porridges were cooked under standardized heating conditions by simmering smooth or coarse wheat endosperm in water (while stirring vigorously) to achieve total and uniform gelatinization of the starch. Next, the porridge was allowed to cool for 5 min, during which time the jam and jelly flavoring was stirred in. The liquid component of the meal was standardized at 449 mL by providing the required volume of drinking water to make up for evaporative losses. The meal was served immediately thereafter to prevent further starch retrogradation, which is known to decrease the susceptibility of starch to amylolysis (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Both test meals were designed to be of a particle size and consistency that could comfortably be swallowed whole without prior mastication. Participants were instructed to swallow the porridge with minimal chewing and were required to consume the entire meal within 15 min of serving.</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro starch digestibility of test meals</title><p>The rate at which starch amylolysis products become bioaccessible (i.e., available for absorption) during duodenal digestion is an important determinant of the duration and magnitude of the glycemic response (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In particular, the extent of starch digested at 90 min has previously been reported to correlate well with the glucose response (AUCs for 120 min) (<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Because of the difficulty in studying luminal digestion of starch in vivo, the rate and extent of starch amylolysis of the 2 test meals was determined in vitro with the use of our well-established digestion protocol (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), which involves sample digestion with porcine pancreatic &#x003b1;-amylase and quantification of digestion products with the use of the Prussian blue method (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Logarithm of slope analysis (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) was applied to the digestibility data and used to predict the total extent of digestion (<italic>C</italic><sub>&#x0221e;</sub>). Because the Prussian blue assay quantifies products as maltose (not glucose) and either underestimates or fails to account for other minor starch digestion products (maltotriose and &#x003b1;-limit dextrins), it slightly underestimates the extent of overall starch digestion. For purposes of comparison, therefore, all digestibility data were expressed as a percentage of total hydrolyzable starch based on maltose equivalents, with the use of extracted durum wheat starch, which had been hydrothermally processed to fully gelatinize the starch (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), as a reference material. Thus, the starch reference sample represented 100% hydrolysis. The proportion of hydrolyzable starch digested after 90 min, known as the hydrolysis index (HI), was estimated from the first-order kinetic model describing the in vitro data (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Collection and handling of blood samples</title><p>Venous blood samples for glucose, insulin, C-peptide, triacylglycerols, and NEFA analyses were collected and handled as described previously (<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Blood samples for gut hormone analyses were dispensed into K<sub>2</sub> EDTA-coated tubes preloaded with either 100 &#x003bc;L aprotinin (10,000 KIU/mL; Nordic Pharma) for GIP and PYY analyses or 40 &#x003bc;L dipeptidyl-peptidase-IV inhibitor (Merck Millipore) for GLP-1 and cholecystokinin analyses, and kept on ice for 15 min followed by centrifugation and plasma storage. All blood samples were centrifuged at 1500 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C, and aliquots of the supernatant were collected and stored at either &#x02212;40&#x000b0;C (for glucose, insulin, C-peptide, triacylglycerols, and NEFAs) or &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C (for gut hormones) until analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Collection and handling of effluent samples</title><p>Ileal effluent was collected every 2 h for up to 10 h and overnight at the convenience of participants. Effluent samples were obtained from the participants, who emptied the contents of their ileostomy pouches into Whirl-Pak (Nasco) specimen bags at predetermined time points. Immediately after each effluent collection, the sample was weighed. A small subsample was taken directly into the fixative (see Microstructural analysis), and the remaining effluent was then homogenized (HR1363 Hand Blender; Philips). For starch and sugar analysis, &#x0223c;2 g of the homogenized effluent was weighed into 4 &#x000d7; 15 mL BD Falcon tubes (BD Biosciences) preloaded with 95% (vol:vol) ethanol to inactivate any residual enzyme activity. These samples were stored overnight at 4&#x000b0;C before starch and sugar analysis. Subsamples of the homogenized effluent were also taken for determination of dry matter, and these were frozen immediately (&#x02212;80&#x000b0;C) to prevent further degradation. Overnight samples were collected into specimen bags by the participants ad libitum and subsequently placed in absorbent padding between eutectic freezer blocks (PlusIce PCM, E-78; Phase Change Material Products) in a polystyrene box to freeze the samples at the time of collection. These frozen samples were stored for future analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical assays</title><p>Plasma glucose, serum triacylglycerol, and serum NEFA concentrations were determined on an iLab 650 auto-analyzer (Instrumentation Laboratories) with the use of Glucose Oxidase and Triglyceride IL test kits (Instrumentation Laboratories) and a Randox NEFA kit (Randox Laboratories). Serum insulin and C-peptide and plasma GLP-1, GIP, and total PYY (1&#x02013;36 and 3&#x02013;36 forms) concentrations were determined by standard methods as described previously (<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Cholecystokinin was determined by competitive inhibition enzyme immunoassay technique with the use of an ELISA kit (USCN Life Science).</p><p>RS was defined as the sum of starch and sugars (expressed as maltose equivalents) present in the ileal effluent, because the sugars are likely to be products of starch degradation (e.g., by microorganisms), as described in previous studies (<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). To determine the total amount of RS, the homogenized, ethanolic ileal effluent was centrifuged for 4 min at 12,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> at 22&#x000b0;C, and the resulting supernatant was analyzed for total reducing sugar, while the pellet was analyzed for total starch content. Total reducing sugar was determined by 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid assay in which 15 &#x003bc;L of the supernatant (diluted in water if necessary) was transferred into a 96-well plate (Nunc, MicroWell, Fisher Scientific) to which was added 5 &#x003bc;L of 3M NaOH and 20 &#x003bc;L 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid reagent consisting of 1.0% (wt:vol) 3,5- dinitrosalicylic acid, 1.6% (wt:vol) NaOH and 30% (wt:vol) sodium potassium tartrate, prepared in deioinized water. Standard samples containing known concentrations of maltose were also included. The plate with samples was then sealed and incubated in a water bath at 90&#x000b0;C for 5 min, after which 200 &#x003bc;L deionized water was added.

However, some of these foods, notably wheat bread, are characterized as being high-GI products&#x02014;a property that derives mainly from their starches, which are highly bioaccessible and rapidly digested (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Wheat-based products containing starch that is slowly released and digested by preservation of the structure of the cell walls (fiber) of wheat endosperm during milling could have public health benefits (e.g., improved management of type 2 diabetes).</p><p>In the current study, we investigated the effects of cell-wall encapsulation of wheat endosperm on in vitro starch bioaccessibility and digestion and on glycemia, insulinemia, and gut hormones in ileostomy participants. The nutritionally matched test meals (smooth and coarse porridge) were freshly prepared, differing only in particle size (2 mm compared with &#x0003c;0.2 mm), and were swallowed with minimal mastication. This design ensured that any observed metabolic effects could be attributed to the structural properties of the test meals during gastroileal digestive transit.</p><p>Our in vitro digestion experiments clearly demonstrated that starch entrapped within the cells of the coarse wheat endosperm particles was hydrolyzed (by &#x003b1;-amylase) at a considerably slower rate than the exposed starch in the fine flour particles. Hence, the structural integrity of dietary fiber, as intact cell walls, can strongly influence the rate at which entrapped starch is made bioaccessible and thereby affect the time course of glucose absorption into the portal blood.</p><p>On the basis of the in vitro data showing marked differences in the rate of amylolysis between coarse endosperm and flour, we hypothesized that the same materials would also elicit differences in the in vivo glycemic responses. Indeed, the coarse porridge evoked significantly lower glycemic, insulinemic, and C-peptide responses compared with the smooth porridge. The magnitude of the reductions in glycemia and insulinemia achieved in the present study were similar to, if not greater than, the glycemic reductions achieved in some previous studies with the addition of soluble fiber or use of whole grains (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Our findings therefore highlight the importance of the physical state of the dietary fiber, present as a cell wall matrix, in influencing glycemic responses (<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>Microscopic examination of ileal effluent revealed that coarse (2-mm) particles of wheat endosperm retained structural integrity during the first 10 h of gastroileal transit but that the majority of encapsulated starch was eventually digested from seemingly intact cells. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such microstructural observations have been reported for wheat endosperm digested in the upper gastrointestinal tract of humans. After 10 h, the majority of the test meal had reached the terminal ileum, and only negligible amounts of RS remained (&#x0223c;5% of total starch), irrespective of particle size. This is consistent with previous ileostomy studies of white wheat bread and cornflakes (<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and suggests that wheat-based food matrices, including the endosperm macroparticles used in the current study, are permeable to &#x003b1;-amylase during digestive transit. Notably, both smooth and coarse porridge contained the same amount of dietary fiber and RS, but the rates of starch amylolysis and subsequent glycemic responses were significantly different. We believe that the role of cell-wall encapsulation in limiting nutrient bioaccessibility provides a more specific explanation for many of the beneficial physiologic effects that have collectively been attributed to dietary fiber (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p>It has been suggested that limiting the bioaccessibility of nutrients may reduce the magnitude of gut hormone responses (<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The appearance of nutrients (e.g., starch digestion products) in the intestinal lumen is an important stimulus for the release of gut hormones that promote satiety (e.g., PYY and GLP-1), insulin secretion (GIP and GLP-1), and digestive secretions (e.g., cholecystokinin) (<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Some interesting trends were observed: for instance, the GIP response to the smooth porridge was 2 times that of the coarse porridge, probably reflecting the increased rate of glucose availability from duodenal starch digestion (as observed in vitro). Also, GLP-1 and PYY concentrations tended to be higher for the first 50 min after smooth porridge than after coarse porridge, but the differences were not significant. Unlike GIP and cholecystokinin, GLP-1 and PYY hormones are both secreted from L cells located predominantly in the ileum and colon, the effect of the latter being excluded in ileostomy participants. A second/sustained peak, reflecting the nutrient sensing of colonic cells, has been reported in human subjects with intact colons (<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). It is also noteworthy that the present study may not have been sufficiently powered to enable differences between gut hormone responses to the high- and low-bioaccessibility test meals to be demonstrated. Nevertheless, the effect of bioaccessibility on endocrine signaling is an area that has important implications for the regulation of food intake and digestion and warrants further investigation.</p><p>Although the test meals were rich in starch and contained little fat (1.6 g/portion), postprandial reductions in triacylglycerol and NEFA concentrations were observed. These reductions probably reflect the net effect of the insulin-mediated uptake of fatty acids and the inhibition of lipolysis in adipose tissue (<xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). No significant differences were observed between the 2 meals, but, interestingly, the smooth porridge, which elicited the greatest insulin response, was associated with higher concentrations of triacylglycerols than the coarse porridge. This is paradoxical, because insulin is known to promote lipogenesis (e.g., triacylglycerol storage in adipose tissue) (<xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). However, it has been reported that high-carbohydrate diets can induce hypertriglyceridemia, possibly by slowing the removal of triacylglycerols (chylomicrons) from the blood (<xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) or by increasing hepatic VLDL release (as reported in a study of insulin-resistant subjects) (<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p><p>Preserving the natural structural integrity (intact cells) of wheat endosperm, and indeed other edible plant tissues, during processing could provide a means of limiting the rate and/or extent of energy uptake from food postingestion and may have significant and important applications in the prevention and management of cardiometabolic diseases. Although wheat breads containing 50&#x02013;80% whole grains have previously been shown to elicit lower glycemic responses than white bread (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), granary bread containing such high proportions of intact grains will have a different texture and appearance from white bread and may therefore not appeal to many consumers. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the potential to manipulate the structure of the endosperm fraction (i.e., the main component of white flour) to achieve a lower and more desirable glycemic response. Developing a low-GI &#x0201c;white&#x0201d; wheat flour could provide a new means of reducing the GI of white bread and a range of other starch-rich staple foods to positively affect public health. Further studies will be needed to better understand how other natural food structures, including <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> (bread wheat), are affected by processing and digestion, but the results of the current work on durum wheat, which is used in bread- and pasta-making, demonstrate proof of principle.</p><p>There is now convincing evidence that the tissue structures of some plant foods (e.g., intact cells) can be retained to a greater or lesser extent during mastication (<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) and gastroileal (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and gastrocolonic (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) digestive transit and that nutrients entrapped within these structures may escape digestion and absorption to a variable extent. As a result, nutrient composition data, which does not adequately account for differences in bioaccessibility, can sometimes lead to substantial overestimations of the nutritional and caloric value of a food (<xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). We suggest that future nutritional studies consider the structure and not just the composition of test meals.</p><p>In conclusion, these results provide the first evidence that the structural integrity of wheat endosperm is a major factor in influencing starch bioaccessibility and that manipulating the structural integrity of the endosperm has the potential to greatly influence postprandial metabolism.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Peter Milligan (King&#x02019;s College London) for statistical guidance, Gema Vizcay-Barrena (Centre for Ultrastructural Imaging, King&#x02019;s College London) for assistance with microscopy, Tracy Dew (Clinical Chemistry Department, King&#x02019;s College Hospital) for assistance with blood analyses, and Dana Navaie and Shuvra Ray for providing clinical cover.
