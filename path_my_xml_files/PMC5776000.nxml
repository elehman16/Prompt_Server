</p><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common lifelong neurobehavioral disorder and has an estimated prevalence of 7.2% in school-aged children with serious consequences, including difficulties in family relationships, educational and occupational problems, and legal issues.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>According to guidelines, the current significant diagnostic criteria are based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders- 4<sup>th</sup> edition (DSM-IV) criteria, seeking coexisting conditions related to the diagnostic process and treatment and collecting information on the child&#x02019;s symptoms in more than 1 setting.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>The most common and highly effective medications in treating ADHD symptoms are stimulants such as methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> It has been reported that these drugs improve social behavior, neuropsychological functioning, and academic performance and confer long-term benefits in mental health.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Research has also revealed that therapy with stimulants, in addition to its effectiveness, is associated with common mild and rare serious adverse effects. According to previous studies, the most pronounced mild adverse events are insomnia and reduced appetite, with a respective frequency of 90% and 79%.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that poor appetite may lead to micronutrient deficiency, including iron or folic acid deficiency.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Folic acid exerts an effect on the synthesis of DNA and cell growth, particularly the cells of the gastrointestinal tract, where the synthesis and secretion of hormones such as peptide YY (PYY) that influence appetite are regulated.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Nonetheless, the mechanism of the impact of folic acid on appetite is still unclear.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Based on previous studies, some pediatricians in Iran prescribe folic acid empirically as an appetite enhancer for low-weight children with poor appetite.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In their triple-blind clinical trial, Hatamizadeh et al.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> investigated the effects of folic acid on the appetite of children between 3 and 5 years of age by administrating a 1 mg/day dose of folic acid for 20 days. In a cross-sectional study, Namdari et al.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> determined the relationship between the level of folic acid and appetite status in children aged 3 to 6 years. The results of these investigations confirmed that folic acid was able to improve the appetite of preschool children with poor appetite.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there is currently a dearth of studies evaluating the effects of folic acid on reduced appetite caused by the use of methylphenidate in children with ADHD.</p><p>In this randomized double-blind clinical trial, we aimed to investigate the effects of folic acid on reduced appetite caused by the use of methylphenidate in children aged between 6 and 12 years with ADHD by measuring changes in the appetite score, weight, and body mass index (BMI).</p></sec><sec sec-type="patients|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title><italic>Ethical Consideration</italic>
</title><p>An informed consent was obtained from the parents of the children prior to the commencement of the study. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences (ethical approval code number: CT-P-9359-5679). The IRCT code of this study was IRCT2016040927304N1.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title><italic>Participants</italic>
</title><p>This randomized double-blind clinical trial recruited 70 outpatients, aged between 6 and 12 years, from the Outpatient Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinic of Golestan Hospital (Ahwaz, Iran) between 2016 and 2017. All the participants were diagnosed as ADHD children. As the prevalence of ADHD is approximately 7% and with a 95% confidence level and a margin of error of 0.05, it was estimated that a sample of 70 participants (35 children in each group) was needed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title><italic>Diagnostic Instruments</italic>
</title><p>ADHD was diagnosed according to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Eligibility for inclusion was approved by 2 board-certified child and adolescent psychiatrist and psychiatric specialist before the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title><italic>Efficacy Measures</italic>
</title><p>The Conners Parent Questionnaire was used to evaluate response to treatment in the patients with ADHD. This questionnaire has 26 questions and a rating scale between 26 and 104. A scale more than 34 represents attention deficit hyperactivity. The validity and reliability of this questionnaire are 85% and 91%, respectively.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Anthropometric measurements were taken by psychiatry residents using standardized methods. Body weight was measured for each child to the nearest 0.1 kg. Height was measured with an accuracy of 0.1 cm. The BMI was calculated as weight in kilogram divided by the square of height in meters (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Demographic characteristics were obtained by interviewing the parents at enrollment in the study.</p><p>The children&#x02019;s appetite was assessed using the Council on Nutrition Appetite Questionnaire by asking their mothers 6 questions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The questionnaire has sensitivity and specificity of 82.7% and 71.7%, correspondingly, and validity and reliability of 60% and 47%, respectively.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> A rating scale (6&#x02013;30) was employed to rate the degree of appetite. The scales between 8 and 16, 17 and 28, and higher than 28 correspondingly represent the risk of low appetite, need for more investigation, and absence of appetite-related problems.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Appetite and nausea questionnaire of the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJMS-43-9-g001"/></fig><p>Nausea was assessed by asking the mothers to answer some related questions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). A rating scale between 1 and 5 was applied for each question. A higher score represents the better condition of the children in terms of nausea.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title><italic>Procedure</italic>
</title><p>The randomization and allocation process was done. All the study subjects were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated code to receive either folic acid (5 mg/d) or a placebo. The patients were randomized to receive treatment with an average dose of methylphenidate (1 mg/kg) plus folic acid (5 mg/d) (Group 1) or an average dose of methylphenidate (1 mg/kg) plus the placebo (magnesium stearate, lactose, starch, sorbitol, and Avicel&#x000ae;) (Group 2) for an 8-week double-blind clinical trial. During the study period, the person who administrated the medications, the rater, and the patients were blinded to the treatment group. The assignments were kept in sealed, opaque envelopes until the point of allocation.</p><p>The inclusion criteria comprised age between 6 and 12 years, ADHD diagnosis based on the DSM-IV, clinical need to treat with methylphenidate, nonuse of other pharmacological interventions 2 weeks before the intervention, completing the consent form, and ability to refer for follow-up visits. Patients were excluded if they had epilepsy, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, bipolar disorder, use of drugs that elevate the sympathetic system activity and cause conditions such as pheochromocytoma, using pseudoephedrine, psychosis in oneself or one&#x02019;s parents, use of any drugs and supplements which affect weight, low birth weight, history of prematurity, comorbid Tourette&#x02019;s syndrome, celiac disease, phenylketonuria, autism, mental retardation syndrome, failure to thrive confirmed in advance by pediatricians, history of severe side effects with the previous use of methylphenidate, drug-using mother, reduced appetite before the study, and minor thalassemia.</p><p>Assessments, with the aid of the Conners Parent Questionnaire, anthropometric measurements, and appetite questionnaire, were conducted by a psychiatrist at baseline and thereafter at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after the commencement of the medication. Additionally, the side effect (nausea) was recorded during the study and was assessed using a checklist administered by a resident of psychiatry at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title><italic>Data Analysis</italic>
</title><p>The data were accumulated, analyzed, and presented as mean and standard deviation (mean&#x000b1;SD). In addition, the statistical comparisons between the groups were executed using the SPSS statistical software (v. 18.0). The Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was employed in order to compare age, weight, height, BMI, Conners Parent Scale, appetite score, and nausea score during the trial between the 2 groups. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the effects of the interventions on the measurements at all 5 time points. A P&#x02264;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Out of the 70 children with ADHD, 66 patients met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate in the study.

However, the mechanism whereby supplemental folic acid augments appetite has not been clearly delineated.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Although investigators have previously probed into the efficacy of folic acid in improving quality of life and reducing aggression and its symptoms in preschool children with ADHD, there is a dearth of data in the existing literature on the efficacy of folic acid in appetite improvement.</p><p>Kishnani et al.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> presented a case of glycogen storage disease type Ib in an adolescent patient. He was in a good metabolic control and referred with poor appetite, weakness, depression, and vomiting of 3 months&#x02019; duration. Extensive work-up demonstrated that the patient had B12, folate, iron, and other nutritional deficiencies. He showed symptom improvement after receiving therapeutic doses of deficient micronutrients. The authors followed up the patient for 2 months.</p><p>Nail et al.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> studied in the laboratory the effects of the deletion of water-soluble (thiamin, riboflavin, pyridoxine, cyanocobalamin, pantothenic acid, folic acid, niacin, biotin, choline, inositol, and ascorbic acid) and fat-soluble (A, D, E, and K) vitamins on the growth and survival of juvenile shrimp for 8 weeks. They observed that diets deficient in folic acid resulted in poor appetite and poorer feed efficiency and there were histological changes in the digestive gland cells.</p><p>Kanani et al.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> investigated the effects of iron-folic acid (IFA) supplements on hemoglobin, hunger, and growth in adolescent girls aged between 10 and 18 years in India. Their results showed increasing levels of hemoglobin, food intake, and weight gain in groups of girls who received IFA supplements, whereas hemoglobin decreased slightly and little weight gain was reported in the girls in the control group. The authors concluded that IFA supplementation was able to promote growth in underweight adolescents.</p><p>Hatamizadeh et al.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> conducted a randomized triple-blind clinical trial to determine the effects of folic acid on the appetite of preschool children, between 3 and 5 years old, with poor appetite. According to their results, the children&#x02019;s appetite improved after receiving folic acid on the 20<sup>th</sup> day. Similar results were reported in a cross-sectional study that aimed to assess the effects of folic acid on the appetite of preschool children, between 3 and 6 years of age. Based on this study, a positive association was detected between the levels of serum folate and improved appetite.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, Ghanizadeh et al.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> examined the efficacy of methylphenidate with folic acid in improving quality of life and treating aggression and ADHD symptoms in children with ADHD. The investigators concluded that methylphenidate might improve ADHD symptoms and the quality of life of children with ADHD. Their evidence, however, failed to support the efficacy of folic acid in treating ADHD symptoms or aggression or in improving quality of life in children with ADHD.</p><p>Accordingly, there is a paucity of studies evaluating the relationship between acid folic and appetite level, especially in children with ADHD. The present study is one of the 1<sup>st</sup> randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the effects of folic acid on appetite in children with ADHD, aged between 6 and 12 years. Even so, first and foremost among the limitations in the present study is the absence of laboratory data and follow-up of the patients after the 8-week study period.</p><p>The results of the current study showed that folic acid was able to enhance the diminished appetite in consequence of the use of methylphenidate in children with ADHD aged between 6 and 12 years. We also found that despite the significant improvement in appetite, no significant change in weight gain was demonstrated. It is worthy of note that folic acid was well tolerated in our cases and no adverse effects such as nausea were reported in the folic acid group. These results seem to be in line with previous studies.</p><p>Finally, we suggest that further studies incorporating laboratory data changes such as peripheral blood smear and glucose, lipid, protein, and serum folic acid levels be undertaken for a more in-depth assessment of the effects of folic acid on appetite in children with ADHD. In addition, as the duration of the present study was approximately short (8 weeks), it seems advisable that the long-term effects and safety of folic acid be investigated in larger groups of participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Folic acid was able to improve the reduced appetite caused by the use of methylphenidate in children with ADHD aged between 6 and 12 years.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This work was financially supported with a grant (CT-P-9359-5679) awarded by the Vice-Chancellor for Research Affairs of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences.
