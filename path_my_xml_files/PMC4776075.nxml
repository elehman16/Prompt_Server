Alternatives to antibiotics are thus urgently needed (<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Piddock, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Stanton, 2013</xref>). Phage therapy (PT), the use of bacterial viruses (phages) against pathogens, is a potentially attractive option for the prevention and treatment of some bacterial infections (<xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Sulakvelidze et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Br&#x000fc;ssow, 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Br&#x000fc;ssow, 2012</xref>). Indeed, a large, randomized and placebo-controlled trial conducted in children from Tbilisi/Republic of Georgia during the 1960s described prevention of <italic>Shigella</italic> dysentery and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> diarrhea with orally applied <italic>Shigella</italic> phages (<xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Sulakvelidze et al., 2001</xref>). PT was practiced in Poland in patients with antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections on a case-by-case basis, apparently with high success (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Mi&#x00119;dzybrodzki et al., 2012</xref>). However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in humans are needed to rationally assess the potential of PT. So far, a single small RCT documented an effect in carefully selected patients suffering from otitis externa (&#x0201c;swimmer's ear&#x0201d;) (<xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">Wright et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p><italic>E. coli</italic> is an important cause of diarrhea in children from developing countries (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Qadri et al., 2005</xref>), resistant against many antibiotics (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2002</xref>) while efficient <italic>E. coli</italic> diarrhea vaccines are not yet available (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed et al., 2013</xref>). Other than zinc and oral rehydration solution, no specific, effective, safe and affordable treatment is available to reduce the severity or duration of illness caused by this bacterial agent. We hypothesize that oral administration of coliphage will be effective in reducing severity of diarrhea in children with proven <italic>E. coli</italic> induced diarrhea. Therefore a RCT of PT with two different coliphage cocktails for which safe use was demonstrated in healthy adults (<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Sarker et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">McCallin et al., 2013</xref>) was performed in children with <italic>E. coli</italic> diarrhea. The primary endpoint was the safety of oral coliphage in children infected with <italic>E. coli</italic>, the secondary endpoint was the titration of fecal coliphage and <italic>E. coli</italic> pathogen to assess <italic>in vivo</italic> lytic phage activity and the tertiary endpoint was the impact of oral phage on quantitative diarrhea parameters. Oral coliphage reached the intestine, but did not achieve treatment effects over placebo most likely because intestinal <italic>E. coli</italic> titers were low and close to the replication threshold of coliphages. Microbiota analysis revealed a marked outgrowth of fecal streptococci during the acute phase of diarrhea.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants and Study Design</title><p>A prospective, single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical trial was undertaken to assess the safety and efficacy of T4-like phage cocktail compared to Microgen ColiProteus phage cocktail or placebo in 6&#x02013;24-month-old male (to obtain stool without urine contamination) children presenting with acute onset of dehydrating diarrhea of less than 48&#x000a0;h duration. The study took place at the Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) between June 2009 and September 2011. The trial was approved by the Research Review Committee and Ethical Review Committee of icddr,b (protocol #2008-062) and registered with the Identifier NCT00937274 at the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="ir0010">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> site.

Written informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians of the child before study enrollment. The T4 phage cocktail contained eleven T4-like phages (AB2, 4, 6, 11, 46, 50, 55; JS34, 37, 98, D1.4) (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Bourdin et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Bourdin et al., 2014b</xref>).

The placebo was reduced osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS) supplemented with zinc, the standard treatment for uncomplicated watery diarrhea at icddr,b. The primary outcome of the safety part of the study was the acceptability of the phage products by the patients as determined by clinical observation and liver, renal and hematology tests described previously (<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Sarker et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">McCallin et al., 2013</xref>). The secondary endpoint was the determination of coliphage and total <italic>E. coli</italic> titers and their phage susceptibility in stool and the clearance of ETEC from stool. The tertiary outcome was changes in total stool output (expressed as g/kg of body weight per day), frequency of stool (number/day) and ORS need for rehydration (in ml/kg body weight per day) from randomization to resolution of illness.</p><p>Children with at least four liquid stools during the previous 24&#x000a0;h, with some degree of dehydration (WHO methodology) were considered for study enrollment after obtaining informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Randomization</title><p>A random permuted block design (with block size of 6) (to equalize the number of patients in the two treatment groups after short intervals) was used for allocation of patients to the study interventions, namely the two active products, <italic>i.e.</italic> T4 coliphage cocktail, Microgen phage cocktail in ORS or placebo (0.9% NaCl) at a 1:1:1 ratio. The icddr,b hospital pharmacist, not associated with the study in any other way, prepared the products and handed it over to the study nurse unaware of the product for dispensing to the patients following a computer-generated list of random numbers developed by an independent biostatistician not associated with the study. Code envelopes were kept by the sponsor and by the investigator for un-blinding in emergency situations and after the blind review meeting. The subjects, principal investigator, hospital staff and laboratory personnel were masked to the treatment assignments. After mixing phage or placebo with ORS powders in 30&#x000a0;ml mineral water (Vittel mineral water, pH&#x000a0;7.6, bicarbonate 384&#x000a0;mg/l) and a food dye, the interventions products were indistinguishable.

Freshly passed stool was obtained daily at about 4&#x000a0;pm (the time was kept fixed as the first dose was fed exactly at 4&#x000a0;pm) for quantitative colony counts of <italic>E. coli</italic> on EMB and MacConkey agar plates, total bacterial count by qPCR (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Nadkarni et al., 2002</xref>) and microbiota analysis. Three putative <italic>E. coli</italic> colonies from day 1 stool agar plates were tested for sensitivity to the applied phage cocktails at NRC, Switzerland.</p><p>The nursing staff recorded the frequency, consistency and volume of stool and urine passed every six hours (to a sensitivity of 1&#x000a0;g). This was achieved through a combination of placing the subject on a cholera cot and collecting urine in a pediatric urine collection bag. The data collected from this procedure was also used to calculate amounts of ORS solution required to account for fluid losses due to diarrhea. Stool frequency was counted by the study nurse and consistency of every stool passed was recorded. The passage of the last abnormal (watery) stool prior to formed or soft or no stool produced during two consecutive 6-hour periods were used to estimate the duration of diarrhea. Feeding appropriate for age was introduced early as <italic>ad libitum</italic> breastfeeding (for breast fed children) or formula feeding (for non-breast fed children) or standardized hospital diet to provide approximately 100&#x000a0;kcal per kg body weight per day.</p><p>If diarrhea continued beyond five days, treatment was judged a failure and the child was transferred to the general ward of the hospital for further management following the hospital's standard protocol.

T4-like coliphages are obligate lytic viruses, their genomes are well characterized and devoid of bacterial virulence genes and they were propagated on a safe production strain (<italic>E. coli</italic> K-12, itself devoid of virulence genes and inducible prophages) (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Denou et al., 2009</xref>). However, the <italic>in vivo</italic> replication potential of T4 was previously only explored in mice where it was found to be inferior to T7 phage (<xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Weiss et al., 2009</xref>). Whether the prolonged T7 phage excretion is an advantage for PT over the shorter elimination time of T4 phage (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Bruttin and Br&#x000fc;ssow, 2005</xref>) is currently unclear. The commercial Russian phage cocktail consisted of at least 17 different phage types including T7 phage (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">McCallin et al., 2013</xref>). The Microgen recipients showed indeed a higher fecal phage titer than T4 recipients, but they did not show a higher prevalence of T7 over T4 in the stool. The higher fecal output in the M recipients is partly explained by a higher oral phage input.</p><p>In acute cases of <italic>E. coli</italic> diarrhea, the barrier function of the gut mucosa in the small intestine is compromised. When the pathogen is lysed by phage, <italic>in vivo</italic> released endotoxins and enterotoxins can thus potentially cross into the circulation. However, no systemic reaction to endotoxin was observed (<xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2010</xref>) which is not surprising since no significant <italic>in vivo</italic> replication of the phage was seen, hence no significant lysis of cells with concomitant toxin release had occurred. While oral coliphages as virions are safe in diarrhea patients, it is still unclear whether oral phages are safe when acting as infectious virus lysing the <italic>E. coli</italic> target cell in the gut of diarrhea patients.</p><p>Neither the T4-like nor the Russian coliphage cocktail showed a clinical benefit over standard care in terms of stool output, stool frequency or rehydration. This observation should be interpreted with caution since it could still represent a false-negative outcome because at interim analysis only half of the planned patients were enrolled. The reported trial was thus not powered to detect a treatment effect, but only to assess safety issues and to gain a mechanistic insight into PT. Notably, we did not observe a substantial <italic>in vivo</italic> replication of the orally applied phage which is a basic requirement for PT. Despite a careful screening, only 60% of the 120 enrolled patients harbored an <italic>E. coli</italic> pathogen in the stool. <italic>E. coli</italic> is thus a less frequent cause of diarrhea (18% of all screened patients) than we had anticipated for Bangladeshi children (36% of all screened patients) (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Albert et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, even in microbiologically defined <italic>E. coli</italic> diarrhea less than 5% of the total fecal bacteria were <italic>E. coli</italic>. When only ETEC pathogens were counted, a median titer of 10<sup>5</sup>&#x000a0;cfu ETEC per g stool was detected. With an estimated <italic>in vivo</italic> burst size of 10 (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Br&#x000fc;ssow, 2013</xref>), no phage amplification beyond 10<sup>6</sup> pfu/g stool was therefore expected, which is close to the observed peak fecal phage titers. That a microbiologically defined <italic>E. coli</italic> diarrhea was not characterized by high intestinal pathogen titers can also be deduced from the observation that ETEC and EAEC infections in the present study showed only 10-fold higher fecal <italic>E. coli</italic> titers than diarrhea patients lacking an <italic>E. coli</italic> pathogen. Likewise, careful quantitative PCR analysis in stools from Peruvian children with EPEC diarrhea showed titers of 3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>5</sup>&#x000a0;EPEC/g stool which were just 10-fold higher than EPEC titers in healthy controls (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Barletta et al., 2011</xref>). Since the <italic>in vitro</italic> replication threshold for T4 phage on a laboratory indicator <italic>E. coli</italic> strain was determined to 10<sup>3</sup>&#x000a0;cfu/ml (<xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Wiggins and Alexander, 1985</xref>), the pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> titer in confirmed cases of <italic>E. coli</italic> diarrhea might simply not be high enough to sustain phage replication <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>From our data it is impossible to predict what percentage of the diarrheal episodes is caused by <italic>E. coli</italic>. Only a minority of the screened children had an <italic>E. coli</italic> diarrhea by standard tests. Even less showed a high fecal abundance of <italic>E. coli</italic> by molecular tests and stool titrations. We cannot deduce from our data whether a low abundance bacterial group could be responsible for diarrhea in children. However, to overcome limitations for future phage therapy trials, we strongly recommend to control first and foremost whether the targeted pathogen occurs with sufficient titers to support <italic>in vivo</italic> phage replication.</p><p>There are still other limitations which have to be considered when interpreting the negative clinical outcome of the present study. Only half of the patients contained phage-sensitive <italic>E. coli</italic> colonies in the stool. The Russian phage cocktail was obviously not customized to the regional patients and we had to adapt our T4 phage cocktail to the ecological situation in Bangladesh to achieve a reasonable coverage (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Bourdin et al., 2014b</xref>). Since the phages were isolated several years before the start of the trial, a constant adaption of the phage cocktail to the prevailing ecological situation is needed. However, it is not clear whether phage coverage was indeed the limiting factor in the current trial since the phage susceptibility of the stool isolates did not correlate with fecal phage titers. Both phage preparations were given without antacid. Buffering of gastric acidity by a slightly alkaline mineral water was perhaps too weak and an additional dose of bicarbonate as recommended by the commercial supplier might have increased phage transit through the stomach. Since it would also increase the risk of nosocomial cross-infection in a diarrhea hospital, such a treatment was excluded for ethical reasons. However, we do not believe that pharmaceutic formulation of the phage was a limiting factor in the current trial since children have a higher (more alkaline) stomach pH than adults. Indeed, in previous trials sensitive biologicals were given to children with diarrhea (antibodies, probiotics), which were recovered intact from the feces (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Hilpert et al., 1987</xref>) or achieved clinical effects in Bangladesh (<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Sarker et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Sarker et al., 2005</xref>). However, a higher oral phage dose might be desirable since children in Bangladesh showed a less good fecal bioavailability of phage than adults from Switzerland (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Bruttin and Br&#x000fc;ssow, 2005</xref>) suggesting some loss during gastrointestinal passage.</p><p>Regarding the lack of <italic>in vivo</italic> susceptibility of <italic>E. coli</italic> to coliphages, several factors need consideration. Prominent are physical barriers for phages to reach <italic>E. coli</italic> (increased peristalsis in diarrhea, reduced phage diffusion rate in mucus layer, pathogen protection in biofilms) or slow growth rate of bacterial cells in the stationary phase (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Br&#x000fc;ssow, 2013</xref>). It will be important to study <italic>E. coli-</italic>phage interaction <italic>in vivo</italic> with animal experiments. However, <italic>E. coli</italic> does not induce diarrhea in small laboratory animals and infections with <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> in mice, commonly used as a surrogate, are not a suitable model system since it induces a colitis (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Collins et al., 2014</xref>). Experiments in animals like piglets or calves which suffer naturally from <italic>E. coli</italic> infection in the small intestine and diarrhea (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Fairbrother et al., 2005</xref>) are clearly needed.</p><p>Another important limitation of our study is the question whether our observations in the fecal samples represent what is happening within the gut. From an analytical viewpoint it would be desirable to analyze bacteria and phages in samples from the upper small intestine. ETEC and EPEC infections occur in the upper parts of the gut and the bacteria excreted with stool might not any longer be in the same growth phase as in the small intestine (stationary <italic>vs.</italic> logarithmic growth). However, such sampling is invasive and ethically difficult to justify in a normally self-limiting disease in children. Again, dissection experiments in experimentally infected and phage-treated pigs might provide the needed insight. In fact, data from pig have supported the &#x0201c;kill-the-winner&#x0201d; model of phage&#x02013;bacterium population dynamics also for the gut ecosystem (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2011</xref>) suggesting that high titers of target bacteria are needed for PT.</p><p>ETEC showed only a short-lived stool peak titer which corresponds to recent reports describing in adult cholera patients from Bangladesh an even shorter peak titer of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> maintained for just 6&#x000a0;h (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Hsiao et al., 2014</xref>). Curiously, the peak titer of ETEC occurred on the second day of hospitalization as if ETEC was not the cause for hospital admission. In fact, the role of <italic>E. coli</italic> as a pathogen has recently been challenged for its low pathogenicity index. Only certain <italic>E. coli</italic> pathotypes in selected age groups of children and geographical areas were by this criterion significantly linked with diarrhea (<xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Taniuchi et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Kotloff et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, <italic>E. coli</italic> diarrhea in children from developing countries is increasingly considered as a polymicrobial infection (<xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Taniuchi et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Kotloff et al., 2013</xref>) as was also seen in the present study.</p><p>Microbiota analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed that only a small fraction of the stool microbiota from children hospitalized with a microbiologically diagnosed <italic>E. coli</italic> diarrhea were represented by <italic>Escherichia</italic>. At admission, the dominant stool bacteria were fecal streptococci independently whether ETEC, EAEC or non-<italic>E. coli</italic> diarrhea cases were considered. Comparison with healthy local controls suggests a marked streptococcal dysbiosis in the acute phase of diarrhea. Notably, the relative abundance of streptococci was positively correlated with stool output, it predicted the length of diarrhea duration and in EAEC or non-<italic>E. coli</italic> diarrhea it decreased with the resolution of diarrhea. Is a fecal streptococcal dysbiosis thus a potential biomarker for diarrhea? Since all these observations apply to the average of the studied population and not to individuals, who showed great variation, this marker is of limited use for the clinical microbiologist. However, fecal streptococci diagnosed as <italic>S. salivarius</italic> also represented a prominent part of the acute diarrhea microbiota in adult cholera patients from Bangladesh (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Hsiao et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> diarrhea in adults and children from Bangladesh showed an ordered gut microbiota succession and fecal streptococci belonged to this sequence (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">David et al., 2015</xref>). In the GEMS survey children from Bangladesh displayed a significant increase in fecal streptococci during diarrhea. This was, although at lower level, also observed in African children (<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Pop et al., 2014</xref>). Are fecal streptococci therefore candidate new enteropathogens as suggested by Chinese researchers (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2013</xref>)? This is unlikely for four reasons: first, using effluents from ileostoma patients, fecal streptococci of the <italic>S. bovis</italic> complex have been identified as typical small intestine commensal in humans (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Booijink et al., 2010</xref>). Fecal streptococci are fast-growing, efficient fermenters of simple carbohydrates (<xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">van den Bogert et al., 2013</xref>) possibly allowing a transient outgrowth when competing gut bacteria are purged from the gut by increased peristalsis in diarrhea. Second, no diarrhea-relevant virulence genes were detected in the three sequenced genomes of fecal streptococci isolated from diarrhea patients. Notably, a biologically proven virulence (pilus) gene identified in a <italic>S. gallolyticus</italic> isolated from an endocarditis patient (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Danne et al., 2011</xref>) was not detected in the stool isolates. Third, an increased abundance of <italic>S. gallolyticus</italic> was also seen in colon cancer patients (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Boleij and Tjalsma, 2013</xref>). Bacteria of the <italic>S. gallolyticus</italic> species complex might adhere to the chronically (colon cancer) or transiently (diarrhea) injured gut mucosa. Interestingly, the replacement of the streptococci by fecal bifidobacteria occurs with the same kinetics as the repair of the gut mucosa with newly synthesized enterocytes. Finally, the analysis of the fecal microbial community types showed that elevated fecal <italic>Streptococcus</italic> abundance had no pathogenic potential as long as they are counter-balanced by an elevated <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> abundance. This could mean that our understanding of diarrhea etiology will have to change in the future: not only need quantitative pathogen titers to be determined, pathogen constellations and pathogens interactions with commensal bacteria need to be considered for the understanding of diarrhea. In our dataset, loss of bifidobacteria was in fact the best biomarker for diarrhea.</p><p>Based on these considerations and the presented microbiological and clinical observations, we decided to stop the PT trial at interim analysis. In summary, while phage therapy is still one very important alternative tool against antibiotic resistance, we need to understand in detail the <italic>in vivo</italic> interactions between phage and its host bacterium to judge the reliability and efficacy of such approaches. At the moment it is risky to conclude whether phage therapy is or is not a viable option against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s0115"><title>Competing Interests</title><p>The authors listed under institutions b and c are paid employees of the two specified research centers of Nestec Ltd., but have otherwise no financial interest in phage therapy.</p><p>The sponsor (Nestl&#x000e9; Nutrition and Nestl&#x000e9; Health Science) was not involved in data evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s0120"><title>Author Contribution</title><p>SAS is the PI of the clinical study responsible for study design, protocol writing, for defense of the protocol to institutional review boards, data collection tool development, data analysis, interpretation and manuscript writing; SS is the Co-PI of the clinical study responsible for defending the protocol at IRB, data collection tool development and data collection; GR did stool phage counting and streptococcal isolation; DM did library preparation, the sequencing and the assembly of the Strep genomes; PD did design the <italic>de novo</italic> genome assembly and data interpretation; FC did the phage susceptibility testing of fecal <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates; GB did the T4-like coliphages cocktail development, GMP production and release; SMC did the PCR detection of <italic>E. coli</italic> virulence genes in stool DNA; CN-B contributed to the bioinformatic analysis of the microbiota and the streptococcal genomes; TN did the statistical analysis; MA did the viable <italic>E. coli</italic> counts in fresh stools; SH collected the clinical data; FQ contributed to study design, data interpretation and supervised the etiology analysis in the clinical microbiology lab; KT did clinical microbiology data collection; MK did streptococcal genome data submission and annotation; MD did the qPCR analysis of <italic>elt</italic> and <italic>est</italic> genes; CL did the qPCR of total stool bacteria; YD searched the streptococcal genomes for virulence genes; SEA did the Dirichlet Multinomial Mixtures analysis; BB did acquisition, analysis and interpretation of microbiota data, and contributed to the writing of manuscript; HB designed with the PI the clinical protocol, coordinated and supervised the project and wrote the manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ahmed</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhuiyan</surname><given-names>T.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zaman</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sinclair</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Qadri</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Vaccines for preventing enterotoxigenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ETEC) diarrhoea</article-title><source>Cochrane Database Syst.
