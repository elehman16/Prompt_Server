Propofol as a single agent is unsatisfactory and to overcome problems associated with LMA insertions. In the present study, we evaluated the haemodynamic changes and laryngeal mask airway insertion conditions comparing ketamine and opioids as adjuncts to propofol.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Patients and Methods:</title><p>90 patients were randomly divided into 3 groups of 30 each. In Group PK-ketamine 0.5mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, in Group PF-fentanyl 1ug kg<sup>-1</sup> and in Group PB - butorphanol 20ug kg<sup>-1</sup> was given intravenously immediately before induction with propofol 2.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>.

The incidence of absolute jaw relaxation was highest in Group PB (93.33%) patients, intermediate in Group PF (53.33%) patients and lowest in Group PK i.e. 36.66% patients. Excellent insertion conditions were observed in 12 (40%) patients in Group PK and 13 (43.33%) patients in Group PF and in 26 (86.67%) patients in Group PB.

Propofol, when used alone often exceeds 2.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> which causes cardiorespiratory depression.

Written informed consent was taken from all patients and they were randomly divided into 3 groups of 30 each as follows: GROUP PK (Propofol - Ketamine), GROUP PF (Propofol - Fentanyl) and Group PB (Propofol - Butorphanol).</p><p>

</p><p>All the patients were premedicated with glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intramuscularly 30 minutes before the surgery. After pre-oxygenation with 100% oxygen for 3 minutes, patients were given midazolam 0.04 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> intravenously. Then they were given their assigned drugs over 10 seconds i.e. Group PK - Inj. ketamine 0.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> intravenous, Group PF - Inj. Fentanyl 1 ug kg<sup>-1</sup>intravenous and Group PB - Inj. butorphanol 20 ug kg<sup>-1</sup> intravenous</p><p>This was followed immediately by propofol 2.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> intravenously over 15 seconds. If required, further increments of propofol 0.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> were given every 30 seconds until loss of consciousness and loss of eyelash reflex. Insertion of LMA was performed 60 seconds after injection of propofol by a blinded investigator.</p><p>Patients were given additional bolus dose of propofol 0.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> on first unsuccessful attempt. Insertion was tried to a maximum of 3 attempts. However, the conditions during laryngeal mask airway insertion were only graded at the first attempt. Patients were kept on spontaneous respiration. Anaesthesia was maintained with 0.75 to 1% of Halothane, 60% and O2 40%. At the completion of surgery N2O and halothane was stopped and LMA was removed. Any other observations like lacrimation, vomiting or injury was noted. 100% oxygen was continued via face mask till recovery. Heart rate, NIBP and SPO2 were recorded pre-induction and immediately after induction of anaesthesia and later at one minute, three minutes, five minutes, ten minutes, every fifteen minutes intervals till the end of the surgery. ECG monitoring was done to record any arrhythmias.</p><p>Following parameters were noted during insertion of LMA</p><p>

To reduce pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes higher doses of propofol are used which cause cardiac depression,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> so to reduce its adverse cardiorespiratory depressant effects a number of other co-induction drugs were introduced among which we compared butorphanol, fentanyl and ketamine.</p><p>In our study too, the propofol requirement was significantly less in butorphanol group (140.08 &#x000b1; 18.97 mg) as compared to fentanyl group (156.22 &#x000b1; 17.18 mg). Supporting our study, the mean dose of thiopentone required in study conducted by Chari P et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> was significantly less in butorphanol group as compared to fentanyl group. They also found significantly less apnoea time in butorphanol group (33.60 seconds) as compared to fentanyl group (56.12 seconds) as shown by our results. The slightly longer duration of apnoea in our study may be due to premedication with midazolam which we used in our study whereas in the above study no premedication was given and it is a well known fact that benzodiazepines enhance the respiratory depressant effects of opioids.</p><p>Lower incidence of apnoea in butorphanol may be because of limited respiratory depression of butorphanol due to receptor specificity and mu antagonism.</p><p>Cheam EWS and Chui PT found that although fentanyl improves conditions during laryngeal mask airway insertion, it also prolongs the duration of apnea.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></p><p>In our study, the incidence of absolute jaw relaxation was highest in Group PB 28 (93.33%), intermediate in Group PF 16 (53.33%) and lowest in Group PK 11 patients (36.66%). Our results are consistent with the study conducted by Pramila Chari and Babita Ghai<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> in which they compared jaw relaxation on 3 point scale for LMA insertion. Their results showed that butorphanol - thiopentone group (92.30%) had significantly higher incidence of full jaw relaxation as compared to fentanyl - thiopentone group (67.30%). (p value 0.001).</p><p>Bahk J et al had compared various doses of propofol and ketamine with lidocaine spray for LMA insertion. They had experienced lesser degree of jaw relaxation with ketamine doses lower than 3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p><p>The Group PB showed significantly lower number of attempts as compared to Group PK and Group PF. This may be because of better jaw relaxation in the butorphanol group.</p><p>The higher incidence of coughing and gagging in the ketamine group in our study may be because of its property to increase airway reflexes and hence inappropriate for LMA insertion.</p><p>The higher incidence of coughing in the fentanyl group may be due to fact that bolus injections of intravenous fentanyl commonly induce patient coughing. In a study conducted by Wong CM et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> higher doses of fentanyl were associated with a notable increase in the incidence of coughing. We observed lower incidence of coughing gagging in butorphanol group as compared to fentanyl group. This is probably because of the antitussive action of butorphanol.</p><p>Excellent insertion conditions were observed in butorphanol group as compared to fentanyl and ketamine group. Our results are consistent with the results of Chari P, et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> who have found statistically significant difference in the ease of insertion of LMA in the thiopentone - butorphanol group and thiopentone - fentanyl group. Best insertion conditions were seen in 92.30% of butorphanol group and 74.15% in fentanyl group. Better insertion conditions in the butorphanol group are due to better jaw relaxation and easy insertion, lesser incidence of coughing and gagging.</p><p>Wong CM et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> have studied 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 ug kg<sup>-1</sup> fentanyl with 2.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> propofol for LMA insertion. Their results showed that a standard fentanyl dose of 1 ug kg<sup>-1</sup> co-administered with propofol 2.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, provided optimal conditions in 65% of cases only.</p><p>Group PK showed more rise in systolic and diastolic blood pressure post LMA insertion as compared to Group PF and Group PB which is explained by the indirect action via the sympathomimetic effect of ketamine. Our results are consistent with the study done by Goh PK et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> in which ketamine showed higher mean arterial pressure and heart rate throughout the study period as compared to the fentanyl group.</p><p>Mishra LD et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> noted a significant fall in heart rate following midazolam and butorphanol. We did not observe bradycardia in our patients probably because we had used anticholinergic in premedication which was not used in their study.</p><p>To conclude, the addition of butorphanol to Propofol for LMA insertion provides absolute jaw relaxation and excellent insertion conditions with stable haemodynamics Side effects like coughing, gagging, lacrimation and laryngospasm were lower as compared to the other two groups. So, Butorphanol is a good adjuvant with propofol for LMA insertion.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Authors disclosure</bold> Authors have no conflict of interest and financial considerations.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brimcombe</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><name><surname>Berry</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The Laryngeal Mask Airway.
