It is approved for twice-daily (b.i.d.) use in combination with other antiretroviral drugs in patients with CCR5-tropic (R5) HIV-1 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">[2,3]</xref>.</p><p>The efficacy and safety of once-daily (q.d.) or b.i.d. treatment with MVC vs. efavirenz (EFV), each in combination with fixed-dose zidovudine/lamivudine (ZDV/3TC), was evaluated in the Maraviroc vs. Efavirenz Regimens as Initial Therapy (MERIT) study in treatment-naive patients with R5 HIV-1. The MVC q.d. arm of this study was discontinued following a planned interim analysis, conducted after 205 patients had completed 16 weeks of therapy, for not meeting prespecified efficacy criteria <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Efficacy analysis at 48 weeks demonstrated that MVC b.i.d. was not noninferior to EFV for the primary endpoint of viral load below 50&#x0200a;copies/ml (65.3 vs. 69.3%), with a predefined noninferiority margin of 10%. In a post-hoc re-analysis that included 614 patients with confirmed R5 virus at screening, as determined using a more sensitive tropism assay <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, the lower bound of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between treatment arms was above 10% for this endpoint <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Similar efficacy results were obtained at 96 weeks <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Furthermore, patients receiving MVC also had a greater increase in CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count compared with EFV at both 48 and 96 weeks, and MVC was safe and well tolerated <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">[4,6]</xref>. In a separate study, MVC has been shown to be well tolerated, and also to have durable efficacy in treatment-experienced patients with R5 HIV-1 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">[7,8]</xref>.</p><p>As durability of virologic response is a critical factor in the long-term success of an antiretroviral treatment regimen, it is important to evaluate long-term efficacy outcomes in clinical studies. Long-term data also play an important role in establishing confidence in the safety of new antiretroviral therapies. Long-term clinical safety follow-up is especially warranted in the study of new agents in a class, and for MVC in particular, based on some initial concerns regarding its novel mechanism of action and the potential untoward, downstream immunologic consequences of its blocking of CCR5. As CCR5 is an important part of the human chemokine system, it was important to ensure that there was no increase in malignancies or infections with MVC treatment <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">[7,9&#x02013;13]</xref>. Furthermore, the development of another CCR5 antagonist, aplaviroc, was discontinued due to hepatotoxicity in early clinical studies <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. With this in mind, the MERIT study was designed to include an open-label extension following unblinding after the last patient's 96-week visit. Here we report findings from the open-label phase of the MERIT study extending to 240 weeks (nominal 5-year visit).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and treatment</title><p>The MERIT study was approved by the institutional review boards/independent ethics committees of each participating site. The study was conducted in compliance with the principles originating or derived from the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with all International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and local regulatory requirements, and is listed on www.clinicaltrials.gov with identifier NCT00098293. All patients provided written informed consent. The first patient entered the study in November 2004 and recruitment was completed in April 2006.</p><p>Study design has been reported in detail elsewhere <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">[4,6]</xref>. Briefly, in this randomized, double-blind, active-comparator multicenter, phase IIb/III study, treatment-naive patients (aged at least 16 years) with R5 HIV-1, as determined using the original Trofile assay (Monogram Biosciences, South San Francisco, California, USA), and with plasma viral load (HIV-1 RNA) above 2000&#x0200a;copies/ml, received MVC 300&#x0200a;mg q.d., MVC 300&#x0200a;mg b.i.d., or EFV 600&#x0200a;mg q.d., each in combination with ZDV/3TC 300&#x0200a;mg/150&#x0200a;mg b.i.d. Key exclusion criteria included prior treatment with EFV, ZDV, 3TC, or any antiretroviral for more than 14 days at any time, and evidence of resistance to EFV, ZDV, or 3TC, as indicated by the presence of at least one nucleoside-associated mutations conferring resistance to ZDV (including M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, and K219Q/E/N) or phenotypic resistance to ZDV, multinucleoside resistant genotype (including the Q151M complex and codon 67&#x02013;69 inserts), at least one mutation conferring resistance to 3TC (including M184V/I, E44D, V118I) or phenotypic resistance to 3TC, or at least one mutation responsible for EFV resistance (including K103N, Y181C/I, Y188C/L/H, G190A/S, V106A, L100I, A98G, K101E, V108I, P225H, and M230L) or phenotypic resistance to EFV. Furthermore, patients with underlying medical conditions that could lead to reduced tolerability to study treatment [creatinine &#x0003e;3&#x000d7; the upper limit of normal (ULN), creatinine clearance &#x0003c;50&#x0200a;ml/min, bilirubin &#x0003e;2&#x000d7; ULN, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &#x0003e;3&#x000d7; ULN, liver cirrhosis, absolute neutrophil count &#x02264;750&#x0200a;cells/&#x003bc;l, platelet count &#x02264;50&#x0200a;000&#x0200a;cells/&#x003bc;l, and hemoglobin &#x02264;7&#x0200a;g/dl] were excluded. Additionally, patients with any safety, behavioral, clinical, or administrative reasons that, in the investigator's judgment, would potentially compromise study compliance or the ability to evaluate safety/efficacy were excluded.</p><p>Following a planned analysis at week 16, the MVC q.d. arm was discontinued for not meeting prespecified efficacy criteria, and the study continued with two treatment arms. The sponsor was unblinded at the 48-week analysis time point, but the investigators and patients remained blinded until the 96-week analysis. The study was then fully unblinded following the last patient's 96-week visit, and patients were enrolled in a nominal 3-year open-label phase. Efficacy and safety data from the 240-week (nominal 5-year) study duration are presented for the MVC b.i.d. and EFV treatment arms in this paper.</p></sec><sec><title>Study assessments and statistical analysis</title><p>Blood samples (10&#x0200a;ml) were collected throughout the study, including at 12-weekly visits during the open-label phase, and were analyzed by a central laboratory (Covance) for plasma viral load and immunological status. Key efficacy endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving plasma viral load less than 50 and less than 400&#x0200a;copies/ml, and change from baseline in CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count, as reported previously <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Five-year efficacy analyses of the MVC b.i.d. and EFV q.d. arms were based on the cohort of patients who received at least one dose of study medication and who were confirmed as having R5 HIV-1 infection following re-testing of screening samples using the enhanced sensitivity Trofile assay (Trofile-ES), which had replaced the original assay <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Efficacy data were summarized by treatment arm and by visit time point. For binary endpoints (plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 and less than 400 copies/ml), patients with missing data were treated as nonresponders, whereas for continuous data (CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count change from baseline), a last observation carried forward paradigm was used. Both means and medians (and associated measures of variation) were calculated for CD4<sup>+</sup> analyses. Prespecified subgroup analyses by screening viral load, baseline CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count, geographic location (northern vs. southern hemisphere), and virus subtype (clade) were performed. Additional subgroup analyses were conducted based on age, sex, and race.</p><p>Safety assessments included adverse-event monitoring, laboratory evaluations, and vital signs measurement. Additionally, a retrospective identification of the following sponsor-defined long-term survival and selected endpoints was conducted: hepatic failure, myocardial infarction/cardiac ischemia, malignancies, category C AIDS-defining events, serious infectious events, and rhabdomyolysis.</p><p>Due to staggered study entry, some patients reached their week 96 visit prior to the last patient and thus had the opportunity for an open-label treatment period that was longer than the nominal 3 years. For safety analysis, all available data were included, and variables were summarized descriptively by treatment arm.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Patient disposition and reasons for discontinuation through 96 weeks have been reported in detail previously <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and are summarized in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.

Other commonly reported adverse events (&#x02265;20% of patients, either arm) included dizziness (MVC 17.2% vs. EFV 32.1%) and headache (MVC 30.3% vs. EFV 29.1%). The most commonly treatment-related adverse events (&#x02265;10% of patients, either arm) were nausea (MVC 30.8% vs. EFV 28.5%), headache (MVC 19.4% vs. EFV 18.0%), dizziness (MVC 11.9% vs. EFV 28.0%), fatigue (MVC 10.6% vs. EFV 9.1%), diarrhea (MVC 8.9% vs. EFV 14.7%), vomiting (MVC 7.8% vs. EFV 10.5%), and abnormal dreams (MVC 5.8% vs. EFV 12.5%). Dizziness, rash and pregnancy each led to the discontinuation of eight patients (2.2%) in the EFV treatment arm. Pregnancy also led to the discontinuation of eight patients (2.2%) in the MVC arm. No other adverse event resulted in the discontinuation of at least 2% of patients in this arm.</p><p>The incidence of clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (including grade 3 and 4 abnormalities) was similar for the MVC and EFV treatment arms: grade 3 or 4 adverse events of increased ALT were observed in eight patients in the MVC arm (2.2%) and five patients in the EFV arm (1.4%), and led to discontinuation of four patients in each arm. Four patients in the MVC treatment arm, and three patients in the EFV q.d. treatment arm met the criteria for Hy's law (bilirubin &#x0003e;2&#x000d7; ULN and ALT &#x0003e;3&#x000d7; ULN or AST &#x0003e;3&#x000d7; ULN) <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Incidences and exposure-adjusted rates of long-term survival and selected endpoints, defined based on identified potential safety issues and theoretical concerns related to the mechanism of action of MVC b.i.d., are presented in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Importantly, there was no evidence of an increased incidence of malignancies, serious infectious events, or category C AIDS-defining events with MVC vs. EFV. No patient in either the MVC b.i.d. or EFV treatment arm experienced hepatic failure; however, one patient in the discontinued MVC q.d. group developed hepatic failure that required a liver transplant. This was considered most likely to be due to hepatotoxicity by concomitantly administered isoniazid and/or co-trimoxazole, but a contributing role for MVC could not be excluded <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>These data from the phase IIb/III MERIT study demonstrate that MVC b.i.d. has comparable long-term efficacy to EFV q.d. throughout 5 years of follow-up, and extend and reinforce the efficacy and safety results from this study at the 48 and 96 weeks time points <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">[4,6]</xref>.</p><p>This is the first report of the long-term safety of MVC in treatment-naive patients. Although the immunologic response in patients receiving EFV in the MERIT study is consistent with what was seen in other long-term studies with EFV (increase of 225&#x02013;295 cells/&#x003bc;l after 3&#x02013;4 years), the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA less than 50&#x0200a;copies/ml was relatively lower <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">[16&#x02013;18]</xref>. For example, in the randomized, controlled phase III STARTMRK (raltegravir versus efavirenz, each with tenofovir/emtricitabine) study of raltegravir compared with EFV, each in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine, 68% of patients receiving EFV in the STARTMRK study had HIV-1 RNA less than 50&#x0200a;copies/ml at week 156 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Similarly, in a study comparing rilpivirine with EFV, 61% of patients receiving EFV had HIV-1 RNA less than 50&#x0200a;copies/ml at week 192 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The differences observed across studies are likely to be attributable to procedural and population differences (e.g. statistical analysis methods, and patient race and sex), as well as the different backbone nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.</p><p>In both treatment-naive and experienced R5 HIV-1-infected patients, treatment with MVC consistently resulted in a greater CD4<sup>+</sup> cell response than comparator <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">[4,6,7,20]</xref>. These findings are consistent with a meta-analysis of CCR5 antagonist studies, indicating that patients taking a CCR5 antagonist gain more CD4<sup>+</sup> cells than those not taking a CCR5 antagonist, independent of degree of virologic suppression <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The MERIT data reported in this study also demonstrated that the greater CD4<sup>+</sup> cell increases seen in MVC-treated patients compared with EFV-treated patients at weeks 48 and 96 were maintained over longer-term follow-up out to 240 weeks, and were, therefore, unlikely to be due to short-term cell redistribution. The clinical significance of this difference is unknown.</p><p>Hypothetical concerns have been raised regarding the potential immunologic consequences of blocking the human CCR5 co-receptor <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. These concerns were further reinforced by reports of an increased frequency of malignancies observed in patients receiving vicriviroc <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">[11,12]</xref>, another investigational CCR5 antagonist, and by reports of deleterious outcomes in patients with the CCR5 delta 32 mutation following infections with certain viruses, including West Nile and yellow fever <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">[22&#x02013;24]</xref>. On the contrary, the CCR5 delta 32 deletion has been associated with a reduced incidence of rheumatoid arthritis and delayed progression of hepatitis C <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">[25,26]</xref>. Additionally, in HIV-infected individuals, the delta 32 deletion has been associated with reduced HIV disease progression and reduced risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and certain opportunistic infections <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">[27&#x02013;30]</xref>. The 5-year data presented here, together with the 2 and 5-year follow-up data from treatment-experienced patients in the Maraviroc versus Optimal Therapy in Viremic Antiretroviral Treatment-Experienced Patients (MOTIVATE) studies <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">[7,8]</xref>, do not reveal any excess of infections (either CDC category or other infections) or malignancies, thereby providing long-term data of blocking the CCR5 receptor.</p><p>Concerns regarding the safety of CCR5 antagonists as a class were also raised following reports of hepatotoxicity with aplaviroc <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, another investigational CCR5 antagonist, which led to the termination of its further clinical development. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that CCR5 deficiency exacerbated T-cell-mediated hepatitis in mice, further increasing concerns that hepatotoxicity may be a class effect of CCR5 antagonists <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. However, the long-term follow-up of patients participating in the MERIT and MOTIVATE studies <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> indicates no increased risk of hepatotoxicity in patients receiving MVC over time <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In this study, safety data for the open-label period, and for the overall 5-year study period, were broadly comparable to the blinded period.</p><p>In conclusion, these data demonstrate that, in treatment-naive patients with confirmed R5 HIV-1 infection, patients receiving MVC maintained similar virologic responses to those receiving EFV throughout the 5-year study. Additionally, patients receiving MVC had improved immunologic responses, and this advantage was maintained through week 240. Reassuringly, the data confirmed the long-term safety of MVC and did not reveal any new or emerging safety concerns.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Editorial support was provided by Lynsey Stevenson of Complete Medical Communications Limited.
