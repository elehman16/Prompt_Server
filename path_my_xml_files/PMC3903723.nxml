It is a suitable model for investigating sepsis under controlled conditions. Endotoxaemia results in an increase in the plasma levels of pro-inflammatory mediators/marker (YKL-40, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6) and anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-1Ra, IL-10, sTNF-RI and sTNF-RII) <xref rid="pone.0087413-Andreasen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087413-Dinarello1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The endotoxaemia generates free radicals (e.g. reactive oxygen species) that induce an oxidative stress response, resulting in cell and tissue damage, called oxidative damage.

The trial consisted of two study days. On the first day, 0.3 ng/kg of <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS (Lot G3E069; US Pharmacopeia Convention, Rockville, MD, USA) was administered at 12 noon. In the second study, the same dose was given at 12 midnight. The participants were excluded if one of these criteria were present: Any use of tobacco, alcohol abuse, any medication, or overt infection. Individuals were not included if they suffered from chronic diseases, allergy against LPS endotoxin or insomnia, or if they had had any infections in the past 14 days before study initiation. Before inclusion, the subjects underwent a clinical examination to confirm that there were no unrecognized diseases. In the week before each study day, the participants were instructed not to take caffeine or alcohol and to sleep in a standardized manner (8 hours) between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m. A priori wash-out period between the two study days was 25 days and if the subjects had any sort of infection the wash out period was extended with at least two weeks from the last day of the infection. On each study day, intravenous catheters were inserted in both cubital veins. LPS endotoxin was administered as intravenous bolus injections. Blood samples were obtained at baseline, i.e. before the onset of endotoxaemia, and 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after LPS injection. All subjects were monitored hourly during the endotoxaemic phase with measurements of blood pressure, temperature, and heart rate. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured using Micro life BP A100 Plus (Microlife, Widnau, Switzerland), and temperature was measured by tympanic thermometer Genius 2 (Covidien Ilc, Boulder, CO, USA).</p><p>All subjects had a private room. During night time endotoxaemia the subjects were assigned to follow the same sleep pattern as kept before each study day, i.e. 8 hours of sleep between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m. Subjects slept in complete darkness. Blood samples and vital parameters during night were taken with a pen light directed away from the patient eyes to minimize both disturbance and light exposure. The subjects were prohibited to drink any caffeine-containing beverages (coffee, tea) and alcohol on both experimental days.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Laboratory analyses</title><sec id="s2c1"><title>Inflammatory markers</title><p>Blood was drawn into tubes containing EDTA and centrifuged at 3,100 G for 3 minutes and then stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0; C until analysis.

The strong anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, and the MDA as a parameter for oxidative damage was higher during day-time endotoxaemia.

Sepsis generally occurs in a heterogeneous group of patients, with or without prior surgical interventions, and frequently with multiple comorbidities. This complicates the interpretation of clinical investigations of sepsis pathophysiology, and it obstructs development of therapies for this potentially lethal condition. In humans, the most used and reliable model to study systemic inflammatory response is the human endotoxin model, in which LPS from <italic>E. coli</italic> or other Gram-negative bacteria is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers <xref rid="pone.0087413-Andreasen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. LPS endotoxin binds to Toll-like receptors on both blood leukocytes and endothelial cells initiating synthesis and secretion of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as many other mediators <xref rid="pone.0087413-Andreasen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1beta are the archetype pro-inflammatory cytokines <xref rid="pone.0087413-Andreasen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087413-Dinarello1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

Measuring an increase in the oxidative stress-markers, such as reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, does not necessarily indicate an increase in the oxidative damage. Endotoxaemia induces both increased inflammatory stress response and oxidative stress response <xref rid="pone.0087413-Salvemini1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087413-Sakaguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

The MDA levels were higher during day time compared with night time. Endotoxaemia induced by LPS has previously been shown to increase levels of MDA <xref rid="pone.0087413-nl1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Daily variations in the levels of MDA are debatable, as there are studies reporting a circadian rhythm <xref rid="pone.0087413-Kosugi1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087413-Morera1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> while other studies questions this circadian rhythm <xref rid="pone.0087413-Kanabrocki1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. No day-night variation was seen in AA. In contrast to the inflammatory cytokine response, the changes in the oxidative stress response indicate an increase in the oxidative damage during day time compared with night time. This is contrary to the response in inflammation that was most pronounced during the night.</p><p>One of the explanations why the inflammatory response was more pronounced during the night might be due to the circadian rhythm of cortisol. The endogenous corticosteroid levels exhibits a circadian rhythm with a peak during day and lowest levels during the night <xref rid="pone.0087413-Marpegan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The anti-inflammatory effect of cortisol is thus lacking during the night, which might result in a more severe inflammatory response at night time <xref rid="pone.0087413-Pollmcher1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087413-Hermann1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. We did not measure the levels of corticosteroids in our study.</p><p>Another explanation of the diurnal variation in endotoxic response is the interaction between clock genes and LPS. Clock genes have been identified in several tissues and peripheral blood cells, including macrophages. In humans, the only study examining the effect of LPS on clock genes was made by Haimovich <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0087413-Haimovich1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. They found that LPS suppressed as much as 90% of the gene expression of PER1, PER2 and other clock genes in human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) for at least 17 hours. Furthermore, they demonstrated that melatonin secretion was not impaired by LPS, indicating that the circadian rhythm between the clock genes in the hypothalamus and clocks genes in PBL were disrupted by endotoxin <xref rid="pone.0087413-Haimovich1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. However, others have found that melatonin secretion from the pineal gland is inhibited and reduced by LPS and TNF-&#x003b1; <xref rid="pone.0087413-daSilveiraCruzMachado1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>
</p><p>Circadian variation in the inflammatory response to endotoxin may have serious clinical implications. For example, TNF-&#x003b1; administration to mice showed a nine-fold increase in the lethality through the day <xref rid="pone.0087413-Hrushesky1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The lethality was highest when TNF-&#x003b1; was administered just before awakening and the survival were highest when the administration was in the second half of the light period. Mortality was also higher when endotoxaemia was initiated in mice at day time compared with night time <xref rid="pone.0087413-Marpegan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. One explanation why these data do not correlate to our findings could be, that mice are physically active at the dark period of the day, while humans are physically active at the light period of the day. While humans are diurnally active, mice are active both day and night having an opposite rhythm of glucocorticoid compared to humans. The interaction between immune system and pineal gland was investigated in a recent study, where patients undergoing hysterectomy showed an inverse relation between plasma levels of melatonin and TNF-&#x003b1; <xref rid="pone.0087413-deOliveiraTatschDias1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Higher postoperative levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and lower levels of cortisol were accompanied by lower levels of melatonin.</p><p>In our study, we included only male subjects. Several aspects lead us to include solely men in this trial: the influences of the menstrual cycle on the levels of and the rhythmicity of melatonin and cortisol <xref rid="pone.0087413-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>; menstrual cycle is associated with fluctuations in melatonin production <xref rid="pone.0087413-Reiter1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>; endotoxin inhibits pulsatile LH and GnRH <xref rid="pone.0087413-Karsch1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>; endotoxin stimulated mononuclear cells from men produce more TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-10 and higher expression of TLR4 compared to women <xref rid="pone.0087413-Temple1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>; and finally the amount of released TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 from LPS-induced monocytes varies during the menstrual cycle, highest in the follicular phase and lowest in the luteal phase <xref rid="pone.0087413-Konecna1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087413-Schwarz1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p><p>Our trial was an experimental study with endotoxaemia, which imitates the initial phase of sepsis, and therefore cannot be used to study sepsis pathology beyond the acute phase response. We applied a dosage of LPS of 0.3 ng/kg b.w. in this trial, which induces a moderate acute phase response as seen in the levels of cytokines. Higher doses of endotoxin can initiate responses that may be resistant to day-night differences. Sepsis can also be initiated by different pathogen-associated molecular patterns other than LPS, i.e. peptidoglycan, which may initiate sepsis through other cellular pathways resulting in a different acute phase response. Body temperature measurement was assessed by ear thermometer which is influenced by several confounders. In this cross over study, the size of the study population was based on empiric estimation. A post-hoc power calculation based on mean and standard deviation for TNF-&#x003b1; on t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2, gives a 61% post-hoc power. Normally, the statistical power is set to be 80%. According to this post-hoc calculation, we need more than 18 subjects in each group to have an 80% statistical power.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that endotoxin-induced inflammatory and oxidative damage exhibit day-night difference, where the inflammatory response is more pronounced at night and the oxidative damage is more pronounced at daytime. Investigations of the circadian variations in inflammatory responses in humans appear warranted, also because of the prophylactic and therapeutic implications. Finally, because melatonin has been shown to have a potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effect in experimental studies, it could be interesting to investigate whether melatonin administration at night may reduce the inflammatory and oxidative damage associated with sepsis.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0087413-Habbal1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
