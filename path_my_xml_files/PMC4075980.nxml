During the 8-week-long treatment, a menopause rating scale, average 24-hour hot flash score, Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire score, and level of female hormones will be observed.

The needle in this trial is more simply constructed and more acceptable to Chinese people.

It is further divided into two phases: the &#x02018;early MT&#x02019; in which cycle lengths vary by more than 7&#x000a0;days from the typical length for the individual woman and the &#x02018;late MT&#x02019;&#x02009;, characterized by at least two skipped cycles and at least one period of amenorrhea exceeding 60&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Different symptoms appear during different phases of the MT period. Hot flashes are the most frequent symptom and the prevalence of flashes can be as high as 79% at the completion of menopause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Other symptoms include night sweats, sleep disturbances, vaginal dryness, urinary incontinence, weight gain, fatigue, irritability, and anxiety. Studies find that most women experience at least one or more of these symptoms as they transit through the postmenopausal stage of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Hormone therapy (HT) is the recommended drug for women with symptoms related to postmenopause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Because of its long-term risks, HT is no longer prescribed as preventive therapy, but rather for managing menopausal symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Treatment of the perimenopausal woman represents a greater challenge than the menopausal woman because of unpredictable and unstable ovarian function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A study of women&#x02019;s decision making during the MT has shown that participants believe that menopausal symptoms are best managed with a natural product rather than HT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>As part of complementary and alternative medicine, acupuncture has been used in many clinical trials in recent years. Existing studies have shown that acupuncture can alleviate postmenopausal-related symptoms, but we were unable to find many trials on the MT period. A review of acupuncture for treating menopausal hot flashes included six randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture, and they concluded that sham-controlled RCTs failed to show any specific effects of acupuncture for control of menopausal hot flashes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Two trials conducted separately in the United States and South Korea on perimenopausal and postmenopausal women showed acupuncture was beneficial for hot flashes, though it was not more effective than sham acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The limitations of the above two trials were that both trials had small samples (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;103 and n&#x02009;=&#x02009;175, respectively), they included both perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, treatment sessions were insufficient (one trial had 10 sessions in 5&#x000a0;weeks and the other 12 sessions in 4&#x000a0;weeks), and follow-up periods were short-term (7&#x000a0;weeks and 4&#x000a0;weeks). Another trial conducted in South Korea reached a similar conclusion that acupuncture failed to show significant effects on hot flash scores compared with sham acupuncture, but it showed partial benefits for hot flash severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Several trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] conducted in China demonstrated that electroacupuncture (EA) could reduce the Kupperman Index, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH), and increase estradiol (E2), but none of these trials used a sham control or had follow-up. In sum, most trials so far have focused on hot flashes in postmenopausal women and no significant differences were found between acupuncture and sham control. The few trials on MT-related symptoms showed that there was not enough evidence to support acupuncture&#x02019;s efficacy for MT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>We have finished a phase I trial (unpublished), which was a single-blinded (patients blinded) RCT study; 16 women with MT-related symptoms were observed. They were randomized into an EA group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) and a sham EA group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;8). After 8&#x000a0;weeks, the reduction in the menopause rating scale (MRS) was 6.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.96 (20.54&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;14.82 at baseline and 14.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.47 after treatment) and 2.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.39 (21.50&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;13.03 at baseline and 19.50&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.85 after treatment) for the EA and sham EA groups, respectively. There was a significant difference between the two groups and the results suggested EA could be beneficial for MT symptoms and have a therapeutic effect.</p><p>This protocol is designed for the phase II trial. It is a multi-center randomized placebo controlled trial. It will compare EA with sham EA for symptoms during MT. The primary objective is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of EA for MT symptoms, and to partially exclude the placebo effect. The second objective is to evaluate EA&#x02019;s safety and any positive effect on the sexual hormone levels (FSH, LH, FSH/LH, and E2) in MT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This will be a prospective RCT conducted over 2&#x000a0;years (from June 2013&#x02013;May 2015) and at 12 hospitals in China (Guang&#x02019;anmen Hospital; The First Hospital Affiliated to Anhui University of Chinese Medicine; Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM); Hubei Province Hospital of TCM; The First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine; Hengyang Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine; Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of TCM; Integrated TCM and Western Medicine of Shanxi University of TCM; Shanxi Province Hospital of TCM; Yueyang Hospital of Shanghai University of TCM; TCM Hospital of Yantai; and 3rd Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University).Participants experiencing MT will be recruited from the 12 centers by use of advertisements in newspapers, television, websites, and posters. Participants will be sent to a gynecologist who will make the diagnosis. A 1-week baseline assessment will include MRS, Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire score (MENQOL), average 24-h hot flash score, and hormone levels (FSH, LH, FSH/LH, and E2, examined at days 2 to 4 of the menstrual period or any day for participants in menopause). Eligible participants will be randomized after their informed consents are obtained. Central randomization will be performed by the Clinical Evaluation Center of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences in Beijing. Stratified block randomization will be made according to the hospital and a block size of six will be used. A random number will be immediately received by the acupuncturist by phone or online after the informed consent is signed.

According to the principle of intention-to-treat (ITT), all randomized participants will be analyzed. All statistical analyses will be two-sided tests and the level of significance will be established at 0.05. SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and SPSS Ver.13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software will be used.

For comparison of two independent samples a <italic>t</italic>-test or nonparametric test will be used for continuous data, and a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or the Fisher exact test will be used for categorical data. The multiple imputation method will be used to handle the missing data. The statistical methods are as follows:</p><p>1. Case distribution and compliance analysis: case distribution of both groups in every center will be described. The total drop-out rate and the drop-out rate due to adverse events, of both groups, will be compared using the Fisher exact test.</p><p>2. Analysis of baseline characteristics.</p><p>3.
