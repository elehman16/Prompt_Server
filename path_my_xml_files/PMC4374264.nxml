We observed a shorter median hospital stay in the laparoscopic group (two days) than open group (four days) and no difference between laparoscopic and robotic groups (three days). Three patients in the laparoscopic group had complications: Two grade II and one with grade III (based on Clavien-Dindo classification).

As for length of hospital stay, intervention type and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score were utilized as covariates.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 66 obese patients were identified and divided into three groups based on procedure type: Laparoscopic (<italic>n</italic> = 31), open (<italic>n</italic> = 21) and robotic partial nephrectomy (<italic>n</italic> = 14).</p><p>All except nine patients (four laparoscopic, four open and one robotic) had clamping of the renal vascular pedicle prior to the partial nephrectomy, with an average clamping time of 26.6 min and a range of 10-50 min. The average ischemia time for laparoscopic, open and robotic groups was 24, 30 and 28 min, respectively. Although, it appears from our data that the robotic approach had longer ischemia time, these numbers were not statistically significant. On univariate analysis, laparoscopic group had a median blood loss of 100 ml that was significantly less than the open group's median loss of 300 ml (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Though the robotic group blood loss was greater than laparoscopic (150 ml), statistically, there was no significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). On multivariate analysis, however, both laparoscopic and robotic interventions were significant predictors of less blood loss in the obese population. Furthermore, tumor size was not a predictor of blood loss.</p><p>With regards to the hospital stay, univariate analysis determined that the laparoscopic group had significantly shorter median hospital stay of 2 days compared with the open group value of 4 days (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Robotic group had a median stay of 3 days, but this was not significantly greater than the laparoscopic group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). On multivariate analysis, none of the methods of partial nephrectomy were a predictor of shorter hospital stay in obese patients.</p><p>Univariate analysis revealed no difference among the groups in terms of tumor pathology, location, grade and stage. There was also no difference in gender, pre-operative and post-operative creatinine, and age. The mean creatinine at discharge was within the normal range (0.8-1.2), which leads us to use absolute numbers for creatinine in our table. Tumor size for open partial nephrectomy was statistically greater than that of the laparoscopic intervention (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), but not for robotic. Furthermore, there was a tendency to perform open partial nephrectomy for endophytic tumors (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Of the 66 obese patients, 64 had their margin status commented on. Of these 64, 5 had positive margins: 3 in the laparoscopic category, 1 robotic and 1 open.</p><p>We had three patients with complications, and all three of those patients with complications were in the laparoscopic group. We classified complications using the Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications. Two patients had grade II complications: Blood transfusion on the post-operative day 1, and pneumonia post-operative day 3. One patient had grade III complication: Urine leak on the post-operative day 3 treated with JJ stent. Mortality occurred in two patients: One patient had renal cell carcinoma metastasis to the lungs 3 years after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy and another patient had retro-peritoneal sarcoma with metastasis to the lungs 4 years after open partial nephrectomy.</p><p>There were a total of four patients who underwent conversion of surgical modality. In the laparoscopic group, a total of two patients were converted to open because of failure to progress/bleeding. In the robotic group, two patients were converted to laparoscopic intervention because of failure to progress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Not only does obesity enhance one's risk of developing renal cancer,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] but also increased BMI is associated with greater morbidity and mortality, a phenomenon explained by the notion that obesity is a &#x0201c;multisystem chronic pro-inflammatory disorder.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Obese patients therefore bear a different set of comorbidities than non-obese, which may affect their peri-operative outcomes and path of recovery. One study that sought to determine the effect of BMI on partial nephrectomy peri-operative outcomes concluded that greater BMI is an independent risk factor for increased blood loss, length of stay and operative time.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Partial nephrectomy can be safely achieved through multiple modalities. However, each method possesses its own set of advantages. For instance, one institution compared open to laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, stratified the results into different BMI categories, and found that for every category, laparoscopic partial nephrectomy was favored in terms of blood loss, hospital stay and operative time.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Our study focused on obese patients and expanded the comparison of partial nephrectomy techniques to not only include open and laparoscopic, but also robotic modality. We determined that the laparoscopic and robotic partial nephrectomy patients have predictably less blood loss than open partial nephrectomy. Though patients who received the open procedure also had larger tumor sizes, our multivariate analyses determined that tumor size was not a predictor of blood loss. Our multivariate analysis also indicated that the partial nephrectomy technique is not a predictor for shortened hospital stay. Overall we encountered three complications in the study, of which two were surgical complications. There are multiple factors that may explain both these findings. One possibility is that robotic surgery was recently introduced to our department, and the learning curve for robotic surgery takes time. Another is that the majority of patients in each group had ASA scores of two or three, so preexisting comorbidities may contribute to their hospital stay. We also acknowledge that the sample size of this study may not have provided enough power to detect a significant difference among the three modalities.</p><p>We only had one patient that had a urine leak that was successfully managed by a double J stent. We don&#x02019;t feel that obesity increases the risk of urine leak after partial nephrectomy in our cohort. Similarly, we only had one patient that needed a blood transfusion post-operatively for a drop in his hematocrit/hemoglobin count. This patient responded well to the blood transfusion, and no further intervention was needed.</p><p>In an era of changing medical reimbursement and health cut backs, we should always think about modalities that will be minimally invasive and cost-effective, that we may achieve improved quality of life without compromising the patient's disease outcomes. A recent study compared overall costs among open, laparoscopic and robotic partial nephrectomies in both obese and non-obese patients. The authors concluded that laparoscopic partial nephrectomy was less costly than open technique because of shorter length of stay, and though laparoscopic length of stay was longer than robotic, the cost of instrumentation made robotic more expensive than laparoscopic.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] We acknowledge that this study was a retrospective analysis and our patient population was non-randomized.</p><p>We concluded that in obese patients, the laparoscopic and robotic partial nephrectomy patients have less blood loss than open partial nephrectomy. Furthermore, length of stay was not related to the type of utilized surgical procedure.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>Cancer Research UK</article-title><year>2012</year><date-in-citation>Last cited on 2013 Jun 01</date-in-citation><comment>Available from:
