Oral health care is one of the dimensions of the US health care delivery system in which striking disparities exist. More than half of the population does not visit a dentist each year. Improving access to oral health care is a critical and necessary first step to improving oral health outcomes and reducing disparities. Fluoride has contributed profoundly to the improved dental health of populations worldwide and is needed regularly throughout the life course to protect teeth against dental caries. To ensure additional gains in oral health, fluoride toothpaste should be used routinely at all ages. Evidence-based guidelines for annual dental visits and brushing teeth with fluoride toothpaste form the basis of this implementation science project that is intended to bridge the care gap for underserved Asian American populations by improving access to quality oral health care and enhancing effective oral health promotion strategies. The ultimate goal of this study is to provide information for the design and implementation of a randomized controlled trial of a participatory, multi-level, partnered (i.e., with community stakeholders) intervention to improve the oral and general health of low-income Chinese American adults.</p></sec><sec id="ST2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a partnered intervention using remote data entry into an electronic health record (EHR) to improve access to oral health care and promote oral health.

Indeed, untreated tooth decay (dental caries) was the single most prevalent and severe periodontitis (periodontal disease) was the sixth most prevalent of 291 oral and general health conditions studied (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The burden of unmet oral health needs on quality of life is substantial, especially for populations with fewer resources. Globally, disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to dental caries and periodontal disease is considerable, especially in China and India (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), but also for disadvantaged populations worldwide.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The burden of oral conditions worldwide as measured by disability adjusted life years lost due to tooth decay and periodontal disease, 2010.

For instance, remote electronic health record (EHR) data entry at the institutional level will permit tracking and evaluation of our multi-level intervention at the community, site, provider, and patient levels, in accordance with the implementation strategy to change record systems. This will better enable us to determine whether or not our multi-level intervention results in, e.g., improved patient care at the individual level and enhanced oral health at the community level.</p><p>In the United States, oral diseases ranging from dental caries to oral cancers cause pain and disability for millions of US children and adults (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This &#x0201c;silent epidemic&#x0201d; has disproportionately severe impacts on marginalized populations, including people from historically disadvantaged backgrounds and racial/ethnic minorities (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Further, a thorough oral examination can detect signs of general health problems, including nutritional deficiencies, immune disorders, injuries, and certain cancers, with referrals to apt health care providers where indicated (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Relatedly, and of critical, but underappreciated importance, there is a segment of the population that visits a dental provider, but not a primary medical provider each year. Using data collected as part of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), Strauss et al. found that of the 24.1% of adults who do not access general outpatient care, 23.1% visited a dentist (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Hence, chairside screening for chronic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension with referrals to primary care providers where indicated has the potential to identify persons who are unaware of their disease status, improve patient health, and lower health care costs (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>As a result, both oral and general health conditions may be prevented by regular dental visits (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Accordingly, Healthy People 2020 Leading Health Indicator (meaning that it is a high priority, evidence-based health issue) is Oral Health-7 (OH-7), namely: increase the proportion of children, adolescents, and adults who used the oral health care system in the past years (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Unfortunately, the US population as a whole has been moving away from the target of 49.0%, from a baseline of 44.5% in 2007 to 42.1% in 2012. For the Asian-only subgroup, the same trend exists, but at a lower prevalence over time, from a baseline of 41.3% in 2007 to 38.2% in 2012 (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>The oral health benefits of fluoride have been well known for more than 70&#x02009;years (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Specifically, fluoride reduces the risk of dental caries in both children and adults through a variety of mechanisms, including: incorporating into enamel before teeth erupt; preventing demineralization and enhancing remineralization of teeth; and inhibiting bacterial activity in dental plaque (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends drinking fluoridated water if it is available and using fluoride toothpaste (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The American Dental Association (ADA) recommends brushing teeth for 2&#x02009;min twice a day with a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste as part of a complete dental care routine (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). A video on proper brushing technique is also available on the ADA website (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><sec id="S1-1"><title>Rationale for Prioritizing Asian American Oral Health Research</title><p>There are at least four compelling reasons to prioritize Asian American oral health research. First, Asian Americans are the fastest growing minority group in the United States, increasing in size by 43.3% between 2000 and 2010, more than four times faster than the total US population. Nationwide, there are nearly 14.6 million Asian Americans, representing approximately 4.8% of the US population, of whom more than 60% are foreign born and more than 30% have limited English proficiency (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Second, studies have shown that current research and policy practices give rise to erroneous conclusions about Asian American health due to omission from data collection efforts, aggregation across Asian subgroups, and extrapolation of results from one Asian subgroup to another (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The preponderance of the limited research is based on West Coast populations, leading to a dearth of understanding of substantial and emerging Asian American communities in the Midwest, Northeast, and Southwest. Third, the &#x0201c;model minority&#x0201d; stereotype of Asian Americans as &#x0201c;wealthier, wiser, and healthier&#x0201d; than other racial/ethnic minority populations undermines the significance of health disparities experienced among and within Asian American communities and the need to devote resources to mitigate those disparities (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Fourth, findings of community health resources and needs assessments that sampled underserved and hard to reach New York, NY Asian immigrant populations consistently found that oral disease was a top concern for Chinese and Sikh South Indian populations (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Fully 22% of Chinese respondents ranked oral or dental health as their top health concern, 68% rated their oral health as poor or fair, and only 53% reported having received an oral/dental health check-up in the past year (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>In separate and related research conducted in New York, NY, the self-reported frequency of visiting a dentist in the past year for Chinese respondents ranged dramatically depending upon the sample studied, from 15.7% among participants recruited from recent immigrant enclaves (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) to 89.3% among participants recruited from throughout the five boroughs who were low-income, but highly educated (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In a prospective study that examined racial/ethnic differences in periodontal disease among participants recruited from six US sites, Chinese participants displayed the highest prevalence of self-reported periodontal disease (39.8%), followed by Blacks (32.0%) and Whites (26.0%), with Hispanics displaying the lowest prevalence (17.4%) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Finally, a study conducted in Washington, DC among Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese Americans found that less acculturated Asian Americans were less likely to receive physical, dental, and eye examinations than those who were more acculturated (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This may be because there is less emphasis on preventive health care in Asian cultures, or because barriers to health care access may amplify the reluctance for preventive care among Asian Americans (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S1-2"><title>Adaptation of the Sikh American Families Oral Health Promotion Program</title><p>Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, UNITED SIKHS, a community-based organization that pursues projects for the spiritual, social, and economic empowerment of underprivileged and minority communities (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), New York University School of Medicine (NYU Medicine), City University of New York Prevention Research Center (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and NYU College of Dentistry (NYU Dentistry) (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) developed, implemented, evaluated, and disseminated the <italic>Sikh American Families Oral Health Promotion Program</italic> (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Several of the implementation strategies identified by Powell et al. were found to be effective in this earlier effort will be adapted for the proposed project, including conduct a local needs assessment, involve patients and family members, use to train-the-trainer strategies to provide hands-on instruction on proper brushing techniques to community educators, and use a community advisory board (CAB) to provide input and advice on implementation efforts (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Findings were for Sikh participants with no dental insurance prior to program enrollment (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;58), 81.0% credited the program with helping them obtain insurance for them or their children; for participants with no dentist prior to program enrollment (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;68), 92.6% credited the program with helping them or their children find a local dentist (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S1-3"><title>Systems Modeling to Understand Dynamic Complexity and Simulate Alternate Scenarios</title><p>The term &#x0201c;systems science&#x0201d; is used to refer to the big picture of problem solving, where the problem space is conceptualized as a system of interrelated component parts (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Both the coherent whole of the system and the relationships among the component parts are critical to the system, as they give rise to emergence, meaning much coming from little (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Note that emergence occurs when even a relatively simple system generates unexpected amounts of complexity, which cannot be understood without the ability to simulate (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p>In order to improve our mental models of the real world, system scientists have developed and leveraged methods, such as system dynamics (SD), agent-based modeling (ABM), geographic information science, and social network simulation. The practice of systems science modeling is situated amidst an ongoing process of observing the real world, formulating mental models of how it works, setting decision rules to guide behavior, and from these heuristics, making decisions that in turn affect the state of the real world (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>Interventions often fail or even worsen the problems they are intended to solve due to a lack of understanding of real world structures and dynamic complexity.

Specifically, CFIR provides a menu of constructs that have been associated with effective implementation and have been used in a range of applications, including our own oral health research (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). For the proposed project, the five domains and the associated constructs that we are particularly interested in exploring are: (1) intervention&#x02009;=&#x02009;partnered EHR enhanced community outreach (adaptability, cost); (2) inner setting&#x02009;=&#x02009;NYU Dentistry <italic>Local Community Outreach Programs</italic> and clinics (implementation climate, relative priority); (3) outer setting&#x02009;=&#x02009;Chinese American outreach sites (patient needs and resources); (4) characteristics of individuals involved&#x02009;=&#x02009;champion (Dr. Wolff), implementation leaders (Drs.

NYU Dentistry conducts local community outreach in two ways. First, all dental students must complete 4-month long community-based rotations, in which they spend 1-day per week providing direct patient care under faculty supervision in 1 out of 7 locations in four boroughs of New York, NY. A second type of outreach, which is the focus of this research, takes place in dozens of locations throughout New York, NY; it is an entirely voluntary effort shared by faculty preceptors and students. In 2015, the number of volunteer community events reached 126. The volunteer screening events are held an average of three times per week, on weekdays and weekends, with 6&#x02013;8 students typically taking part in each event. Although they do not directly treat patients at these sites, students refer many of them to NYU Dentistry. To encourage patients to visit a dentist, students provide each patient screened with a voucher worth $205.00 for oral health care at NYU Dentistry to cover his/her comprehensive oral examination, treatment plan, and prophylaxis at no charge and with no co-payment required.</p><p>In discussions with Dr. Schenkel, the program leader, we learned that turnout at Chinese sites was especially high, affirming the findings of a recent <italic>Chinese Community Health Resources and Needs Assessment</italic> conducted by NYU Medicine, where oral health was identified as a top concern (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).

Training lay individuals of the same cultural and linguistic background as participants, e.g., CHWs through train-the-trainer techniques, has been found to be an acceptable approach for delivering culturally appropriate, community-based oral health interventions, as well as for recruiting participants into interventions through community and social networks (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>).

Dr. Yi will then lead a guided discussion structured around the 4&#x02009;P&#x02019;s of social marketing. For product, CAB members will be asked if the materials encourage prevention of oral conditions through regular dental visits and brushing with fluoride toothpaste. For price, CAB members will be asked how much it will cost a person to take on the desired behaviors in terms of time and effort, not merely dollars and cents. For place, CAB members will be asked to help to compile a list of local dental providers in addition to NYU Dentistry who provide culturally tailored and language-specific oral health care to Chinese American families. For promotion, CAB members will be asked to identify other Chinese American community change agents to promote the program through word of mouth, social media, and neighborhood venues. CAB input will also be sought on incorporating appropriate imagery and cultural beliefs regarding oral health in the Chinese American community. This guidance will then be used to adapt both print and online materials. Finally, the adapted materials will be presented back to the CAB to ensure their input was accurately captured.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S4-2"><title>Procedures for Training Interventionists and Monitoring Intervention Fidelity</title><p>Both CHWs in this study were formerly trained as CHWs, have a history of engaging in health promotion with the Chinese American community, and are bilingual in English and Mandarin Chinese (the primary dialect of participating community outreach sites). Specifically, the project CHWs were previously trained in a core competency program that employed diverse training methods, guided by adult learning principles and popular education philosophy. We will further train the project CHWs in the oral health promotion demonstration protocol and on oral health services and programs available at local clinics and hospitals. The investigative team and CAB members will also collect, assess, and deliver to the CHWs updated information regarding health and dental insurance and access to oral health programs available for low-income and immigrant communities. NYU Dentistry investigators and staff will train the CHWs using models on evidence-based oral health practices, stressing the importance of drinking fluoridated water and brushing teeth for 2&#x02009;min twice a day with a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste (&#x0201c;painting the teeth with fluoride&#x0201d;). This train-the-trainer model will promote peer support and allow the project to be replicated and sustained across settings. Interactive educational techniques will be integrated into the demonstrations. As in our pilot work (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), hands-on instruction will be provided on proper brushing and flossing techniques, culturally tailored health promotion methods (i.e., preparing healthy traditional meals and using the plate method to determine the proper balance and size of portions), and goal-setting skills. Trainees will then demonstrate the presented procedures back to the trainers using models.</p><p>At the end of the training, the CHWs will collaborate in groups to practice delivering short excerpts from the curriculum to their peers and project team members, with the trainers providing comments and assistance. Approximately, 1-month before the CHW training is complete, the curriculum will be pilot tested to ensure its cultural appropriateness with patients. Two mock educational sessions and a final examination of knowledge and evaluation of trial encounters with mock participants will be conducted with project investigators and CAB members. Individuals who score below the threshold level of knowledge regarding oral health promotion will receive intensive 1-on-1 tutoring and be required to take a second examination of knowledge. Quality assurance controls will be built into the intervention. Drs. Northridge and Yi will meet with the CHWs on an approximately bi-weekly basis to ensure that the model components are being consistently applied. Each CHW will keep a log of activities and communication around their follow-up of patients. These logs will be reviewed as necessary to evaluate the type and nature of communications between the CHWs and their assigned study participants.</p></sec><sec id="S4-3"><title>Study Schedule</title><p>The study will extend for approximately 1&#x02009;year.

The group adaptation session will be guided by a user-centered design facilitation protocol that sequentially leads the group through presentation of specific remote EHR use cases that include variations on the original EHR data entry screens adapted to the workflow characteristics of local community sites. For each presented use case, the group discussion will focus on the workflow at the site around the role responsibilities (people), documents, and information content (patient medical history, self-reported outcome measures, head and neck/oral examination results) with regards to reviewing customized EHR protocols based on the findings. The discussion will be digitally recorded and each non-patient participant will be given color-coded response sheets to record their perspectives on how to enhance the usefulness of the customized EHR protocols within the community outreach site setting. The digital recordings and response sheets will then be processed, summarized, and converted into adaptation recommendations by the study team.</p><p>Next, the study team will transform the recommendations into proposed revisions and document them in revised standard workflow diagrams that build on established workflows to minimize changes at the sites or new work for the dental providers. The insights will then be used to adapt the customized EHR protocols and related workflows, and will be validated in a follow-up group meeting at each site where the adapted EHR screens will be presented and assessed according to the IOF implementation outcome measures of acceptability and adoption. During these follow-up meetings, we will identify any additional workflow variations that the EHR protocols may need to support. Candidate workflows will then be discussed with the project team and other non-patient participants to finalize the adapted workflow integration approach.</p></sec><sec id="S5-2"><title>Pilot Testing and Live Usability for Remote EHR</title><p>In order to account for real world conditions, the intervention will be pilot tested at three Chinese American sites before rolling it out to additional study sites during a planned randomized controlled trial. Early formative observations/short interviews will be conducted with dental teams at each of the pilot sites regarding interaction with the customized EHR. This pilot testing will examine impact on workflow, uncover any new usability problems, and identify any educational needs to be included before large-scale implementation. As providers at the pilot sites engage with the EHR, live-usability testing will be conducted, consisting of direct observations by the research team. Live usability is ideal for observing the impact of new tools on real setting workflows and for observing alternative workflows that can be missed during simulations.</p></sec><sec id="S5-3"><title>Semi-Structured Interviews Regarding the Remote EHR and Partnered Intervention</title><p>Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with participating dentists, CHWs, and other non-patient participants in administrative and technical roles after the intervention.

A systems science approach will be undertaken to integrate knowledge held by non-patient participants into simulation models to explore alternative paths toward improved health and health care for low-income, urban Chinese American adults <italic>via</italic> community-based outreach followed by clinical care. These simulation models will be designed using a multi-method approach, in which principles of SD are used to incorporate feedback effects and delays through stocks that accumulate flows (rates of change over time). The SD approach will be integrated with an ABM framework that is used to appropriately represent dynamics at the community, site, provider, family, and patient levels. The model platform developed for this study will contain multiple model structures that characterize different dynamics and reflect participant input.</p><sec id="S5-4-1"><title>Modeling to Anticipate Effects of Interventions</title><p>The models in this platform will simulate implications of hypotheses elicited <italic>a priori</italic> (before implementation of the partnered intervention) from non-patient participants.

This model platform will therefore test the relative effectiveness of the interventions as anticipated under these <italic>a priori</italic> assumptions. Toward this end, this effort will involve design of scoping models that establish a baseline for simulating access at the community level and care-seeking behaviors at the individual level.</p><p>A participatory SD modeling process will be undertaken <italic>via</italic> a group model-building workshop held with non-patient participants as well as semi-structured interviews with individual non-patient participants to elicit targeted model input and feedback on assumptions. The UB Geography Systems Science Modeling Team will work closely with non-patient participants to devise indices for input parameters and indicators for outcomes of simulation experiments. In addition to informing the design of model structures, this participatory approach will enable non-patient participants to better assess the results of the simulation models developed in this <italic>a priori</italic> model platform for authenticity and identification of insights for subsequent implementation research. The resulting model platform will establish a multi-level agent-based GIS framework for simulation modeling of access to oral health care and care-seeking behaviors by low-income, urban Chinese American adults at the community, site, provider, family, and patient levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5-5"><title>Study Hypotheses</title><p>Our hypotheses for this feasibility and acceptability study are stated next.</p><sec id="S5-5-1"><title>Primary</title><p>Based on exit interviews, patient participants in this study will be satisfied with the partnered intervention components.</p></sec><sec id="S5-5-2"><title>Secondary</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Based on semi-structured interviews, non-patient participants in the study will be satisfied with the partnered intervention components and remote entry features of EHR software at NYU Dentistry to enter patient information at three Chinese American community sites.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The knowledge held <italic>a priori</italic> by non-patient participants about factors that influence access to oral health care and care-seeking behaviors among low-income, urban Chinese American adults will enhance the intervention during and/or after the study for further use in future implementations.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec id="S5-6"><title>Sample Size Considerations</title><p>No formal sample size estimates were performed for this feasibility and acceptability study.

The patient participant will sign the informed consent document prior to any study-related assessments or procedures. Patient participants will be given the opportunity to discuss the study with their surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. They may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the study. A copy of the signed informed consent document will be given to patient participants for their records. The rights and welfare of the patient participants will be protected by emphasizing to them that the quality of their clinical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to participate in this study. The consent process will be documented in the clinical or research record.</p><p>Consent for non-patient participant interviews for the knowledge modeling will take place where the interview happens, verbally over the telephone. Dr. Metcalf will send the consent information sheet by email when scheduling the interview, which will be at least 2&#x02009;days in advance of the interview. To ensuring ongoing consent for follow-up interviews, Dr. Metcalf will remind the non-patient participants about their previous consent and will resend the consent document if needed. Dr. Metcalf will obtain verbal consent for any subsequent recording of information collected during follow-up interviews. Dr. Metcalf will send the consent document ahead of time. Before recording, Dr. Metcalf will ask: have you reviewed the information? Do you have any questions? If the non-patient participant answers &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; to the first question and &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; to the second question, then she will ask: is it OK if we start the interview now? And if recording the telephone call: is it OK if I begin audio recording? After the participant answers &#x0201c;yes,&#x0201d; the interview will begin.</p></sec><sec id="S7-4"><title>Women, Minorities, and Children</title><p>The proposed study will enroll Chinese American adults aged 21&#x02009;years and older. No children will be included since there are separate and targeted NYU Dentistry programs for this age group. The study population is Chinese American adults living in any of the five boroughs of New York, NY. We estimate that approximately 60% of our enrolled patient participants will be women, based on our experience with conducting community-based screening events. All enrolled patient participants will be of self-reported Chinese ethnicity, to ensure that our partnerships and materials are culturally and linguistically relevant. Study sites will be concentrated in lower Manhattan (Chinatown and the Lower East Side) and the Sunset Park area of Brooklyn, which include dense ethnic enclaves of Chinese Americans.</p></sec><sec id="S7-5"><title>Subject Confidentiality</title><p>Subject confidentiality is strictly held in trust by the MPIs, Co-Is, study staff, and the sponsor(s) and their agents. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological samples and genetic tests in addition to any study information relating to subjects.</p><p>The study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor.</p><p>The study monitor or other authorized representatives of the sponsor may inspect all study documents and records required to be maintained by the MPIs, including but not limited to medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) for the study subjects. The modeling site will permit access to such records.</p></sec><sec id="S7-6"><title>Certificate of Confidentiality</title><p>To further protect the privacy of study subjects, a Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). This certificate protects identifiable research information from forced disclosure. It allows the MPIs and others who have access to research records to refuse to disclose identifying information on research participation in any civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding, whether at the federal, state, or local level. By protecting researchers and institutions from being compelled to disclose information that would identify research subjects, Certificates of Confidentiality help achieve the research objectives and promote participation in studies by helping assure confidentiality and privacy to subjects.</p></sec><sec id="S7-7"><title>Data Handling and Record Keeping</title><p>The MPIs are responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported. All source documents will be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data.

Study documents will be retained for a minimum of 2&#x02009;years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2&#x02009;years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents will be retained for a longer period, however, if required by local regulations. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the MPIs when these documents no longer need to be retained.</p></sec><sec id="S7-12"><title>Protocol Deviations</title><p>A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical study protocol, Good Clinical Practice, or Manual of Procedures requirements.

It requires scientists to submit final peer-reviewed journal manuscripts that arise from NIH funds to the digital archive PubMed Central upon acceptance for publication.</p><p>The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have adopted a clinical trials registration policy as a condition for publication. The ICMJE defines a clinical trial as any research project that prospectively assigns human subjects to intervention or concurrent comparison or control groups to study the cause-and-effect relationship between a medical intervention and a health outcome. Medical interventions include drugs, surgical procedures, devices, behavioral treatments, process-of-care changes, and the like. Health outcomes include any biomedical or health-related measures obtained in patients or participants, including pharmacokinetic measures and adverse events. The ICMJE policy requires that all clinical trials be registered in a public trials registry, such as <italic><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</uri></italic>, which is sponsored by the National Library of Medicine. Other biomedical journals are considering adopting similar policies. For interventional clinical trials performed under NIDCR grants and cooperative agreements, it is the grantee&#x02019;s responsibility to register the trial in an acceptable registry, so the research results may be considered for publication in ICMJE member journals. The ICMJE does not review specific studies to determine whether registration is necessary; instead, the committee recommends that researchers who have questions about the need to register error on the side of registration or consult the editorial office of the journal in which they wish to publish.</p><p><italic>US Public Law 110&#x02013;85</italic> (Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 or FDAAA), Title VIII, Section 801 mandates that a &#x0201c;responsible party&#x0201d; (i.e., the sponsor or designated principal investigator) register and report results of certain &#x0201c;applicable clinical trials&#x0201d;: Trials of Drugs and Biologics: controlled, clinical investigations, other than Phase I investigations, of a product subject to FDA regulation; and Trials of Devices: controlled trials with health outcomes of a product subject to FDA regulation (other than small feasibility studies) and pediatric postmarket surveillance studies. NIH grantees must take specific <italic>steps to ensure compliance</italic> with NIH implementation of FDAAA.</p></sec><sec id="S7-14"><title>Confidentiality</title><p>Personal information about potential and enrolled participants will be collected and then de-identified prior to it being shared to ensure confidentiality of participants is maintained before, during, and after the study.

Further, the <italic>Center for the Study of Asian American Health</italic> at NYU Medicine is the only center of its kind in the United States solely dedicated to research and evaluation on Asian American health and health disparities. Thus, this study holds the potential to fill a care gap for this diverse and growing population. In particular, Chinese are the largest Asian ethnic group in New York, NY, with higher poverty rates for working age and older adults relative to all residents (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). As NYU Dentistry and NYU Medicine have partnered on CBPR initiatives using CHW models (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), there is confidence in our ability to adapt materials and programming for this new population/setting of Chinese American outreach sites. Further, in longstanding collaboration with The State University of New York at Buffalo, our research team has examined how factors at multiple levels contribute to oral health and care-seeking behaviors of racial/ethnic minority older adults (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Leveraging our portfolio of systems science models and group model-building expertise and experience, we plan to engage with our partners to understand the dynamic complexity of our interventions and simulate alternate scenarios, in concert with a recent NIH funding opportunity announcement (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Finally, integrating multiple scientific approaches (implementation science, CBPR, and systems science) and utilizing remote EHR capabilities to enhance patient care and tracking are notable strengths of this study.</p><p>This feasibility and acceptability study also has certain limitations. First, findings may not be generalizable to other settings and locales. Nonetheless, by furnishing our protocol to the research community, other implementation scientists may adapt it for their local needs. Second, the study is only funded for 1&#x02009;year. Thus, we will not be able to track patient participants screened during the second half of the funding period to determine whether or not they visited a dental provide in the complete follow-up year, as per Leading Health Indicator OH-7 (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Still, this funding provides an opportunity to ascertain the feasibility and acceptability of our partnered intervention, and strengthen our methods toward designing and implementing a randomized controlled trial of a participatory, multi-level, partnered intervention to improve the oral and general health of low-income Chinese American adults. Further, while the pre-post retrospective evaluation design to assess the acceptability of the partnered intervention is considered a practical method to evaluate learning from an educational program (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), it has certain limitations. In particular, recall bias may affect the quality of the data collected due to potentially inaccurate or skewed memories of patients regarding their prior attitudes, emotions, behaviors, and experiences. Finally, social desirability bias may affect patients&#x02019; self-reported brushing of teeth for 2&#x02009;min twice a day with a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This feasibility and acceptability study will be conducted in accordance with the International Council on Harmonization guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (ICH E6), the Code of Federal Regulations on the Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR Part 46), and the NIDCR Clinical Terms of Award. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
