Objective signs of vaginal atrophy are petechiae, friability, vaginal discharge, the presence of a dry and pale vaginal mucosa and loss of the rugae of the vaginal wall.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Cytological examination of the mucosa reveals a reduction in the percentage of mature cells (superficial cells) and an increase in primitive cell types, such as parabasal cells.

The percentage of superficial cells and the maturation value increased significantly after treatment with vagitocin 400 IU. Vaginal pH and the scores of vaginal atrophy were significantly reduced after treatment with vagitocin 100 IU. The experience of the most bothersome symptom was strongly reduced by vagitocin 400 IU. This effect was significant versus placebo.</p><p>Treatment with vagitocin improved the appearance of the atrophic mucosa according to the clinician&#x02019;s investigation. These results confirmed the finding of a previous study, in which oxytocin applied intravaginally for seven days significantly improved post-menopausal vaginal atrophy.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>New findings in the present study are that treatment with vagitocin 400 IU induced a significant increase in the percentage of superficial cells and that the maturation value was significantly increased. These findings demonstrate that local treatment with vagitocin 400 IU stimulates the maturation of cells in the vaginal epithelium. Similar results, such as an increase in the percentage of superficial cells and in the maturation value, were found in a previous study wherein oxytocin 600&#x02009;IU treatment was administered for 12 weeks (to be published).</p><p>Interestingly, the vaginal pH decreased particularly in response to vagitocin 100&#x02009;IU, whereas the effect of vagitocin 400&#x02009;IU was less clear. As discussed below, the less clear effect in the vagitocin 400&#x02009;IU group may be due to lower amount of individuals in this group. The decrease in the pH indicates the presence of a more functional vaginal epithelium with production of acid metabolites.</p><p>The histological evaluation of the vaginal biopsies showed that vagitocin improved the condition of the vaginal mucosa, particularly at the lower dose (100 IU). It is important to recognise that the histological evaluation was not only based on the presence of superficial cells, but also on other expressions of proliferation and maturity such as the total number of cell layers in the vaginal epithelium.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In a previous paper an increase in the number of cell layers of the mucosal epithelium, from 2&#x02013;3 to 10&#x02013;12, was observed in response to one week of intravaginal treatment with oxytocin 600 IU.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>Oxytocin in a concentration of 1&#x02009;&#x000b5;mol stimulated the growth of human vaginal epithelial cells <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> at a rate similar to estrogen (Uvn&#x000e4;s-Moberg and Sj&#x000f6;gren, manuscript to be submitted). Oxytocin has been shown to stimulate the growth of several types of epithelial and endothelial cells.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> These effects were induced by activation of oxytocin binding G-protein linked receptors on the cell surface. A similar mechanism should be activated in the vaginal epithelial cells. Oxytocin may also stimulate growth by other mechanisms (e.g. by increasing the circulation of the vaginal mucosa and, thereby, the transport of oxygen and nutrients to the tissues).<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>A very important finding in the present study was that intravaginal application of oxytocin in the doses used did not stimulate the growth of the endometrium. This is in contrast to intravaginally applied estrogen, which, after absorption into the circulation, may stimulate endometrial growth.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>Subjective symptoms related to post-menopausal vaginal atrophy, such as vaginal dryness and irritation/itching, were slightly improved after seven weeks of treatment with vagitocin. In contrast, vagitocin significantly decreased the symptom of dyspareunia in the subgroup of women who were sexually active during the study.</p><p>The strongest effect of vagitocin was exerted on the symptoms reported as most bothersome. After seven weeks of treatment with vagitocin 400 IU, 53% of the women who reported a most bothersome symptom at the start of the study no longer experienced the symptom. This effect was highly significant versus placebo.</p><p>The most common treatments for vaginal atrophy are various kinds of estrogen therapies systemic or local. Intravaginal estrogen therapy has a positive impact on the vaginal atrophic symptoms and signs and can restore normal vaginal pH. In addition, it can increase the number of superficial cells and the maturation value.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>Systemic estrogen replacement therapy has been associated with an increased risk of endometrial and breast cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke and thromboembolic disease.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The risk of endometrial cancer is increased after long-term systemic estrogen use in post-menopausal women if not combined with progesterone treatment. A small increase of the incidence of breast cancer has been noted in some studies after systemic treatment with estrogen.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Oral estrogen treatment has been reported to increase the frequency of cardiovascular and thromboembolic disease. The benefit or risk of estrogen therapy in the post-menopausal state depend on the duration of the treatment, age, physical condition and presence of certain genetic predispositions.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> On the other hand, the frequency of some types of cardiovascular disease seems to decrease following treatment with oral estrogen.</p><p>All types of vaginal estrogen preparations seem to be effective in improving symptoms related to vaginal atrophy, such as vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, irritation and itching. However, there are some differences in their effect profiles.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>Low-dose local estrogen treatment is associated with a lower risk of severe estrogen-linked side effects which has made this treatment more popular. Series of studies have shown that intravaginally applied estrogens may raise plasma estrogen levels.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The local absorption of intravaginal estrogen varies greatly from one woman to another and it differs depending on the type and dose of estrogens used. Use of vaginal cream containing conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) is more frequently associated with uterine bleeding, perineal pain and breast tenderness when compared to low-dose vaginal tablets and estrogen containing vaginal rings. These effects of CEE resemble those of oral estrogens and probably reflect increased plasma levels.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Consequently, a risk remains for a proliferative effect on the endometrium and stimulation of breast cancer cells.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Regarding the use of low dose estrogen there are no conclusive data concerning the long-term safety.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>Despite its proliferative effect on the healthy epithelial and endothelial cells, oxytocin most often inhibits the growth of malignant cells.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Interestingly, studies have shown that oxytocin has inhibitory effects on endometrial, ovarian and breast cancer cell growth.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>The inhibitory effects of oxytocin on cancer cells are mediated by the same oxytocin receptors that stimulate growth in normal cells.

Furthermore, oxytocin might be of value in women who have estrogen-dependent types of cancers, as oxytocin has not been shown to stimulate growth of breast cancer cells; rather, on the contrary.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2053369115577328" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>It is important to note that in the present study significant effects versus placebo were only achieved for the variable the most bothersome symptom. Using within-group statistical testing, however, significant effects within groups were obtained for oxytocin regarding all the physiological parameters. Significant effects versus placebo would have been obtained also between active treatment and placebo for these parameters had the study included more women and been of a longer duration. In addition, results from two other clinical studies support the fact that intravaginal treatment with oxytocin does indeed relieve signs of vaginal atrophy in post-menopausal women<sup>18</sup> (Al-Saqi, Fianu Jonasson and Uvn&#x000e4;s Moberg, manuscript to be submitted). The lower dose of oxytocin (100 IU) seemed to be more efficient than the 400 IU dose regarding the effect on pH, histological evaluation and dyspareunia. This may be due to the fact that more patients were included in the 100 IU than in the 400 IU group. In spite of the randomisation procedure more women were excluded from the study in the 400 IU group than in the 100 IU group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec31-2053369115577328"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present results indicate that intravaginal oxytocin induces important clinical effects in the context of menopausal disorders.
