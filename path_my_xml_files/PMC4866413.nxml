Two hundred and eleven patients will be followed up for a minimum of 1&#x000a0;year. Inclusion criteria include a clinical indication for a fistuloplasty, an access circuit that is free of synthetic graft material or stents, and a residual stenosis of 30&#x000a0;% or less after plain balloon fistuloplasty. Exclusion criteria include a synchronous venous lesion in the same access circuit, location of the stenosis central to the thoracic inlet or a thrombosed access circuit at the time of treatment. The primary endpoint is time to end of target lesion primary patency. This is defined as a clinically-driven radiological or surgical re-intervention at the treatment segment, thrombosis that includes the treatment segment, or abandonment of the access circuit due to an inability to re-treat the treatment segment. Secondary endpoints include angiographic late lumen loss, time to end of access circuit cumulative patency, the total number of interventions, and quality of life.

This equated to 365 patients per million population in the UK in 2011. This number has increased every year with an overall increase of 3.6&#x000a0;% from 2006 to 2011. In order to perform haemodialysis, reliable vascular access is essential. It is universally agreed that native arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) are superior to synthetic arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and tunnelled central venous catheters for haemodialysis access. AVFs and AVGs have limited lifespans. Data from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Study (DOPPS) showed that in the US the 1-year patency for AVFs and AVGs are 68&#x000a0;% and 49&#x000a0;% respectively. In Europe, 1-year AVF survival was somewhat better at 83&#x000a0;% but there is still a need for improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Problems with vascular access are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in haemodialysis patients. In the US, it has been estimated that $1 billion per year is spent on vascular access and its complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A recent survey in the UK found that haemodialysis patients occupy 320,000 bed days per year, with 30&#x000a0;% of admissions related to vascular access (Renal Association vascular access audit, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.renal.org/">www.renal.org</ext-link>). When thrombosis or stenosis occurs in an AVF or AVG, a central venous catheter may be used for several months until another AVF or AVG is formed and becomes usable. Data from the US have shown that the risk of invasive infection is increased 100-fold in haemodialysis patients compared to the general population. Eighty-five percent of those diagnosed with an infection have an invasive device in situ. Ninety percent of those diagnosed with an infection require hospitalisation and there is a 17&#x000a0;% associated mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is, therefore, imperative to preserve each AVF or AVG for as long as possible and to minimise the use of central venous catheters.</p><p>The initial therapy for a stenosis in an AVF is radiological fistuloplasty. A major concern, however, is the longevity of this effect. Turmel-Rodrigues et al. reported the outcomes of interventional salvage of dysfunctional and thrombosed haemodialysis circuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There were 220 cases in the dysfunctional AVF group. The 6-, 12-, and 24-month primary patency (AVF working with no repeat intervention) reported rates were 67&#x000a0;%, 51&#x000a0;% and 37&#x000a0;% for forearm AVF and 57&#x000a0;%, 35&#x000a0;% and 24&#x000a0;% for upper arm AVF respectively. More recently Bountouris et al. reported the outcomes after 159 percutaneous transluminal angioplasties (PTAs) in AVFs. The primary patency rates at 6, 12 and 24&#x000a0;months were 61&#x000a0;%, 42&#x000a0;% and 35&#x000a0;% respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Primary assisted patency rates (AVF working regardless of repeat intervention) were 89&#x000a0;% and 85&#x000a0;% at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months respectively. Although there have been some exceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], most other studies have reported similar primary patency rates of around 40&#x02013;50&#x000a0;% at 1&#x000a0;year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Hence, more durable interventions are required to reduce restenosis rates.</p><p>In addition there is a need to better understand the cellular processes involved in the development of stenoses and the responses that occur following intervention. Neointimal hyperplasia is characterised by expansion of alpha smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts in the neointima which leads to stenoses in the venous segments of AVFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In arteries, the contribution of bone marrow-derived cells to tissue repair depends on the nature and severity of injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The contribution of bone marrow cells to venous neointimal hyperplasia is not resolved and the data from animal studies are conflicting. Two studies using bone marrow transplantation with cells containing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) or &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter gene, have suggested a minimal contribution of bone marrow-derived cells in mouse and rat models respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, a further study employing a murine vein graft has suggested that at least 20&#x000a0;% of neointimal cells may be bone marrow-derived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. GFP-positive cells were detected by a more sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and these technical differences were suggested as a reason for discrepancies with other studies.</p><p>In addition to these conflicting data on the origin of neointimal cells, it should be noted that none of the previous reports induced vein injury in a way that mirrors the changes induced by angioplasty. Instead, most have focussed on the development of primary stenosis in venous conduits undergoing arterialisation where endothelium is &#x02018;traumatised&#x02019; or activated by changes in the flow characteristics of the arterial blood to which it becomes exposed. Given the data from arterial studies, a contribution from bone marrow cells to the alpha smooth muscle actin-producing cells in the hyperplastic neointima of a dysfunctional arteriovenous fistula is highly likely with the degree of trauma to the endothelium that would follow angioplasty. Angioplasty causes vessel wall damage with rupture of the junction between the intima and the media, with a burst of proliferation and repair. Much of our understanding of aggressive neointimal formation in this context comes from arterial studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], but similar pathology and an increase in proliferation has been shown in AVFs following venous angioplasty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Paclitaxel exerts an anti-proliferative effect by interfering with cell microtubule function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Systemic administration of paclitaxel after angioplasty in the rat carotid artery showed that a significant reduction in neointimal proliferation could be achieved at doses much lower than antineoplastic levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In rat and human cultured cell models, paclitaxel inhibited vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], consistent with its effects in vivo. As an alternative to systemic therapy, local drug delivery offers the advantages of allowing high local concentrations of drug at the treatment site while minimising systemic toxic effects. Proof of this possibility was initially shown using paclitaxel-coated stents in pig coronary arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Recent advances in technology have allowed angioplasty balloons to be coated with paclitaxel. This allows local delivery of paclitaxel to the site of stenosis. A number of multicentre, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the coronary and peripheral arterial circulation have established the positive benefit of drug-coated balloons (DCBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A small pilot study has suggested efficacy in dialysis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In this study, 40 patients with dysfunctional AVFs or AVGs were randomised to receive either DCB or plain balloon angioplasty (PBA). Primary unassisted patency (defined angiographically as a binary readout of less than 50&#x000a0;% stenosis) in the DCB group was significantly better than the PBA group at 6 (70&#x000a0;% versus 25&#x000a0;%) and 12&#x000a0;months (35&#x000a0;% versus 5&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c;0.001) respectively. This study may be criticised on a number of points. These include the use of an angiographic rather than a clinical endpoint, the lack of blinding and independent angiographic core laboratory analysis and the very small sample size originally intended to test non-inferiority only (with a wide 15&#x000a0;% non-inferiority limit). In addition, a range of balloons was used in the control group for post dilatation after the paclitaxel-coated balloons, and these were not universally high pressure and non-compliant. This may have added variability to the outcome. Furthermore, the inclusion of both AVFs (35&#x000a0;%) and AVGs (65&#x000a0;%) may have resulted in significant confounding given the difference in survival rates associated to the two types of access. Despite these limitations, the results suggested that a further study of efficacy is warranted, which is what we propose here.</p><p>The PAVE trial is a large-scale RCT designed to test superiority of DCBs in native haemodialysis access circuits. Further, the impact on patient quality of life will be assessed. Patient blood samples will also be collected within the setting of the clinical trial. This will form an important resource for future laboratory-based studies on biomarkers and AVF outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial objectives</title><p>The purpose of this RCT is to compare the efficacy of additional paclitaxel-coated balloon fistuloplasty versus plain balloon fistuloplasty only to preserve the patency of arteriovenous fistulae used for haemodialysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Primary endpoint</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Time to end of target lesion primary patency</title><p>This is defined as patency with no re-intervention to the area 5&#x000a0;mm proximal to, within, and 5&#x000a0;mm distal to, the index treatment segment.

Primary analysis will be repeated using multivariate Cox regression for the adjustment of the treatment effect size for the effect of known clinical covariates and minimisation factors. Model components considered in the primary model will include previous radiological intervention in the access circuit; trial centre; whether the patient is on haemodialysis or not at study entry; trial arm; observed study time (length of time between patient entering and exiting study); and a trial arm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;observed time interaction term. The interaction term allows for variable follow-up time effects. Patients with TLPP at the end of follow-up will be considered censored, as will those who receive a renal transplant, switch to peritoneal dialysis or are lost to follow-up before the study end. Kaplan-Meier plots, hazard ratio (HR) and its confidence interval will be used to describe the results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Analysis of secondary outcomes</title><p>Effects on secondary outcomes will be analysed using the same strategy for time-to-event variables, and generalised linear models for binary and continuous outcome measures, adjusting for the effects of relevant covariates when appropriate.

The proportions of participants missing each variable will be summarised in each arm and at each study visit. If necessary, multiple imputation will be used for the imputation of missing values in baseline variables and secondary outcomes. Patients with TLPP at the end of follow-up will be considered censored, as will those who receive a renal transplant, switch to peritoneal dialysis or are lost to follow-up before the study end. The baseline characteristics and adverse events (AEs) of patients lost to follow-up will be compared to those with complete follow-up data. The relationship between these and missing data will be investigated graphically to see if baseline characteristics or AEs predict missing values, i.e. drop-outs are not random. Should any baseline variables be predictive of missing values then these will be included in the primary analysis Cox regression models as further covariates.</p><p>For non-time-to-event outcomes, missing post-randomisation assessments will be dealt with by fitting generalised linear models to all the available data using maximum likelihood methods. Such an approach provides valid inferences under the assumption that the missing data mechanism is ignorable (or missing at random (MAR)). This allows for missingness at later times to be predicted by outcome values at earlier times. However, if post-treatment variables, such as compliance with study procedures, are found to be predictive of drop-out, multiple imputation will be considered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Interim analysis</title><p>Interim analysis of the primary outcome will be performed three times throughout the study based on the cumulative number of failures of the treatment area, i.e. after 27, 54 and 81 events, expected approximately at 9, 14 and 19&#x000a0;months of study under the null hypothesis, and at months 11, 17, and 23 under the alternative hypothesis. Group sequential stopping boundaries have been calculated using a Lan-DeMets spending function (with O&#x02019;Brien-Fleming parameters), to allow early stopping for rejection of the null or the alternative hypotheses. Stopping in case of boundary crossing is non-binding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Model assumption checks</title><p>In order to assess the adequacy of the Cox regression models for the primary outcome and time-to-event secondary outcomes, the main assumption to test for is proportionality; the Kaplan-Meier plots will be used to check if the curves for the two trial arms are the same shape, and if the separation of the curves remains proportionate throughout the analysis period. In addition, time-dependent covariates will be generated by creating interactions of the predictors and function of survival time; if these are significant then the predictors are not proportional. If the assumption for proportionality is violated then the consequence this has on the results can be checked. The Cox model can be stratified according to the variables with non-proportional hazards to see whether this changes the HRs for the variables of interest; if it still does, then it may be necessary to use an alternative model. One parametric alternative is the Royston-Parmar model, which is more flexible and can fit a non-proportional hazards model. For the other secondary outcomes regression residuals will be plotted to check for normality and outliers, where applicable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Sample size, selection and withdrawal of subjects</title><p>For the definition of the survival curve in the placebo balloon group, we assumed target lesion primary patency rates of 61&#x000a0;%, 42&#x000a0;%, and 35&#x000a0;% at 6, 12 and 24&#x000a0;months respectively. This was consistent with published results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and with our own audit data. A HR of 0.5 was chosen as the minimum clinically relevant effect size. Katsanos et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] found a HR of 0.3 for TLPP at 6&#x000a0;months; however, the confidence interval was broad and the effect size is expected to be closer to the null when AVGs are excluded. Based on these assumptions, it is expected that the paclitaxel-coated balloon group will show 78&#x000a0;%, 65&#x000a0;%, and 59&#x000a0;% survival rates of TLPP at 6, 12 and 24&#x000a0;months respectively. Recruiting 211 patients, with variable follow-up, a minimum follow-up of 1&#x000a0;year, and three interim analyses, will provide 94&#x000a0;% power to detect a statistically significant difference between the two groups in TLPP survival rates with a two-sided 5&#x000a0;% type I error rate. It is expected that 108 patients will experience fistula failure during the follow-up period.</p><p>The required sample size has been estimated assuming cumulative 10&#x000a0;% drop-out in each treatment arm by the end of the study, and recruitment of 2 patients per month (ppm) during the first 3&#x000a0;months, 8&#x000a0;ppm up to 7&#x000a0;months, and 12&#x000a0;ppm onwards. The expected accrual duration will be 22&#x000a0;months, and the maximum study duration (including follow-up) 34&#x000a0;months. We do not anticipate patients completely withdrawing from the trial as the primary endpoint data are collected primarily from clinical records. The 10&#x000a0;% drop-out estimate is based primarily on switching to peritoneal dialysis, receiving a transplant, or death.</p><p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarised in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the trial</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Inclusion criteria</th><th>Exclusion criteria</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.

There is one previously published randomised trial in vascular access for haemodialysis patients and the limitations of this study have been discussed above in the Background section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Two recent observational reports give further support to the suggestion that DCBs will be of benefit. A single-centre study investigated DCBs for the management of 20 juxta-anastomotic stenoses in radiocephalic fistulae of 10 patients. A different lesion in the same patient served as the control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This small study suggested an improved target lesion revascularisation-free survival for DCBs. In addition, in a retrospective study of recurrent symptomatic central stenosis in 27 consecutive patients with haemodialysis fistulas, custom-made DCBs were suggested to show a benefit over plain balloons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>We are aware of two prospective randomised trials that have been completed with results awaited. One is a single centre study from Singapore (NCT01544907) and includes 125 patients. It includes a mixture of AVGs and AVFs and has a primary endpoint of angiographic late lumen loss. In addition, a small randomised open-label study from Canada (NCT01001676) includes 33 patients with AVGs or AVFs and has 6-month primary patency as the primary endpoint.</p><p>In contrast to these trials, our study is restricted to patients with a native AVF in order to give a more defined patient group. In addition, our trial design means that patients and referring clinicians will be blinded to the study treatment. Furthermore, the primary endpoint is a clinical one that makes a difference to patients. We have included two secondary angiographic endpoints, which will be measured during a protocol fistulogram at 6&#x000a0;months post randomisation in patients who have not met the primary endpoint prior to this. We anticipate that the number of patients who will have had a repeat procedure within these 6&#x000a0;months will be fewer in the DCB treatment group compared to the control group. This means that the timing of the fistulogram used for the secondary angiographic endpoints will, on average, be later for the DCB treatment group. Therefore, any improvement in late lumen loss or binary restenosis in the DCB group will be despite this difference in timing, rather than because of it. We anticipate that this trial will provide rigorous data that will clarify whether DCBs are of clinical benefit in haemodialysis patients with a native AVF undergoing fistuloplasty.</p><sec id="Sec32"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment started in November 2015.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AR</term><def><p>adverse reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AVF</term><def><p>arteriovenous fistula</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AVG</term><def><p>arteriovenous graft</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Atm</term><def><p>atmospheres (pressure)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>chief investigator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DCB</term><def><p>drug-coated balloon</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMC</term><def><p>Data Monitoring Committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PI</term><def><p>principle investigator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PTA</term><def><p>percutaneous transluminal angioplasty</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TLPP</term><def><p>target lesion primary patency</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TSC</term><def><p>Trial Steering Committee</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MR is the chief investigator of the study.
