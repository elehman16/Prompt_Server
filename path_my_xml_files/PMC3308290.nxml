Among patients with baseline diabetes, 13.9% taking <italic>E/S+N</italic> and 11.6% taking <italic>E/S</italic> underwent changes in antidiabetic regimen.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The rate of new-onset diabetes with <italic>E/S+N</italic> therapy was higher compared with <italic>E/S</italic> during 24 weeks, but was only marginally higher over 64 weeks. Most cases of new-onset diabetes with <italic>E/S+N</italic> occurred within 24 weeks during niacin titration to the 2-g dose, with few additional occurrences during the remaining 40 weeks. Similarly, FG elevations occurred at early times with <italic>E/S+N</italic>, then declined to pretreatment levels by 64 weeks, largely without antidiabetic medications. No trend toward early-onset diabetes was observed with <italic>E/S</italic>. These effects were not attributed to study treatment adherence, which remained high in both groups through 64 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Our incidence rates for diabetes are somewhat exaggerated due to frequent FG sampling (11 times in 64 weeks) compared with FG monitoring in clinical practice. In addition, 29% of patients meeting criteria for new-onset diabetes on <italic>E/S+N</italic> remitted by study end. Most cases had incremental FG elevations modestly exceeding 7.0 mmol/L. Nevertheless, the clinical impact of new-onset diabetes for individual patients can be profound. Four patients on <italic>E/S+N</italic> had destabilization of glucose homeostasis (FG &#x02265;8.9 mmol/L), and 8 of 798 initially nondiabetic patients received antidiabetic medication among both treatment groups.</p><p>All new-onset diabetes in this study arose in patients with baseline impaired FG (&#x02265;5.6 to &#x0003c;7.0 mmol/L). Among such patients treated with <italic>E/S+N</italic>, the rate of new-onset diabetes persisting at 64 weeks was slightly higher (10.1% in 64 weeks) than that suggested for impaired FG in general (25% in 3&#x02013;5 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). It should be noted that in addition to niacin, treatment with statins has also been associated with increased development of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>The temporal pattern shown in this article may help explain apparently contradictory results in past studies. Niacin-induced hyperglycemia was prominent in studies of short duration (2&#x02013;12 weeks) and/or at high niacin doses of 3&#x02013;4.5 g/day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), whereas longer-term studies at lower doses (&#x02264;3 g) showed only modest or statistically nonsignificant effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Likewise, insulin resistance was found in 2-week niacin studies, whereas a 4-month study gave no such evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The time course of niacin-induced hyperglycemia is interestingly similar to that of skin flushing, which is mediated by a G-protein-coupled receptor, GPR109A, and is subject to desensitization via &#x003b2;-arrestin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In humans treated with MK-0354 (a GPR109A agonist that lacks effects on lipoproteins), FG and insulin trended higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Either niacin or MK-0354 binding to GPR109A strongly inhibits adipocyte triglyceride lipolysis and fatty-acid release, and the resulting perturbation in fuel supply might be linked to increased FG and insulin levels. We speculate that the waning of niacin&#x02019;s hyperglycemic effect, analogous to flushing, could be related to potential desensitization of GPR109A on adipocytes.</p><p>Our ability to define glycemic responses fully was limited by the study design, optimized to evaluate drug effects on lipids and safety. Characterization of incident diabetes was limited by the small number of cases; nonetheless, the low incidence is reassuring. As with any secondary analysis, these results are considered hypothesis-generating.</p><p>In summary, combination <italic>E/S+N</italic> produced small initial increases in FG and new diagnoses of diabetes that dissipated over time, largely without the use of antidiabetic medication. Consistent with guidelines, niacin is a reasonable option to treat dyslipidemia in patients with or at risk for diabetes, but risk/benefit should be weighed, and glucose should be checked periodically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>This article contains Supplementary Data online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-1369/-/DC1">http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-1369/-/DC1</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="fn2"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
