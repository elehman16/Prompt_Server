The treatment group received a combination of XELOX with thalidomide and the control group received XELOX alone. Each patient received at least 2 cycles of treatment (1 cycle=21 d). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) and the secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) as well as disease control rate (DCR).

The subgroup analysis of the study showed that improved PFS observed only in the group treated with bevacizumab plus XELOX, but not plus FOLFOX. This finding suggested that the efficacy of an anti-tumor angiogenesis agent combined with XELOX was superior to that with FOLFOX. However, bevacizumab was too expensive for many patients and it increased the risk of cerebral apoplexy and other arterial vascular events in senile patients.

The addition of thalidomide to chemotherapy could improve the efficacy of hematological tumors and prolong PFS as well as overall survival <sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>]</sup>. In May 2006, the Chinese Food and Drug Administration approved the application of thalidomide for treating multiple myeloma. The domestic and foreign studies on thalidomide for the treatment of solid tumors, particularly gastrointestinal tumors, were also growing <sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>-</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15"><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>]</sup>. However, the conclusions from these studies were not consistent. Govindarajan <sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13"><sup>13</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> found that the combination of thalidomide with some other chemotherapeutic agents improved response rates in patients with metastatic and chemotherapy resistant colon cancer. However, a phase II clinical trial by McCollum et al. <sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> showed Xeloda combined with thalidomide did not improve ORR of patients with progressive colorectal carcinoma. A domestic phase II clinical trial <sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15"><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> showed that thalidomide combined with chemotherapy did not improve the ORR or PFS compared with chemotherapy alone but did decrease gastrointestinal reaction related to irinotecan, such as diarrhea, naupathia, etc.</p><p>This study investigated efficacy of XELOX combined with or without thalidomide for the first-line treatment of MCRC patients. ORR of the treatment group was significantly improved compared with the control group. Addition of thalidomide to XELOX could effectively control the disease, postponing time-to-progression. PFS of the treatment group (5.6 months) was higher than the control group (5.2 months), but without statistical difference. It is worth noting that among the patients with hepatic metastases, 2 patients in the treatment group got hepatectomy, and the hepatectomy rate was 8.3%; but none in the control group satisfied the criteria of hepatectomy. That suggested that further studies about combination of XELOX with thalidomide for the treatment of colorectal cancer patients with hepatic metastases are needed.</p><p>The rate of constipation was higher in thalidomide group compared with the control group, but that could be alleviated by adjusting the diet of the patient or orally administrating laxatives, and that didn&#x02019;t lead to chemotherapy interruption. Thalidomide also caused drowsiness therefore patients must be instructed to take it at bedtime and not drive during the medication.</p><p>Thus, XELOX combined with thalidomide was well tolerated for the first-line treatment of MCRC. It can significantly increase DCR, although it fails to prolong PFS. A larger-sample clinical trial should be conducted in patients with hepatic metastases to explore whether the regimen could inprove the hepatectomy rate and overall survival.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>No potential conflicts of interest are disclosed.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cassidy</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Tabernero</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Twelves</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>XELOX (capecitabine plus oxaliplatin): active first-line therapy for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.</article-title><source>J Clin Oncol</source><year>2004</year>; <volume>22</volume>: <fpage>2084</fpage>-<lpage>2091</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15169795</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="r2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ladetto</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Pagliano</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferrero</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Major tumor shrinking and persistent molecular remissions after consolidation with bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone in patients with autografted myeloma.</article-title><source>J Clin Oncol</source><year>2010</year>; <volume>28</volume>: <fpage>2077</fpage>-<lpage>2084</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20308672</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="r3"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Noman</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><name><surname>Koide</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Hassan</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Thalidomide inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha production via down-regulation of MyD88 expression.</article-title><source>Innate Immun</source><year>2009</year>; <volume>15</volume>: <fpage>33</fpage>-<lpage>41</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19201823</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="r4"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">O&#x02019;Connell JB, Maggard MA, Ko CY.
