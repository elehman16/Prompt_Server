Web-based interventions are a popular approach for behaviour change given their wide reach and accessibility. However, challenges with participant engagement and retention reduce the long-term maintenance of behaviour change. Web 2.0 features present a new and innovative online environment supporting greater interactivity, with the potential to increase engagement and retention. In order to understand the applicability of these innovative interventions for the broader population, &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; interventions implemented under &#x02018;everyday conditions&#x02019; are required. The aim of this study is to investigate the difference in physical activity behaviour between individuals using a traditional Web 1.0 website with those using a novel Web 2.0 website.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>In this study we will aim to recruit 2894 participants. Participants will be recruited from individuals who register with a pre-existing health promotion website that currently provides Web 1.0 features (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.10000steps.org.au">http://www.10000steps.org.au</ext-link>). Eligible participants who provide informed consent will be randomly assigned to one of the two trial conditions: the pre-existing 10&#x02005;000 Steps website (with Web 1.0 features) or the newly developed WALK 2.0 website (with Web 2.0 features). Primary and secondary outcome measures will be assessed by self-report at baseline, 3&#x02005;months and 12&#x02005;months, and include: physical activity behaviour, height and weight, Internet self-efficacy, website usability, website usage and quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study has received ethics approval from the University of Western Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (Reference Number H8767) and has been funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (Reference Number 589903).

Given the unprecedented growth in Internet usage worldwide<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and across many populations, including women, elderly and those of low socioeconomic status,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> it is not surprising that the Internet provides an attractive medium that has the potential to reach large diverse populations, providing greater accessibility to health promotion and behaviour change approaches. A number of literature reviews have demonstrated the effectiveness of Internet-based PA interventions for behaviour change, highlighting positive short-term behaviour change outcomes.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref> Few studies, however, have reported long-term behaviour change, or have examined the effectiveness of specific website components that may impact short-term and/or long-term behaviour change. The lack of maintenance of behaviour change has often been attributed to low levels of participant engagement and retention, and requires innovative approaches to address this challenge.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Web 2.0 features may be a promising approach to increasing user interaction and retention. Web 2.0 refers to a second generation of Internet-based features that are recognised to be highly interactive, and that have evolved from the traditional &#x02018;read only&#x02019; website features to more participatory features, providing users with personal influence of how information is generated, created and shared collaboratively.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Such features might include a wide range of interactive features such as blogs, wikis, podcasts, mash-ups and social networking, all of which have the potential to revolutionise website usage if utilised effectively.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Further, there is growing acknowledgement that Web 2.0 features show promise in the field of health promotion and healthcare.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;22</xref> In order to fully understand the true effectiveness of Web 2.0 technologies in &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; health promotion and healthcare practice, there is a need for large scale population-based studies that are evaluated in real-world settings.</p><p>In the past, PA intervention and behaviour change research has focused on the evaluation and outcomes of efficacy, in which efficacy of intervention is defined as its effect under &#x02018;ideal conditions&#x02019;.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> These &#x02018;ideal conditions&#x02019; commonly consist of tightly controlled, short-term randomised control trials (RCT) which are utilised in an effort to increase the internal validity of the intervention design.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Although RCTs are often considered the gold standard of trial design due to their ability to minimise the impact of selection and information biases, control for confounding variables and potentially rule out chance, they have often been challenged on the grounds of external validity.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;26</xref> Moreover, these types of interventions can be nearly impossible to adopt or implement in real-world settings, where participants are more likely to have a variety of health issues, numerous unforeseen external influences, and are often less motivated to engage in PA.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> As a result, there is a push to go beyond the use of RCTs alone, specifically in terms of public health and health promotion practice.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> RCT's are an essential component of the research process, as a methodologically sound design will maximise internal validity, as well as provide a measure of efficacy. However, in order to understand effectiveness, generalisability and the true impact of large-scale public health and health promotion interventions on the general population, complementary approaches that go beyond RCTs and that are evaluated under normal, everyday conditions in a real-world setting (or as close to this as possible) are needed.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;29</xref> This is particularly relevant to Web 2.0 features, as their spontaneous, viral and often uncontrollable nature makes it difficult to study their true dynamics in controlled RCT circumstances.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> For example, if one cannot invite friends to join a social network, due to RCT-related restrictions, the social network is unlikely to be as functional and effective as it would be in real-world circumstances where such artificial barriers are not present. Therefore, given the proliferation of Web 2.0 features on the Internet, understanding the translation of Web-based PA intervention research into the real-world is becoming increasingly important.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>

Second, this study will investigate the effectiveness of Web 2.0 features (eg, involving social networking) to engage and retain individuals to a PA promotion website, as well as examine differences in quality of life between the intervention groups. A two-group randomised trial will be applied to compare a website using the novel Web 2.0 features with a traditional Web 1.0 intervention, and investigate the effectiveness of both interventions in a &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; setting.

<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> This instrument measures quality of life via 8 health-related concepts, including physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue and general health perceptions. RAND 36 was developed from the original SF-36 Medical Outcomes Study Survey.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Researchers from the original Medical Outcomes Study-MOS<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> released a commercial version of SF-36 while the original RAND-36 has been made available license-free from the RAND Corporation. Both survey instruments contain the same items developed for MOS,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> however the scoring for the body pain and general health sections are slightly different between the RAND and SF-36.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> In scoring RAND 36, precoded numeric values are given to each scale item. All items are then scored on a 0 to 100 range, with a high score representing a more favourable health state. Additionally, items in the same scale are averaged together to create 8 scale scores. Any items left blank are referred to as missing data and are not taken into account when calculating the scale scores.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> The RAND 36 has been validated in Australian populations,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> has demonstrated suitability for use in the general population,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>

Across the intervention period, the study will aim to recruit 1447 participants per group, resulting in a total of 2894 participants recruited into the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All analyses will follow &#x02018;intention to treat&#x02019; principles.

The sample size is inflated to take into account the possible uncertainty arising from data that is not missing at random. All analyses will be conducted using SPSS for Windows (V.20.0).

<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> However, in relation to population-based interventions that are expected to reach a large proportion of the population in a real-world setting, RCTs alone are limited in yielding valid and generalisable evidence.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> By extending our intervention implementation to a &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; trial, we are able to gain a greater understanding of the true effectiveness of an intervention in a natural setting which may be influenced by natural external variables that are not necessarily apparent in a RCT. Variables related to health status, motivation, compliance and resources associated with long-term sustainability are just a few of the external variables not taken into account when carrying out a RCT.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Being aware of these variables and any other challenges (that may occur due to chance) in a real-world setting, provides us with the opportunity to address them and develop alternative best practice approaches that are logical, plausible and meet the needs of the larger population. The current study provides an opportunity to do this. This real-world trial will provide us with a greater understanding of how to engage and retain participants from the general population, under everyday conditions, in web-based interventions aimed at increasing PA and other health-related behaviours. More importantly, this trial is the first step to understanding the factors associated with population-level dissemination and research translation. Being able to identify the successful components and challenges associated with of Web 2.0 features, particularly concerning engagement and retention, will assist with intervention refinement and further intervention delivery, ultimately impacting PA behaviours and subsequently preventing chronic disease and improving global health.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> WKM, GSK, AJM, CV, MJD and CMC conceived the project and procured the project funding.
