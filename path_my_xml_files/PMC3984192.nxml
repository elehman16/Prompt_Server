periodontium in areas previously affected by periodontal disease<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Histological and ultrastructural
studies have demonstrated that dental roots that have been exposed to the oral cavity or
to the periodontal pocket present reduced collagen fiber insertion<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, changes in their mineral
density<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and root contamination
by bacteria and its products<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Scaling
and root planing alone are not able to fully eliminate the etiological contaminants and
produce a compact smear layer covering the instrumented surface<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
which inhibits periodontal tissue reattachment<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. These alterations have become the rationale for the use of
demineralizing agents as adjunct to periodontal therapy due to their potential for
removing smear layer and exposing the underlying radicular collagen fibrils, funneling
dentin tubules and modifying dentin permeability, restoring the biocompatibility of the
roots<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p><p>It has been shown that demineralization of the root surface can exert neutralizing
effects on endotoxins from periodontal pathogens <italic>in vitro</italic>, e.g.,
inhibition of fibroblast proliferation, synthesis and attachment<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Other studies have shown that, when
compared to non-conditioned ones, acid conditioned dental roots are more effective in
maintaining fibrin clot and exposing collagen fibrils and associated
proteoglycans<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p><p>
<italic>In vivo</italic> animal<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and
human histological studies<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> have shown improved biological response
when decalcifying agents are used to condition the root surface. The most used
demineralizing agents for these purposes are citric acid<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, phosphoric
acid<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>,
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and tetracycline hydrochloride<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the great variability of protocols employed by
clinicians and researchers has prevented consistent comparisons among them. Clinical
trials have also provided insufficient evidence that acid conditioning of diseased
dental roots present any additional new attachment when compared to non-conditioned
ones. The only systematic review found on this subject was published by
Mariotti<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> (2006) who concluded
that the use of citric acid, tetracycline or EDTA to modify the root surface provides no
benefit of clinical significance to regeneration in patients with chronic periodontitis.
On the other hand, the author identified that several factors as lack of controls,
non-calibrated examiners, masked reference standards and small sample sizes, among
others, reduced the observational quality of relevant studies. As a consequence,
Mariotti<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> (2006) stated that
the overall conclusion of his review must be carefully considered.</p><p>Some authors have measured the number and diameter of dentin tubules exposed after root
conditioning in order to relate these parameters with potential for cell adhesion and
for intertubular collagen exposure<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Labahn, et al.<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> (1992) have found a time-dependent
increase in the mean dentin tubule orifice diameter after treating dentin surfaces with
citric acid or tetracycline HCl and Ruggeri, et al.<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> (2007) stressed that the exposure of the dentin matrix of root
surface allows the formation of a proper fibrin clot, which is a determinant factor for
the positive outcome of the early wound healing events<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. This would facilitate the integration between the root
surface and the connective tissue favoring migration and attachment of gingival
fibroblasts<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.</p><p>There still is a remarkable controversy concerning to the type of chemical conditioner,
time of its application and even the need of its use, which justifies the search for
parameters that can support the option for this procedure in periodontal treatments. To
the best of our knowledge, there is no standardized study comparing several chemical
root conditioners for their ability of smear layer removing and dentin tubule widening.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to contribute with reliable data to analyze and
compare diseased dental root surfaces treated by manual scaling followed by conditioning
with four commonly used demineralizing agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Specimen preparation</title><p>Twenty-five human single-rooted teeth scheduled for extraction due to advanced
periodontal disease at the Bauru School of Dentistry, University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo,
Brazil, were selected for this study after signing an informed consent form. The
selected teeth had to meet the following inclusion criteria: 1) no history of scaling
and root planing in the previous 6 months; 2) proximal attachment loss of 5 mm or
more; 3) absence of decay lesions or restorations near the cementoenamel junction
(CEJ). The freshly extracted teeth were cleaned from blood and other debris in saline
solution and visible calculus was gently removed using manual scalers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1A</xref>). The teeth were stored in formalin at
10% for no more than 7 days. The crowns were removed by transversal sectioning at the
CEJ with a water cooled high speed bur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure
1B</xref>). The diseased parts of the roots were visually identified with the aid
of a magnifying glass (Lactona - 4&#x000d7; of magnification; Lactona, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil)
as the area showing absence of remnants of the periodontal ligament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1A</xref>). Then, each root received a second
section made 2 mm away from the first in the apical direction, resulting in radicular
dishes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1C</xref>). On the mesial and distal
surfaces of the dishes, 2 grooves separated by a distance of 4 mm were made with the
same previously used bur, determining an area measuring 2 mm x 4 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">1E</xref>) approximately. This area was scaled by the same operator with 20
strokes<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> of Gracey curettes
(Hu-Friedy; Hu-Friedy do Brasil, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1F</xref>) and then, the mesial and distal halves of the dishes
were sectioned, producing 50 radicular fragments with an scaled area delimited by the
grooves in which demineralizing agents were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1G</xref>). The radicular fragments were randomly divided into 5 groups of
10 fragments each according to the treatment given to the scaled surface as follows:
1) CA: demineralization with a liquid solution of citric acid at 50% and pH1
(Pharm&#x000e1;cia Spec&#x000ed;fica; Farm&#x000e1;cias e Drogarias, Bauru, SP, Brazil) for 3 min; 2) TC-HCl:
demineralization with a liquid solution of tetracycline hydrochloride at 50 mg/mL
(Laborat&#x000f3;rio Teuto, An&#x000e1;polis, GO, Brazil) for 3 min; 3) EDTA: demineralization by a
gel of EDTA at 24% (PrefGel; BIORA AB, Malm&#x000f6;, Sweden) for 3 min; 4) PA:
demineralization with a liquid solution of 37% phosphoric acid (Pharm&#x000e1;cia Spec&#x000ed;fica;
Farm&#x000e1;cias e Drogarias) for 3 min; 5) Control: treatment with saline solution for 3
min. All the agents were applied to the roots surfaces by burnishing them with a
sterile cotton pellet changed every 30 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure
1H</xref>); the surfaces were then flushed profusely with distilled water. After
the treatments, the dental fragments were immediately processed for analysis by
conventional scanning electron microscopy (SEM).</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Specimen preparation. A: extracted teeth in which the diseased part of the root

reference for the total area (266, 240 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>) in which the percentage of
area occupied by the enlarged dentin tubules was calculated. All the morphometric
measurements were performed by a single investigator who was unaware of the origin of

improve periodontal regeneration. Unfortunately, numerous and often uncontrolled
histological and clinical studies have created controversy and confusion about the
positive or negative effects of those agents<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. The inconsistency of these studies may be due to differences in
experimental systems and techniques. Nevertheless, there is a common acceptance that it
is not possible to decontaminate periodontitis-affected root surfaces by mechanical
means alone. It is also well documented that hand or ultrasonic scaling of root surface
produces a nonbiocompatible smear layer that must be removed to expose the underlying
collagen in order to favor fibroblast migration, attachment, and orientation<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.</p><p>Tetracycline became one of the most widely used and studied demineralizing agents since
<italic>in vitro</italic> studies of Terranova, et al.<sup><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> (1986) suggested its potential usefulness in
regenerative procedures. Many concentrations and application times were tested ranging
from 0.5% to 200% and from 0.5 to 10 min<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Most of the studies,
however, found the best results with concentrations between 50 mg/mL and 125 mg/mL
during 3 to 4 min of application by burnishing technique. Isik, et al.<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> (2000) concluded that concentrations
between 50 mg/mL and 125 mg/mL might alter dentin surfaces by removing the smear layer
and also maximize tubule openings in a short period if repeated applications are
performed. Based on these studies, we adopted the concentration of 50 mg/mL for TC-HCl.
It has also been shown that burnishing the demineralizing agent on the root surface
results in efficient removal of smear layer and exposure of the underlying tubules due
to demineralization action of fresh acid solution<sup><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. This was the rationale for the use of burnishing technique and
for changing the cotton pellet at every 30 s in this study.</p><p>The low pH of the saturated solutions of citric acid and tetracycline-HCl were suggested
as one of the reasons for the reduced cellular insertion and for the unpredictability of
the results, once it could denature the organic matrix of dentin<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. It was also suggested that acid etching
would interfere on periodontal healing by its necrotizing effect on the surrounding
progenitor cells<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Thus, EDTA at
12%-24%, neutral pH for 30 s to 3 min was introduced aiming at removing smear layer and
widening dentin tubules without damaging biological structures<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Notwithstanding, Ruggeri, et al.<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> (2007) presented reliable findings using
monoclonal antibodies and field emission in-lens scanning electron microscopy (FEISEM)
showing that both citric acid and EDTA treatments are able to etch and expose collagen
fibrils and proteoglycans without any degradation of dentin collagen matrix. Our
findings demonstrated that EDTA, in this way of use, failed to properly remove smear
layer and expose dentin tubules. Five specimens (50%) from the EDTA group had none of
their dentin tubules exposed and only 2 were totally clean from smear layer.</p><p>It must be emphasized that even though CA and TC-HCl did not differ significantly on
tubule number and widening evaluations, TC-HCl could not be considered different from
the other groups. This result was the responsible for classifying TC-HCl in second place
in our analysis. Another interesting finding was that CA and PA exposed similar numbers
of dentin tubules, but CA produced greater enlargement as reflected by the area
measurements. EDTA and PA had the same behavior as saline solution on both evaluations,
suggesting that these agents failed on efficiently conditioning the roots surfaces. As
EDTA showed lower numerical results, it was classified in fourth place.</p><p>All specimens from the PA group showed a foamy surface, probably due to a chemical
acid/basic reaction between a strong acid and the hydroxyapatite, leading to calcium
phosphate deposition on the roots surfaces. This occurrence can be attributed to the
extended time of acid contact with the roots (3 min). It may produce an insoluble form
of that salt, which precipitates, blocking tubule openings and annulling its
demineralizing effect<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. As the superficial composition of these
deposits was not characterized in this study, this interpretation is speculative.
However, it is suggestive that phosphoric acid is not appropriate for root conditioning
in this particular way of using.</p><p>Relevant findings from other researchers have reinforced that acid etching plays a
decisive role in the establishment of new connective tissue attachment influencing the
early healing events, i.e., adsorption and adhesion of blood elements and fibrin to the
root surface<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. In this aspect, Baker,
et al.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> (2005) have clearly
demonstrated the superiority of citric acid in comparison to EDTA when applied for 5 min
on planed dentin root surfaces. Fibrin clot adhesion was better supported by the
CA-treated than EDTA-treated dentin surfaces and forces produced by three 5-min rinses
in PBS under agitation on a rotary shaker table partially removed the fibrin clot from
EDTA-treated surfaces but not from CA-treated surfaces. The authors stressed that a
fibrin network was firmly attached directly on dentin surface were the tubules were
exposed and widened by the citric acid treated fragments. These findings led us to
believe that the more exposed and widened the dentin tubules are, the more retained the
fibrin clot will be on the root surface, perhaps within limits still to be determined.
Citric acid and tetracycline behaved very similarly in this particular aspect,
suggesting that both can be equally effective as conditioning agents.</p><p>The number and diameter of exposed dentin tubules in laser-conditioned roots were
calculated in SEM micrographs by Herrero, et al.<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> (2009) who related increased numbers and diameters to better root
conditioning, once widening tubules openings causes higher exposure of the underlying
dentin favoring connective tissue attachment. Gamal and Mailhot<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> (2003) also observed that periodontal
ligament fibroblasts adhere and differentiate on EDTA-conditioned roots surfaces that
were free from smear layer and presented exposed round to oval dentin tubule orifices.
Nevertheless, there is no study comparing the number of exposed dentin tubules and their
corresponding area after conditioning with several conditioners for comparison with our
data.</p><p>The findings of this study corroborate previous data stressing the advantages of using
conditioning agents on diseased root surfaces and provide additional relevant
information when choosing an agent for root conditioning. Before extrapolation of data
to the clinical conditions can be done, the correspondence between capacity for tubule
exposure/widening and intensity of connective tissue attachment should be further
investigated in <italic>in vivo</italic> surveys.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The comparison among four of the most frequently used chemical root conditioners
according to their efficiency on smear layer removal and dentin tubule widening showed
that citric acid was the most effective followed by tetracycline-HCl, phosphoric acid
and EDTA. This information can be of value as an extra parameter for choosing one of
them for root conditioning.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank Professor Jos&#x000e9; Roberto Pereira Lauris, from Bauru School of
