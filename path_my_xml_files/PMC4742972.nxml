cardiovascular, peripheral, and pulmonary factors that determine the ventilatory
response to exercise. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of
continuous exercise training and interval exercise training on the OUES in patients
with coronary artery disease. Thirty-five patients (59.3&#x000b1;1.8 years old; 28 men, 7
women) with coronary artery disease were randomly divided into two groups: continuous
exercise training (n=18) and interval exercise training (n=17). All patients
performed graded exercise tests with respiratory gas analysis before and 3 months
after the exercise-training program to determine ventilatory anaerobic threshold
(VAT), respiratory compensation point, and peak oxygen consumption (peak
VO<sub>2</sub>). The OUES was assessed based on data from the second minute of
exercise until exhaustion by calculating the slope of the linear relation between
oxygen uptake and the logarithm of total ventilation. After the interventions, both
groups showed increased aerobic fitness (P&#x0003c;0.05). In addition, both the continuous
exercise and interval exercise training groups demonstrated an increase in OUES
(P&#x0003c;0.05). Significant associations were observed in both groups: 1) continuous
exercise training (OUES and peak VO<sub>2</sub> r=0.57; OUES and VO<sub>2</sub> VAT
r=0.57); 2) interval exercise training (OUES and peak VO<sub>2</sub> r=0.80; OUES and
VO<sub>2</sub> VAT r=0.67). Continuous and interval exercise training resulted in
a similar increase in OUES among patients with coronary artery disease. These
findings suggest that improvements in OUES among CAD patients after aerobic exercise
training may be dependent on peripheral and central mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Coronary artery disease</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Cardiorespiratory fitness</kwd><kwd>Ventilatory efficiency</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="24"/><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) is a highly reliable and well-validated approach
to assessing aerobic performance and monitoring exercise tolerance in patients with
cardiovascular disease (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In this context, Baba
et al. (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) introduced the oxygen uptake
efficiency slope (OUES), an objective and reproducible measure of cardiopulmonary
function. The OUES is derived from the single regression analysis between oxygen uptake
and minute ventilation during incremental exercise. Importantly, OUES evaluates the
functional capacities of several organ systems, such as cardiovascular, pulmonary and
skeletal muscle metabolism during exercise (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) in a single index. The OUES has
been investigated as an index of cardiopulmonary functional reserve in patients with
various conditions (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Of particular note, a study that followed
patients with cardiovascular disease over 6 years showed that the OUES was a good
prognostic indicator (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Aerobic exercise training has been recommended as a non-pharmacological treatment for
patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In this regard, continuous
exercise training (CET) has been shown to promote increased cardiorespiratory fitness in
CAD patients (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, over the last few
decades, there has been increasing interest in interval exercise training (IET) for
cardiac rehabilitation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). IET consists of periods of high-intensity exercise alternated
with periods at lower intensity; this allows cardiac patients to complete short exercise
bouts at a higher intensity than would have been possible during continuous exercise.
Previous investigations (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr"/>) have also shown that IET effectively improves the
aerobic fitness of CAD patients.</p><p>Although both CET and IET have been shown to improve aerobic fitness, there is little
information about the effects of the mode and intensity of exercise training on OUES in
CAD patients. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of CET and IET
on OUES in patients with CAD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects|methods"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec><title>Population</title><p>The participants were patients admitted to the coronary care unit of the TotalCor
Hospital for the diagnosis of CAD. After being discharged from the hospital, the
patients enrolled in a cardiac rehabilitation program at the cardiorespiratory
rehabilitation center of the Amil group. Thirty-five CAD patients (59.3&#x000b1;1.8 years
old; 28 men, 7 women) were randomly divided into two groups: CET (n=17) and IET
(n=18). This trial was designed to test the exercise-training modalities for
noninferiority, with the key secondary objective of testing for superiority with
respect to the OUES. The inclusion criterion was having stable CAD diagnosed by
coronary angiography. Exclusion criteria included having unstable angina pectoris,
complex ventricular arrhythmias, pulmonary congestion, and orthopedic or neurological
limitations to exercise. Patients remained on their standard medications throughout
the study, and no changes in medications were reported. The study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the Universidade Santa Cecilia (66/2011) and all of the study
participants gave their written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Graded exercise test</title><p>Maximal graded exercise tests were carried out on a programmable treadmill
(DigiStress model pulsar, Brazil) before, and three months after commencing the IET
or CET intervention. Gas exchange and ventilatory variables were measured
continuously during the gas exchange tests, breath-by-breath, using an open-circuit
spirometry procedure on an exercise-based system (SensorMedics, model Vmax 229
Pulmonary Function/Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing Instrument, USA). The following
variables were obtained breath-by-breath and expressed as 30-s averages: pulmonary
oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub> mL&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup>, standard
temperature and pressure, dry) pulmonary ventilation (VE L/min body temperature and
pressure, saturated), end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (PetCO<sub>2</sub> mmHg),
ventilatory equivalent ratio for oxygen (VE/VO<sub>2</sub>), and ventilatory
equivalent ratio for carbon dioxide (VE/VCO<sub>2</sub>). Before each test, the gas
analyzers were calibrated using a gas mixture containing known concentrations of
carbon dioxide and oxygen balanced with nitrogen, and the flow meter was calibrated
using a 3-L syringe. Heart rate was continuously recorded at rest, during the graded
exercise testing, and during the recovery period using a 12-lead ECG (HW Systems,
HeartWare Ltda, USA). All tests in this study were performed in the same laboratory
at a room temperature of 20-23&#x000b0;C.</p><p>The subjects performed a ramp-like progressive exercise test to exhaustion on the
treadmill. The exercise workload (speed and/or slope) was increased every 1 minute
with completion of the incremental part of the exercise test occurring between 8 and
12 min. The following criteria were used to define maximal effort: 1) participants
demonstrated subjective evidence of exhaustion (unsteady gait, facial flushing, and
hyperpnea), and either 2) peak heart rate (HR) &#x02265;95% age-predicted maximum, or 3)
maximal respiratory exchange ratio (RER) &#x02265;1.10 (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Ventilatory anaerobic threshold</title><p>The ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) was defined as the break point between the
increase in the carbon dioxide output and VO<sub>2</sub> (V-Slope) or the point at
which VE/VO<sub>2</sub> reached its minimum value and began to rise without a
concomitant rise in VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> (13).</p></sec><sec><title>Respiratory compensation point</title><p>The respiratory compensation point (RCP) was defined as the point at which
VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> reached its minimum value and began to rise, and the highest
value of PetCO<sub>2</sub> before its progressive fall (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In the present investigation, all patients reached the
RCP.</p></sec><sec><title>Peak oxygen consumption</title><p>The peak oxygen consumption was defined as the maximum VO<sub>2</sub> attained during
the exercise period in which the subject reached exhaustion (analog scale from Borg's
scale of perceived exertion).</p></sec><sec><title>Oxygen uptake efficiency slope calculation</title><p>The OUES was assessed based on the respiratory data during exercise by calculating
the slope of the linear relationship between VO<sub>2</sub> (y-axis) and the
logarithm of VE (x-axis) using single regression analysis. The OUES was derived from
the relationship: VO<sub>2</sub>=a log10 VE+b, where a is the OUES and b is the
intercept. Before inclusion in the regression analysis, respiratory data were
averaged every 30 s from the beginning of the second minute of exercise until evident
exhaustion. The first minute of exercise was not included in the analyses because of
irregular breathing patterns during early exercise (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Ventilatory efficiency analysis</title><p>The VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> Slope, which reflects the rate of increase in minute
ventilation per unit increase in CO<sub>2</sub> production, was obtained by linear
regression analysis of the relationship between VE and VCO<sub>2</sub> during
exercise using the data from the entire exercise test excluding the first minute
(<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>The difference in end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure from at rest to its highest value
during exercise (&#x00394; PeTCO<sub>2</sub> rest-exercise) was also analyzed (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Exercise-training program</title><p>A supervised exercise-training program was conducted at the cardiorespiratory
rehabilitation center of the Amil Group. The exercise-training program consisted of
three 60-min exercise sessions per week for a 3-month period. Each exercise session
included a 5-min warm-up, 42 or 50 min of aerobic exercise, and 5 min of cool-down
exercises. The CET consisted of 50-min of treadmill exercise at VAT intensity. The
IET consisted of seven sets of 3 min at RCP and seven sets of 3 min of exercise at
VAT intensity, totaling 42 min of exercise. The estimated energy expenditure for both
exercise-training modalities ranged from 200 to 230 kcal/min. Heart rate was
monitored throughout the sessions to ensure that all patients exercised within the
intensity limits. Adherence to the exercise-training program was assessed based on
the percentage of exercise sessions attended, with all patients attending more than
80% of the sessions.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., USA).
Data are reported as means&#x000b1;SE. A P value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant. The normality of distribution was checked for all
variables using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Student's unpaired
<italic>t</italic>-tests and Fischer's exact tests were used to assess baseline
differences between the CET and IET groups for all dependent variables.</p><p>Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures was performed to test for
possible within-group and between-group differences in physical characteristics,
cardiorespiratory parameters, and the OUES. When significant differences were
detected, Tukey&#x02019;s <italic>post hoc</italic> comparisons were performed. Single
regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between OUES and
cardiorespiratory parameters after exercise training.</p><p>For the CET group, the sample size of 18 provided the power (96%) to detect a
difference in OUES based on a relevant difference of 0.32 L/min, an SD of 0.35 L/min,
&#x003b1;=0.05, and a two-tailed test of significance. For the IET group, the sample size of
17 provided the power (99%) to detect a difference in OUES based on a relevant
difference of 0.32 L/min, an SD of 0.30 L/min, &#x003b1;=0.05, and a two-tailed test of

in CAD patients; 2) CET and IET resulted in the same degree of increase in OUES; 3)
significant associations were observed between OUES and aerobic capacity for CET and
IET.</p><p>This study evaluated the effects of interval and continuous exercise on OUES in patients
with CAD. Determining the mechanisms involved in increasing OUES after exercise training
are beyond the scope of the present study; however, we suggest that factors related to
peripheral metabolic adaptations, such as increased aerobic metabolism, may be involved.
After 12 weeks of either CET or IET, CAD patients demonstrated similar increases in
VO<sub>2</sub> at VAT. In addition, our results showed significant post-intervention
associations between OUES and VO<sub>2</sub> at VAT.</p><p>Baba et al. (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) proposed that the physiological
mechanisms reflected in the OUES are the development of metabolic acidosis, which is
controlled by distribution of blood to skeletal muscles, and also the physiologic dead
space, which is affected by perfusion of the lungs. Thus, an increase in OUES after
aerobic exercise training indicates that a given oxygen uptake has been achieved with
lower ventilatory demand at submaximal workloads (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Our results showed that the ratio of VE to VO<sub>2</sub> (reflecting
the ventilatory requirement for a given amount of work) was significantly reduced at
matched work rates after CET and IET. Notably, an increase in capillary density, muscle
blood flow, and mitochondrial density after aerobic exercise training leads to a delay
in the onset of metabolic acidosis, thereby decreasing the ventilatory response during
exercise. These results are in accordance with previous investigations demonstrating the
effects of exercise training on OUES in cardiac patients (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). For instance, Van
Laethem et al. (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) showed an increase in OUES
after a 6-month exercise-training program in patients with chronic heart failure.
Furthermore, in the same study, the authors observed that the increase in OUES
correlated with improvement in VAT.</p><p>In the present study, after a 3-month exercise intervention, both training methods were
found to result in the same level of improvement in aerobic fitness. These findings
agree with those of previous studies that have demonstrated similar effectiveness of CET
and IET for increasing cardiorespiratory fitness in CAD patients (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, other
studies (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) have observed a greater increase in fitness in response to IET than to
CET. Rognmo et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) reported a greater
increase in cardiorespiratory fitness among CAD patients who performed IET, alternating
between 4 min at higher intensity (80%-90% peak VO<sub>2</sub>) and 3 min at moderate
intensity (50%-60% peak VO<sub>2</sub>) throughout the exercise session. In the same
investigation (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), the CAD patients who
performed CET completed 41 min of moderate intensity (50%-60% peak VO<sub>2</sub>)
exercise for a 10-week period. In contrast, in the present study the CAD patients in the
IET group performed seven 3-min sets of exercise at RCP (80%-90% peak VO<sub>2</sub>)
and seven 3-min sets of exercise at moderate intensity corresponding to the VAT, whereas
the CET group patients performed 50 min of exercise at VAT (70%-80% peak
VO<sub>2</sub>), for 12 weeks. We suggest that the similar fitness improvements observed
in both groups may be attributed to the greater relative intensity and higher volume of
exercise performed by the CET group in our present study. Controversy remains regarding
the mode and intensity of aerobic exercise that yields optimal cardiorespiratory effects
in CAD patients.</p><p>In this investigation, the improvement in OUES after aerobic exercise training was
positively correlated with peak VO<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, Defoor et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) showed an improvement in OUES in 425 patients
with CAD after an exercise-training program. In the same study, the authors observed
similar increases in both peak VO<sub>2</sub> and OUES. These findings indicate that the
OUES may be a sensitive measure for quantifying exercise performance improvements in
cardiac patients.</p><p>It is important to mention that a previous study (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) reported that the use of beta-blockers could mitigate improvements in
aerobic capacity in healthy subjects. In the present study, there were more patients
using beta-blockers in the CET group than in the IET group. However, our results suggest
that beta-blockers had no effect on the increase in aerobic capacity after exercise
training in CAD patients. In the same context, Vanhees et al. (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) observed similar increases in peak oxygen uptake in CAD patients
with and without beta blockers (36 and 34.5%, respectively).</p><p>CET and IET showed a similar post-intervention ventilatory efficiency response, as shown
by a decrease in VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> Slope. Additionally, both the CET and IET groups
demonstrated an increase in &#x00394;PetCO<sub>2</sub> at rest after the exercise intervention.
Based on these findings, our results suggest that the increase in ventilatory efficiency
after aerobic exercise training could be related to a reduction in ventilation/perfusion
mismatch (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Furthermore, it has been suggested
that increases in ventilatory efficiency after aerobic exercise training may be related
to attenuation of hypercapnic CO<sub>2</sub> chemosensitivity (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, in spite of these previous findings, we failed to
observe a correlation between VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> Slope and OUES after the exercise
intervention in either group. In fact, the present results suggest that the improvement
in OUES after the interventions may not be associated with the physiological mechanisms
related to the decreased VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> Slope in CAD patients.</p><p>A limitation of this study is the fact that there were more hypertensive patients in the
CET group than in the IET group. In general, hypertensive patients exhibit a greater
increase in blood pressure during exercise than non-hypertensive subjects of the same
age (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The higher systemic peripheral resistance associated with hypertension at
all levels of exercise may result in increased left ventricular workload and
consequently an inadequate cardiac response during exercise.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that both CET and IET resulted in similar
improvements in OUES in patients with CAD. These data suggest that improvements in OUES
