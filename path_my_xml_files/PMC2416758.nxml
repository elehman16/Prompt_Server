A double-blind, placebo (starch 50 mg) controlled experiment was carried out with 19 patients randomly divided into diazepam (n = 10) and placebo (n = 9) groups. They were evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination, and tests were conducted for immediate and delayed (short-term) memory with emotionally toned stimuli (negative, positive, neutral), recognition, and semantic memory in visual or auditory modality. The Visual Analog Mood scale (VAMS) was applied to measure anxiety and mood changes after the administration of drugs (30 minutes and 6 hours). Higher scores in the positively toned list among patients who received diazepam were observed, at the 30-minute compared with the 6-hour evaluation. The recall index of positive words in the diazepam group was positive and significantly different from the index of the placebo group. No anterograde amnesia following diazepam was observed. The neural model of a dysfunction of limbic prefrontal cortical structures that impairs the modulation of the amygdala in major depression may explain the present results. Consequently, the action of diazepam on the amygdala, which has been proposed to be the basis of its anxiolytic action, might be altered, modifying the modulation of memory in our patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>major depression</kwd><kwd>diazepam</kwd><kwd>emotional memory tasks</kwd><kwd>amygdala</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is extensive evidence that benzodiazepines, the most widely prescribed psychotropic drug class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Greenblatt et al 1983</xref>), induce anterograde amnesia in both humans and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Lister 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Thiebot 1985</xref>). The findings of several experiments suggest that the anxiolytic properties of benzodiazepines involve effects mediated by the amygdala. Intra-amygdala injections of benzodiazepines produce anxiolytic effects comparable to those induced by systemic injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Nagy et al 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Scheel-Kr&#x000fc;ger and Petersen 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Shibata et al 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Niehoff and Kuhar 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Petersen et al 1985</xref>). Furthermore, intra-amygdala injections of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil attenuate the anxiolytic effects of systemically administered benzodiazepines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hodges et al 1987</xref>). Recent findings by Izquierdo and colleagues (1990) suggest that benzodiazepine impairment of memory involves GABAergic type A receptors in the amygdala. Post-training intra-amygdala injection of flumazenil causes memory facilitation comparable to that found with systemic injections, and systemic injection of flumazenil before training attenuates the amnestic effects of post-training intra-amygdala injection of muscimol.</p><p>Studies examining the memory-modulating effects of drug treatments have provided evidence that memory can be modulated by systemic as well as intra-amygdala GABAergic compounds. When administered shortly after training, GABAergic agonists (eg, muscimol and baclofen) impair memory retention, while GABAergic antagonists (eg, picrotoxin and bicuculline) enhance retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Breen and McGaugh 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Brioni and McGaugh 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Brioni et al 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Castellano et al 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ammassari-Teule et al 1991</xref>). On the other hand, there is extensive evidence indicating a key role for GABA neurotransmission in the modulation of fearful/defensive behaviors. It has been found that systemic or intra-amygdala injections of GABA agonists reduce and GABA antagonists enhance experimental fear and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Graeff 1990</xref>). Furthermore, lesions of the amygdala attenuate the antianxiety as well as the memory-modulating effects of GABAergic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Shibata et al 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ammassari-Teule et al 1991</xref>). A recent study with magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed low GABA levels in the occipital cortex of depressed patients, but in vivo GABA(A)-receptor binding activity with benzodiazepine radioligand was not altered. Cortical benzodiazepine binding to GABA(A) receptors has been measured with <sup>123</sup>I-labeled flumazenil and single photon emission computed tomography in unmedicated patients with major depression and healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Kugaya et al 2003</xref>).</p><p>Depression is currently seen as a chronic medical disorder that produces as much functional limitation and morbidity as chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Angst 1999</xref>). One of the most frequent and neuropsychologically well investigated symptoms in depression is reduced memory capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Burt et al 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Ilsley et al 1995</xref>). The condition is thought to result from dysfunctions in monoaminergic systems affecting norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine at several effector sites. Disturbances of the limbic&#x02013;hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal axis and the serotonin system were found, and changes in adrenoceptors associated with the pituitary&#x02013;adrenal axis function strongly implicate a disorder in central noradrenergic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Leonard 2000</xref>). The effect of corticotropin-releasing factor in modulating the activity of noradrenergic neurons in the locus ceruleus may provide a link between environmental trigger factors and central noradrenergic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Leonard 2000</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that depression may affect the amygdala noradrenergic modulation of memory and, through the noradrenergic/GABAergic connection, may modify the anterograde amnestic effect of benzodiazepines. Furthermore, the action of benzodiazepines may block the negative tendency on emotional memory tasks described for depressed patients. The purpose of the present study was evaluation of the effect of diazepam on explicit memory (emotional and non-emotional tasks) in patients with major depression who were not previously receiving benzodiazepines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment with diazepam 10 mg (Novaquim-Sigma<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) was carried out with DSM-IV Major Depression patients (by certificated psychiatrists) during the first 24 hours after admission in the psychiatric unit of a general university hospital.

The Mini-Mental State Examination was also administered at the 30-minute evaluation.

The emotional content of the words, effect on other words in mixed lists, and effect of age, education, and symptoms of depression were evaluated before the final lists were achieved. The Portuguese idiom in Brazil still lacks population studies on quantitative linguistics (such as word frequency and age of acquisition). Therefore, the Ceitlin study covered most of these factors for generation of the present word lists.</p><p>The effect of the emotionally arousing word lists on a patient&#x02019;s subjective states (mood and anxiety) was evaluated by the Visual Analog Mood scale (VAMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Norris 1971</xref>), which consists of 16 analog items composed of two adjectives with opposite feelings, separated by a 10-cm line on which the subject has to mark the point which best describes his/her feelings at the time.

For positive words, the gradient showed the least variation among the diazepam group, significantly less than in placebo patients. These findings may suggest a facilitatory effect of diazepam (10 mg) on the recall of positive words (30 minutes after administration).

For that reason, selection of the statistical techniques (analyses and alpha control) was especially careful. Therefore, further investigation with larger samples is mandatory. However, our results are provocative and raise an interesting hypothesis.</p><p>Comparisons between diazepam and placebo groups showed no difference on non-emotional memory tests. Patients did not present anterograde amnesia following administration of diazepam; however, this effect has been demonstrated in normal volunteers and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Sutton et al 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Zuardi et al 1993</xref>). Benzodiazepine effects are mediated through the GABA(A) complex by enhancing GABA-induced synaptic inhibition. As the GABAergic system in the amygdaloid complex is a site of action for the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines, it has been suggested that benzodiazepines may also influence memory through the amygdala. Lesions in the amygdaloid complex can block diazepam-induced retention deficits, and central and lateral, but not basolateral, amygdala nuclei lesions impaired retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Tomaz et al 1993</xref>). The amygdala is a key structure in the brain&#x02019;s integration of emotional meaning with perception and experience and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of major depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Drevets 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bremner et al 2000</xref>). There is growing interest in understanding brain mechanisms of memory formation for emotionally arousing events, a development closely related to renewed interest in the concept of memory consolidation. There is little doubt that memory for emotionally arousing events is better than for neutral stimuli. This is clearly adaptive, because emotional stimuli, whether pleasant or aversive, are generally more important to species survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Hamann et al 1999</xref>). Most current evidence indicates that the amygdala is not a site of storage of memory processes but plays a key role in modulation of emotional memory for both human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">McGaugh et al 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Cahill and McGaugh 1998</xref>) and nonhuman subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Barros et al 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bianchin et al 1999</xref>). Long-term, but not short-term, memory has been shown to be enhanced by emotional arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Quevedo et al 2003</xref>).</p><p>Depression may affect the amygdala noradrenergic modulation of memory and, through the noradrenergic/GABAergic connection, may modify the anterograde amnestic effect of benzodiazepines. Functional neuro-imaging studies of the anatomical correlates of familial major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder have identified abnormalities of resting blood flow and glucose metabolism in depression in the amygdala and the orbital and medial prefrontal cortical areas that are extensively connected with the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Drevets 1999</xref>). The amygdala metabolism in major depression and bipolar disorder is positively correlated with both depression severity and stressed plasma cortisol concentrations measured during scanning. Thus, a neural model of a dysfunction of limbic prefrontal cortical structures impairing modulation of the amygdala in major depression, leading to abnormal processing of emotional stimuli, may be considered. Consequently, the action of diazepam on the amygdala, which has been proposed to be the basis of its anxiolytic action, might be altered, modifying the modulation of memory in our patients.</p><p>Substantial evidence from animal and human subject studies converges on the view that memory for emotionally arousing events is modulated by an endogenous memory-modulating system consisting, at a minimum, of stress hormones and the amygdaloid complex. Within the normal range of emotions experienced, this system is viewed as an evolutionarily adaptive method of creating memory strength that is, in general, proportional to memory importance (<xref
