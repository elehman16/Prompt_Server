Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin and epirubicin, are effective clinical chemotherapeutic agents used to treat breast cancer patients. However, one of the major limitations of using anthracyclines as chemotherapy is their cardiotoxicity. Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is an accumulative dose-dependent effect, which can manifest clinically as acute and potentially lethal cardiac events including pericarditis and late cardiomyopathy, which may lead to irreversible heart failure.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> In addition to direct damage to cardiomyocytes, a number of studies have shown that anthracyclines cause dysfunction of the cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS),<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> independent from the deterioration of cardiac contractility.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Hence, how to reduce or prevent the occurrence of anthracycline-linked cardiotoxicity to increase the therapeutic window for breast cancer patients has been an interesting research area for both cardiologists and oncologists in the field.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Dexrazoxane (DRZ) is used clinically to decrease anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> A previous study demonstrated that DRZ did not reduce the therapeutic effects of anthracyclines, particularly in advanced/metastatic breast cancer patients<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>; however, the use of DRZ in combination with anthracyclines may increase the incidence of bone marrow suppression. In addition, there is limited evidence showing the benefits offered by the administration of DRZ before the initiation of anthracycline treatment in patients with early stage breast cancer. Currently, the FDA has approved only DRZ treatment for advanced/metastatic breast cancer patients who have received a 300-mg/m<sup>2</sup> doxorubicin treatment. Whether DRZ is cardioprotective when administered prior to the treatment with anthracyclines in early stage breast cancer patients has not been well explored, but there are some preliminary findings to suggest that DRZ treatment is beneficial when used this way. One clinical study showed that patients administered DRZ before doxorubicin treatment had fewer adverse cardiac events (27.7%) compared with those in whom DRZ was not administered (52.4%).<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Testore et al<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> also conducted a retrospective study on 318 patients who received anthracycline treatment. Among these patients, 302 had early stage breast cancers and received DRZ treatment prior to the initiation of anthracycline therapy. The authors concluded that DRZ treatment offered cardioprotective benefits for these early stage breast cancer patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Therefore, it appears that DRZ pretreatment before anthracycline administration may protect the heart from anthracycline-induced damage.</p><p>Although the risk for cardiotoxicity caused by anthracycline treatment is largely caused by accumulation from repetitive dosing, the presence of other factors, including hypertension, aging, preexisting cardiovascular diseases, and coadministration of other treatments, may make breast cancer patients more susceptible to anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Diabetes is a well-defined risk factor for coronary heart disease,<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> and several studies have suggested that women with diabetes are more likely to develop breast cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Although it has not been demonstrated whether the presence of diabetes increases the incidence of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients, given that diabetes is a strong risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events, it is likely that diabetes contributes to clinical cardiotoxicity.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> In particular, cardiac ANS damage has been associated with diabetes<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> as well as with anthracyclines. A consensus has not been established regarding sustaining minimal cardiotoxicity in the treatment of breast cancer patients with comorbid diabetes. Previously, we reported that an early treatment with DRZ in combination with anthracycline administration improved diastolic function in early breast cancer patients with type 2 diabetes.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup></p><p>In the present study, we further explored the cardioprotective effects of DRZ in early stage breast cancer patients with diabetes who had been treated with epirubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Specifically, we tested whether DRZ treatment prior to the initiation of epirubicin therapy can ameliorate cardiac ANS dysfunction in early stage breast cancer patients with diabetes.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Selection of subjects</title><p>A total of 110 patients diagnosed with both early stage breast cancer and type 2 diabetes<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> were recruited to the study between October 2012 and April 2014 at the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University Breast Center.

EC chemotherapy was administered intravenously once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (126 days total). Thirty minutes before administration of epirubicin, the patients in the Chemo group received intravenous injection of saline (0.9% NaCl solution), while the patients in the Chemo&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;DRZ group received intravenous injection of 800&#x0200a;mg/m<sup>2</sup> DRZ.</p><p>All patients underwent general physical examinations to determine height, weight, and blood pressure. Routine blood tests were conducted on each subject to measure electrolyte, lipid, and blood glucose levels.

For standard (non-Holter) ECG examination, each patient rested in a supine position for 10 minutes and a standard 12-lead ECG was recorded with a multilead ECG machine (Photoelectric Medical Electronic Instrument Co Ltd, Shanghai, China). Lead II was selected to trace 10 cardiac cycles and the average R-R interval (intervals between consecutive heartbeats) was used to calculate the resting heart rate (RHR). Subjects also underwent 24-hour ambulatory Holter ECG monitoring (model 90217-18Q, Hertford), which was capable of 24-hour monitoring of blood pressure and ECG with 3 channels. Electrodes were placed in the standard positions on disinfected skin. The recorded data were automatically analyzed by CardioVisions 1.13.0 analysis software. Heart rate variability (HRV) was evaluated for both time and frequency domains. Time-domain analysis included the following measurements: the standard deviation (SD) of all normal-to-normal intervals (i.e., the SD of R-R intervals of all sinus beats), the SD of the average of all normal-to-normal intervals during all 5-minute intervals, the root mean square of differences between adjacent normal-to-normal intervals, and the percent of number of pairs of adjacent normal-to-normal interval difference by &#x0003e;50 milliseconds in the total number of normal-to-normal intervals. Frequency-domain analysis included the following: low frequency (LF), 0.04 to 0.15&#x0200a;Hz; high frequency (HF), 0.15 to 0.40&#x0200a;Hz; and LF/HF, ratio of the LF band to the HF band.</p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data were presented as mean&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;SD.

A number of measures may be used to evaluate HRV,<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> and in the present study, we employed the 2 most frequently used types of measurement, time domain and frequency domain measurements, to evaluate HRV; both of them may be used to assess the cardiac sympathovagal balance. A decrease in HRV represents impaired cardiac autonomic activity. Consistent with previous findings showing damaged cardiac sympathovagal balance by anthracyclines,<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> our study revealed indeed that patients in both the Chemo and Chemo&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;DRZ groups exhibited decreased HRV after epirubicin treatment, suggesting that epirubicin impaired cardiac ANS activity. However, this decrease was attenuated in patients in the Chemo&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;DRZ group, indicating that DRZ ameliorated the ANS dysfunction induced by epirubicin. In the present study, we also used RHR to evaluate the degree of cardiac ANS dysfunction caused by epirubicin and the cardioprotective effect of DRZ. RHR is also an indicator of ANS activity, and its abnormal increase is a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> A previous study showed that an increase in RHR by 10&#x0200a;beats/min was equivalent to an increase in systolic blood pressure of 10&#x0200a;mm&#x0200a;Hg, resulting in an 8% increase in the incidence of major cardiovascular events, and an 11% increase in the risk for heart failure specifically.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> Indeed, we found that after chemotherapy, all patients exhibited higher RHR, suggestive of impaired ANS activity. The DRZ treatment attenuated the increase in RHR significantly (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). Thus, consistent with the above-mentioned HRV data, DRZ improved cardiac ANS function in epirubicin-treated breast cancer patients as evaluated by RHR changes.</p><p>One concern in our study was that our chemotherapy regime contained both epirubicin and cyclophosphamide; theoretically, the role of cyclophosphamide on the insult to cardiac ANS function could not be ruled out completely. However, a previous study revealed that cyclophosphamide caused heart damage only at a high dosage (&#x0003e;1.55&#x0200a;g/m<sup>2</sup>/d) after 1 to 3 weeks of administration.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Also, cyclophosphamide treatment alone was ever used as a control to explore the impairment of the cardiac ANS activity in the anthracycline-treated breast cancer patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> The cyclophosphamide dosage used in our study (0.5&#x0200a;g/m<sup>2</sup>/d) was much lower than the above-mentioned heart-damaging dosage, and none of the patients in our study showed any signs of heart failure at any time in the observation period. Therefore, it is unlikely that the cardiac ANS damage observed in these chemotherapy patients was due to cyclophosphamide; instead, we believe that the cardiac ANS damage reflected by the increase in RHR and decrease in HRV is attributable to epirubicin.</p><p>Diabetes is a widely recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease,<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> and autonomic neuropathy is one of the most common complications of diabetes with an incidence rate &#x0003e;60% for diabetic patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> HRV is reduced in diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy and has been used extensively to evaluate the degree of autonomic neuropathy in patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> Our study suggested that DRZ improved HRV in epirubicin-treated breast cancer patients with diabetes; however, we did not recruit a control (nondiabetic) group. Therefore, we did not know whether these patients had impaired cardiac autonomic function linked to their diabetes prior to commencing chemotherapy. Also, diabetic patients were not further divided into subgroups based on their blood sugar levels, and we did not pursue the question of whether DRZ combined with an antidiabetic treatment would benefit epirubicin-treated breast patients with diabetes synergistically with regards to cardiac ANS function. In addition, the sample size of our study was small, and the length of the observation period was relatively short. Therefore, our findings need to be further corroborated in studies with larger sample sizes and longer observation periods.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that DRZ protects the cardiac ANS from epirubicin-induced impairment in early stage breast cancer patients with diabetes, as evidenced by ameliorated RHR and HRV. Therefore, we recommend administration of DRZ prior to the initiation of chemotherapy to effectively reduce the incidence of cardiotoxicity in anthracycline-treated breast cancer patients with diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors would like to express their thanks to Health and Family Planning Commission of Hebei Province, 2016, key projects of medical science research in Hebei Province (project no. 20160646) for their support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ANS = autonomic nervous system, Chemo = chemotherapy alone, DRZ = dexrazoxane, ECG = electrocardiography, HF = high frequency, HRV = heart rate variability, LF = low frequency, RHR = resting heart rate, SD = standard deviation.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hayek</surname><given-names>ER</given-names></name><name><surname>Speakman</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Rehmus</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group>
