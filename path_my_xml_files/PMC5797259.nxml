To further minimize the risk of CRC, surveillance with colonoscopy is recommended after the detection and removal of colonic neoplasia. In the past, it was common practice to perform annual follow-up surveillance colonoscopies in patients with colorectal adenomas in order to detect newly developed metachronous adenomas and missed synchronous adenomas.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, most patients with colorectal adenoma experience no benefit from surveillance and only 6% develop CRC,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> suggesting that, ideally, surveillance should be targeted at patients most likely to develop CRC. Several studies have found that certain adenoma characteristics at baseline colonoscopy are associated with the rate of adenoma detection and the histologic severity of subsequent adenomas during surveillance.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Patients with multiple adenomas or adenomas with advanced pathological features at baseline have been found to have an increased risk of developing CRC.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Current Western guidelines have recommended colonoscopy surveillance intervals according to the risk stratification of patients based on the findings at baseline colonoscopy.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> According to U.S. guidelines, surveillance colonoscopy should be repeated at 10 years for patients with no neoplasia at baseline, at 5 to 10 years for low-risk patients with 1 or 2 small (&#x0003c;10 mm) tubular adenomas, and at 3 years for high-risk patients with advanced neoplasia or more than 2 adenomas.<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, to date, few studies have evaluated colonoscopy surveillance after polypectomy in Asia.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The aims of this prospective and multicenter study were to determine the 3-year cumulative incidence rate of advanced neoplasia in Korean patients with baseline colorectal neoplasia at screening colonoscopy and to determine which baseline colonoscopic findings are associated with the recurrence of advanced neoplasia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>1. Study Population</title><p>Participants were enrolled in 11 University Hospitals between March 2007 and December 2008. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of each participating center. Written informed consent for participation was obtained from all participants prior to the procedures. Initial enrollment criteria included individuals who did not have lower gastrointestinal tract symptoms, prior history of colon disease, or structural examination of the colon within 10 years. Patients were eligible if they underwent a complete colonoscopy and were found to have 1 or more adenomas at baseline colonoscopy. A complete colonoscopy was considered to include the following: good bowel preparation, colonoscopy reaching the cecum, and removal of all visualized polyps that were detected. Patients were excluded if baseline colonoscopy revealed invasive CRC (cancer invading beyond muscularis mucosa), nonadenomatous polyps, IBD, or familial adenomatous polyposis.</p><p>At enrollment, patients were interviewed to assess the following data: age; gender; family history of CRC; current smoking and alcohol consumption; history of diabetes and hypertension; use of medications including aspirin, NSAIDs, and statins.</p><p>All enrolled patients were assigned to colonoscopy surveillance at 3 years. Follow-up clinic reminder calls were made several months before the expected date of colonoscopy surveillance from each participating center.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Colonoscopy and Pathological Review</title><p>All colonoscopic examinations were performed by study investigators. During baseline and surveillance colonoscopy, the characteristics of all detected polyps including number, size, and location were identified. The size of the polyp was estimated with an opened biopsy forceps. The location of the polyp was categorized as proximal (cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, and splenic flexure) or distal (descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum). All detected polyps were completely removed; diminutive polyps were removed by &#x02264;5 mm by biopsy forceps and larger ones by colonoscopic polypectomy or endoscopic mucosal resection. All specimens were evaluated by local expert gastrointestinal pathologists according to the colorectal neoplasia classification of the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Pathological interpretation of intramucosal carcinoma or carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic> was categorized as a high-grade dysplasia. Invasive cancer was defined as the invasion of malignant cells beyond the muscularis mucosa. In patients with multiple adenomas, the size, location, and histological type were classified according to the largest, the most proximal, and the most advanced lesion, respectively. Advanced adenoma was defined as tubular adenoma 10 mm or larger in diameter, villous or tubulovillous adenoma, or adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.</p></sec><sec><title>3. Statistical Analysis</title><p>We compared the baseline demographic and adenoma characteristics of subjects who underwent follow-up colonoscopy with those of subjects who did not using the Student <italic>t</italic>-test and chi-square test as appropriate for the comparison of means and proportions. The RR of recurrence of advanced adenoma and any adenoma were estimated using the Cox proportional hazard regression model by computing the hazard ratio and the 95% CI after multivariate adjustments (demographic and baseline adenoma characteristics). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 12.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). A two-sided value of <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>1. Baseline Characteristics of the Study Population</title><p>A total of 1,323 patients with colorectal adenoma at baseline colonoscopy were enrolled and assigned to colonoscopy surveillance at 3 years. During surveillance, 29.3% of patients (387/1,323) had a surveillance colonoscopic examination, and the mean follow-up interval was 31.0&#x000b1;9.8 months. We compared the baseline demographic and adenoma characteristics of the surveillance group with those of the non-surveillance group to determine whether there were any differences in the possible risk factors for advanced colorectal neoplasia between the 2 groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). There were no significant differences in terms of age, family history of CRC, co-morbidities (hypertension and diabetes), and use of medications (aspirin, NSAIDs, and statins). However, the surveillance group had higher proportions of males, smokers, and alcohol drinkers, and was more likely to have purported high CRC risk variables of baseline adenoma including advanced adenoma, number, size, and villous histology. Accordingly, we analyzed the incidence and risk factors of colorectal adenoma recurrence in the surveillance group.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Incidence and Risk Factors of Recurrence of Colorectal Adenoma</title><p>During the follow-up period of 31.0&#x000b1;9.8 months, the recurrence rates of advanced adenoma, multiple adenoma with 3 or more, and any adenoma were 4.4% (17/387), 10.6% (41/387), and 48.3% (187/387), respectively.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> demonstrate the RR of demographic and baseline adenoma characteristics for recurrent advanced adenoma after multivariate adjustments. Among the demographic variables, advanced adenoma recurrence was observed only in males and in subjects aged &#x02265;50 years at follow-up (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). On the contrary, there was no significant risk factor for advanced adenoma recurrence among the baseline adenoma variables. However, the risk of advanced adenoma recurrence was 2 times higher in patients with baseline advanced adenoma than in patients with baseline non-advanced adenoma, though the difference was not statistically significant (6.8% [9/133] vs. 3.1% [8/254], <italic>P</italic>=0.09] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref> present the RR associated with each of the demographic and baseline adenoma characteristics for recurrent overall colorectal adenoma and multiple (&#x02265;3) adenomas, respectively. Male sex, age &#x02265;50 years, and number of adenomas (&#x02265;3) had a significant impact on both overall adenoma recurrence and multiple (&#x02265;3) colorectal adenoma recurrence after multivariate adjustments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present multicenter, prospective study, the 3-year cumulative incidence rate of advanced adenoma in Korean patients with colorectal adenoma at the baseline screening colonoscopy was 4.4%.

The Asia Pacific Working Group reported that advancing age, male sex, family history, and smoking are the most important risk factors for developing advanced CRC.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A report from a pooled analysis of postpolypectomy patients showed that older age and male sex were associated with an increased risk of metachronous advanced adenoma.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> One Japanese study<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and one Chinese study<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> also reported that the occurrence of advanced neoplasia at surveillance colonoscopy was associated with the male sex and older age, while another Chinese study<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> reported that older age alone was an important risk factor for advanced neoplasia recurrence. Several previous studies suggested that males have a higher prevalence of advanced adenoma than females during surveillance colonoscopy.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In this prospective study, we confirmed that the male sex and age &#x02265;50 years had a significant effect on the recurrence of any adenoma, multiple adenomas, and advanced adenoma. In the multivariate analysis, family history, smoking, and medication were not associated with advanced adenoma recurrence. However, the low rate of patients who underwent surveillance colonoscopy and the low incidence of advanced adenoma on follow-up may have contributed to the negative results.</p><p>A number of studies have reported that the size, number, and histological characteristics of the baseline adenoma were associated with an increased risk of advanced adenoma recurrence.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Some studies have demonstrated recurrence rates of advanced adenoma at 3-year follow-up after polypectomy of 5% to 17% for adenomas larger than 1 cm,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> 10% to 13% for villous adenomas,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> 10% to 12% for adenomas with high grade dysplasia,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and 9% to 18% for 3 or more adenomas.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In the latest U.S. guidelines, patients with advanced adenoma or 3 or more adenomas are recommended to have follow-up surveillance colonoscopy at 3 years.<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In this study, despite the lack of statistical significance, the risk of advanced adenoma recurrence was 2 times higher in patients with baseline advanced adenoma than in patients with baseline non-advanced adenoma, confirming the definitive difference in advanced adenoma recurrence at the 3-year follow-up between patients with baseline advanced adenoma and patients without baseline advanced adenoma. Our study also showed that the presence of 3 or more adenomas at baseline was an independent risk factor for overall adenoma recurrence, confirming that the number of adenomas at baseline colonoscopy should be considered in determining the interval of surveillance colonoscopy. We were unable to find any relationship between other baseline adenoma characteristics such as size, histology, and degree of dysplasia and advanced adenoma recurrence, which may be due to the small number of patients in this study who experienced advanced adenoma recurrence.</p><p>Prior reports have shown that an increased risk of advanced adenoma is associated with baseline advanced adenoma.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Nusko et al.<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> demonstrated that the recurrence rates of advanced adenoma after polypectomy were 10% at 3 years. In Korean patients with baseline advanced adenoma, Seo et al.<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> reported that the 3-year cumulative rates of metachronous advanced neoplasm were 13.2%, while Chung et al.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> reported that the 5-year cumulative rates of advanced adenoma were 12.2%. A pooled analysis that used individual data from 8 North American prospective studies also indicated that patients with baseline advanced adenoma were more likely to develop advanced neoplasm (15.5%) after a median of 4 years of follow-up surveillance.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Thus, international guidelines such as the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> American College of Gastroenterology, American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, and British Society of Gastroenterology<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> have recommended follow-up colonoscopy at 3 years after polypectomy in patients with baseline advanced adenoma.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In the present study, 3-year cumulative recurrence rate of advanced adenoma was low (6.8%) in patients with baseline advanced adenoma; therefore, our results indicate that the current recommendation of 3-year follow-up surveillance colonoscopy after polypectomy in patients with high-risk findings is appropriate.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, only 29.3% of patients had a surveillance colonoscopic examination during the follow-up period, which may have introduced a possible selection bias. The surveillance group had higher proportions of males, smokers, and alcohol drinkers and was more likely to have purported high CRC risk variables for baseline adenoma, including advanced adenoma, number, size, and villous histology in comparison with the non-surveillance group. We had considered that the surveillance group in our study might have a higher risk potential for advanced adenoma recurrence compared with the baseline enrolled patients. Second, this was not a community-based cohort study because our population was derived from a group of tertiary medical centers. Therefore, a selection bias could not be avoided. Third, we were unable to evaluate other risk factors for colorectal neoplasia after polypectomy, such as obesity, BMI, metabolic syndrome, diet, and physical activity, which may have influenced the recurrence rate of adenomas, and further studies aimed at assessing recurrence in the context of those factors are necessary.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of the present Korean prospective multicenter study reveal that a 3-year surveillance interval for patients with baseline advanced adenoma can be considered appropriate. Future studies designed to evaluate the surveillance interval after polypectomy based on both stratified risk factors and cost-effectiveness are warranted in Korea.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>FINANCIAL SUPPORT:</bold> This work was supported by The National R&#x00026;D Program for Cancer Control, Ministry of Health &#x00026; Welfare, Republic of Korea (0820290).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>CONFLICT OF INTEREST:</bold> No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION:</bold> D.S.H. conceived and designed the study.
