Behaviour change interventions that target health and lifestyle factors associated with the onset of diabetes can delay progression to diabetes, but many approaches rely on intensive one-to-one contact by specialists. Health coaching is an approach based on motivational interviewing that can potentially deliver behaviour change interventions by non-specialists at a larger scale. This trial protocol describes a randomized controlled trial (CATFISH) that tests whether a web-enhanced telephone health coaching intervention (IGR3) is more acceptable and efficient than a telephone-only health coaching intervention (IGR2) for people with prediabetes (impaired glucose regulation).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>CATFISH is a two-parallel group, single-centre individually randomized controlled trial. Eligible participants are patients aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years with impaired glucose regulation (HbA1c concentration between 42 and 47&#x000a0;mmol/mol), have access to a telephone and home internet and have been referred to an existing telephone health coaching service at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, Salford, UK. Participants who give written informed consent will be randomized remotely (via a clinical trials unit) to either the existing pathway (IGR2) or the new web-enhanced pathway (IGR3) for 9&#x000a0;months. The primary outcome measure is patient acceptability at 9&#x000a0;months, determined using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire. Secondary outcome measures at 9&#x000a0;months are: cost of delivery of IGR2 and IGR3, mental health, quality of life, patient activation, self-management, weight (kg), HbA1c concentration, and body mass index. All outcome measures will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. A qualitative process evaluation will explore the experiences of participants and providers with a focus on understanding usability of interventions, mechanisms of behaviour change, and impact of context on delivery and user acceptability. Qualitative data will be analyzed using Framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The CATFISH trial will provide a pragmatic assessment of whether a web-based information technology platform can enhance acceptability of a telephone health coaching intervention for people with prediabetes. The data will prove critical in understanding the role of web applications to improve engagement with evidence-based approaches to preventing diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN16534814">ISRCTN16534814</ext-link>.

At present, 3.4 million adults in the UK are diagnosed with diabetes, the majority with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The damaging effects of uncontrolled hyperglycaemia can cause macrovascular complications (coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease and stroke) and microvascular complications (diabetic nephropathy [kidney disease], neuropathy [nerve damage], which can lead to non-traumatic lower limb amputations, and retinopathy, which can lead to blindness) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Altogether, the impact of diabetes is thus significant, with serious implications for health and quality of life, and costs to health care systems. In England, the direct cost to the National Health Service (NHS) of treating type 2 diabetes is approximately &#x000a3;8.8 billion annually, with a further &#x000a3;13 billion associated with indirect costs; these costs are estimated to rise to &#x000a3;15.1 and &#x000a3;20.5 billion, respectively, by 2035&#x02013;6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Obesity, physical inactivity and diet are among key risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Weight gain and obesity are especially implicated in the onset of type 2 diabetes. Obese women are nearly 13 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than non-obese women; obese men are over 5 times as likely to develop type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, a 1&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> increase in body mass index increases the risk of impaired fasting glucose by 9.5&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance indicate impaired glucose regulation, which is a condition where blood glucose levels are raised, but the levels are insufficient to meet current thresholds for a clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Impaired fasting glucose is associated with a raised hepatic glucose output, whereas impaired glucose tolerance is associated with peripheral insulin resistance. There is strong and consistent evidence that people with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance have between a 6- and 12-fold risk of developing diabetes, compared with people without, and both are risk factors for fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>However, it is well established that lifestyle interventions that target modifiable risk factors such as weight and physical activity can prevent the onset of diabetes in people with impaired glucose regulation. A systematic review of 36 trials showed that diabetes prevention programmes that included diet or physical activity interventions can significantly reduce progression to type 2 diabetes and reduce weight and glucose at 12&#x02013;18 months, compared with usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As such, identification of people with impaired glucose regulation and intervention with lifestyle-change programmes presents significant opportunities for reducing the future incidence of type 2 diabetes. The delivery of these behaviour change interventions is central to guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on prevention of diabetes in high-risk groups, including people with impaired glucose regulation. However, the delivery of NICE-recommended diabetes prevention programmes is contingent on the availability of specialist staff to provide intensive interventions to relatively small numbers of people over 9 to 18&#x000a0;months. As articulated by the NHS National Diabetes Prevention Programme, the challenge remains to scale up and rapidly roll out evidence-based behaviour change interventions to ensure that more people at risk of diabetes can access to such interventions, but without compromising quality.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Health coaching</title><p>A model of care that has potential to achieve diabetes prevention at a large scale through effective behaviour change is &#x02018;health coaching&#x02019;. This is a relatively new approach and variously defined but common to this approach is an emphasis on health education and health promotion via patient-centred coaching based on motivational interviewing to improve health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The increasing adoption of telephone and mobile technologies among patients, and the possibility of delivering care in efficient and flexible ways, has led to significant interest in the potential of telephone health coaching which involves:<disp-quote><p>a regular series of phone calls between patient and health professional&#x02026; to provide support and encouragement to the patient, and promote healthy behaviours such as treatment control, healthy diet, physical activity and mobility, rehabilitation, and good mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]</p></disp-quote></p><p>However, current evidence of effectiveness is mixed. A systematic review of 13 randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies showed that, in 11 studies, telephone, internet or a combination of telephone, face-to-face, internet or email health coaching can effectively improve physical and mental health, promote healthy behaviours and increase social support among people with long-term conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Other reviews have similarly identified a number of effective models, although the important &#x02018;active ingredients&#x02019; are not clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, much of the evidence is derived from trials conducted in the USA and there is uncertainty about the benefits of health coaching in the UK. A recent evaluation of the nurse-led Birmingham OwnHealth telephone health coaching service for people with long-term conditions (including diabetes) did not find reductions in health service utilization or cost over 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. By contrast, a UK trial of telephone support from non-clinical telecare staff (backed up by diabetes specialist nurses) did show significant improvements in glycaemic control in people with type 2 diabetes, compared with usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This intervention, now known as Diabetes Care Call, has recently been adapted for use in people with impaired glucose tolerance and impaired glucose regulation. A pilot evaluation (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;44) of the Care Call intervention in people with impaired glucose tolerance showed reductions in weight (2.81&#x000a0;kg, 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval 1.2&#x02013;4.42), body mass index (1.06&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval 0.49&#x02013;1.63), and fasting blood glucose (0.29&#x000a0;mmol/l, 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval 0.07&#x02013;0.51) 1&#x000a0;year after the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Similar outcomes 12&#x000a0;months after the intervention were achieved in a pilot evaluation of Care Call in people with impaired glucose regulation who were offered either a telephone-only or a telephone plus group education pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. While the findings of these pilot studies are limited by the absence of a control group, they offer proof of concept that telephone health coaching can translate to people with impaired glucose regulation to promote positive and sustained lifestyle changes to prevent type 2 diabetes.</p><p>The Impaired Glucose Regulation Care Call intervention has recently been enhanced, with greater use of web-based materials and electronic transfer of patient data, with a view to making the service more engaging for patients, and the provision of care more efficient for providers. The web plus telephone health coaching intervention has been developed by NorthWest EHealth in partnership with Hitachi Europe Ltd. Patient engagement is critical to the success of health promotion interventions and frequent, real-time communication and feedback are key to behaviour change and empowering patients to manage their behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Information technology (IT) platforms, such as desktop applications, mobile short message service (SMS) and internet-based interventions are increasingly used to support and enhance patient engagement in self-management programmes. There is partial evidence that e-health interventions, described as second-generation interactive computerized interventions, can lead to positive improvements in physical activity and diet in people drawn from community and health settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and can also support diabetes self-management tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, the evidence in favour of using IT interventions to support behaviour change is equivocal and few studies have assessed whether satisfaction and usability lead to better engagement and less costly delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The addition of an IT platform within the Impaired Glucose Regulation Care Call service might lead to significant advantages in patient uptake and engagement, as well as freed human resources for the provider, which could ultimately improve the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the service. However, there is a need to conduct an assessment of satisfaction, usability and cost of delivery of the new web-enabled telephone health coaching service (known as IGR3). This trial will therefore compare user experience and cost of delivery of IGR3 with the existing telephone-only health coaching service (known as IGR2). Further study into the potential impact of the IGR3 model on the clinical and cost effective aspects will then be planned.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p>This trial protocol is written in accordance with standardized reporting guidance from SPIRIT (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>This trial is a pragmatic, two-arm, patient-level randomized and controlled comparison of two health coaching services, one of which is already commissioned by Salford Clinical Commissioning Group and provided in the NHS by Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust (i.e. IGR2).

A significant difference in CSQ-8 scores in favour of IGR3 will prove the hypothesis that the web plus telephone health coaching intervention offers patients a better care experience than the existing telephone-only health coaching intervention.</p><p>As a comparison of two active treatments, where one is simply an enhanced version of the other, differences in clinical outcomes, quality of life and cost-effectiveness are expected to be relatively small.

All patients referred to the Care Call service will have a confirmed diagnosis of impaired glucose regulation and will have had an opportunity to discuss with their general practitioners the options available from the Care Call service. Eligible patients for the service and thus the trial will then be identified from routine contact with patients&#x02019; general practitioners.</p><p>In addition, a rapid search and find tool designed by NorthWest EHealth, FARSITE, will be used to identify further eligible patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The FARSITE software provides a safe, convenient and effective way for general practitioners to control the recruitment of their patients into clinical research, while allowing NHS-based researchers to run complex and powerful searches over anonymized population-level health record data. Because FARSITE is hosted in a secure environment located at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, confidentiality of data is preserved. General practitioner data collected and processed for FARSITE are transmitted across the NHS (N3) network, using high grade encryption, by the secured local NHS data host, the General Practitioner System Supplier or Apollo Medical Systems Ltd. Patient demographics data and pseudonymized data are stored in two separated and encrypted databases. In the CATFISH study, a research nurse employed by Hitachi Europe Ltd will run FARSITE searches from general practices in Salford to generate lists of pseudonymized patient populations. The clinical teams in practice can review the selected patients, merge patient contact details using the letter generation tool and send the letters to DocMan for print and postal fulfilment services. These letters will offer patients suspected to have impaired glucose regulation to attend for a general practitioner consultation and onward referral to Care Call.</p><p>Feasibility searches using FARSITE protocols for impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance were run in November 2014 and identified 3852 patients with suspected impaired glucose regulation. This test run showed that the FARSITE tool was capable of identifying patients with impaired glucose regulation and that there are sufficient numbers of patients with impaired glucose regulation who can be referred to the Care Call service and thus be invited to the CATFISH trial.</p><p>After triage, the diabetes specialist nurse at the Care Call service will pass details of all eligible patients to the CATFISH trial administrator. The CATFISH trial administrator will call all patients and confirm personal details (email and phone number). Each patient is given a brief overview of the CATFISH trial. The administrator will confirm that each patient meets the inclusion criteria for the CATFISH trial (access to home internet and a desktop computer or laptop), and will seek permission for the University of Manchester research team to contact them. Those patients who do not wish to be approached by researchers will be redirected to the existing Care Call service (IGR2). The contact details of those patients who do agree to be contacted will be passed to the University of Manchester research team using a secure (nhs.net) email service. Within one week, a University of Manchester researcher will then contact the patient to discuss involvement in the trial in greater detail, giving them an opportunity to ask questions about the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Participant timeline</title><p>The recruitment window runs from July 2015 to the end of June 2016.

To ensure allocation concealment, randomization will be by means of a computer-generated code implemented by a MAHSC-CTU employee and shared by telephone with the Care Call administrator following correct exchange of a password. The Care Call administrator will communicate allocations to Care Call staff (diabetes specialist nurse and health advisors). Participants will be allocated 1:1 to either IGR2 or IGR3 using minimization to ensure balance for age (&#x0003c;40, 40&#x02013;60, &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;years) and body mass index (&#x02264;18.5, 18.6&#x02013;24.9, 25.0&#x02013;29.9).

Our researchers at the University of Manchester will be informed of the MAHSC-CTU randomization number for each participant by the Care Call administrator. The MAHSC-CTU randomization number will become the primary identifier for participants in the trial. In addition to the Care Call administrator, the principal investigator (PAC) will be unmasked to allocations in the event that participants request to be unblinded. Participants will be unblinded at the end of the follow-up period, or on withdrawal from the study. The CATFISH research team at the University of Manchester will remain blind to treatment allocation until follow-up assessments have been completed. The trial statistician will remain blind to treatment allocation. However, owing to the nature of health economic analysis, it is not possible to blind the trial health economist.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Data collection</title><p>At the baseline assessment visit, University of Manchester researchers will record the height and weight of participants and calculate body mass index using the NHS Choices body mass index healthy weight calculator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Height will be measured using a Leicester stadiometer on a firm and even surface. Participants will be asked to remove their shoes and stand up straight with heels together, with heels, buttocks and shoulders pressed against the stadiometer. The University of Manchester researcher will take the measurement with the participant standing tall, looking straight ahead with the head upright and not tilted backwards.</p><p>Where participants&#x02019; cannot stand, arm span can be used as an estimate of height, using the formula: total arm span/1.06 (women) or total arm span/1.03 (men). Arm span is measured by locating and marking the edge of the right collar bone (in the sternal notch) with a pen. Participants will each be asked to place their non-dominant arm in a horizontal position. The researcher will check that the patient&#x02019;s arm is horizontal and in line with the shoulders. Using a tape measure, the researcher will measure the distance from the mark on the midline at the sternal notch to the tip of the middle finger. If the arm is flat and wrist is straight, the researcher will take a reading in centimetres and repeat the process for the dominant arm to calculate the total arm span.</p><p>Weight will be measured in kilograms using Seca 875 weighing scales (Class 111 calibrated medical scales) that conform to ISO 9001:2008. Both height and weight will be recorded on a case report form. The participant&#x02019;s initials is entered onto the front cover of the case report form, along with general practitioner &#x02018;P&#x02019; code and date of completion. After height and weight have been measured, participants will be given the baseline questionnaire to complete. Researchers will be available to answer any questions the participant may have during completion. Explanation should be given without biasing the participant&#x02019;s response. The researcher may also read the questions and complete the questionnaire if the participant requests this. After completing the questionnaire, the researcher will check that all questions have been attempted.</p><p>At follow-up, the researcher will contact the participant by telephone to arrange a convenient time and place to meet for the follow-up assessment. During this, call the researcher will remind the participant not to tell the researcher if they were part of the telephone-only health coaching group or the web plus telephone health coaching group. At the follow-up assessment visit, the researcher will adopt the same procedures undertaken at the baseline visit to collect and record data on height and weight. The participants will be given the follow-up questionnaire to complete and the researcher will adopt the same procedure undertaken at the baseline visit to ensure that this questionnaire is completed appropriately.</p><p>After completing follow-up assessments, participants will be invited to attend an appointment at the Clinical Research Facility at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust for a plasma glucose test to measure HbA1c. All blood tests will be conducted by nursing staff at the Barnes Clinical Research Facility, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust. Sample type and volume are fluoride oxalate (yellow), 1&#x000a0;ml; the reference range is 3.0&#x02013;6.0&#x000a0;mmol/l.

Hard copies of the results will then be stored in a locked, secure area. A member of the CATFISH research team will visit the Barnes Clinical Research Facility at least once every two weeks to collect the results. The results will then be returned to the CATFISH office at the University of Manchester and stored securely.</p><p>Once the research team has collected the HbA1c concentration results from the Clinical Research Facility, they will be screened by the CATFISH Research Nurse. If the HbA1c concentration falls outside the normal prediabetes range expected (&#x02265;48&#x000a0;mmol/mol), the participant&#x02019;s general practitioner will be informed by letter of the result. If the concentration remains within the prediabetes range (42&#x02013;47&#x000a0;mmol/mol) or is within the normal range (&#x0003c;42&#x000a0;mmol/mol) the general practitioner will not be routinely informed of the result. Blood samples for HbA1c testing will be automatically archived after analysis to a secure storage unit in the pathology department at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust and kept at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. They will be kept for a maximum of 2&#x000a0;days and then sent for incineration.</p><p>Demographic and outcome data will be collected in an anonymized format using paper-based questionnaires administered face-to-face by the University of Manchester researchers. Additional data about engagement and delivery of the intervention will be captured by the secure and web-based system hosted by NorthWest EHealth at the University of Manchester. Patient confidentiality will be protected throughout all phases of data collection and analysis, in accordance with them UK Data Protection Act, 1998. The data management policy will adhere to Research Councils UK Common Principles on Data Policy and will be created by the principal investigator in accordance with the University of Manchester&#x02019;s intellectual property policy and relevant third-party agreements.

We will control for baseline values of each outcome and design factors. We will apply multiple imputation to baseline and 9&#x000a0;month variables with missing values by the chained equations approach using scores on all primary and secondary outcome measures (at baseline and follow-up). We will use 20 multiple imputation sets, as this will provide appropriate stability of results. Analyses will be conducted using STATA (version 14) with an alpha significance value of 5&#x000a0;%.

The first will be an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis from a clinical commissioning group perspective using patient satisfaction and intervention costs to derive a cost per additional unit of patient satisfaction. The second analysis will be conducted from an NHS and personal social services perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Costs will include intervention costs and healthcare and social services resource costs. The quantity of resource use will be collected by questionnaire and a set of national average unit costs will be applied (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]). The use of the EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L will enable the estimation of quality-adjusted life years by calculating the area under the curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per additional quality-adjusted life year) will be used to assess cost-effectiveness of IGR3 in comparison with IGR2. Cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be constructed to reflect any uncertainty in the results and threshold.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Qualitative study</title><p>Process evaluations of complex interventions can be used to explain outcomes through an evaluation of how casual assumptions about how an intervention might work are related to the way it was implemented and how it produces change within particular contexts. Drawing on guidance from the Medical Research Council, a focus on understanding implementation (the what and how of intervention delivery), mechanisms of impact (pathways to change), and contextual factors can inform the design and conduct of a process evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, the framework proposed by the Medical Research Council is not easily operationalized in the absence of a programme theory set out as a logic model. Programme theory articulates the hypothesized connections between the programme components and the outcomes to be assessed and is often underpinned by a theory of change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Logic models offer a visual way of representing the &#x02018;if&#x02026; then&#x02026;&#x02019; relationships between the resources needed to deliver the programme, the activities planned and their outputs, and the intended results of the programme. Using programme theory to drive the evaluation can help differentiate between programme theory failure, i.e. whether the intervention failed because of weaknesses in the underlying theory of change, and programme implementation failure, i.e. whether the intervention failed because of weaknesses in the way it was delivered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p>In this trial, the theory of change presupposes that health coaching supported by web-enabled self-monitoring and feedback and education will increase patient activation, which, in turn, will result in increased patient satisfaction, reductions in the cost of service delivery and positive changes in health behaviours known to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). As such, greater effects are anticipated among participants in the web plus telephone coaching group than in the telephone-only group.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Theory of change model in CATFISH</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1519_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p>At the heart of this model is the concept of patient activation, which captures key ingredients known to predict patients&#x02019; capacity to engage in self-managing their health and use of healthcare: knowledge, skill and confidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Higher patient activation has been shown to predict engagement in preventive behaviours, such as attending regular check-ups, and healthy behaviours, such as regular exercise, treatment adherence and self-monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Moreover, activated patients are more likely to have clinical outcomes, such as HbA1c concentration and body mass index in the normal range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Critically, highly activated patients are more satisfied with their care experience and have lower rates of hospital admissions and emergency room use, possibly leading to reductions in the cost of their care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p>Taking this theory of change as a starting point, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the logic model for the web plus telephone health coaching intervention tested in this trial. It is read from left to right, and includes a detailed breakdown of the resources and activities associated with delivering the intervention, along with details of the anticipated results, which include outputs, outcomes and impact over time. This logic model will facilitate qualitative evaluation of key programme vantage points related to context, implementation and outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. While this trial is not a formal test of clinical effectiveness, qualitative evidence drawn from patient participants and also from health professionals engaged in delivery of the interventions will strengthen our understanding about user experience and impact of what was delivered, leading to greater opportunities to report about how the interventions might work in comparable and different contexts. Specific to the evaluation of IGR3, the evaluation will also be informed by evidence about dynamic factors that moderate individual acceptance of IT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Logic model of programme components in CATFISH.

In this trial, we will assess patient experience of IGR3 compared with IGR2, with a focus on understanding whether the web enhancements led to greater levels of activation and thus greater engagement with managing their health.

Before embarking on expensive and time-consuming trial assessment of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, however, a key challenge is to understand from the patient perspective if enhancing telephone health coaching interventions with IT platforms improves acceptability and usability and thereby engagement in diabetes prevention programmes. This trial will offer important insights about whether a web-based IT platform can enhance engagement in a telephone health coaching intervention provided by health advisors for people with impaired glucose regulation. The results will have implications for the design of future definitive cost-effectiveness trials in settings where there is no existing diabetes prevention programme.</p><p>The trial design is potentially limited by restrictions on participant recruitment. Currently, referral into the Care Call service at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust is heavily reliant on general practice and there are limited routes into the service from other sources in the community, e.g. pharmacy and public health. Participants in the CATFISH trial will therefore primarily be drawn from patients already &#x02018;in the system&#x02019; and known to general practitioners and may have been given behaviour change advice in the past. Additionally, achieving our recruitment target may be jeopardized by only sourcing participants for the CATFISH trial from referrals into the Care Call service &#x02013; recruitment into the trial will be contingent on sufficient throughput in the clinical service. However, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust is one of seven demonstrator sites for the NHS National Diabetes Prevention Programme in the NHS and there is an ongoing commitment to increase capacity in the Care Call service, with a likely benefit for the CATFISH trial. Furthermore, the Care Call service attracts referrals from all eight neighbourhoods across Salford, increasing opportunities to recruit participants with different socio-economic profiles. The design and recruitment strategy are thus pragmatic and thus more likely to be generalizable.</p><p>Working with industry partners in health services research is novel and presents unique challenges, not least the need to maintain independence. Hitachi Europe Ltd, have invested in the Care Call service at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust to improve efficiencies, such as employing an administrator and a research nurse to expedite quality referrals into the service. With the support of the trial steering committee, the CATFISH trial is being run as an independent evaluation and we have ensured that sufficient safeguards are in place to preserve independence throughout all phases of the trial. This includes a commitment to open-access publication and data sharing, in keeping with policies to prevent publication and outcome reporting bias of clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Trial status</title><p>Trial registration was initiated prospectively with ISRCTN on 23 April 2015. Failure of administrative functions on the part of BioMed Central who host and curate ISRCTN and the University of Manchester led to delay in payment and registration was not finalised until 1 July 2015. The recruitment started on 30 June 2015, after the initiation of public registration.</p><p>Recruitment to the trial began in June 2015 and completed in May 2016. A total of 209 participants were recruited and randomized. The trial is now in follow-up and data collection will be completed at the latest in March 2017; results will be available in May 2017.</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CONSORT, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials; CSQ-8, Client Satisfaction Questionnaire; EQ-5D, Euroqol-5D; HbA1c, Glycated haemoglobin; IT, information technology; MAHSC-CTU, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre Clinical Trials Unit; NHS, National Health Service (UK); NICE, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; SMS, short message service; SPIRIT, Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec41"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1519_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>SPIRIT 2013 Checklist.
