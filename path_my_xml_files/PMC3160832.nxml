To date, published studies have not investigated the effects of yoga on cortisol in FM. This pilot study used a time series design to evaluate pain, psychological variables, mindfulness, and cortisol in women with FM before and after a yoga intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Participants (n = 22) were recruited from the community to participate in a 75 minute yoga class twice weekly for 8 weeks. Questionnaires concerning pain (intensity, unpleasantness, quality, sum of local areas of pain, catastrophizing, acceptance, disability), anxiety, depression, and mindfulness were administered pre-, mid- and post-intervention. Salivary cortisol samples were collected three times a day for each of two days, pre- and post-intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) scores improved significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) from pre- to post-intervention for continuous pain (pre: 5.18 &#x000b1; 1.72; post: 4.44 &#x000b1; 2.03), pain catastrophizing (pre: 25.33 &#x000b1; 14.77; post: 20.40 &#x000b1; 17.01), pain acceptance (pre: 60.47 &#x000b1; 23.43; post: 65.50 &#x000b1; 22.93), and mindfulness (pre: 120.21 &#x000b1; 21.80; post: 130.63 &#x000b1; 20.82). Intention-to-treat analysis showed that median AUC for post-intervention cortisol (263.69) was significantly higher (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) than median AUC for pre-intervention levels (189.46). Mediation analysis revealed that mid-intervention mindfulness scores significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) mediated the relationship between pre- and post-intervention pain catastrophizing scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion:</title><p>The results suggest that a yoga intervention may reduce pain and catastrophizing, increase acceptance and mindfulness, and alter total cortisol levels in women with FM. The changes in mindfulness and cortisol levels may provide preliminary evidence for mechanisms of a yoga program for women with FM. Future studies should use an RCT design with a larger sample size.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>fibromyalgia</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>cortisol</kwd><kwd>yoga</kwd><kwd>psychological variables</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fibromyalgia (FM) is a poorly understood condition that is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and presents with other symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbances, anxiety, depression, gastrointestinal discomfort and stiffness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-jpr-4-189">1</xref> Recent proposed changes to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) formal diagnostic criteria for FM include implementation of the widespread pain index (WPI) and symptom severity scale (SS), to supplement the previous gold standard of a tender point count, along with widespread pain for at least 3 months in at least 3 of the 4 quadrants of the body.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-jpr-4-189">2</xref></p><p>Female gender, older age, low level of education, low socio-economic status, and divorce have been associated with FM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jpr-4-189">3</xref> Psychological distress is a major risk factor for long term complaints<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-jpr-4-189">4</xref> and comorbidity with anxiety and depression is high,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jpr-4-189">3</xref> with rates of 13%&#x02013;64% and 20%&#x02013;80%, respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-jpr-4-189">5</xref> Moreover, FM patients display generalized hypervigilance,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-jpr-4-189">6</xref> characterized by a greater sensitivity to external stimuli in various modalities. Pain catastrophizing and low pain-self efficacy are other psychological factors that prevent healthy adjustment to FM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-jpr-4-189">7</xref> and contribute to disability,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-jpr-4-189">8</xref> pain, depression and quality of well being.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-jpr-4-189">9</xref> Although the neurophysiological underpinnings of this disorder have yet to be elucidated, there is evidence that central sensitization is largely implicated in the extensive and enduring pain and that FM is accompanied by altered hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jpr-4-189">3</xref></p><p>Cortisol is a steroid hormone that is produced and released by the adrenal gland, and functions as a component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in response to stress or low blood sugar. Healthy HPA axis functioning, as measured by cortisol secretion, entails higher cortisol levels upon waking, a peak approximately 30&#x02013;40 minutes post-waking (the cortisol awakening response [CAR]) and a decline over the course of the day, when levels reach a trough prior to sleep onset.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-jpr-4-189">10</xref> Healthy functioning also involves HPA resilience, which refers to the ability of the HPA system to recover or rebound from stress. The literature on HPA functioning and cortisol levels in FM patients is equivocal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-jpr-4-189">11</xref> A host of variables complicates an accurate portrayal of HPA function, but variations in the methods used to collect cortisol samples, such as time of cortisol measurement (morning, afternoon, evening), number of measurements per day (1&#x02013;8, or continuous readings), and source (salivary, plasma, serum or urinary) of cortisol, make it particularly difficult to derive a clear picture of HPA activity in FM patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-jpr-4-189">12</xref></p><p>Notwithstanding the variability in cortisol sampling procedures and findings, it is accepted that there is a dysregulation of HPA functioning in patients with FM,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-jpr-4-189">11</xref> resulting in alterations in levels of cortisol, corticotropin-releasing hormone, growth hormone and thyroid hormones, which may have secondary effects on pain, fatigue, immune function, mood and sleep.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jpr-4-189">3</xref> Recent research indicates that FM patients exhibit hypocortisolism, particularly as an attenuated CAR.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-jpr-4-189">13</xref> Hypocortisolism is characterized by a blunted presentation of cortisol secretion, compromised HPA resilience and a triad of pain, fatigue and stress sensitivity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-jpr-4-189">14</xref> In support of this idea, women with FM have lower urinary<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-jpr-4-189">15</xref> and salivary cortisol levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-jpr-4-189">16</xref> than healthy controls, and less diurnal variability in comparison to individuals with rheumatoid arthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-jpr-4-189">17</xref> In addition, core features of FM, such as fatigue, pain, and psychological stress, have been associated with lower morning cortisol levels and blunted diurnal slopes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-jpr-4-189">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-jpr-4-189">20</xref> HPA axis dysfunction has also been associated with psychological dysfunction, such as depression, and stress but not with pain in patients with FM,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-jpr-4-189">12</xref> indicating that the relationship between HPA function, pain and psychological distress in FM needs further examination.</p><p>Treatments for FM are general in nature and include the use of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological symptom management. Exercise is widely used as a treatment option and guidelines have been suggested for optimal results: minimize micromuscle trauma, minimize central sensitization, emphasize low-intensity exercise, individualize exercise, and maximize self-efficacy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-jpr-4-189">21</xref> Although research findings concerning isometric exercise and pain levels in FM are mixed, results from a randomized controlled trial indicate that cortisol levels in individuals with fibromyalgia do not differ from healthy controls when performing static muscular work and isometric contraction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-jpr-4-189">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-jpr-4-189">24</xref> Yoga has been used as a treatment for a variety of chronic conditions in which pain is a predominant feature.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-jpr-4-189">25</xref> To date, there are only two published studies of yoga for the treatment of FM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-jpr-4-189">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-jpr-4-189">27</xref> Improvements were seen on measures of pain, fatigue, mood, pain catastrophizing, acceptance and coping in FM patients when compared to waitlist controls, and in pain scores when compared to a yoga plus touch condition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-jpr-4-189">27</xref> Findings from these studies suggest that yoga improves pain, fatigue and psychological variables in an FM population. Further investigation is needed to examine how yoga affects other psychological domains and functional capacity, such as mindfulness and pain disability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-jpr-4-189">26</xref></p><p>Mindfulness as a construct has garnered recognition for its therapeutic gains in a variety of pain related conditions. It is rooted in Buddhist and contemplative philosophies and is characterized by paying total attention to the present moment with a non-judgmental awareness of inner and outer experiences.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-jpr-4-189">28</xref> Benefits of mindfulness practices for FM include the reduction of depressive symptoms mid- and post-treatment,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-jpr-4-189">29</xref> decreases in sympathetic autonomic arousal after meditation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-jpr-4-189">30</xref> and reduced heat-induced pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings in response to slowed breathing practices.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-jpr-4-189">31</xref> Since yoga encompasses elements of mindfulness and includes breathing techniques, it is possible that the benefits of yoga may be, in part, due to the evolving perspective and awareness that result from mindfulness.</p><p>Yoga may also exert its effects through physiological mechanisms, as it impacts the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Specifically, morning levels of cortisol increased in both depressed patients who participated in a yoga intervention and in yoga practitioners when compared to controls,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-jpr-4-189">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-jpr-4-189">33</xref> and cortisol levels decreased in undergraduate students after one yoga class,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-jpr-4-189">34</xref> in yoga teachers over a one-day yoga intensive,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-jpr-4-189">35</xref> in self-referred women after one yoga class,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-jpr-4-189">36</xref> and in detoxifying youth after a yogic breathing program.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-jpr-4-189">37</xref> Other studies did not report changes in cortisol post-yoga intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-jpr-4-189">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-jpr-4-189">40</xref> Taken together, the findings regarding the effects of yoga on HPA functioning are controversial and the use of standardized protocols for cortisol collection in research involving yoga interventions would be beneficial.</p><p>Although many studies of HPA functioning have been conducted in FM patients, the effects of a yoga intervention on cortisol levels in patients with FM have not yet been evaluated. Moreover, the effects of yoga on physiological, psychological, functional and pain variables have yet to be evaluated in a single study of patients with FM. Since yoga has been shown to alleviate many FM symptoms, such as pain and psychological functioning, and to improve HPA functioning in other populations, it is possible that yoga may improve HPA functioning, as measured by increased cortisol levels. The objectives of this pilot study were to evaluate the effects of an eight-week Hatha yoga intervention on measures of (1) pain (intensity, unpleasantness, quality, sum of local areas, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, pain disability), (2) general psychosocial functioning (anxiety, depression), (3) mindfulness, and (4) cortisol in a sample of patients with FM. It was hypothesized that the yoga program would result in improvements in pain and pain-related variables, psychological functioning, mindfulness, and increases of cortisol levels, greater diurnal variability, and a greater CAR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>Due to the higher prevalence of FM in women than men,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jpr-4-189">3</xref> and the likelihood of disproportionate numbers of men and women in the yoga classes, only women were included in this study. The main inclusion criterion was written documentation of a diagnosis of FM by a physician. Exclusion criteria were: males with FM; a current yoga practice (or a recent practice in the past six months); self-reported or diagnosed bipolar, psychotic, or personality disorders; change in any medication in the month prior to the commencement of the saliva collection and yoga program; a habit of smoking more than 15 cigarettes a day; and currently pregnant or breastfeeding. Women with FM were recruited through public advertisements (postings in locations including government and school community centers, book stores, health food stores), support groups, health centers, and pain clinics in Toronto. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-4-189">Figure 1</xref> shows the flow of participants through the study. Between April 2010 and May 2010, 57 women were screened, 24 of whom were eligible and available for the yoga classes and 19 completed the yoga program. The yoga program ran from June 16th to August 20th, 2010. The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the Human Participants Review Committee at York University prior to the start of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-jpr-4-189">Figure 2</xref>, the program consisted of several components: an information session; pre- and post-program saliva collection; yoga classes; a follow-up session; and administration of self-report questionnaires. Questionnaires were administered at three time (T) points: pre- (T1), mid-(T2), and post- (T3) intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment and information session</title><p>Prospective participants who contacted the study coordinator were interviewed over the telephone using a script to determine eligibility. Those who met the eligibility criteria were emailed a general information letter about the program, the informed consent form, and a document outlining ways to decrease and prevent muscle soreness or tightness. The information letter outlined what was to be expected in terms of attendance, commitment, pacing, initial increases in pain due to overexertion, and how to handle flare-ups during the yoga program. Participants brought the consent form and a doctor&#x02019;s note confirming a diagnosis of FM to the information session, where they were provided with saliva collection kits and were given detailed instructions for taking samples. All participants were educated in the proper procedures for saliva collection, were given general instructions concerning the yoga program and were provided the opportunity to ask questions and discuss concerns.</p></sec><sec><title>Saliva collection kits</title><p>Saliva collection kits consisted of a booklet titled &#x0201c;Saliva Sample Collection and Information Instructions&#x0201d; with educational information about cortisol, labeled diagrams and explanations of the saliva collection equipment, step by step instructions for taking samples and recording information.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-jpr-4-189">41</xref> Saliva sampling equipment (Salimetrics LLC, State College, PA) consisted of a small cotton swab, housed inside a centrifugation tube, in turn housed in a holding tube. All holding tubes were pre-labeled according to participant number, day (1, 2), and sample (S1, S2, S3) number using freeze resistant labels provided by Salimetrics. Participants were provided with freezer bags labeled for each day of collection. The kits also contained a diary to record the date and time when each sample was taken, as well as questions about consumption of food, alcohol, caffeinated beverages, and drugs, and exercise activities around the time of sampling. Lastly, the kits contained a question and answer sheet relevant to commonly asked questions about saliva collection.</p></sec><sec><title>Pre- and post-program salivary cortisol collection</title><p>Participants took three pre-intervention samples on each of the two consecutive days prior to the start of the study, and another three samples on each of the two consecutive days beginning the day after the final yoga class, according to a two day sampling technique.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-jpr-4-189">42</xref> The first sample (S1) was taken promptly upon awaking in the morning, the second sample (S2) was taken 30 minutes later, before brushing teeth, consuming food or beverages, or exercising, and the final sample (S3) was taken at night right before going to sleep. Participants were instructed not to exercise, consume drugs, alcohol, beverages or food within the hour before S3. All participants were called the night before the first day (pre- and post-intervention) of saliva sample collection to review the saliva sampling protocol and to answer any questions.</p><p>When taking a sample, participants were instructed to place a cotton swab under the tongue for at least 60 seconds, deposit the cotton swab into the centrifugation tube within the holding tube and store the entire sample in a freezer. Participants brought the pre- and post-intervention frozen samples to the studio on the first day of the yoga program and on the day of the scheduled follow-up session, respectively. The samples were transferred to a secure freezer until the end of the program, when both sets of samples were couriered to Salimetrics for cortisol immunoassay.</p></sec><sec><title>Yoga classes</title><p>Participants attended two 75-minute Hatha yoga classes each week for 8 weeks at Vidya Institute in Toronto. Classes were taught by a certified Yoga Alliance (Toronto, ON) instructor (KC) with 200 hours training. Hatha yoga is a mind-body practice that was developed in 15th century India, in which physical yoga postures were practiced to prepare the mind for meditation. Theoretically, the term Hatha is composed of the Sanskrit terms &#x0201c;Ha&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Tha&#x0201d;, which refer to the sun, or heating and activating properties, and to the moon, or cooling or calming properties, respectively. By balancing these opposing qualities, physical and mental health are fostered and the development of self-awareness and mind-body unity are cultivated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-jpr-4-189">43</xref> Hatha yoga is an appropriate form of yoga for women with FM since it is gentle, can be easily modified to accommodate individual medical conditions and difficulties with mobility. The classes consisted of traditional, modified, and restorative yoga postures (asana), breathing exercises (pranayama), a brief meditation (dhyana),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-jpr-4-189">25</xref> intention setting, mindfulness exercises and an introduction to the eight limbs of yoga. Participants were neither encouraged nor discouraged to practice asana at home between classes, and measures of home practice were not taken.</p><p>This program is similar in format to the Yoga as Awareness program developed by Carsen et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-jpr-4-189">26</xref> for women with FM, but differed in that short yoga philosophy teachings were given instead of dyadic presentations and that there was no group discussion in the present study. Teaching aspects of yoga philosophy, such as ahimsa (non-violence), aparigraha (non-grasping) and niyamas (guidance for one&#x02019;s relationships to the self) provided direction to participants for practicing the postures and breathing techniques, as recommended for chronic pain patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-jpr-4-189">44</xref> Special care was taken in the formulation of instructions for practicing the postures so that they were tailored to individuals with FM, specific cues were given to provide participants with techniques for monitoring how to safely practice the postures when in pain and considerable instruction was given regarding the nature of a non-judgmental, compassionate, and accepting approach to practice.</p><p>All yoga classes began with philosophy teachings concerning the eight limbs of yoga, which are ethical considerations and guidelines to living a meaningful and purposeful life. These teachings were then practically applied to the physical yoga postures, as well as to a physical practice where pain is a predominant sensory experience. Modifications and variations in postures and purposeful sequencing were used to accommodate the pathophysiology and functional changes associated with FM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-jpr-4-189">26</xref> Slow transitions between asanas were used to address autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation and restorative postures were interwoven throughout the class to calm the sympathetic nervous system. Low impact and intensity postures were used to minimize micromuscle trauma, and modified asanas (eg, sun salutation at the wall, variations of sitting postures) and props (blocks, straps and bolsters) were used to minimize musculoskeletal pain in the knees, back, hips, and wrists. Classes ended with corpse pose (savasana), which was accompanied by body scans and visualization practices, in order to help participants embrace relaxation, embody presence, and to serve as a focus for the mind, liberating it from attending to pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-jpr-4-189">44</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up session</title><p>Three days after the final yoga class, participants attended a follow-up session at the studio, where they returned the frozen post-intervention saliva samples, completed the final set of questionnaires, and debriefed about their experiences. In specific cases where participants could not attend the follow-up session, individual meeting times were organized.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>All participants were given a package of questionnaires at three time points to evaluate pain, mood, psychological functioning and mindfulness. The first set of questionnaires (T1) was completed at the yoga studio 45 minutes before the first class along with demographic and clinical information concerning occupation, education, ethnicity, medical or psychiatric illness, medication use and socioeconomic status. The second set (T2) was completed by participants at home or at the yoga studio before the ninth class, and the third set (T3) was filled out at the follow-up session. The study coordinator (KC) was available to answer any questions and guide participants when completing the forms. Each questionnaire package consisted of the following measures.</p></sec><sec><title>McGill Pain Questionnaire short-form 2 (MPQ-SF-2)</title><p>The MPQ-SF-2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-jpr-4-189">45</xref> is a multi-dimensional measure of pain that consists of 22 pain descriptors. Participants rate each descriptor on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (&#x0201c;none&#x0201d;) to 10 (&#x0201c;worst possible&#x0201d;). Subscale scores are computed by calculating mean ratings for the following subscales: (1) continuous pain, (2) intermittent pain, (3) neuropathic pain, and (4) affective descriptors. Total score is the mean of the four subscale scores. The MPQ-SF-2 has very good to excellent psychometric properties, including adequate to high internal consistency reliability estimates for the four subscales (0.73&#x02013;0.87) and the total score (0.91&#x02013;0.95), good construct validity, and sensitivity to change in response to pharmacotherapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-jpr-4-189">45</xref></p><sec><title>Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for pain intensity (I) and unpleasantness (U)</title><p>The NRS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-jpr-4-189">46</xref> provided a global measure of pain intensity and pain unpleasantness.

For instance, the SLAP measures the front and back of each arm as separate regions, while the WPI measures the upper and lower portions of each arm. Participants are instructed to circle areas in which they have been experiencing pain over the past week. The SLAP was selected for this study since (1) the practicality, accuracy and reliability of using tender points to determine pain intensity in FM patients has been questioned,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-jpr-4-189">2</xref> (2) tender point count requires specialized training, and (3) the SLAP has been shown to be a better clinical predictor of pain than tender point count in FM patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-jpr-4-189">47</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</title><p>The PCS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-jpr-4-189">48</xref> is a 13-item self-report questionnaire that measures catastrophic thinking in relation to experienced or anticipated pain.

The results demonstrated post-intervention improvement on a variety of pain and psychological variables, including continuous pain, pain catastrophizing, pain helplessness, chronic pain acceptance, activity engagement, pain willingness, mindfulness, non-reactivity to inner experience and ability to describe inner experience. Moreover, using an intention to treat analysis, total cortisol output increased significantly post-intervention. These results suggest that a Hatha yoga program specifically tailored to the needs of a female FM population reduces continuous pain, pain catastrophizing and increases chronic pain acceptance and mindfulness.</p><p>Improvements in pain, pain catastrophizing and chronic pain acceptance are consistent with the results of a recently published Yoga as Awareness intervention for women with FM, which showed a reduction in pain, fatigue, pain catastrophizing, and an increase in acceptance, mood and coping.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-jpr-4-189">26</xref> The present results confirm many of these recent findings and extend them by suggesting that the pre- to post-intervention changes we observed in mindfulness and cortisol levels may point to potential mechanisms of the present yoga program for women with FM.</p><p>The therapeutic benefits of mindfulness have been attributed to three components: intention, attention and attitude.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-jpr-4-189">59</xref> These components serve to generate awareness and purpose for certain behaviors, to facilitate observation of both internal and external experiences while withholding judgment about the nature of those experiences, and to enhance the quality of how one attends. Kindness, openness and acceptance are pivotal to cultivating a state of non-striving, in which one can let go of hoping for pleasant experiences. Shapiro et al posit that these three elements contribute to a large proportion of the variance in the transformations that result from mindfulness practice in terms of psychological functioning, pain, and other outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-jpr-4-189">59</xref> These considerations are supported by the results of the mediation analysis showing that mid-intervention levels of mindfulness (which increased significantly from baseline to T2 as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-jpr-4-189">Table 3</xref>) mediated the reduction in pain catastrophizing from pre- to post-intervention. The results of the mediation analysis support recent fear-avoidance models of chronic pain, which propose that chronic pain is in part maintained by fear of pain and pain catastrophizing through the negatively reinforcing effects of avoiding (eg, behavioral, emotional, interoceptive) pain-related cues and sensations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-jpr-4-189">60</xref> We suggest that the in-class emphasis that mindfulness practices placed on attending, without judgment, to pain and the ensuing cognitive-emotional reactions (eg, catastrophic thoughts), permitted participants to circumvent their typical avoidance strategies and to experience the pain and distress, thereby reducing catastrophic appraisals by a process of interoceptive exposure. Furthermore, it is possible that the mindfulness practices and their effects on reducing pain catastrophizing may have contributed to the significant increases in chronic pain acceptance observed over the course of the intervention, but further research is needed to better understand these relationships.</p><p>Given that HPA axis dysregulation in FM has received considerable attention, the present results showing increased levels of total cortisol output (AUC) is especially noteworthy. This change suggests that the yoga program may have contributed to normalizing one aspect of HPA axis dysregulation observed in women with FM. The results are consistent with the findings from (1) an uncontrolled, multi-disciplinary CBT and aquatic exercise program for women with FM that showed a greater AUC for cortisol post-treatment,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61-jpr-4-189">61</xref> and (2) a non-randomized, but controlled, ten-week yoga program for women with rheumatoid arthritis that showed no change in the CAR post-treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-jpr-4-189">38</xref> The absence of a significant change in the CAR in the present study fits with the non-significant change in post-intervention HADS depression scores in that an attenuated rise in the CAR has been related to greater subclinical depressive symptoms and a greater rise to milder symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62-jpr-4-189">62</xref> However, it is possible that a more sensitive measure of the CAR and/or a longer yoga intervention may be required to demonstrate improvements in the CAR and HADS depression scores.</p><p>In order to evaluate diurnal variability, we sampled cortisol three times daily precluding a more precise analysis,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63-jpr-4-189">63</xref> which requires a more intense sampling protocol of 5&#x02013;7 samples over the course of the day, for two consecutive days. It is possible that with a greater number of measurements, differences in diurnal variability may have been observed. It is also possible that the absence of a significant difference from pre- to post-intervention AUC, when using the protocol-compliant analysis, was due to a lack of power as significance was observed with the addition of the three participant&#x02019;s missing data. A methodology employing a greater number of sampling time points would also allow for the division of participants into HPA subgroups of typical, flat or inconsistent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-jpr-4-189">42</xref> Since FM is associated with variable HPA functioning as well as a high variability of illness profiles,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jpr-4-189">3</xref> such grouping would be very useful in determining a more accurate picture of HPA patterns in this population. Further grouping according to symptom subgroups may be most effective when evaluating the effects of a pain management program,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64-jpr-4-189">64</xref> and future research might consider the use of a larger sample size to allow for classification of FM participants according to sensory symptoms and comorbidities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65-jpr-4-189">65</xref> within the context of a yoga intervention. Future research should measure other variables that are implicated in HPA function, such as growth hormone or inflammatory cytokines, to better understand how a yoga intervention might impact HPA function more broadly. Taken together, it is clear that randomized, controlled trials are needed to further examine the effect of mind-body practices, such as yoga, on cortisol in women with FM.</p><p>Speculation on the underlying mechanisms of yoga for chronic pain conditions includes physiological changes that impact the pain experience.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-jpr-4-189">25</xref> Yoga promotes the relaxation response, which consists of a decreased heart rate, increased breath volume, and increased digestive function, amongst improvements on other physiological responses to stress, by increasing parasympathetic nervous system activity and decreasing sympathetic nervous system activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66-jpr-4-189">66</xref> Recent research indicates that advanced yoga practitioners have lower interleukin-6 levels than novice practitioners and it has been suggested that a regular yoga practice may serve to inhibit a pro-inflammatory response to stress.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67-jpr-4-189">67</xref> It is possible that such physiological changes may also have contributed to the post-yoga intervention changes we observed. Future research should examine the effects of yoga on these psycho-immune-endocrine interactions in FM.</p><p>The present yoga intervention did not result in improvements in the HADS depression and anxiety scores over the course of the yoga program. These findings are not consistent with other yoga studies of women with FM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-jpr-4-189">26</xref> and rheumatoid arthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-jpr-4-189">38</xref> Reasons for this discrepancy include differences among the studies in the measures used to assess depressive symptomology (ie, Beck Depression Inventory,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-jpr-4-189">38</xref> Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-jpr-4-189">26</xref> HADS in the present study), the duration and intensity of the yoga program (10 weeks,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-jpr-4-189">38</xref> 8 weeks plus group discussion,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-jpr-4-189">26</xref> 8 weeks), or both. A longer intervention, including a social support component, may be needed to produce post-intervention improvements in depression as measured by the HADS.</p><p>There are limitations to the present study. The main methodological shortcoming is the absence of a control group, raising the possibility that the observed effects are not due to the yoga program per se but reflect spontaneous recovery, regression to the mean, and/or non-specific factors such as a caring atmosphere and attention paid to participants. In addition, the relatively small sample size limits statistical power and the absence of males limits the generalizability of the findings. Finally, notwithstanding the observed post-intervention changes in total cortisol and diurnal variability, the absence of a change in the CAR may be a limitation of our salivary cortisol sampling procedure. More frequent sampling of salivary cortisol would also permit a more fine-grained classification of HPA axis functioning.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of the present pilot study suggest that an eight-week yoga program helps to improve various psychological and pain related variables; namely, to decrease continuous pain and pain catastrophizing, to increase chronic pain acceptance and levels of mindfulness, as well as to alter cortisol levels in women with FM. Use of a randomized, controlled design with a larger sample size is recommended to better understand the effects of a yoga intervention on the above variables. A longer intervention may yield more robust findings, and a six-month follow-up may provide valuable information concerning the potential for lasting improvement.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Robin Hurlow and Claire Wicks for their expertise and commitment in the execution of the yoga program, and Dr Warren Nielson and Neil Pearson for their suggestions concerning fibromyalgia and appropriate asana practices for chronic pain, respectively.
