Approximately 70% of post-stroke patients have sensorimotor deficits in the upper limb (UL), which result in contralateral hemiparesis injury. [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These sensorimotor deficits can include somatosensory alterations, which impair movement control and joint stability [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. An important subsystem of the somatosensory system involves proprioception [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which consists of afferent information originating from mechanoreceptors [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Proprioception can be divided into three submodalities, i.e. kinesthesia, sense of tension or force and joint position sense (JPS) [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Proprioceptive deficits impair feedback and feedforward control, which negatively influence joint stability, acuity and coordination movements [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], mainly small or precise movements [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], as well as motor skill acquisition [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Fifty percent of post-stroke subjects present proprioceptive deficits in the UL [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. According to previous studies, subjects with chronic hemiparesis presented bilateral deficits of kinesthesia during internal and external shoulder rotation [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], as well as bilateral deficits of JPS during movement abduction and flexion of the shoulder. These deficits are related to the degree of shoulder subluxation [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, these proprioceptive deficits are also associated with UL motor recovery and function [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which impair the performance of activities of daily living [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and possibly restrict participation and quality of life. Therefore, treating proprioceptive impairments is one of the main objectives in rehabilitation programs for stroke patients [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Given these clinical findings, some strategies to improve proprioception have been used in clinical practice, such as augmentation of somatosensory information via passive techniques that involves manual therapy, soft tissue techniques and taping or brace applications [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Taping consists of an adjunct technique, which uses an elastic adhesive tape over the skin in order to stimulate mechanoreceptors via continuous skin stretching and compression during joint motion [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Based on accepted principles in neuroscience, it can be hypothesized that these afferent stimuli are transmitted to the contralateral area of the somatosensory cortex, which integrates information from different sensory and motor modalities [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. One taping technique widely used in clinical practice is the Kinesio Taping method [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>According to previous studies, taping increased electromyographic activity and improved the shoulder joint position sense of healthy individuals [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Moreover, taping helped to perform simple and proprioceptive activities during knee extension in healthy subjects, which were associated with more bilateral activation in the primary sensorimotor cortex and primary sensory cortex, and less bilateral activation in the cingulate motor area and cerebellum [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, these results demonstrated that taping can influence neural activation, as well as provide biomechanical support, i.e., improving shoulder girdle stability [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Regarding stroke patients, a systematic review [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] highlighted that the effects of taping on pain intensity, muscle tone, range of motion and strength were inconclusive, and that there was insufficient evidence related to activity and participation. Hence, the authors concluded that there is a need for more in-depth research that can verify the taping effects on this population.</p><p>Although systematic review [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and studies have shown that elastic tape does not reduce shoulder pain [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and subluxation [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], nor does it increase the range of motion [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], motor function and functionality in post-stroke subjects [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], other studies observed opposite effects of the UL from the same population, such as reduced pain, improvements in range of motion [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], motor function and functionality [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] after intervening with elastic tape. Thus, the literature supported the lack of consensus of the effects of elastic tape used in the UL of post-stroke subjects, requiring more studies. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence regarding the effect of taping on proprioception (joint position sense) in this population. Our study will test if taping is able to provide any improvement of the sensorial feedback in the shoulders of chronic post-stroke subjects.</p><p>The main purpose of this study was to verify the effect of the elastic tape, used on the paretic shoulder (anterior, middle, and posterior deltoid), on the JPS of the paretic side during abduction and flexion in chronic hemiparetic subjects, compared to rigid tape (sham). Secondly, another aim was to verify if the possible improvement of shoulder girdle stability provided by the elastic tape on the paretic side could influence the JPS of the non-paretic side. Thirdly, another objective was to verify if this potential effect (difference between pre and post intervention after elastic tape) on the paretic shoulder was correlated to the baseline shoulder subluxation measurements and sensorimotor impairment. Therefore, it can be observed whether there is a relationship between the amount of deficits and response to the treatment. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) elastic tape improves JPS on the paretic side, (2) elastic tape improves JPS on the non-paretic side by increasing the proximal stability and (3) this change is negatively correlated to the baseline subluxation grade and sensorimotor impairment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Experimental design</title><p>This study presents a randomized sham-controlled crossover study, which was conducted with chronic hemiparetic subjects at a center (UFSCar, Brazil). Patients were recruited from lists acquired from the rehabilitation center and the University Hospital of S&#x000e3;o Carlos, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil. Patients were not involved in any rehabilitation program. The research activities of this study received ethical approval by the Ethics Committee in Brazil (Number: 966636) and was registered in the Clinical Trials (URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>. Unique identifier: NCT02390115). Written informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to taking part in the study. All data regarding the trial for this intervention were registered. However, the registration date was retrospective to the participants&#x02032; enrollment due to insufficient information for registration, for example, little information regarding the tape application protocol. The CONSORT checklist, study protocol and individual data are available as supporting information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0170368.s003">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0170368.s004">S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0170368.s005">S3</xref> Files, respectively).</p><p>Assessments were divided into three days and all evaluations were carried out at the Federal University of S&#x000e3;o Carlos (UFSCar), Brazil. On the first day, screening to select the sample and clinical assessment was done. In the first and second sessions, the JPS was assessed, followed by a wash-out period of one month between sessions. In both sessions, the JPS test was run without and with intervention (elastic or sham tape). Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups using sealed opaque envelopes to receive the Sham Tape (ST) first or the Elastic Tape (ET) first. An independent staff member prepared the envelopes. However, the assessor and patient were not blinded when the intervention took place due to the color of the tape and not being able to cover the limb, which could generate more sensory input and impair the test. Thus, before the test, the assessor read a standard text to the patient: &#x0201c;I will put the tape on your shoulder and you will do a test, which I will explain later&#x0201d;.

Twenty-four movements were performed for each limb, and the absolute error was the average of three attempts.

Blue Kinesio<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Tex Gold Finger Print tape (5 cm wide) was used for the elastic tape intervention and Cremer tape strips (5 cm wide) (Cremer S/A, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil) were used for the sham intervention. After putting on the tapes, and before re-evaluating the JPS, the patients remained seated for 10 minutes. Then, the JPS test was performed again with the intervention (sham or elastic tape). A previous study showed a short-time effect after 10 minutes using the elastic tape [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>To attach the elastic tape, the acromioclavicular joint was considered as the initial anchor and one point immediately below the insertion of the deltoid muscle as the final anchor. The first tape was placed on the anterior portion of the deltoid with the shoulder at 30&#x000b0; passive extension. The second tape was placed on the middle portion of the deltoid with the shoulder at 30&#x000b0; passive horizontal adduction. To place the third tape on the posterior deltoid, the limb was positioned at 90&#x000b0; of passive flexion of the shoulder (data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0170368.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The elastic tape tension was described as &#x0201c;paper tension&#x0201d; and was equivalent to 10&#x02013;15% of the total elastic tape tension, i.e., no tension was applied to the tape by the therapist [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. According to the Kinesio Taping method, the tape application from origin to insertion with 10&#x02013;15% of tension can facilitate muscle function and provide more support by increasing the sensory stimulation without performing the functional correction (mechanical support) [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Furthermore, also according to the method, applying the tape with the stretched muscle generates convolutions on the skin when the patient returns to neutral position, which can increase the sensory input [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The sham tape was placed similarly to the elastic tape with the patient in the same position.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Perceived effects</title><p>An assessment of the perceived effects was carried out during the first session after the JPS for both groups.

Furthermore, in accordance with systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the current available evidence is of low quality and insufficient to draw conclusions about the effects of elastic tape on different populations and/or pathologies [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Thus, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomized sham-controlled crossover study that has verified immediate effects of elastic tape applied to the paretic shoulder, on JPS of the paretic and non-paretic side during abduction and flexion in subjects with chronic hemiparesis, compared to rigid tape.</p><p>The results of the present study revealed that elastic tape only improves JPS on the paretic side for all analyzed movements and angles characterized by a decreased absolute error. These findings confirm the first hypothesis. However, these results are not in line with previous studies that did not observe any effects of elastic tape on shoulder proprioception in athletes [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and healthy subjects [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. These conflicting results may be partially explained by differences between the evaluated populations and assessment tools, such as the use of the inclinometer versus an optoelectronic system for three-dimensional analyses. On the other hand, our results are in agreement with previous studies that used the same measurements on the knees of healthy subjects. These studies observed an improvement in JPS after using elastic tape in participants with poor proprioception compared to the good proprioception group [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In addition, facilitators&#x02032; effects were also observed when elastic tape was used on the knees of healthy subjects [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], and on the shoulders of healthy subjects [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Based on previous literature [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and neuroscience knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], it can be suggested that a possible explanation for the effect of elastic taping may be related to the neural activation and biomechanics support. Elastic tape produces tactile stimulation, which increases sensory input from mechanoreceptors to the cortex contralateral primary somatosensory via thalamus [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The primary somatosensory cortex has a connection with multimodal association areas, which integrates information from different sensory modalities such as visual and proprioceptive information. These areas are linked to multimodal motor association areas that transform sensory information into planned movements and calculate the necessary programs for movements (feedforward and feedback control). In addition, these motor multimodal areas are linked to the primary motor cortex and premotor areas [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This possible central neural influence of the elastic tape was demonstrated by a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], that observed the increase in bilateral activation of sensory and sensorimotor areas and bilateral decrease in areas related to decision making and planning, and coordination of the some aspects of proprioception, such as cerebellum and the cingulate motor area.</p><p>Because the sham intervention (rigid tape) had no effect in the position sense, it can be suggested that the effects of the elastic tape may be due to its elastic property. This property can produce mechanical changes on the skin, such as stretching and compression, thereby increasing the sensory input [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It is worth highlighting that the sham intervention was considered a plausible comparator for this study. Finally, as there were no changes in the JPS between the two evaluations on the non-paretic (i.e. non-treated) side, it can be concluded that there was no learning effect. Moreover, although the elastic tape may improve shoulder girdle stability [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which can improve body position and perception bilaterally, these results demonstrate that the immediate effects of the elastic tape were limited to the applied part of the body. Furthermore, while previous study demonstrated that elastic tape provided a bilateral activation in the sensorimotor cortex [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], it did not reflect immediate changes on the shoulder JPS on the non-paretic side, reinforcing that short-term effects of the tape are local.</p><p>Another important result of this study is related to a negative correlation between the potential effect (difference between the absolute average error in the pre and post elastic tape intervention) and the measurement of shoulder subluxation during abduction. According to the literature, subluxation impairs the abduction motion more than the flexion motion, due to anatomical and biomechanical aspects [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. However, no correlations between the sensorimotor impairment (FMA score) for all the movements and angles were observed, which refutes the second hypothesis of the study. The lack of correlation demonstrated that patients with mild or moderate UL sensorimotor impairment can benefit from using elastic tape, regardless of the impairment level.</p><p>Overall, the results of this study demonstrated that elastic tape could be considered as an important intervention strategy for post-stroke subjects in chronic phases, regardless of the UL sensorimotor impairment level. Apart from the relationship between the effect of elastic tape during abduction and the baseline shoulder degree of subluxation, this intervention strategy also provided an improvement for this movement. Moreover, shoulder JPS plays an important role in feedback and feedforward controls during motor action to achieve specific roles for movement acuity, joint stability and coordination [<xref rid="pone.0170368.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170368.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which influence the upper limb performance. Thus, these improvement in shoulder JPS provided by elastic tape can improve joint stability and control of movement of UL. Furthermore, elastic tape would be an important strategy to facilitate the increase in sensory input, and should be associated with more repetitive task-specific training.</p><p>It is worth noting that the results of the present study are limited to the immediate effects of the elastic tape on shoulder JPS in subjects with chronic hemiparesis post-stroke with mild or moderate UL sensorimotor impairment. Thus, future studies that verify the effects of long-term elastic tape on joint position sense, as well as studies that verify short and long-term effects in other submodalities of proprioception, and/ or other phases of stroke are needed. In addition, the present study did not evaluate the effect of elastic tape on UL functional movements. Therefore, future studies are needed to verify the relationship between improvement in JPS and performance in the UL movements, as well as the effect of the elastic tape on daily UL activities. Furthermore, although an adequate sample size and large effect size were observed in the present study, for the correlation analysis, a larger sample size is required to further generalize our findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Elastic tape applied to the paretic shoulder (anterior, middle, and posterior deltoid) improved JPS during abduction and flexion in chronic hemiparetic subjects, regardless of the level of UL sensorimotor impairment.
