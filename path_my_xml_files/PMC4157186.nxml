F-18 FDG is transported within the myocytes and undergoes phosphorylation to FDG-6-phosphate where no further metabolism occurs.</p><p>In normal myocardium, oxidative metabolism is primary source of energy and utilizes free fatty acids, glucose, and lactate as substrates. In fasting state, free fatty acid becomes substrate of choice as the plasma insulin levels fall that results in lesser transport of glucose into the myocytes and an increase in the availability of free fatty acids secondary to increased lipolysis in peripheral adipose tissue. After feeding, plasma insulin levels rise, glucose becomes the primary substrate for oxidative metabolism as lipolysis within adipose tissue is inhibited, and arterial fatty acid content decreases.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Because FDG uptake reflects the glucose metabolism, then in fasting state there should be negligible FDG uptake in the myocardium. However, variable uptake of FDG is noted in the myocardium in fasting state.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Even in the post-glucose load protocol, if patient preparation is not adequate, a heterogeneous F-18 FDG uptake is noted in the myocardium making the interpretation of the scan difficult.</p><p>Therefore, we have designed this study to observe the variable patterns of myocardial FDG uptake in fasting state for a short interval of 4 h, longer duration of overnight fasting (&#x0003e;12 h), and overnight fasting with a low carbohydrate and fat-rich diet for 2 days prior to the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>A total of 153 patients referred for FDG PET scan for routine oncological evaluation to our department were enrolled in the study. The patients were recruited after obtaining ethical clearance from ethics committee of the institute. Patients with any previous investigation suggestive of coronary artery disease, with past history of myocardial infarction, past history of revascularization, and uncontrolled diabetes were excluded from the study. Also patients with history of chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 8 weeks, age below 12 years, and mediastinal radiation were excluded. The recruited patients were randomized in blocks of three subjects in three groups.</p><p>Patients in each group were advised to follow instructions as part of preparation prior to PET scan. Group A patients were advised to fast for at least 4 h, and Group B patients were advised to fast overnight so as to have fasting period of at least 12 h (range 12-14 h). Group C patients in addition to fasting overnight were requested to follow low carbohydrate and fat-rich diet for period of 2 days before the scan. Group C patients were explained and a dietary chart of permitted and non-permitted foods was given based on dietary habits, and all the patients who complied and followed the diet chart were considered. We did not follow a fixed standard diet so as to have a better patient compliance. Also, it was not logistically possible to provide a special diet to each patient in the department before the FDG injection. These patients were requested to avoid carbohydrate-rich diet like rice, potato, and sweet potatoes and fruits like grape, banana, and litchi and sweets like chocolate, honey, and jam. Depending upon dietary habits, they were asked to consume protein-rich diet like pulses, cottage cheese, green vegetables, and egg and high fat-rich diet like butter, cheese, chicken, meat, and fried food.</p><p>Before the FDG study, we confirmed compliance of each patient for the instructions given. Blood glucose level was checked for each patient using glucometer. Ten-15 mCi (370-555 MBq) of F-18 FDG was injected into the patient through an intravenous catheter. A whole body PET scan was acquired 40-60 min after injection on dedicated PET-computed tomography (CT) scanner (Biograph 2, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). In the PET-CT system, CT acquisition was performed on spiral dual slice CT with a Kv of 130, mAs of 60, slice thickness of 4 mm, and a pitch of 1. Image was acquired using a matrix of 512 &#x000d7; 512 pixels and pixel size of 1 mm. After CT, three-dimensional (3D) PET acquisition was done for 2-3 min per bed position. PET data were acquired using matrix of 128 &#x000d7; 128 pixels with a slice thickness of 1.5 mm. CT-based attenuation correction of the emission images was used. PET images were reconstructed by iterative method ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM; two iterations and eight subsets). After CT acquisition, PET acquisition of the same axial range was done with the patient in the same position. After completion of PET acquisition, the reconstructed attenuation-corrected PET images, CT images, and fused images of matching pairs of PET and CT images were available for review in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes, as well as in maximum intensity projections (MIP), and 3D cine mode. Attenuation-corrected PET images focussing the heart were reoriented from the transaxial slices to generate the conventional cardiac short axis and vertical and horizontal long axis. Two nuclear medicine physicians reported the PET studies that were blinded to patient group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Image interpretation</title><p>All the studies were viewed in MIP and in 3D cine mode for initial assessment of cardiac and extracardiac FDG uptake. Patients with abnormal FDG uptake in mediastinum were excluded from further analysis. F-18 FDG PET cardiac images were analyzed for myocardial uptake in conventional cardiac format as short axis vertical and horizontal long axis. To observe the variable pattern of FDG uptake in the left ventricular (LV) myocardium, we classified the uptake as follows: 1) homogeneous uptake in the entire LV myocardium, 2) heterogeneous uptake in the LV myocardium. This regional uptake was assigned to conventional anatomical walls of the LV myocardium based on 20 segment model using Emory Cardiac Toolbox (ECTbox; Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia (GA), United States of America (USA)). The regions were identified irrespective of the intensity of the uptake, provided they could be delineated separately from the blood pool activity in the LV cavity and the surrounding background. 3) No uptake or negligible uptake in the LV myocardium.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics was used for reporting the demographics of patient data.

PET scans routinely performed for oncological evaluation have shown a variable spectrum of FDG uptake in myocardium even in fasting state. This variable uptake poses difficulty in interpretation when suppression of FDG uptake in normal myocardium is desired, e.g., in detection of ischemic myocardium,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] in oncological evaluation of thorax and upper abdominal area,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and when a low myocardial uptake is required in plaque imaging of the coronary vessels.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Even in the post-glucose load studies for assessment of viability, often a heterogeneous F-18 FDG uptake is noted in the myocardium making the interpretation difficult. Therefore, we designed this study to observe the influence of duration of fasting and dietary modifications on myocardial FDG uptake.</p><p>In our study, we evaluated a total of 153 patients who were divided into three groups, Group A: Patients with 4-h fasting (range 4-6 h), Group B: Patients with 12-h overnight fasting (range 12-14 h), and Group C: Patients with overnight fasting and on low carbohydrate and fat-rich diet for 2 days prior to the study.</p><p>To observe the variable pattern of FDG uptake in the LV myocardium, we visually classified the uptake into homogeneous uptake, heterogeneous uptake, and &#x02018;no uptake&#x02019; in the LV myocardium. Some authors have compared the myocardial FDG uptake with background or other organs like liver by visually grading the uptake or using standardized uptake value (SUV).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In our study, we did not take into consideration myocardial SUV values or compared the ratio of myocardial uptake with background or other organs. These parameters routinely are not taken into consideration when reporting cardiac study. The focus of our study was to observe and identify the pattern of FDG myocardial uptake in relation to duration of fasting and diet so as to bePnefit the interpretation of cardiac PET studies in day to day practice. Although all the studies were viewed in the 3D cine format, the final analysis of all the studies was done in conventional cardiac format as short axis and vertical and horizontal long axis, like any routine cardiac study.</p><p>In our study, we observed the &#x02018;no uptake&#x02019; pattern in 10, 55, and 77%, &#x02018;heterogeneous&#x02019; pattern of FDG uptake in 39, 28, and 14%, and &#x02018;homogeneous&#x02019; pattern in 51, 18, and 10% patients in Group A, B, and C, respectively. These results showed that Group C protocol of overnight fasting and restricted diet (2 days of low carbohydrate and fat-rich diet) before F-18 FDG administration suppresses myocardial F-18 FDG uptake more than Group B that suppresses the uptake more than Group A. Our results suggest that myocardial uptake suppression is better with combination of controlled diet and fasting than fasting alone.</p><p>Several authors have studied the role of diet and fasting on myocardial FDG uptake.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] De Groot <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] had concluded that age, fasting period, and blood glucose levels did not influence physiological uptake of FDG in myocardium. This study suggests that carbohydrate-restricted fat-rich diet may be more effective than fasting to suppress myocardial FDG uptake. Balink <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] in their study described the effect of a 1-day fat-allowed carbohydrate-restricted diet on myocardial F-18 FDG uptake in fasting protocol for PET oncology study. They found that after a carbohydrate-restricted diet, 68% of patients had a homogeneously low myocardial uptake of F-18 FDG. Therefore, we designed the 2-day protocol of carbohydrate-restricted fat-rich diet in order to achieve better myocardial FDG suppression and also compare the findings with prolonged fasting period. In our study, myocardial suppression was higher (77%) in patients who fasted overnight and were put on a controlled diet for 2 days.</p><p>In a recent study, Harisankar <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] evaluated the feasibility to consistently suppress myocardial FDG uptake with a low carbohydrate high fat protein permitted (LCHFPP) diet. In their study, they compared 50 patients (&#x0003e;12-h fasting) and 60 patients on special LCHFPP diet, which the patients were advised to consume on previous night and also at 4 h before the test. After exclusion of noncompliant patients in LCHFPP group, 84% of subjects demonstrated significant FDG suppression. The authors observed better myocardial FDG uptake suppression using LCHFPP diet compared with prolonged (&#x0003e;12 h) fasting protocol.</p><p>We analyzed the relation of blood glucose level on the myocardial uptake pattern. The mBG was lowest in &#x02018;no uptake&#x02019; pattern calculated to be 102 &#x000b1; 25 mg/dl, which was comparable with 111 &#x000b1; 24 mg/dl in homogeneous pattern. Also within each group, no relationship could be established between mBG and the uptake pattern. These results suggest that mBG does not determine the uptake of FDG in the myocardium. Other factors like insulin level, free fatty acid concentration, glucagon level, and influx rate constants of FDG may also play role in myocardial FDG uptake as suggested by Choi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Similarly, de Groot <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in their study on patients who underwent repeated PET scans for oncological evaluation suggested that the variable uptake in the myocardium is not influenced by the blood glucose level.</p><p>We further evaluated the heterogeneous uptake pattern in relation to the regions in the ventricular wall. The regions were identified irrespective of the intensity of the uptake, provided they could be delineated separately from the blood pool activity in the LV cavity and the surrounding background. A total of 41 patients showed heterogeneous pattern, of which 20 (39%) were noted in Group A, 14 (28%) in Group B, and least seven (14%) in Group C. We could identify seven different patterns involving the ventricular walls. Region wise the most common regions that showed myocardial FDG uptake were lateral wall (90%), followed by base of the heart (88%), inferior wall (56%), and distal anteroapical region (46%). The regions with negligible or absent FDG uptake were septum, mid anterior wall, and inferoapical region. Similar findings of regional heterogeneity of FDG uptake in the myocardium have been described in previous studies.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Gropler <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] reported that myocardial accumulation of FDG in the septum and anterior wall averaged 80% of that in the lateral and posterior walls in the subjects with regional uptake. The regional heterogeneity of FDG uptake could be attributed to preferential substrate utilization by different regions of the myocardium in the fasting state. Hicks <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] studied normal variation in regional myocardial substrate metabolism and quantitatively evaluated myocardial oxidative metabolism with carbon-11 acetate and glucose metabolism using F-18 FDG. They observed that the glucose utilization was 13% lower in the septum compared with the lateral wall. This could not be explained by decreased metabolic demand because C-11 clearance constants were marginally higher in the septum than in the lateral wall in both studies. The authors suggested that relatively decreased septal glucose utilization could reflect regional variation in substrate use and possible preferential free fatty acid utilization by the septum.</p><p>In our study, we studied the effect of diabetes on the myocardial FDG uptake. On overall analysis, we found no relation between uptake pattern and presence of diabetes. Previous studies have assessed the role of diabetes on myocardial FDG uptake and suggested that in diabetics, myocardium shows preference for fatty acid as substrate compared with glucose.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] But the same tendency was not noted in our study population. However, due to small numbers of diabetic patients in our study population and still lesser number in each group, a definite conclusion cannot be made.</p><p>In our study, we also assessed whether chemotherapy can affect the myocardial uptake pattern. Overall, we found no relation between uptake patterns in patients who received chemotherapy when compared with patients who had not received chemotherapy.</p><p>In summary, the results of our study show that Group C protocol of overnight fasting and restricted diet (low carbohydrate and fat-rich diet) for 2 days before F-18 FDG study suppresses myocardial F-18 FDG uptake more than Group B protocol of overnight fasting alone that suppresses uptake more than Group A protocol of 4-h fasting. Blood glucose, diabetes, and chemotherapy do not influence myocardial FDG uptake. Therefore, our results suggest that both restricted diet and duration of fasting play an important role in suppression of myocardial FDG uptake.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
