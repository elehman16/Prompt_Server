It is endemic in 88 countries including Iran, Iraq, Brazil, Afghanistan, Peru, Sudan and Syria. It has afflicted 12 million people with 1-1.5 million new cases each year putting 350 million people at risk. It is becoming a global problem with increasing incidence due to immigration and travel.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Hyperendemicity of leishmaniasis in Iran has made it an important health problem in this country demanding high annual expenses. Although cutaneous leishmaniasis is a self-limiting disease, its healing takes months to years and in some cases it becomes chronic. On the other hand, healing is associated with a deformed scar.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Despite multiple treatment suggestions for cutaneous leishmaniasis, pentavalent Antimony compounds are used as first-line treatment,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] but regarding their serious potential side effects including cardiac, hepatic and blood toxicity and pancreatitis, increased cases of clinical response failure,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] high prices, lack of production technology in many of the developing endemic countries and prolonged treatment period, there are still efforts for finding an effective treatment with less side effects acceptable for patients. In numerous studies, oral zinc sulfate has been reported effective in treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Efficacy of intralesional zinc sulfate is debated in various studies, so that in Sharquie study it has been very effective[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] while in that of Firooz its efficacy has been reported to be inferior to intralesional Glucantime.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Therefore, we decided to compare the effect of intralesional zinc sulfate in treatment of acute cutaneous leishmaniasis with therapeutic effects of Glucantime in this clinical trial study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This randomized clinical trial was performed from March to September 2004 on patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis admitted to Imam Reza Hospital in Mashhad.

</p><p>According to these criteria, 45 patients were studied in two groups of A (treated with intralesional zinc sulfate) and B (treated with intralesional Glucantime). Eleven patients were excluded from the study for various reasons including painful injections,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] the emergence of new lesions,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] the need for systemic therapy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] or failure to complete treatment;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] and finally, 34 patients (including 24 patients in group A and 10 patients in group B) completed the study.</p><p>In order to prepare 2% solution of zinc sulfate, 2 g of dry zinc sulfate was dissolved per 100 ml double distilled water to make the transparent solution with pH=5. In order to sterilize the solution, first the solution was poured in serology glass and put for 20 minutes in 120C autoclave. In the next stage, the solution was passed by syringe through 0.2 &#x003bc;m color filter under laminar hood and transferred to vials of which the cap was sealed by paraffin.</p><p>To ensure a sterile solution, several culture samples were taken from vials for aerobic and anerobic bacteria with negative results. The solution was injected using insulin syringe needles in adjacent intact skin of the lesions with 45 degree angle so that the lesions were indurated and white. The average volume of injected solution per lesion was 0.2-0.5 ml. In group A, in each lesion injection of zinc sulfate was performed twice within 2 weeks. In group B, Glucantime was weekly injected in the lesions for 6 weeks using insulin syringe. The patients were monitored every 2 weeks for 8 weeks, and each patient completed a questionnaire including age, gender, lesion location, erythema size and induration of the lesions data. Rehabilitated lesions were assessed using clinical examination and determination of the induration size and erythema in the lesions. All the lesions were ultimately subject to direct smear.

Due to the side effects of these drugs, lack of cost effectiveness in economic terms, absence of production technology in many endemic developing countries and inadequate efficacy in some cases, the search for effective, risk free and inexpensive drugs is necessary. Considering the fact that Glucantime is the salt of the heavy metal Antimony and inhibits the amastigote growth by stopping glycolytic function and fatty acid oxidation, researchers have turned to consider other less toxic heavy metals such as zinc; and the hypothesis has been proposed that zinc may be effective against leishmania parasite. Zinc sulfate with concentration used in this study has the effect of immune-stimulation,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] and the zinc ion has the ability of protein precipitation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] On the other hand, it has been shown that intralesional 2% zinc sulfate has a high capacity to inhibit leishmania amastigote, and possibly exerts this function through tissue damage and severe inflammatory changes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Zinc also directly affects the enzymatic system of leishmania parasite.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>Zinc can boost Th1-mediated immune responses and help combat intracellular pathogens, and in this way it may be effective against leishmania.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Zinc is an intracellular signal molecule that plays an important role in improving the function of macrophages, dendrocytes and monocytes and cell -mediated immunity that are in turn effective in body defense against leishmania.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Zinc is involved in the determination of structural properties of molecules concerned with connection and entry of leishmania into white blood cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Several studies have shown that the serum zinc level in patients with leishmaniasis has been lower compared to control group;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] and following treatment with Antimony compounds the serum zinc level has increased.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Regarding the above statements, several clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effects of oral and intralesional zinc sulfate in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis.</p><p>Najim <italic>et al</italic> showed that oral zinc sulfate is effective on leishmania parasite both extracorporally and in animal body.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Sharquie <italic>et al</italic> evaluated the effect of different doses of oral zinc sulfate in treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Their results showed that the rate of healing in the group receiving oral zinc sulfate with 2.5 mg/kg/day dose for 31.8&#x000b1;18 days was 89.3%, in the group receiving 5 mg/kg/day dose for 29.9&#x000b1;1.7 days 93.1%, and in the group with 10 mg/kg/day dose for 28.3&#x000b1;1.4 days 96.6%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Sharquie introduced in 2004 a case of disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis treated with oral zinc sulfate with 10 mg/kg/day dose divided to three bouts for 4 months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>In a clinical trial conducted by Sharquie <italic>et al</italic> in 1997, cutaneous Leishmaniasis patients were subject to treatment by intralesional zinc sulfate, Glucantime and 7% sodium chloride solution. Based on the results of this study, 33 out of 38 (84.8%) lesions treated with intralesional 2% zinc sulfate showed complete healing following a bout of intralesional injection, and 94.7% of lesions were completely healed by two times injection within 10-15 days.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Iraji <italic>et al</italic> in 2005 conducted a study to compare the effect of 2% zinc sulfate and intralesional Glucantime in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The rate of healing after 6 weeks in 35 patients receiving Glucantime (6 weekly injections) was 60%, and it was 83.3% in 31 patients receiving 2% zinc sulfate (2 injections with 2-week interval). After weeks 2 and 4 post-treatment, the efficacy of treatment with zinc sulfate was higher than Glucantime (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01), but after 6 weeks no difference between the two groups was observed (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). They concluded that treatment with intralesional zinc sulfate can be the alternative treatment for intralesional Glucantime.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] In contrast, in the study by Firooz <italic>et al</italic> in 2005 in the form of a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial, 31 cutaneous leishmaniasis lesions were treated with intralesional Glucantime and 19 lesions were treated with 2% zinc sulfate weekly for 6 weeks. A week after the end of treatment, complete healing was seen in 19 lesions (61.3%) in the first group and in two cases (10.5%) in the second group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). It was shown that a 6-week treatment period with 2% intralesional zinc sulfate is less efficient in treatment of Old World leishmaniasis than intralesional Glucantime.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>In our study, like that of Firooz <italic>et al</italic> but more significantly, the rate of healing 8 weeks after starting the treatment in the group treated with intralesional Glucantime was 80%, and was significantly higher than the 33.3% rate of healing in the group treated with intralesional 2% zinc sulfate (<italic>P</italic>=0.009).</p><p>In justifying the differences observed between our study and investigations of other researchers in which zinc sulfate has been indicated the efficient treatment of cutaneous Leishmaniasis, the following points can be cited:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Difference in leishmania species causing cutaneous leishmaniasis in Mashhad, Isfahan and Iraq, and as a result difference in sensitivity of leishmania parasites to zinc sulfate.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Difference in the formulation of zinc sulfate.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Difference in method and frequency of zinc sulfate injection.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Generally, we must say that intralesional Glucantime injection compared with zinc sulfate is more effective in the healing of acute cutaneous leishmaniasis lesions, and pentavalent Antimony compounds make the first-line treatment of acute cutaneous leishmaniasis. In conclusion, we suggest that similar studies be performed with higher sample number, changing injection frequencies and zinc sulfate concentration, determining Leishmania subtype and its sensitivity to zinc sulfate for more precise conclusions.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of
