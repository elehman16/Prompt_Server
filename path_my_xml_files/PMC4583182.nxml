Poor performance in tasks requiring temporal processing, rhythm perception and sensorimotor synchronization seems to be a crucial factor underlying dyslexia in children. Interestingly, children with dyslexia show deficits in temporal processing, both in language and in music. Within this framework, we test the hypothesis that music training, by improving temporal processing and rhythm abilities, improves phonological awareness and reading skills in children with dyslexia. The study is a prospective, multicenter, open randomized controlled trial, consisting of test, rehabilitation and re-test (ID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT02316873">NCT02316873</ext-link>). After rehabilitation, the music group (N = 24) performed better than the control group (N = 22) in tasks assessing rhythmic abilities, phonological awareness and reading skills. This is the first randomized control trial testing the effect of music training in enhancing phonological and reading abilities in children with dyslexia. The findings show that music training can modify reading and phonological abilities even when these skills are severely impaired. Through the enhancement of temporal processing and rhythmic skills, music might become an important tool in both remediation and early intervention programs.</p><sec id="sec001"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT02316873">NCT02316873</ext-link>

Dyslexia can be a severely invalidating disorder per se and is a risk factor for increased internalizing problems, anxiety and school failure which can lead to behavioral disorders, especially during adolescence. Its prevalence can be high, ranging from 3% to 10% [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, intervention is crucial not only to improve academic abilities, but also to regulate social interactions.</p><p>Across languages, children with dyslexia have poor phonological processing skills, leading to a dominant phonological core deficit [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although there are several theories on the causes of this disorder [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], many authors agree that the phonological deficit in dyslexia could be related to a deficit in temporal processing [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. More precisely, temporal processing may be impaired at several interconnected temporal scales. For instance Hornickel and Kraus [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] found that poor readers have more variable neural responses to speech, possibly leading to an impoverished representation of the fine-structure of speech sound (above 600 Hz) containing the formant patterns that are necessary acoustic cues to place of articulation. On a longer time-scale, of the order of tens of milliseconds, Tallal [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] proposed that the phonological deficit in developmental dyslexia could be due to impaired processing of formant transitions characterizing the phonetic distinctive features of some consonants. At an event longer time scale Goswami and collaborators claimed that amplitude modulations in the envelope, ranging between 2 and 50 Hz, may be one of the critical acoustic properties underlying syllable rate and speech rhythm [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Interestingly, Amitay and collaborators [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], using an amplitude modulation detection task, found a deficit at slow (4Hz), intermediate (10Hz) and fast modulations (500Hz), showing that there may not be a deficit at a specific temporal scale. The general hypothesis we address in this work is that music training should boost temporal processing at different time scales and this may have in turn a positive impact on phonological awareness and reading abilities in children with dyslexia.</p><p>Indeed, music training encompasses a wide range of brain functions, going from sound encoding to higher cognitive functions. There is clear evidence that music training induces functional and structural changes in the auditory and sensori-motor systems, which in turn increases accuracy in music-related tasks [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, the fact that music shares several cognitive functions with other human abilities, for instance language, raises the intriguing possibility that musical expertise transfers to other, not strictly musical domains [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138715.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recent data support the view that music training affects speech and language processing. For instance, the group of Nina Kraus has elegantly shown that musicians show a more faithful brainstem representation of linguistic sounds compared to non-musicians. This is reflected, for instance, in a more precise frequency-following response (FFR), finer representation of consonant features [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and greater resistance to response disruption by noise in both adults [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and children [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Functional differences between musicians and non-musicians have also been observed in the auditory cortex, notably with an enhanced activation pattern for musicians when processing pitch contour in music and speech [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], as well as when processing vowels and consonants [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Musicians also perform better when distinguishing consonants based on durational cues such as voice onset time [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], formant transition durations and phrasal lengthening [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. They are also more proficient in speech segmentation [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Some of these findings have also been extended to children. For instance, musically trained children i) are better at detecting pitch and envelope changes in speech, ii) show higher vocabulary and reading abilities, iii) are more efficient in segmenting a new language (i.e. word extraction from a continuous flow of sounds) and iv) show an overall enhanced verbal intelligence compared to children who do not receive music training [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. One recent possible explanation of this cross-domain transfer, is the precise auditory timing hypothesis (PATH) [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. According to this model, the enhanced phonological abilities in musicians would be related to the high degree of precision in audio-motor timing required by music, possibly leading to an enhanced perception of the timing of speech sounds.</p><p>Notably, several of the temporal processing skills that are enhanced by music training are impaired in reading disorders, leading to the hypothesis that reading disability might be linked to a poor temporal resolution of perceptual systems [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. While the evidence of a causal role of music training on reading abilities is scarce [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], several studies have shown that musical perceptual abilities correlate with phonological awareness and reading abilities, and can also be predictive of preschoolers&#x02019; reading developmental trajectories [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. While several researchers have hypothesized that there might be a benefit of music training on reading skills in children with dyslexia, so far supporting evidence is scarce [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Most importantly, this hypothesis has never been addressed using a randomized controlled trial in children with dyslexia&#x02014;rather than children without other confounding comorbidities-and with a sufficiently long training duration [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>We report the results of a randomized controlled trial testing the hypothesis that music training, by improving temporal processing at multiple temporal scales, improves phonological awareness and reading skills in dyslexic children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Participants Recruitment</title><p>All children between 8 and 11 years of age, with a diagnosis of dyslexia, living in the provinces of Trieste and Rome (Italy), who had been referred to the Institute for Maternal and Child Health &#x0201c;Burlo Garofolo&#x0201d;, to Local Health Service (AAS N 1) in Trieste and to the Rehabilitation Center &#x0201c;Villaggio Eugenio Litta&#x0201d; in Grottaferrata, (Rome) during the period from January 1<sup>st</sup>2007 to August 30<sup>th</sup>2011 were checked for eligibility.

Children listened to the metronome using an open headphone at approximately 75 dB and performed the task holding a pencil in their dominant hand and tapping it on a wooden box containing a microphone. They were instructed to tap as regularly as possible and did a short training before the recording to verify that they understood the task. Stimulation and acquisition were run using Audacity 1.3.

Because the aim of the multiple regression was to show which was the best predictor of phonological awareness, both analyses (phonemic blending and segmentation) were run collapsing the two groups to maximize the sample size.

By contrast, the painting group showed a greater improvement in perceptual visuo-spatial reasoning (assessed by the Block Design test). No differences were visible at the level of verbal comprehension or at the self esteem level, showing that group differences were not a mere greater motivational effect of music, but rather specific effects.</p><p>A larger effect of music training was also found when testing auditory attention and in several perception and production abilities as tested by psychoacoustic and musical tasks (<xref rid="pone.0138715.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This was particularly evident for tasks requiring precise temporal processing, such as the temporal anisochrony detection task (a psychophysical measure of temporal regularity perception) and the rhythm reproduction task (<xref rid="pone.0138715.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref>), wherein children had to tap a previously heard rhythmic sequence. The outcome in the rhythm production task turned out to be the best predictor of phonological awareness as measured by the phonemic blending and phonemic segmentation tasks (p&#x0003c;0.001 for both variables, betas = 0.56 and 0.48, respectively). Also the greater the improvement in rhythmic abilities, the greater the improvement in phonological awareness, as measured by the phonemic blending task (p = 0.002, r = 0.45, see <xref rid="pone.0138715.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0138715.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0138715.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Scatter plot of the improvement in the rhythm reproduction task (accuracy After training&#x02014;accuracy Before training) and the improvement in the Phonemic blending task (accuracy After training&#x02014;accuracy Before training).</title><p>The ellipse contains the non-outlying data.

While reading speed improved in both groups, only the music group showed a clear improvement in reading accuracy. This result is important for two reasons. First, our sample consisted of 46 severe dyslexic children in absence of comorbid attention and/or language disorders&#x02014;while indeed our sample was slightly smaller than what suggested on the basis of a pilot test, the power on the final data on the primary outcome was &#x0003e;0.80. Second, by contrast to other studies using a control group without any active engagement [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], the control group received an active training with a recreational component comparable to that of the intervention group. While the motivational effect of a musical activity compared to a control group without any active engagement is certainly high, our results show that children in the two groups did not differ in their appreciation of the activity or in their self-esteem after training. Thus, the transfer effects described here seem to be due to precise neural and cognitive mechanisms that are specifically enhanced by music training.</p><p>The improvement in reading was not limited to text reading but included pseudo-word reading, which is usually quite difficult to train [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and often remains impaired in dyslexic adults [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Reading pseudo-words requires an active grapheme-phoneme conversion, which is a rather complex process. The development of phonological awareness follows a hierarchical progression, from larger to smaller phonological units: whole spoken words&#x02014;syllables&#x02014;onset rhymes&#x02014;phoneme level units of language. The latter is called phonemic awareness and develops following introduction to reading and is affected by the variations in orthographic consistence among languages [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In Italian, phonemic blending relies more on phonological rather than lexical processing, the contrary of what one would expect in less transparent orthographies [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The improvement we observed in the phonemic blending task is thus in line with previous findings showing a tight link between phonological and musical competences [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and a positive effect of music training on phonological abilities in both normal readers [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and pre-schoolers [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Moreover, Kraus and collaborators recently showed that beat synchronization, precise neural encoding in the brainstem and language skills are highly intertwined in preschoolers [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, the best predictor of phonological awareness was not working memory nor auditory attention but rhythmic reproduction. Even further, the improvement in rhythmic reproduction was a good predictor of the improvement in phonological abilities. This supports the hypothesis of a causal role of rhythm-based processing for language acquisition and phonological development [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Moreover, this can also be interpreted within the temporal sampling framework for developmental dyslexia, which has been proposed to account for auditory sensory difficulties and rhythmic impairments often found in children with dyslexia [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>While we did not find a significant correlation between amplitude envelope processing and phonological abilities, as could be expected on the basis of previous correlational research [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], this was possibly due to a lack of sensitivity in some of our tasks. Indeed what is of interest here is not the global performance on a given task, that would be appropriate in a correlational approach, but the more specific improvement of the performance following music training and its relation to improved phonological abilities. For instance, the task measuring metrical perception, adapted from Huss and collaborators [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], did not show any improvement following music training (nor painting training), thus preventing any possible correlation with improved phonological abilities. Nonetheless, metrical structure is a major determinant of the perception of rhythm, which in turn was the best predictor of phonological awareness. Concerning tapping skills and rise time detection, while they did significantly improve after training, this improvement was not different across training groups. Thus, changes in performance are possibly due to maturation and repetition of the tasks. The finding that the rhythmic reproduction task is the best predictor of phonological abilities may be due to the fact that this task is possibly the most complete (and complex) temporal task that we assessed. Indeed, it requires to precisely process temporal anisochronies, temporal envelops (i.e. durations), beat and metrical structure, to store an auditory temporal representation of sounds as well as to have good sensorimotor skills allowing a precise reproduction of the internalized representations.</p><p>Another measure that was significantly affected by music training and that strongly correlated with phonological skills was a measure of temporal anisochrony, namely the ability to detect the temporal regularity of an auditory sequence. As described by the dynamic attending theory, rhythmic perception depends upon stimulus-neural coupling [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Moreover, entrainment can optimize processing resources when events take place at expected moments in time [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In speech, oscillatory neural mechanisms that entrain to the amplitude envelope of ongoing speech are also thought to serve to guide perception and affect sensitivity to relevant speech acoustic features [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Indeed, sound envelope modulations, the building block of speech rhythm, play a major role in speech comprehension in both adults and infants [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138715.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Interestingly, the temporal sampling needed to process rhythm in music and syllables, words and prosody in speech is very much alike and is known to be impaired in persons with dyslexia [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138715.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138715.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. These data and our findings support the idea of a tight and possibly causal [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] link between temporal perceptual accuracy and phonological skills [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138715.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], although further work will be needed to disentangle the different levels of temporal processing and their respective links to speech and reading abilities.</p><p>Overall, we show that music training can have a positive causal effect on specific linguistic abilities that are impaired in dyslexic children. This seems to take place thanks to an improvement in rhythmical and metrical abilities. Training these skills most probably results in improved auditory processing, prosodic and phonemic sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], sequencing abilities, auditory and temporal orienting of attention, and certainly more.</p><p>Importantly, these music training effects do not generalize to all tested competences. For instance vocabulary or mathematical skills did not improve more in the music group. Also, the painting group improved more than the music group in visuo-spatial abilities. Given that the playful and emotionally engaging nature of training certainly played a role, children in both groups equally attended and appreciated training sessions. Thus, music training seems to have a specific effect on those perceptual and cognitive abilities that are shared by music and language.</p><p>Our findings strongly support the hypothesis of a beneficial effect of music training on reading skills and phonological awareness. They also highlight an important role of rhythm on phonological perception and production. Since rhythm and meter, by requiring more precise timing, possibly place higher demands in music than in language [<xref rid="pone.0138715.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], remediation based on music and rhythm may strengthen phonological and language development from a perspective that is quite different from (though complementary to) the more traditional language-based remediation approaches.</p><p>Through the enhancement of rhythmic skills and by means of its emotionally engaging and joyful nature, music might also become an important tool for early classroom interventions for children who are at risk of dyslexia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec028"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138715.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist for a randomised trial.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0138715.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138715.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Ethical Approval.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0138715.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138715.s003"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Research Grant Application.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0138715.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138715.s004"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Clinical Trial Registration Protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0138715.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Giorgio Tamburlini, Johannes Ziegler and Glenn Schellenberg for very helpful comments on a previous version of this manuscript and to Marco Carrozzi, Aldo Skabar and Isabella Lonciari for supporting the project.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0138715.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
