With increasing rates of early onset obesity, children are at the greatest risk for long-term health complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] because the disease is often resistant to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The dramatic increase in obesity prevalence has coincided with increased availability of large portions of high energy dense foods, driving a pattern of overeating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, levels of physical activity both in and out of the everyday school setting have decreased, reducing children&#x02019;s average daily energy expenditure (EE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Typical methods to reduce EI require intentional energy restriction. These methods may be difficult to sustain as a long-term lifestyle change, particularly during childhood when preferences for sweet, salty and fatty foods are high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, alternative strategies are needed that impact EI and EE to improve obesity outcomes in children. Incorporating exercise as a regular lifestyle component may provide an alternative means to control appetite and energy balance throughout the life course.</p><p>The present study aims to understand the acute effects of morning exercise versus rest on daily EI in children ages 9&#x02013;12 years. Exercise not only has a direct effect on energy balance through EE, but has been shown to also have an indirect effect through its impact on EI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Emerging research has implicated the use of exercise as a preventative measure for overeating and subsequent development of overweight and obesity in adolescents and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. While exercise, relative to rest, has been shown to be effective in reducing subsequent EI and contributing to a negative energy balance in adolescents and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], limited research has examined this relationship in children under the age of 12&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Previous work shows that high intensity exercise can induce a state of lower 24-h energy balance by reducing subsequent EI relative to both low intensity exercise and sedentary activity in obese adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This is commonly referred to as the &#x0201c;transient anorexigenic effect&#x0201d; of exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In obese adolescents, the greatest effects of high intensity exercise on EI have been seen seven hours post-exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These changes were seen without any significant differences in appetite ratings. These findings suggest the use of exercise as a possible strategy to decrease EI, at least in the short term, which could augment attempts to intentionally restrict EI.</p><p>Previous studies have focused on the impact of exercise on intake as a treatment strategy in overweight and obese adolescents, but the &#x0201c;anorexigenic effect&#x0201d; of exercise on intake has not been studied in healthy weight children who are at risk for developing obesity due to family history. From a prevention standpoint, it is vital to determine the effectiveness of exercise-related strategies to reduce overeating in children who are predisposed to genetic or environmental factors that promote positive energy balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This study examined the effects of acute imposed exercise versus imposed sedentariness on daily EI in healthy-weight children with at least one overweight or obese biological parent. Based on previous research with adolescent populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], we hypothesized that Total EI and Relative EI (adjusted for Activity-related EE) would be lower on a day with imposed exercise compared to a day where children remained sedentary.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>A within-subjects crossover design study was conducted with a community-based sample of 20 children ages 9&#x02013;12 years.

The baseline visit was a four-hour session in the morning to familiarize children with eating in a laboratory environment (breakfast and lunch) and collect baseline measurements (described below). Outside of meal and exercise testing periods, children had access to a series of toys, books, and games and could switch freely between activities. The EX and SED days consisted of the same four-hour morning session in the laboratory, followed by five hours of free-living time at home, and then an in-laboratory dinner session (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Children and their parents were each weighed and measured twice using a standard scale (Detecto model 437, Webb City, MO) and stadiometer (Seca model 202, Chino, CA) in light clothing and stocking feet.

Children were outfitted with a Polar Heart Rate Transmitter chest strap and wrist unit receiver (Polar Electro Inc. model T31-Coded, Lake Success, NY, USA). Participants remained seated for five minutes while a researcher explained the procedure and instructed the child on the use of the Borg Scale for Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. At the end of the five minute period, a supervising nurse obtained resting heart rate and blood pressure measurements. Children were then familiarized with the cycle ergometer (Lode Corival V2, Lode Holding BV, Groningen, The Netherlands) and completed a three-minute warm-up, followed by the YMCA submaximal cycle test. The YMCA cycle test follows a branching, multi-stage format (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) to determine the relationship between heart rate and work rate in order to estimate the individual&#x02019;s VO<sub>2max</sub>. Children are required to pedal at a constant rate (50&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;rpm) while researchers adjust the resistance (i.e., work rate) on the cycle ergometer at each stage. Heart rate values are recorded every minute, while blood pressure and RPE are measured every three minutes. The test requires that each participant completes two separate workload stages that result in steady-state heart rates between 110 and 150 beats per minute. Steady-state is achieved when two consecutive heart rate values are within &#x000b1;5 beats per minute. VO<sub>2max</sub> was estimated using the graph plot and extrapolation technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Discussion</title><p>The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the effects of acute exercise on daily EI in healthy-weight 9&#x02013;12 year-old children who were at risk for becoming overweight due to family history. Based on previous research on adolescents with obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], we hypothesized that Total EI and Relative EI (Total EI adjusted for Activity-related EE) would be lower on the EX day compared to the SED day. In line with our hypothesis, we did find that Relative EI was 226&#x000a0;kcal lower on the EX day compared to the SED day, indicating a beneficial effect of imposed exercise on children&#x02019;s energy balance over the course of a day. This finding was a result of the fact that children did not significantly adjust their daily EI to fully compensate for differences in activity-related EE between the two days. Participants consumed essentially the same number of calories (within 85&#x000a0;kcal) on the EX day and the SED day, but had greater Activity-related EE (~310&#x000a0;kcal) on the EX day than the SED day. There were small but statistically significant increases in calories consumed from protein (11&#x000a0;kcal) and fat (39&#x000a0;kcal) on the EX day relative to the SED day. In sum, we found that imposed exercise had a beneficial impact on daily energy balance in children who are at risk for becoming overweight by increasing Activity-related EE without a significant increase in subsequent EI.</p><p>In the current study, we looked to extend previous findings in adolescents with obesity regarding the &#x0201c;anorexigenic effect&#x0201d; of exercise on subsequent food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We used a similar design to previous studies to examine the effects of exercise in a younger age group of pre-adolescent children who were at risk for becoming overweight. We found that imposed exercise was effective in reducing Relative EI when compared to the SED day. We did not find evidence of a compensatory response to the exercise bout in regards to children&#x02019;s EI at subsequent meals. Children consumed approximately the same number of calories on both days, demonstrating that they did not adjust their EI to match differences in Activity-related EE between the EX day and the SED day. In other words, the short-term benefits of exercise on EE were not immediately offset by compensatory EI in our sample of healthy weight children. Previous studies in adolescents and adults have shown mixed results for acute post-exercise EI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], which can be attributed to differences in participant characteristics (e.g., lean versus obese) or exercise methodologies (e.g., intensity, modality). Generally, subsequent EI is not greater after exercise relative to rest in healthy populations, whether at a single meal or over the course of a day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Once differences in EE from exercise are accounted for, Relative EI is typically lower after exercise versus a control condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These results, together with ours, suggest that morning moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise may be an effective strategy to prevent positive energy balance in children at risk for becoming overweight, at least in the short term. Additional longer-term studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of structured morning exercise for childhood obesity prevention.</p><p>It is important to note that the timing of the exercise bout relative to the meals can affect subsequent EI, but previous studies disagree regarding the most effective time interval to reduce EI. A recent study in healthy weight adolescent males demonstrated that exercise immediately prior to lunch was more effective in reducing lunch EI when compared to an identical exercise bout approximately 2&#x000a0;h prior to lunch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There are several proposed mechanisms for the effects of acute exercise on appetite and EI regulation. Exercise can act indirectly on energy balance through influences on body composition (e.g., fat and lean mass), gut peptide signaling (e.g., polypeptide YY 3&#x02013;36, glucagon-like peptide-1) and brain responses to food-related cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. These signals, in theory, impact appetite and subsequent food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Given the short half-life of many appetite-regulating hormones, it may be expected that a shorter delay between an exercise bout and a meal is more effective in reducing EI than a longer interval. In the current study, the delay between the exercise bout and the lunch test-meal was approximately 45&#x000a0;min. We did not find a significant difference in lunch EI between the EX and SED days. Other studies have found lasting effects of acute morning exercise on EI later in the day. For example, Thivel and colleagues found that high intensity exercise was effective in reducing intake at a dinner test-meal 7&#x000a0;h post-exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The mechanism for these more sustained effects is unclear, but important to investigate given that obesity prevention requires chronic regulation of energy balance.</p><p>One major methodological difference in our study, versus previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], is that EE was not matched across the two days (EX versus SED). Activity-related EE was controlled during the four hours of in-laboratory time in the morning, but we also allowed children free-living time in the afternoon. This allowed us to test whether children would compensate for the morning exercise by increasing sedentary time later in the day. We did not find any differences in afternoon Activity-related EE between the EX and SED days. In other words, children were not less active following the exercise bout than they were following imposed sedentary time. The lack of a compensatory response in our sample is suggestive of one promising behavioral attribute that could help children maintain a healthy weight. A recent study in overweight boys found that after a vigorous exercise session, the participants spontaneously decreased their physical activity EE during the following 24&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Participation in structured exercise may be a more effective strategy in healthy weight populations with fewer negative consequences on subsequent leisure-time physical activity. A systematic review in healthy adults found minimal evidence that prescribed exercise affects non-exercise physical activity and EE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Further research in children is warranted to determine which characteristics make an individual more or less likely to compensate for imposed exercise.</p><p>This preliminary study represents a novel application of the working model of energy balance in a sample of children at risk for becoming overweight. There are several strengths of this study. First, we have objective measures of daily EI across multiple test-meals during which we were able to assess children&#x02019;s energy intake. Objective intake measures are advantageous compared to self-reported EI, a method which introduces misreporting biases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In addition, identical meals across the two experimental days allowed us to look specifically at the within-subjects effect of the exercise bout on Total EI. Another strength is the inclusion of objective measures of Activity-related EE, both in the laboratory and free-living. Our study was designed to facilitate acclimation to the laboratory environment (research personnel, exercise testing and test-meals) at the baseline visit. This helped to reduce the novelty effect on our outcome variables on the experimental days. Finally, we had a 100&#x000a0;% retention rate and full reported and/or observed compliance with instructions and protocols across the three testing days.</p><p>Some limitations of the current study should be noted. We were not able to assess intake outside of the 10-h experimental day and are unsure whether children&#x02019;s EI differed in the late evening (e.g., dessert) or the following day. While there were no reports of additional food or beverage intake during the free-living period between lunch and dinner, we acknowledge that our compliance rates with food-related study procedures are subject to the biases of self-report. In addition, a few of the differences in intake between the two days were non-significant trends (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.10), including lunch EI (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.06). Post-hoc analyses demonstrated we were underpowered (Power&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.30) to detect differences in intake of individual meals/snack between the two days. It is possible that these differences would be significant with a larger sample size. Our sample was homogenous in demographic characteristics, which limits the generalizability of our findings. In addition, our classification of &#x0201c;at risk for becoming overweight&#x0201d; was solely based on parent weight status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and not inclusive of additional genetic, family or environmental-level factors that can impact energy balance-related behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Future studies may be able to identify more specific phenotypes of obesity risk in the recruitment phase. Finally, this study did not include measures of resting metabolic rate or thermic effect of food. Therefore, we cannot evaluate effects of exercise on total daily EE or overall energy balance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Children in this study did not adjust their EI to match differences in Activity-related EE, resulting in relative positive energy balance on the SED compared to the EX day. Imposed exercise may help children at risk for becoming overweight better regulate their food intake within the course of a day. In order to allow for more personalized prevention strategies, future research is necessary to determine the individual-level child characteristics that are likely to impact the effect of exercise on energy intake in this population.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term><italic>ad lib</italic></term><def><p>
