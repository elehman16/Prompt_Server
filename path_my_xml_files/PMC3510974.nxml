The exclusion criteria of the study were subjects with renal, heart, chronic, metabolic (except diabetes) disease, pregnant and nursing mothers. One hundred diabetes patients who were referred to endocrine clinic during 6 months and were receiving either insulin or oral medication were recruited for this study. Before commencement of the study, patients were asked to fill a consent form, and their 7-day food dietary records were collected to estimate their usual energy intake. Patients were recommended to follow their regular lifestyle and take their medications during intervention.

The reduction in cardiovascular risk factors in poorly controlled diabetic patients in our study was due to weight loss and also low GL of diet.</p><p>Although the poorly controlled diabetes patients had similar isocaloric diet before and during intervention, the low-GI, low-GL diet caused significant weight reduction after 10 weeks of intervention. Several studies have examined the effect of GI on human appetite, and most of them demonstrated increased satiety, delayed return of hunger, or decreased <italic>ad libitum</italic> food intake after consumption of low compared to high-GI foods.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] In contrast, hyperinsulinemia resulting from high-GI food intake may cause weight gain by directing nutrients away from oxidation in muscle and toward storage in fat. In animal study it was shown that hyperinsulinemia elevates glucose utilization in fatty tissue, but decreases utilization in muscles, a process that results in increased food intake and weight gain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] In epidemiological studies, it has been reported that Pima Indian children with increased fasting insulin levels gain more weight than those children having normal insulin concentration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Energy-restricted diet based on low-GI foods produced greater weight loss than did an equivalent diet based on high-GI foods, and among healthy pregnant women, high-GI diet resulted in greater weight gain at term than isocaloric low-GI diet.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] The weight changes found in adult rats fed isoenergic, nutrient-balanced diets based on high-GI or low-GI diet for 32 weeks were significantly different. The low-GI group had reduced weight, while the high-GI group demonstrated increased weight.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] These diets have been reported to be beneficial as they control diabetes, increase HDL-C, lower serum TG,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] and reduce glycated proteins.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] In contrast, consuming high-GI diet and consequently high-GL diet was 4 times greater among women with a higher BMI,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] which may lead to diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Also, the epidemiological studies such as the Nurses Health Study and Health Professional Follow-Up Study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] and also Framingham Offspring Study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] have demonstrated the association between GL and type 2 diabetes, CVD, and metabolic syndrome.</p><p>All the above studies confirm weight reduction in diabetes subjects of our study, following low-GL diet. The present study also gains support from a study in which consumption of an <italic>ad libitum</italic> low-GL diet by obese adults during 6 months resulted in significant body weight reduction which was comparable with conventional restricted energy (250&#x02013;500 kcal/day deficit) diet group (&#x02013;7.8% and &#x02013;8.4% weight reduction, respectively).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] In our study, diabetes subjects with low GL and sufficient energy intake had 4.4% weight reduction during 10 weeks intervention. The low-GL diet in our study may have increased oxidation of nutrients in muscles rather than storing them in white tissue. In addition, the low-GL diet may have elevated satiety and reduced the intake of foods.</p><p>In epidemiologic studies, both GI and the GL of the overall diet were associated with a greater risk of type 2 diabetes in whole adult population and low-GI diet had significant effect on reducing glycosylated proteins.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] The low-GI and low-GL diets independent of weight loss have significant effect on improving cardiovascular risk factors. In a study, <italic>ad libitum</italic> intake of the low-GI diet resulted in a 10% decrease in LDL-C compared with isocaloric high-GI diet after 10 weeks intervention,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] and also <italic>ad libitum</italic> intake of low-GI diet showed a significantly greater mean decline in plasma triacylglycerols than did the conventional restricted diet.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] In our present study, the LDL-C reduced by 4%, while the HDL-C increased by 8%. Beneficial effect of low-GI diet in the management of diabetes is well documented. A meta-analysis showed that after average duration of 10 weeks, subjects with type 1 and 2 diabetes who were consuming low-GI diets had HBA1c concentration of 0.4% points lower than those who were following a high-GI diet.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Comparing low-GI versus high-GI diet, the low-GI diet significantly improved fasting blood glucose and HbA1c of type 2 diabetes.
