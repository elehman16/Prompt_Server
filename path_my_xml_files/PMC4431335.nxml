Early joint inflammation, including synovitis and bone oedema (osteitis), is an important predictor of subsequent structural damage,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;4</xref> and reliable tools are needed for its measurement. MRI can detect early joint inflammation with high sensitivity and without the use of radiation<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and allows earlier identification of joint damage than would be possible using conventional radiographs.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Furthermore, MRI findings in RA are known to be strong predictors of subsequent radiographic progression.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref></p><p>The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials (OMERACT) RA MRI scoring system (RAMRIS) is a validated scoring system for the assessment of synovitis, bone oedema and bone erosion,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> that is, joint inflammation and damage in RA, and changes in synovitis and bone oedema at 12&#x02005;weeks after initiation of anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy have been reported to be significant in several clinical trials.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, no study has yet looked for the earliest time point when an anti-TNF therapy effect on synovitis and other imaging signs of active joint inflammation can be documented. Certolizumab pegol (CZP), a PEGylated Fc-free anti-TNF, is an ideal agent to study the issue, as clinical response is observed as early as 1&#x02005;week following initiation of CZP therapy.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>This is the first report of the MAgnetic Resonance image VErified earLy respOnse on rheUmatoid factor positive arthritiS (MARVELOUS) randomised placebo-controlled study (NCT01235598). The main aim of this study was, by performing MRIs before and after initiation of CZP treatment at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16, to identify the first time point of an MRI-verified response to CZP in patients with RA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>The study population was &#x02265;18&#x02005;years of age with adult-onset RA of between 3&#x02005;months and 15&#x02005;years duration, as defined by the 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Eligible patients had active, moderate-to-severe RA, with three or more tender joints and three or more swollen joints (28 joint count) at baseline, including one or more tender joint and one or more swollen joint in the joint area imaged (unilateral wrist and second to fifth metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints). Inclusion criteria also required that patients had immunoglobulin M rheumatoid factor and/or anti-citrullinated protein positivity, with serum creatinine within normal limits (&#x0003c;4&#x02005;weeks prior to baseline), and stable disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy for at least 12&#x02005;weeks prior to baseline.</p><p>Patients were excluded if they had received more than one previous biological agent, had ever received rituximab or tocilizumab or had treatment with infliximab or abatacept &#x0003c;3&#x02005;months prior to baseline or adalimumab, golimumab or etanercept &#x0003c;2&#x02005;months prior to baseline.

Reproducible positioning was ensured using a custom individualised splint for each hand of each patient in conjunction with the Syn-M-RA positioning device. Wrist and MCP joint regions were scanned separately. Biplanar slice alignment was used.

Secondary endpoints included the difference between change from baseline in OMERACT RAMRIS synovitis score for CZP versus placebo&#x02192;CZP at weeks 1 and 2, and clinical outcome measures including European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) response, ACR response criteria, Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) C reactive protein (CRP) score, Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score and bone mineral density (BMD, as measured by digital X-ray radiogrammetry (DXR)). Additional secondary and exploratory endpoints included the change from baseline in MRI bone oedema (osteitis) and bone erosion scores, and the correlation of synovitis change from baseline at week 16 with EULAR response, ACR response, change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) and change from baseline in hand BMD. Safety variables, including adverse events (AEs) and laboratory parameters, were also assessed.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Due to sparse information concerning MRI-based OMERACT RAMRIS synovitis scores, no formal sample size or power estimates were conducted.</p><p>All endpoint analyses were conducted in the full analysis set (FAS), which included all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study medication and who had a valid baseline efficacy assessment and at least one valid postbaseline efficacy assessment. Safety analyses were carried out using the safety set, which included all patients who received at least one dose of study medication.</p><p>The permutation test for matched pair data was used to analyse change from baseline within the CZP treatment group for synovitis, bone erosion and bone oedema scores at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16. To determine the earliest time point at which a significant change occurred, fixed sequence testing was conducted beginning with the week 16 visit. If the test at week 16 was statistically significant, then the week 8 time point was analysed. Testing was continued in this manner until a non-significant result was obtained. Once a non-significant result was obtained, no further testing was allowed. The time point which corresponded to the last statistically significant result was declared the earliest time point at which OMERACT RAMRIS scores were significantly different from baseline. The change from baseline for synovitis, bone erosion and bone oedema scores are summarised using the exact Hodges&#x02013;Lehmann estimate for median difference (for paired samples) and the corresponding 95% CI.</p><p>The change from baseline for the synovitis scores at weeks 1 and 2 was compared between treatment groups (CZP vs placebo (placebo portion of the placebo&#x02192;CZP treatment group)) using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The Hodges&#x02013;Lehmann estimate for median difference (for independent samples) and 95% CI were computed for weeks 1 and 2.</p><p>Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between change from baseline to week 16 in synovitis score and the following clinical outcomes for the CZP group: EULAR response; ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 responses; change from baseline in DAS28(CRP) score&#x000a0;and change from baseline in BMD as measured by DXR.</p><p>Last observation carried forward imputation was used for synovitis analyses and observed data for all other outcomes.

This allowed systematic investigation of the earliest time point when changes in signs of inflammation can be recognised by MRI. In a sample of only 27 patients with RA, statistically significant improvements in synovitis and osteitis were detected at week 16, but not at week 8. Although differences from baseline were not statistically significant at week 8, a numerical decrease in median synovitis and osteitis scores was also observed at weeks 1&#x02013;8 in patients receiving CZP from baseline.</p><p>At week 16, when high ACR and EULAR response rates were seen, indicating good clinical response to CZP, significant reductions from baseline occurred in two of the inflammatory OMERACT RAMRIS parameters: synovitis and bone oedema. These results are consistent with other studies assessing the effect of RA therapies on MRI outcomes where, despite small sample sizes, therapeutic efficacy can be discriminated in &#x0003c;6&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>The OMERACT RAMRIS synovitis score reflects the volume, or load of inflamed synovium; MRI synovitis has previously been shown to be a responsive measure of inflammation when evaluating anti-TNF therapy in the first year of treatment.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The MARVELOUS study, therefore, shows that CZP reduces the load of inflammatory tissue, as assessed by a sensitive objective measure. This is in line with previous studies documenting the clinical efficacy of CZP.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This study also provides important pathophysiological information, showing that changes in synovitis volume lag behind the clinical effect of anti-TNF therapy, which was already observed after 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;weeks. This could suggest that the immediate clinical effect of CZP is based on other factors than reduction of the synovitis mass, such as reduction in inflammatory cytokines or CRP.</p><p>Nevertheless, this early clinical effect is followed by robust pathoanatomical improvement in synovial inflammatory load&#x000a0;and also in bone oedema, which has been demonstrated to reflect inflammatory infiltrates in the bone (osteitis)<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>

<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In addition, there was no decrease in BMD in either the placebo&#x02192;CZP or CZP groups during the MARVELOUS study, supporting CZP suppression of rheumatoid inflammation.</p><p>Most previous studies investigating the efficacy of biological drugs on MRI outcomes in RA have performed MRIs at 12&#x02013;26&#x02005;weeks, demonstrating significant reductions in synovitis and osteitis.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A recent study of the anti-interleukin 6 monoclonal antibody tocilizumab demonstrated consistent reductions of synovitis at week 12, but not at week 2, where a reduction was only seen in one of the groups.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In the present study, MRI was not performed at week 12. A Spanish investigator-initiated study of the anti-TNF inhibitor etanercept showed a significant reduction of synovitis, but not of bone oedema, after 6&#x02005;weeks of etanercept therapy.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The MARVELOUS study did not reveal a statistical improvement so early, which may be related to the lower initial synovitis and bone oedema scores, or due to the fact that the MARVELOUS study simultaneously evaluated six time points, whereas only two time points were evaluated in the Spanish study.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Reading of MRI data was carried out across all six time points simultaneously, by a reader blinded both to time and treatment arm. The interpretation of these images was challenging, due to the temporal proximity of the time points used (eg, weeks 0, 1 and 2) and the resultant small changes occurring between them. The use of fewer time points (and therefore potentially greater distinctions between them) might have improved sensitivity, which possibly could have led to greater discrimination among images at earlier time points.</p><p>Inter-reader reliability was not assessed in the present study, as a high agreement between M&#x000d8; and other internationally well-known readers has previously been documented.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Instead, intrareader reliability was assessed and was found to be very high. We find it unlikely that assessment of a subset of the patients by another reader would significantly change the results. However, using only a single reader's scores, rather than averaged scores from two independent readers, could have limited the statistical power for detecting small changes.</p><p>It is also possible that more advanced MRI techniques, such as dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, which has previously been shown to be very sensitive to change and closely related to histological signs of inflammation in RA joints,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> would improve the ability to show early change. The issue that only relatively few joints could be examined by MRI, which potentially limits the sensitivity to change of the MRI technique, may in the future be overcome by applying whole-body MRI, which after further technical improvement could provide an &#x02018;MRI joint count&#x02019;.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>This study included a small group of 13 patients treated with placebo for a short period (2&#x02005;weeks), who had MRI repeated twice (at weeks 1 and 2) during the placebo period. The fact that synovitis and osteitis scores did not decrease during placebo treatment has for the first time documented that MRI outcomes are not compromised by any placebo effect, that is, the expectation of the patient to receive effective therapy does not improve synovitis or bone oedema on MRI. This supports the use of MRI as objective measure of RA disease activity.</p><p>In conclusion, this first study with multiple MRIs following initiation of anti-TNF therapy showed reduced OMERACT RAMRIS synovitis and bone oedema scores at week 16. This confirms, in agreement with previous MRI studies of anti-TNF therapies, the effect of CZP on objective measures of synovitis volume and extent of osteitis, that is, on reducing inflammation in synovium and bone. This was observed despite the small sample size and the technical challenges of reading six time points simultaneously. Numerical, but statistically insignificant, reductions of MRI inflammation were also observed at weeks 1&#x02013;8 in patients receiving CZP from baseline. This study provides important information on optimal MRI timing for subsequent trials.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge Matladi N.
