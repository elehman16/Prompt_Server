The objective of this study was to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation in reducing number of acute exacerbation in COPD patients.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>This randomized control trial was conducted at East Medical Ward Mayo Hospital Lahore from January to December 2015 as exacerbations of COPD are season dependent. Diagnosis was confirmed by performing Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs). Basic demographical information was obtained and baseline PFTs of the patient was done. Only Group A patients was treated with oral vitamin D intake of 2000 IU daily for 6 months. Vitamin D level was measured at 0, 2, 4, and 6 months and exacerbation of COPD, FEV1 and FVC was measured weekly. Both the groups were given standard treatment for exacerbation of COPD. Spirometry was repeated at each visit. Blood samples were collected every 2 months for vitamin D.

Control of respiratory tract infection through correction of vitamin D level may result in better outcome in patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Few studies have measured the significance of vitamin D deficiency in COPD by calculating serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-[OH]D), which is the important circulating vitamin D metabolite and recognized as the finest short-term biomarker of entire contact to vitamin D. With disease development, marked by decay in FEV1, patients grow systemic significances and became prone to infectious exacerbations which are precipitated by concomitants vitamin D deficiency.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Deficiency in 25-hydroxyvitamin D is related with emerging risk of infections containing influenza, TB and pneumonia.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> COPD is categorized by permanent expiratory airflow restriction. The disease is intermingled with times of exacerbations that have necessary results for patients and health care providers. Mainly Exacerbations are triggered due to infection.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Of note, low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-[OH]D) levels, reproducing vitamin D status, are related with reduced FEV1, and it is present in 60% to 75% of severe COPD patients.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>According to the Vitamin D Council, vitamin D levels above 30 - 40 ng/mL may reduce the risk of COPD. To reach these levels, most people need to take 1000&#x02013;5000 international units (25&#x02013;125 mcg) per day of vitamin D3, an active form of vitamin D that is produced under the skin. However, they also stress that, because there is considerable variation from person to person, proper dosage should be determined by measuring a patient&#x02019;s vitamin D blood levels before, and several months after, taking vitamin D3 additions or increasing ultraviolet-B exposure.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>An attractive target for intervention studies are particularly for COPD, the vitamin D pathway is due to lack of vitamin that can increase chronic airway and systemic inflammation, decrease bacterial clearance, and urge the chance for infectious exacerbations at the same time.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Our aim was to explore the effect of vitamin D supplementation on COPD exacerbations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>Data was collected after approval of synopsis from ethical committee.

number of acute exacerbation in&#x0201d; COPD&#x0201d; patients. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent amongst patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and comes to be more frequent with increased disease severity. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common preventable and treatable disease, characterized by persistent air flow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response of airways and the lungs to noxious particles or gases; exacerbation and comorbidities contribute to the overall severity in individual patients.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>In our study the mean 25(OH) level at baseline was 24.08&#x000b1;2.58 and at 6th month was 29.60&#x000b1;8.74. The mean FEV1 at baseline was 67.54&#x000b1;5.50 and at 6th month was 78.97&#x000b1;6.94. The mean FVC at baseline was 77.83&#x000b1;5.49 and at 6th month was 91.34&#x000b1;5.52. The exacerbation at baseline was present in all 120(100%) patients and at 6th month it was present in 4(3.3%) patients. Statistically insignificant difference was found between the dyspnea, sputum volume, sputum purulence, cough, fever, common cold, wheezing, sore throat but for exacerbation, the difference was significant. Quint JK reported that 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency is associated with COPD and increased susceptibility to infection in the general population.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Lehouck et al.found that the median time to first exacerbation did not differ significantly between the studied groups, nor did exacerbation rates, FEV1, hospitalization, quality of life, and death.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, a post hoc analysis in 30 participants with severe vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-(OH) D level &#x0003c;10 ng/ml at baseline) showed a significant reduction of exacerbations in the vitamin D group. A recent randomized trial looking at the effect of vitamin D supplementation in patients with COPD did not show a statistically significant reduction in exacerbation rates. A subgroup of patients with very low vitamin D levels did show some reduction in COPD exacerbation rates. In participants with severe vitamin D deficiency at baseline, supplementation may reduce exacerbations.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>According to a recent meta-analysis, the benefits of supplementation were only present when baseline 25-OHD levels are very low (&#x0003c;10 ng/ml).<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> One more study compared the effects of vitamin D and placebo on FEV1 and exacerbation rate in the patients with moderate to very severe COPD. They reported that this dose of vitamin D had not improved FEV1 and exacerbation rate. This difference may be due to the difference between baseline serum vitamin D levels in these studies.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> For COPD, the vitamin D pathway is an attractive target for intervention studies because vitamin D deficiency may enhance chronic airway and systemic inflammation, reduce bacterial clearance, and increase the risk for infectious exacerbations at the same time.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Deficiency in 25-hydroxyvitamin D results from a number of causes and is associated with increased risk of infections including influenza, TB and pneumonia.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> On contrary Rezk et al.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> in their study found a significant improvement in dyspnea scale (p &#x0003c; 0.003), coupled with a decrease in disease exacerbations (p &#x0003c; 0.001) and CRP (p &#x0003c; 0.001) a year after vitamin D replacement. However, the FEV1 and FVC did not differ significantly. One more study by Abolfazl Zendedel et al.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> have reported that after the intervention, there were significant differences in FEV1 and the number of COPD exacerbation between the case and control group patients. Also, after the study, in the case group, FEV1 was increased and the number of COPD exacerbation was decreased significantly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Vitamin D can be beneficial in reducing exacerbations but it exerts this effect when it is taken in adequate amount and moreover for a prolonged period of time. Moreover, not every symptom benefitted with vitamin D replacement. So, further studies should be encouraged with different methodology and design to prove benefits of vitamin D in COPD.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Authors&#x02019;
