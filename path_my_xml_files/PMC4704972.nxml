Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive technology that measures regional tissue oxygenation. NIRS may be used alongside global measures to optimize regional perfusion and reduce organ injury.

By maintaining adequate perfusion through an extracorporeal pump and oxygenator, CPB enables complicated surgical procedures to be performed on the heart. Since its development in the 1950s, refinement of CPB technology has made cardiac surgery safer and widened its availability to increasingly elderly and sicker patients. Perfusion technology remains imperfect, however, and CPB is still associated with significant morbidity [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The pathophysiology of CPB-associated morbidity is multifactorial but includes regional hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia, often within vascular beds, which are already abnormal due to advanced age or comorbidities such as diabetes. Consequently, up to 25% of patients may experience neurocognitive decline [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and up to 25% experience acute kidney injury [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Oxygen Delivery During CPB</title><p>Adequate tissue oxygen delivery during CPB is achieved through the optimization of several parameters including CPB pump flows, perfusion pressure, hematocrit, and the oxygen saturation of arterial blood. In contemporary clinical practice in adult cardiac surgery, the adequacy of perfusion is determined by the following: (1) the use of global measures of oxygen utilization such as the mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>), or (2) evidence of tissue hypoxia as implied by elevated serum lactate, a marker of anaerobic cell metabolism, or other indicators of metabolic acidosis. However, in some patients, particularly those with pre-existing end organ dysfunction, global measures may not detect regional hypoxia [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Direct measures of regional tissue oxygen levels such as gastric tonometry, laser Doppler flowmetry of the intestinal mucosa, or cerebral venous oxygen saturation using jugular bulb catheters can be used to measure and optimize tissue oxygenation. However, these modalities are invasive which limits their use. More recently, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has emerged as a noninvasive and accurate technique to monitor regional tissue oxygenation [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. An added benefit is that NIRS can accurately measure tissue oxygenation in the brain, one of the most important end organs. NIRS sensors, when applied to the forehead, can determine the relative saturation/desaturation of blood within cerebral arterioles and venules. NIRS cerebral oximetry has been clinically validated as a measure of cerebral venous oxygen saturation [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and is now approved as a noninvasive measure of regional cerebral oxygenation by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Several observational and a small randomized trial in adult cardiac surgery [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] have shown that optimization of cerebral oxygenation using NIRS can be associated not only with reduced neurological morbidity but also with a reduction in renal complications and other major adverse clinical events. The wider benefit from optimization of cerebral oxygenation observed in these studies may have arisen because the brain is more susceptible to hypoxia than other organs [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Whereas cerebral oximetry is widely used in pediatric cardiac surgery, the relatively low level of clinical evidence supporting its use in adult cardiac surgery has led to wide variation in its adoption, particularly as it carries additional disposable costs of up to &#x000a3;200 per patient. There is thus a need for high-quality evidence to address the benefits and costs of NIRS cerebral oximetry in adult cardiac surgery patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Indications for Red Blood Cell Transfusion During Cardiac Surgery</title><p>Cerebral oximetry may also be used during CPB to develop goal-directed, patient-specific indicators of the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion if used as part of a wider algorithm designed to optimize cerebral oxygenation. The primary goal of RBC transfusion is to optimize tissue oxygenation. Currently, most RBC transfusions are given solely as a response to a hematocrit that has fallen below an arbitrary threshold and not as a response to incipient tissue hypoxia [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the hematocrit is a poor indicator of regional tissue hypoxia, and therefore is inadequate as an indicator of the need for transfusion.</p><p>The hematocrit below which oxygen delivery to tissues is reduced such that anaerobic metabolism occurs is known as the &#x0201c;critical hematocrit (Hct).&#x0201d; In healthy human adults very low hematocrits of less than 15 can cause organ hypoxia [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and transfusion in such cases is known to be beneficial [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, the Hct for patients during cardiac surgery is unclear; it is thought to be higher than 15, as most patients are elderly and have comorbid conditions, but it is also likely that the Hct varies considerably both between cardiac patients and individual patients over the course of the perioperative period [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Hct is increased by conditions which impair autoregulation such as diabetes or increased age [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and during CPB. Hct is also affected by multiple factors that affect the balance of oxygen supply and demand such as hypothermia [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], rewarming [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], pump flow [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], or perfusion pressure [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Uncertainty about when an individual may benefit from a transfusion is reflected by the wide range in reported hematocrit transfusion thresholds used during CPB (from 17 to 25) [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], as well as the wide variation in transfusion rates in cardiac surgical patients across units in the UK (35-75%) [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Because the Hct for any particular patient at any given time is unknown, the ability to directly measure tissue oxygenation and incipient tissue hypoxia may have distinct advantages over the use of generic and prespecified hematocrit transfusion thresholds.</p></sec><sec><title>Risks Associated With Red Blood Cell Transfusion</title><p>Arbitrary, generic transfusion thresholds can result in patients being undertransfused and overtransfused. In cardiac surgery, unnecessary RBC transfusion has been shown in observational studies to be associated with increased rates of stroke, renal dysfunction, infection, prolonged ventilation times, and death [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], although this was not confirmed in a recently reported TITRe2 randomized trial [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Irrespective of the effects of transfusion on postoperative morbidity, preventing unnecessary blood transfusion would reduce health care costs. Our goal is to develop transfusion algorithms that are objective, patient specific, and directed at optimizing tissue oxygenation and the adequacy of oxygen delivery. We propose that RBC transfusion should be more appropriately given in response to an objective measure of regional tissue oxygenation, as one of a group of interventions, rather than as a response to a generic, prespecified hematocrit threshold in isolation.</p></sec><sec><title>Cerebral Oximetry</title><p>Existing protocols to optimize tissue oxygenation during CPB deploy manipulations of CPB (according to levels of blood markers such as lactate) and the transfusion of RBC (according to the hematocrit). These methods are used independently of each other and in response to generic thresholds, despite the fact that both have the underlying aim of improving tissue oxygenation.</p><p>In this trial we compare alternative algorithms for optimizing tissue oxygenation during CPB (ie, a currently used generic algorithm versus a patient-specific algorithm). The patient-specific algorithm differs from the generic algorithm in two key ways. First, it considers the option to give an RBC transfusion as one element of several linked interventions to optimize regional tissue oxygenation, rather than in response to a predefined hematocrit threshold in isolation. Second, it is &#x0201c;goal-directed&#x0201d; such that the algorithm is specifically targeted to maintain cerebral oxygen delivery during CPB (monitored by NIRS).</p><p>The patient-specific algorithm aims to optimize the cerebral oxygen supply and demand balance during CPB by (1) increasing oxygen supply using hyperoxygenation, increased pump flow, perfusion pressure, or hypercapnic cerebral vasodilation; (2) increasing oxygen offloading by the use of nitrates; or (3) reducing oxygen demand by deepening anesthesia [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Cerebral oxygen saturations approaching a low threshold in the presence of anemia (a hematocrit of 18-23) and despite optimization of other parameters suggest that the cerebral Hct is about to be reached and transfusion is indicated. Therefore, this algorithm is patient and time specific, and goal-directed to optimize a validated objective measure of tissue oxygenation. This could potentially reduce health care costs associated with unnecessary allogeneic RBC transfusions and complications associated with tissue hypoxia during CPB.</p></sec><sec><title> Aims and Objectives</title><p>We aim to compare generic and patient-specific algorithms for optimizing tissue oxygenation during CPB in adult cardiac surgery patients in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Compared to the generic algorithm (including a hematocrit transfusion threshold of 23), we hypothesize that the patient-specific, goal-directed algorithm (based on optimizing regional cerebral oxygen saturation), combined with a prespecified &#x0201c;restrictive&#x0201d; hematocrit transfusion threshold of 18, will result in fewer RBC transfusions and will reduce complications arising from low oxygen levels during CPB. The specific objectives of this multicentre RCT are to (1) compare the effects of the patient-specific, goal-directed algorithm versus the generic algorithm in terms of cognitive function; (2) compare the effects of the patient-specific, goal-directed algorithm versus the generic algorithm with respect to a range of secondary outcomes; and (3) estimate the cost effectiveness of the patient-specific, goal-directed algorithm versus the generic algorithm and describe this in terms of a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This is a multicenter, parallel group RCT of two different algorithms for optimizing tissue oxygenation in adult cardiac surgical patients undergoing nonemergency valve surgery, with or without coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and using CPB at mild hypothermia (32-35&#x000b0;C). The trial is restricted to these patient groups because they have a higher chance of needing transfusion and needing more RBC units transfused than patients undergoing isolated CABG (Trial Registration Number [ISRCTN]: 23557269).</p><sec><title>Trial Population and Recruitment Procedure</title><p>The target population is adult cardiac surgical patients undergoing nonemergency valve or combined CABG and valve surgery using CPB.

In order to detect a small to moderate target difference with 80% power and 5% significance (two tailed), 200 patients (100 per group) are recruited. Specifically, this sample size allows the trial to detect standardized differences between groups of 0.33 (0.36 at 2.5% significance) in cognitive function (adjusting for baseline) and 0.46 in cost, while allowing for up to 12% dropout across the trial. Correlations between measures are assumed to be 0.5 between baseline and postintervention measures and 0.7 between repeated postintervention measures.</p><p>This sample size also allows a standardized difference of 0.3 to be detected for biochemical markers (adjusting for baseline and using 4 repeated measures).

Analyses are based on intention-to-treat and are adjusted for center and surgery (valve or CABG and valve). For the study to conclude that the patient-specific algorithm is superior to the generic algorithm evidence of superior cognitive function for at least one domain at the 2.5% level is required (the significance level chosen to reduce the likelihood of a type 1 error, but not to be as conservative as a Bonferroni correction).</p><p>Health economic analysis are undertaken by the Health Economics Research Centre, University of Oxford. Analyses are designed and conducted to estimate the costs and likely cost of the alternative approaches identified in this protocol.

The analysis calculates the average cost and outcome on a per-patient basis and from this the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the different blood algorithms are derived, producing an incremental cost per-complication avoided. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis are used to demonstrate the impact of the variation around the key parameters in the analysis of the baseline cost-effectiveness results. This examines the impact of changing resource use in particular to help with generalizing the study results to other UK settings. The results are expressed in terms of a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. A single analysis is performed at the completion of the study and no interim analyses and subgroup analyses are planned.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Approval</title><p>The South West Research Ethics Committee approved the trial protocol on June 15, 2009.</p></sec><sec><title>Adverse Events</title><p>Serious and other adverse events are recorded and reported in accordance with the International Conference for Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) guidelines and the Sponsor&#x02019;s (University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust) Research Related Adverse Event Reporting Policy.

To assess protocol compliance, interventions made as part of the patient-specific algorithm are logged. NIRS cerebral saturation monitoring is also conducted on patients allocated to both the generic and patient-specific groups to document whether the intervention resulted in significant separation of mean NIRS values. The NIRS values are carefully concealed from the theater team in the generic group. Surgical, anesthetic, and perfusion staff in the theater cannot be blinded to allocation but every effort is being made to ensure that patients, CICU, and other ward care staff and outcome assessors are blinded to minimize performance and detection bias. To further minimize detection bias, outcome measures are defined on the basis of objective criteria. Data are collected for all patients during surgery to characterize compliance with the randomly allocated transfusion protocol.

Follow-up on all study patients was completed in April 2014. Results are to be published early 2016.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Key Changes to the Protocol</title><p>There have been changes to the protocol since it was first approved in 2009. The study was designed with co-primary outcomes of cognitive function and infectious complications, to measure both the hypothesized benefits of preventing regional (cerebral) tissue hypoxia and a reduction in unnecessary red blood cell transfusion. Evidence available at that time suggested that RBC transfusion was associated with increased rates of infection. However, the TiTRe2 trial [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] found consistent rates of infection with both liberal and restrictive postoperative transfusion thresholds (92% versus 53% transfused, 25% infection rate in both groups with less than 20% due to sepsis). As a result, infective complications was removed as a co-primary outcome and added as a secondary clinical outcome. Similarly, a cumulative infection score, which we had intended to develop using data from the TITRe2 trial by supplementing data on wound infections with data describing the severity of sepsis was dropped. Instead the occurrence of an infectious complication is reported. There have also been changes to the study biomarkers. Urine levels of LFABP and KIM-1 replaced cystatin C and complement activation in blood samples as more sensitive and specific biomarkers for early detection of glomerular and tubular renal injury. Glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferases alpha and pi, novel markers of tubular and glomerular renal injury, were also added but have since been removed after preliminary laboratory test results indicated technical problems with the ELISA kits. The manufacturer was informed of these findings. The blood and urine samples collected were stored for analysis at the end of the trial. The indicated changes have not impacted the integrity of the trial.</p><p>The study was initially designed as a single-center study in Bristol. To increase recruitment rates, after 2.6 years, the study was extended to 2 further centers. At the request of the funder, the sample size was reviewed after 100 participants were recruited. The correlation between baseline and postintervention cognitive function was lower than anticipated when the study was planned (0.5 rather 0.7) and there was a higher than anticipated dropout rate early on in the trial (see the following section). To account for these differences, the target sample size was increased from 150 to 200 participants. The target effect size was unchanged.</p></sec><sec><title>Protocol Compliance</title><sec><title>Perfusion Protocol</title><p>Perfusionists involved in the conduct of the trial are experienced in using NIRS equipment due to its routine practice in pediatric cardiac surgery. However, this trial involves the implementation of a specific and more complex NIRS protocol in addition to the routine clinical duties. Therefore, compliance of this protocol is carefully monitored. For each participant, the trial coordinator sets up the NIRS equipment in an anesthetic room and highlights the procedures involved in the generic and patient-specific algorithms prior to handing over the treatment allocation in a sealed envelope. Training sessions and meetings are arranged throughout the conduct of the trial. In order to develop an effective relationship with the perfusionist team the same 3 coordinators are involved with the set up of the NIRS equipment.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood and Urine Sample Collection</title><p>This trial involves the collection of urine samples at 4 time points and blood samples at 6 time points. These samples are predominately taken by ward staff and analyzed by scientists who have no other involvement in the trial. To make sure all samples are taken in a timely fashion we hold regular teaching sessions with ward staff and have created a sample checklist for them to complete. Research nurses and trial coordinators visit the wards throughout the day to check that all samples are up to date. To reduce the likelihood of sample misplacement, an electronic sample log linked to the freezer where the study samples are stored was developed to indicate the exact location of each study sample within the freezer.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Challenges to Recruitment and Retention of Participants</title><p>Since the protocol was written a few measures have been introduced to help with the recruitment and retention of trial participants.</p><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>When recruitment began, potential patients were identified from operating lists and then sent information by mail or fax. Approach and consent took place once patients arrived in the hospital for their operation. Short periods between patients receiving trial information and operation dates resulted in a number of patients refusing consent. During the course of the study, the Bristol Heart Institute introduced a day of surgery admission (DOSA) policy to maximize bed space. DOSA patients attend the hospital for a short visit the day before surgery to give consent for their procedure and undertake routine clinical tests. They then return for their surgery the following day. Around 50% of patients are now DOSA, thus limiting the amount of time to enroll patients on to the trial, conduct neurocognitive assessments, and take trial samples. To help with recruitment, ethical approval was obtained to approach and consent patients at the preassessment clinic. The pathway that most of our elective patients now follow is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Since approaching patients earlier in their care pathway, only 3.3% (4/120) of eligible patients have refused consent due to insufficient time to consider the study compared to 11% (8/70) who previously refused on these grounds.</p><fig id="figure1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Patient recruitment pathway since February 2011.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="resprot_v4i4e137_fig1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Retention</title><p>The trial requires patients to undergo neurocognitive tests at 3 time points: preoperatively, 5 days after surgery, and 3 months after surgery. These tests can be taxing and each assessment takes up to 90 minutes. As such, patients can become anxious about their performance and this may result in them refusing to complete all of the assessments. For consistency, all staff at the participating sites need to administer tests in the same way. All research team members are trained by the same chartered neuropsychologist and clinical trial co-ordinator. A core part of the training centers on an awareness of patient sensitivity. Staff are assessed and monitored throughout recruitment period.</p><p>After discharge, patients may decide they do not wish to come back to the hospital for the 3-month follow-up assessments because they may find it too stressful or may not want to travel. Therefore, where possible, we try to schedule the follow-ups with routine postoperative hospital outpatient appointments. In May 2011, ethical approval was obtained to conduct 3-month follow-up visits at patients&#x02019; homes. Since home visits have taken place, only 1.7% (2/120) of patients have refused to take part in the follow-up compared with 7% (5/70) previously. Putting these strategies in to place has helped us increase recruitment in to the trial, reduce patients lost to follow-up, and collect high-quality outcome data.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The PASPORT trial is part of an NIHR funded blood conservation research program (Grant Reference Number RP-PG-0407-10384) aiming to develop high-quality evidence on appropriate use of blood transfusions in cardiac surgery patients and was supported by the NIHR Bristol Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit.
