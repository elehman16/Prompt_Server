It is characterized by severe chronic anemia, fulminant infections due to functional asplenia, and repetitive painful vaso-occlusive ischemic &#x0201c;sickle cell crises&#x0201d;. The latter are often provoked by infection, fever, pain, dehydration, cold and stress. Ultimately, multiorgan failure develops, accumulating in avascular necrosis of bones, retinopathy, stroke, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension and kidney failure, among others. Life expectancy is set at 45&#x000a0;years of age. Causes of death are multifactorial but often due to organ failure caused by the disease. Overall, the direct and indirect costs of SCD treatment are substantial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>SCD is endemic in Africa, the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea (Morocco, Turkey), the Middle East (Iran, Irak) and the Caribbean region (Surinam, Antilles, Haiti and Dominican Republic). Moreover, carriership is 1:7 individuals from these regions. As more than 11&#x000a0;% of the current Dutch population and more than 50&#x000a0;% of the younger population in the larger cities originates from these non-Western countries, neonatal screening for SCD was initiated by the Dutch government on January 1st 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], aiming to lower age at presentation and to improve timely and adequate patient support. Since neonatal screening was initiated, approximately 60 children with SCD and 800 SCD carriers are born annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Therapeutic interventions for SCD include: infection prevention by prophylactic antibiotics in the younger population, vaccinations, folic acid supplemention, blood transfusions in combination with iron chelation therapy, hydroxycarbamide and antihypertension treatment. An important part of treatment regimens consists of extensive patient education on the importance of: antibiotic prophylaxis, recognition of provoking risk factors for painful sickle cell crises, early disease symptoms and complications, lifestyle modifications as well as the inheritance of the disease.</p><p>Delivering adequate medical care for SCD patients is often difficult due to the fact that most patients present themselves when disease symptoms have already progressed and exhibit poor adherence to medication and medical visits, due to diverse patient related factors which are not easily influenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. An important factor of treatment, and by consequence prognosis, is &#x0201c;self-efficacy&#x0201d;. Self-efficacy is defined as confidence in one&#x02019;s own capabilities to manage illness. Importantly, it is modifiable as shown by various studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. An innovative form of outpatient contact to improve self-efficacy is a protocolized Group Medical Appointment (GMA), in which a protocolized Individual Medical Appointment (IMA; care-as-usual) is incorporated within a group consultation, in the presence of fellow patients and other medical professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of the individual- and group medical appointments</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Group medical appointment</th><th>Individual medical appointment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Number of patients</td><td>6&#x02013;8</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Duration of appointment</td><td>90&#x000a0;min total</td><td>15&#x000a0;min per professional</td></tr><tr><td>Severity of disease</td><td>Various severities of disease</td><td>One severity of disease</td></tr><tr><td>Professionals</td><td>Treating physician, nurse, clinical geneticist, social worker</td><td>Treating physician, nurse, clinical geneticist, social worker</td></tr><tr><td>Clinical examination</td><td>Behind a screen in conference room or in another room (before or after the appointment)</td><td>In physician&#x02019;s office</td></tr><tr><td>Privacy</td><td>Confidentiality protected by the group</td><td>Completely</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>We aim to analyze the effectiveness of GMA versus IMA, in pediatric and adult patients with SCD, in a study with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>We hypothesize that: 1) GMA will improve self-efficacy, adherence, quality of life and the patient-professional relationship in SCD patients as compared to IMA; 2) and that complementary periodic GMA&#x02019;s (four in three years) will be a cost-effective approach to intensify support for these patients, since SCD requires time consuming support by treating professionals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>In this RCT with a parallel design, effects of protocolized GMA versus protocolized IMA (care-as-usual) will be tested in SCD patients, over a three year period, for children and adults separately.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p>Although the natural course of the disease in our patient population differs according to disease severity, the pathophysiology of the disease, alarming signals, lifestyle alterations and mode of inheritance do not differ. The content of the GMA&#x02019;s are applicable to our entire patient population and therefore all patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous SCD are eligible. We will exclude patients with a first visit to the outpatient clinic, patients who cannot communicate adequately due to language difficulties and/or hearing problems or patients who have behavioral problems which will limit group functioning (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12878_2016_58_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The expected study population will consist of: 40 children and 60 adults with all types of SCD (HbSS, HbSC, HbS beta&#x02009;+&#x02009;and 0 thalassemia) from the Sickle Cell Comprehensive Care Center in the Erasmus Medical Center - Sophia Children&#x02019;s Hospital Rotterdam, the Netherlands.</p><p>All patients/parents will be informed about the study and will be asked to provide permission to use the data for research purposes. Then they will be given one to two weeks consideration time.

Monitoring of organ dysfunction is performed by annual laboratory analyses, echocardiography and transcranial Doppler and duplex analysis (1&#x02013;2 times a year), the latter only in children. Consultation visits are also made to various subspecialists, according to protocol (cardiologist, clinical neurophysiologist, ophthalmologist) and when clinically indicated (pulmonologist, gynecologist, neurologist, nephrologist, anesthesiologist, orthopedic surgeon). All patients included in the study will receive a personal dossier in which sickle cell crises, emergency department visits, hospital admissions and blood transfusions are documented. This is of importance as many patients are concomitantly monitored by physicians at other non-academic hospitals. Furthermore, all patients or parents in our comprehensive care center standardly receive extra reminder letters and are contacted prior to appointments by telephone to keep lost to follow-up to a minimum.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention: GMA</title><p>In the intervention group, every other outpatient clinic visit will be replaced by a protocolized GMA. GMA was introduced by Noffsinger and Scott and recently promoted by &#x0201c;Kwaliteitsinstituut voor de Gezondheidszorg (CBO)&#x0201d; in the Netherlands, as an effective option to optimize self- efficacy, adherence, as well as treatment regimen and lifestyle alterations in chronically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. During a GMA, approximately eight patients and their parents/partners are seen simultaneously by the (pediatric) hematologist, during a 1.5&#x000a0;h session. Since it is important to safeguard the heterogeneity of the groups, we will not invite the same patients (and parents) to each GMA, although sometimes there may be overlap. The protocolized standard of care for our patient population consists of two hospital visits per year. Since GMA&#x02019;s have been shown to be effective for the motivated patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], we have chosen not to exceed the two visits to the hospital. Therefore, during this three year RCT, the protocolized GMA will be performed every other six months, leading to a frequency of once a year, with a total of four GMA&#x02019;s and three IMA&#x02019;s in a three year period.</p><p>A chairman trained to supervise a GMA, hosts and facilitates the sessions. Patients consent to confidentiality in each session. Although all components of an IMA are incorporated, a GMA allows more time to discuss disease related topics and psycho-education. In addition, information and social support from fellow-patients can greatly improve self-efficacy and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). GMA is provided for children and their parents (all ages until approximately 16&#x000a0;years of age) by the pediatric team (a pediatric hematologist, a clinical geneticist, a sickle cell nurse and a social worker) and for teenagers (approximately 16&#x000a0;years and older and in transition to the adult hospital) and adults by the adult team (a hematologist, a clinical geneticist, two sickle cell nurses and a social worker).

An economic evaluation will be performed from a healthcare perspective for the period of three years after the start of the intervention. For the calculation of the costs from a healthcare perspective, total medical care costs will be measured (e.g. GMA, inpatient days, professional health caregivers&#x02019; activities, medical procedures). Actual medical costs will be calculated by multiplying the volumes of healthcare use with the corresponding unit prices. Data on resource use will be collected from medical files. The cost price of GMA will be determined with the bottom-up micro-costing method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], which is based on a detailed assessment of all resources used. Therefore, costs for all separate actions and time used by all individual healthcare professionals will be measured. For the calculation of other medical costs, we will use charges as published in Dutch guidelines as a proxy of real costs.
