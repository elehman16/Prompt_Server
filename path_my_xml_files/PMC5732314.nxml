Several interventions delivered during antenatal care have been shown to improve maternal and newborn outcomes, but stockouts of medical supplies at point of care can prevent implementation of these services. We aimed to evaluate whether a supply chain strategy based on the provision of kits could improve quality of care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We did a pragmatic, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised controlled trial at ten antenatal care clinics in Mozambique. Clinics were eligible if they were not already implementing the proposed antenatal care package; they served at least 200 new pregnant women per year; they had Maternal and Child Health (MCH) nurses; and they were willing to participate. All women attending antenatal care visits at the participating clinics were included in the trial. Participating clinics were randomly assigned to shift from control to intervention on prespecified start dates. The intervention involved four components (kits with medical supplies, a cupboard to store these supplies, a tracking sheet to monitor stocks, and a one-day training session). The primary outcomes were the proportion of women screened for anaemia and proteinuria, and the proportion of women who received mebendazole in the first antenatal care visit. The intervention was delivered under routine care conditions, and analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. This trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, number PACTR201306000550192.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between March, 2014, and January, 2016, 218&#x02008;277 antenatal care visits were registered, with 68&#x02008;598 first and 149&#x02008;679 follow-up visits. We found significant improvements in all three primary outcomes. In first visits, 5519 (14&#x000b7;6%) of 37&#x02008;826 women were screened for anaemia in the control period, compared with 30&#x02008;057 (97&#x000b7;7%) of 30&#x02008;772 in the intervention period (adjusted odds ratio 832&#x000b7;40; 99% CI 666&#x000b7;81&#x02013;1039&#x000b7;11; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001); 3739 (9&#x000b7;9%) of 37&#x02008;826 women were screened for proteinuria in the control period, compared with 29&#x02008;874 (97&#x000b7;1%) of 30&#x02008;772 in the intervention period (1875&#x000b7;18; 1447&#x000b7;56&#x02013;2429&#x000b7;11; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001); and 17&#x02008;926 (51&#x000b7;4%) of 34&#x02008;842 received mebendazole in the control period, compared with 24&#x02008;960 (88&#x000b7;2%) of 28&#x02008;294 in the intervention period (1&#x000b7;88; 1&#x000b7;70&#x02013;2&#x000b7;09; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001).

For any antenatal care visit, the required set of health interventions is often delivered at several physical locations and requires multiple appointments, resulting in long waiting times and several visits to the facility.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p><p id="para110"><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p id="para120"><bold>Evidence before the study</bold></p><p id="para130">Maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity remain unacceptably high in many low-resource settings. A substantial proportion of these adverse outcomes are preventable as several interventions have been shown to be effective and supported by high-quality evidence. This issue is particularly relevant during the antenatal period, since in many low-resource settings antenatal care visits represent the only opportunity for providing pregnant women with health-care services. However, stockouts of medical supplies at the point of care often prevent implementation of these services. The distribution of supply kits targeted at women, providers, or health facilities has been suggested as a strategy to increase the adoption of evidence-based practices. However, the bulk of the evidence on the effectiveness of these kits derives from observational studies and has focused mainly on clean childbirth and reducing the incidence of infection and its complications, particularly in settings where women give birth at home. Despite the important role of antenatal care and the potential value of supply kits, to the best of our knowledge the delivery of supply kits at point of care to improve the quality of antenatal care visits has not been formally tested. The design of this trial was therefore based on the results of formative research that aimed to understand the barriers that hinder health practitioners' ability or willingness to implement evidence-based antenatal care practices and on a national needs assessment of maternal and neonatal health.</p><p id="para140"><bold>Added value of the study</bold></p><p id="para150">The results of our stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised controlled trial show that the provision, at point of care, of supplies for evidence-based practices packaged in kits resulted in a vast improvement in the quality of antenatal care compared with the routine system for procurement and distribution of supplies used by the Ministry of Health of Mozambique. The effect was found to be immediate and sustained over time, with negligible heterogeneity between sites. The intervention improved care for the main drivers of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality, including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, anaemia, and maternal infections. The combination of a robust design, large sample size, and large effect size provides a strong level of evidence to support the effectiveness of the intervention, since bias or random error are unlikely to explain these findings. This was a pragmatic trial designed from the ground up to inform policy makers. The study population included all women attending antenatal care visits and the intervention was delivered by available health-care workers under routine care conditions by use of the government antenatal care registration logbooks as a source of data.</p><p id="para160"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para170">Policy makers should consider the use of supply kits to efficiently provide medical supplies at the right time, consistently, and reliably in settings where supply chain deficiencies and stockouts are major barriers to health care.</p></boxed-text></p><p id="para180">With a maternal mortality ratio of 489 maternal deaths per 100&#x02008;000 livebirths in 2015, only 54% of births attended by a skilled birth attendant, and 51% of pregnant women receiving four or more antenatal care visits,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Mozambique needs to develop and prioritise strategies to increase contact of pregnant women with the health system and to improve the quality and integration of antenatal care services. To explore deficiencies and potential solutions for improving antenatal care in Mozambique, WHO and the Mozambican Ministry of Health launched a two-pronged study in 2010.

All clinics were Ministry of Health facilities and provided antenatal care free of charge under the public health system in which patients do not pay for maternal and child health care. All clinics provided the same standard of care in accordance with national Ministry of Health guidelines for antenatal care at health centre level. Two of the clinics (3-Songo and 5-Matola) received some additional resources from non-governmental partners.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Randomisation</title><p id="para230">Clinics were assigned to one of ten start dates by the study statistician via a computer-generated list of random numbers.

Because of the importance of the first antenatal care visit, the trial differentiated between first and follow-up antenatal care visits (visits other than the first). We designed four types of kits: Kit A contained supplies necessary to carry out 100 first antenatal care visits; Kit B contained supplies necessary to carry out 200 follow-up antenatal care visits; Kit C contained urine collection containers; and Kit D contained long-lasting impregnated bednets. For this trial, Kit A and Kit B were procured in the Netherlands and imported as ready-made boxes in accordance with national regulatory importing procedures. Kit C was purchased in Mozambique, and Kit D and antiretroviral drugs were provided through the Ministry of Health. The International Centre for Reproductive Health in Mozambique, the local implementing partner, was responsible for importation, storage, and distribution of the kits. Automatic sphygmomanometers with rechargeable batteries were part of the intervention but were not packed inside the kits because they were a one-time delivery. The full list of the products contained in Kits A and B, and photos of the kits, can be found in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>.</p><p id="para260">Data collection started in March, 2014, in all antenatal care clinics. The first clinic entered the intervention in June, 2014, and the last in December, 2015. The dates of the launches of the intervention in each facility are shown in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>. Before the day of the launch, the local coordination team would be deployed to the clinic for preparation of the intervention. The kits were received, stored, and organised, the cupboard for storage was set up, and the antenatal care room or rooms were rearranged to accommodate changes in patient flow required by the introduction of the intervention. The training session was carried out with attendance of all MCH nurses involved in antenatal care services at the clinic, as well as laboratory and pharmacy technicians. The content of the training is outlined in the <xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text">panel</xref>. On the day of the launch, the nurses would start by addressing the awaiting pregnant women to explain the new system of kits and their contents, the antenatal care practices they were going to receive, the importance of these practices, and the advantages expected. This process was implemented ten times&#x02014;before the launch of the intervention in each facility.</p><p id="para270">An official from the Ministry of Health was actively involved in every step of the trial, including the launches and the monitoring visits. Nurses were supervised by the Ministry of Health in the context of their routine monitoring activities.</p><p id="para280">During the control period, each clinic provided antenatal care according to standard practice and functioned under the regular procurement system. The components of the antenatal care visits were the same in both groups, as per national guidelines (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). The kits contained, among other items, rapid tests for HIV, syphilis, haemoglobin, and proteinuria. Rapid tests for HIV and syphilis were already a routine part of antenatal care services before the intervention, whereas proteinuria and haemoglobin tests were only done at the laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="para290">Ten practices for women attending the first antenatal care visit were initially targeted by the intervention and included in the protocol as primary outcome candidates.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> The protocol prespecified that three among those ten practices would be selected as primary outcomes, on the basis of the analysis of outcome delivery rates with data collected before the implementation of the intervention (ie, in step 1). This analysis was done during step 2 and the results are presented in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>. From the initial list of outcomes, iron/folic acid supplementation and tetanus toxoid administration were excluded before the analysis was done because the information required to compute these variables was not recorded in the antenatal care logbook. Screening for hypertensive disorders was split into its two elements: screening for high blood pressure and screening for proteinuria. These changes led to the final list of nine outcomes that were evaluated for the first antenatal care visits. The full list of outcomes and definitions is provided in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>. Among these nine practices, the three with the lowest delivery rate during step 1 were selected as primary outcomes: screening for proteinuria, screening for anaemia, and treatment of parasitic worms with mebendazole. The other six practices (screening for high blood pressure, preventive treatment for malaria, screening for HIV, treatment for HIV, screening for syphilis, and treatment for syphilis) were selected as secondary outcomes.</p><p id="para300">Secondary outcomes also included delivery of antenatal care practices in follow-up visits. These practices are described in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>. A composite outcome was also prespecified in the protocol.</p><p id="para310">All outcomes were measured with routine data extracted from the antenatal care logbook. Antenatal care nurses are required to register all antenatal care visits and practices delivered in each visit in standardised logbooks provided by the Ministry of Health (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Although the Ministry of Health compiles data from monthly summaries generated by the nurses on the basis of the data in the logbooks, no system is in place for systematic digital storage of this information. Women do not have clinical records, and the logbook was the only source document for the trial. Data management procedures were developed and implemented in all ten participating antenatal care clinics with the purpose of transferring data in the logbook to the data management centre. Nurses were trained in how to complete the logbooks correctly by use of the coding system. Research assistants hired for the trial regularly reviewed the logbooks in each antenatal care clinic, took digital photos of each page of the logbook, and sent them to the data management centre in Maputo.

Importantly, through integration of all essential antenatal care practices, the kits created the necessary conditions for a woman-centred approach, resulting in improvements in antenatal care across practices (all &#x0003e;80% coverage for the whole intervention period). Furthermore, when looking at the effect of the intervention in each clinic and over time, we found a uniform effect across clinics, which was immediate and sustained throughout the entire intervention period.</p><p id="para430">Our simple intervention addressed several limitations of the health system in Mozambique. Packaging of all required supplies and timely delivery of these kits at the clinics addressed weaknesses in the procurement and supply systems.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> With the kits, screening for proteinuria and haemoglobin switched from laboratory testing to rapid testing, which enabled nurses to screen, diagnose, and treat women in a single antenatal care session, thus optimising the scarce contact between these women and the health-care system and ensuring that these women access the full range of recommended interventions.

Vertical, well-resourced HIV programmes are deeply established in Mozambique; we saw that screening and treatment for HIV were two practices with very high baseline coverage, at 90% or more, and therefore little room for improvement as reflected in the non-significant increase, whereas screening for high blood pressure, proteinuria, and anaemia was much less common (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).

We also validated the source data by doing surveys with women leaving antenatal care and doing an audit. Contamination was deemed unlikely because it would imply the improbable transfer of kits between clinics, which were dispersed across the country. Additionally, the kits' stocks were monitored.</p><p id="para470">This was a pragmatic trial designed from the ground up to inform policy makers. The close partnership between the Ministry of Health and WHO, and the ownership and full engagement of the Ministry of Health, catalysed this implementation research, embedded in a real-world setting and driven by the needs and priorities of the country. Consequently, a relevant and practical intervention was designed on the basis of the formative research. The study population included all women attending antenatal care visits, with no exclusion criteria. The intervention was implemented by the available nurses under routine care conditions and regardless of any event occurring in the clinics during the trial period. We used the government antenatal care registration logbook as our source of data and thus the trial did not place additional burden on the health-care providers. To our knowledge, this is the first trial to evaluate an intervention with these characteristics.</p><p id="para480">For all parties involved in the study, scaling up and sustainability were important considerations. Subsequent to the trial, the study partners, including the Ministry of Health, have been engaged in an assessment of the cost-effectiveness and implementation options for scaling up the use of antenatal care supply kits in Mozambique. This information will inform how antenatal care supply kits could be incorporated into the supply chain in Mozambique, including whether the use of other (private) supply solutions would be feasible and cost-effective.</p><p id="para490">Our study has some limitations. The stepped-wedge design can be vulnerable to secular trends if outcomes are already improving. However, the large sample size and large number of steps in this trial allowed us to estimate and adjust for time trends.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> The effect might also be explained by differences in reporting during the intervention period. To avoid this problem, we isolated the data collection procedures from those relating to implementation of the interventions as much as was feasible and implemented strict data management procedures that included several data audits.</p><p id="para500">Although rapid tests for HIV and syphilis were being used in antenatal care before the intervention, the kits introduced two additional rapid tests for proteinuria and anaemia&#x02014;the conditions for which the most substantial increase in screening was observed. The availability of rapid tests for these conditions is likely to have an effect independently of the provision of kits.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Unfortunately, however, in evaluations of complex interventions delivered as a package, disentangling the individual effect of each component is not possible.</p><p id="para510">We could not report on all the initially prespecified secondary outcomes because of limitations in the data collection instrument from the Ministry of Health. Iron and folic acid supplementation and tetanus toxoid administration had to be excluded because the information to compute these outcomes was not recorded in the logbook. Lastly, we did not collect data on final maternal and newborn outcomes, so the overall effect of the antenatal care practices on mortality or morbidity cannot be assessed. However, we only included evidence-based practices for which the benefits have already been clearly established.</p><p id="para520">The health-system and resource challenges underpinning the design of our intervention are undoubtedly not unique to the facilities participating in this trial or to Mozambique.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This study provides crucial information to policy makers in countries with similar supply chain deficiencies but its relevance goes well beyond this obvious target. We believe that this simple intervention could be easily adapted beyond low-resource settings and beyond the area of maternal health. The simplicity and the nature of the intervention make it likely to be acceptable and adaptable across many countries and settings. However, context-specific kits need to be designed. What to include, where to produce and store the kits, and how to distribute these kits to facilities will vary across countries and settings and requires careful analysis to avoid the very same challenges that these kits aim to address.</p><p id="para530">In conclusion, although the evidence-based practices for improving maternal and newborn health are well known, approaches to effectively and sustainably scale up these interventions are urgently needed, particularly in low-resource settings. The results of this study show that a simple intervention focused on the provision, at point of care, of supplies for evidence-based practices packaged in kits resulted in a vast improvement in quality of antenatal care when compared with the routine national system for procurement and distribution of supplies.
