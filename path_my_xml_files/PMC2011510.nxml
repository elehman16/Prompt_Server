Symptom scores were significantly better for patients on nabilone for nausea, retching and vomiting (P less than 0.05). Fewer subjects vomited with nabilone (P = 0.05) and the number of vomiting episodes was lower (P less than 0.05); no patients on nabilone required additional parenteral anti-emetic. More patients preferred nabilone for anti-emetic control (P less than 0.005). Adverse effects common with nabilone were drowsiness (57%), postural dizziness (35%) and lightheadedness (18%). Euphoria was seen in 14% and a "high" in 7%. Erect systolic blood pressure was lower in nabilone patients on Day 1 (P = 0.05) but postural hypotension was a major problem in only 7%. Nabilone is an effective oral anti-emetic drug for moderately toxic chemotherapy, but the range and unpredictability of its side-effects warrant caution in its use.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00422-0036.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="657" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00422-0037.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="658" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00422-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="659" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00422-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="660" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00422-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="661" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00422-0041.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="662" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00422-0042.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="663" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
