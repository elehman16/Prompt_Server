Combined safety data from RCT and OLE are presented. The safety population includes all patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of CZP in either study. Data are presented from time of first CZP exposure until last visit, or patient withdrawal plus 12-week follow-up. Adverse events (AE) and serious AEs (SAE) were assessed at every visit and classified by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) according to the MedDRA dictionary (V.9.0). Exposure-adjusted event rates (ER) and incidence rates (IR) per 100 patient-years (pt-yr) are reported. IRs are presented for AEs typically occurring in individual patients only once (eg, malignancy) with data, including exposure, censored after the first occurrence of a particular event in a patient. IRs do not account for when an individual may remain in the trial after experiencing one or more events of interest (eg, infections) and are therefore only appropriate for AEs of single incidence. As more frequent AEs can occur more than once in individual patients, for completeness, both ERs and IRs are presented for AEs occurring in individual patients more than once. The most frequent AEs (ER&#x0003e;7.0) and SAEs (ER&#x0003e;0.25) are reported.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Efficacy analyses</title><p>Secondary objectives of the OLE were assessment of the continued tolerability, efficacy and effect on physical function and health outcomes of CZP+MTX.</p><p>Efficacy data is reported for two populations: (1) Patients randomised to CZP 400&#x02005;mg or 200&#x02005;mg+MTX in the RAPID 1 RCT who completed the 52-week RCT and enrolled into the OLE (week 52 CZP completers), (2) All patients randomised to CZP in the RCT (CZP intent-to-treat (ITT) population).</p><p>Efficacy data are presented from baseline of the RAPID 1 RCT to 5&#x02005;years CZP treatment (eg, for completers, 52&#x02005;weeks of treatment in RCT followed by 204&#x02005;weeks in OLE).

In this study, patient retention rates were relatively high, highlighting the favourable long-term tolerability profile of CZP, and patient satisfaction with treatment. Retention rates in this study were similar to those observed in other long-term anti-TNF studies.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, as clinical trials represent a highly selected patient population that is closely monitored, care must be taken when comparing retention rates from OLE trials to real-life data, such as registries. The safety profile of CZP remained in line with that observed during the RCT and the rate of AEs decreased over time. There was no increase in the overall rate of serious infections with continued exposure to CZP (IR=4.6) compared to that observed in the first and second years of CZP treatment in this study (IRs=7.3 and 5.4 between 0&#x02013;12 and 12&#x02013;24&#x02005;months, respectively).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The IRs of SAEs and serious infections were comparable to those observed in other long-term TNF inhibitor studies,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref> although direct comparison is difficult due to differences in study populations and methods of recording AEs. The incidence of malignancies did not increase with additional CZP exposure, and was in line with that expected in the general population.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Long-term CZP treatment was not associated with a change in the type or severity of AEs, and no new safety signals were identified.</p><p>Improvements in signs and symptoms, physical function, HRQoL and PROs observed over 52&#x02005;weeks in the RAPID 1 trial were sustained throughout 5&#x02005;years. Despite high baseline disease activity, the proportion of week 52 CZP completers achieving DAS28 (ESR) remission in the study was maintained at approximately one quarter (OLE entry: 24.4%; week 256: 25.2%). Furthermore, measurable improvements in the rigorous ACR/EULAR Boolean remission criteria<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> were observed. However, the mean DAS28 (ESR) score plateaued at approximately 4, an effect previously observed with biologic therapies in established RA, indicating that despite clear benefits with CZP treatment, remission is not achieved in all patients.</p><p>Patients in the CZP ITT population also displayed long-term reduction in signs and symptoms of disease in the OLE. The difference in outcomes between this population and the completer population was greater for ACR response rates than DAS28 (ESR) and HAQ-DI, suggesting that disease state measures may be of more use when assessing efficacy in long-term studies.</p><p>Dose reduction analysis indicated that the registered dose of CZP 200&#x02005;mg Q2W+MTX provides sustained clinical efficacy for over 3&#x02005;years of treatment.</p><p>The patient population and imputation methodology applied in long-terms studies can have a considerable impact on the reported data, and hence on inferences about efficacy.

The ITT population, based on all patients, should also be presented.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In line with these recommendations we have presented data analysed both the CZP RCT completer and ITT populations. As would be expected, ACR response rates and measures of remission are lower in the latter population although, even with this more conservative approach, one fifth of patients achieved DAS28 (ESR) remission after 5&#x02005;years of CZP treatment.</p><p>Long-term comparison of interventions is often complicated by publications which contain either no imputation<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
