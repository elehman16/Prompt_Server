We evaluated the effects of tourniquet use on functional and clinical outcome and on knee range of motion (ROM).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>70 patients who underwent TKA were randomized into a tourniquet group (n = 35) and a non-tourniquet group (n = 35). All operations were performed by the same surgeon and follow-up was for 1 year. Primary outcomes were functional and clinical outcomes, as evaluated by KOOS and knee ROM. Secondary outcomes were intraoperative blood loss, surgical time and visibility, postoperative pain, analgesic consumption, and transfusion requirements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients in the non-tourniquet group showed a better outcome in all KOOS subscores and better early knee ROM from surgery to week 8. No difference was detected at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Postoperative pain and analgesic consumption were less when a tourniquet was not used. Surgical time and visibility were similar between groups. Intraoperative blood loss was greater when not using a tourniquet, but no postoperative transfusions were required.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>This study shows that TKA without the use of a tourniquet results in faster recovery in terms of better functional outcome and improved knee ROM. Furthermore, reduced pain and analgesic use were registered and no intraoperative difficulties were encountered.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Tourniquets are frequently applied in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to ensure less intraoperative bleeding and create a bloodless surgical field, thereby potentially reducing surgical time, improving the quality of cementation, and ensuring long-term implant fixation (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Bannister and Miles 1988</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Rama et al. 2007</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Hing 2010</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Tsarouhas et al. 2012</xref>).</p><p>There are, however disadvantages when using a tourniquet, including thigh pain, nerve palsy, ischemia, soft tissue damage, thromboembolic complications, poor wound healing, and patella maltracking (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Komatsu et al. 2003</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Hing 2010</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Tai et al. 2011</xref>). Furthermore, recovery may be delayed due to reduced muscle strength, reduced knee ROM, and increased pain (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Saunders et al. 1979</xref>). Other studies have shown increased pain and impaired ROM up to 1 year after surgery in which a tourniquet is used (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Abdel-Salam and Eyres 1995</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Ledin et al. 2012</xref>).</p><p>Several randomized controlled trails and meta-analyses dealing with adverse effects of tourniquet use have been published, but disagreement still remains as to whether TKA surgery should be performed with or without the use of a tourniquet (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Hing 2010</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Tai et al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Alcelik et al. 2012</xref>).</p><p>We examined the effects of tourniquet use on functional and clinical outcome and on knee ROM. Furthermore, intraoperative blood loss, surgical time, surgical visibility and difficulties, postoperative pain, analgesic consumption, and transfusion requirements were registered. We hypothesized that the absence of a tourniquet during TKA would improve functional outcomes and increase knee ROM, reduce postoperative pain levels, and reduce analgesic consumption.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="ss1"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted at Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark. 70 primary TKAs were included in the study; they were performed between January 2011 and January 2012.</p><p>Approval from the local Ethics Committee was obtained (approval no.

The envelope was opened when the surgeon was present, in the operating theater before surgery. The patients were unaware of the group to which they were allocated. 33 patients had surgery using a tourniquet (the Tq group) and 31 patients had surgery without the use of a tourniquet (the non-Tq group).

In addition, tranexamic acid (0.5 g) was given 3 h after surgery and cefuroxime (750 mg) was given 6 and 12 h postoperatively. Thrombosis prophylaxis was achieved with use of rivaroxaban (10 mg/day) throughout the hospital stay.</p><p>Both groups had an appropriate-sized thigh tourniquet applied, but it was only inflated in the Tq group. In non-Tq group, it was placed on the thigh but not inflated, thereby serving as a safety device in case of uncontrollable bleeding. In the Tq group, limb exsanguination was done by elevation for 2 min and the cuff was inflated to 250 mmHg. The standard procedure in our clinic is TKA surgery using a tourniquet.</p><p>All knee implants were the NexGen CR-Flex Fixed Bearing Knee (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN) with use of Biomet Refobacin Bone Cement R (Biomet, Warsaw, IN). In all cases, the patella was resurfaced. All surgery was performed by the same surgeon. A midline skin incision and medial parapatellar arthrotomy were applied. An intramedullary guide system was used for the femur and external guides for the tibia. Distal femur holes were plugged with autogenous bone grafts. Cement was applied on the tibia plateau surface, beneath the tibial tray and along the stem. Anchorage holes were drilled into the tibia plateau to increase the contact area between bone and cement. High-pressure pulse lavage was performed to remove blood and provide better cement interdigitation.</p><p>Modern cementing technique was used that involved meticulous pulse lavage of debridement before cement application. A 2-stage cementation procedure was performed. The tibia and patella were implanted first, and then another package of cement was used to fixate the femoral component. This was done to ensure that there was enough time to obtain a careful cementation with proper pressurization. After cementation, further pulse lavage debridement was performed to eliminate cement debris from the wound (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Niki et al. 2007</xref>). Immediately after wound closure, dressings were applied, and the cuff was deflated in the Tq group and removed. The mean operation time was 70 (68&#x02013;72) min for Tq group and 71 (70&#x02013;73) min for non-Tq group.</p><p>Postoperative rehabilitation and pain management followed a standard protocol including full weight bearing, paracetamol, and morphine analogs. Mobilization was allowed on the same evening as the day of operation. Patients received daily functional training under the supervision of physiotherapists until the day of discharge (2 days after surgery).</p></sec><sec id="ss4"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>To evaluate functional and clinical outcomes, KOOS was used (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Roos et al. 1998</xref>). In this validated knee-specific questionnaire, the outcome is expressed as the change in average score from baseline to 12 months for each subscale. Knee ROM was measured by extension and flexion with a goniometer 2 weeks preoperatively as a baseline, postoperatively on day 2, and during follow-up (8 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>At discharge, 90% of the patients had obtained full extension; at 6-month follow-up, all the patients had full extension. Mean preoperative knee ROM was similar in the 2 groups: 108 degrees (95% CI: 105&#x02013;111) in the non-Tq group and 107 degrees (95% CI: 104&#x02013;111) in the Tq group.</p></sec><sec id="ss5"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Pain was assessed using a VAS score (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain) with no distinction between thigh pain and knee pain. Pain was registered at rest, just before surgery and postoperatively after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h on the day of surgery (day 0). On the following days, pain was evaluated during rest and after walking 20 m. The mean of all consecutive VAS scores during the first 3 days was used for analysis. Analgesic consumption was expressed as a mean morphine equivalent during hospitalization, and the consumption was standardized using 10 mg of morphine as reference analgesic dose. Surgical data were recorded regarding blood loss estimation, which was measured by summing fluid volume in suction bottles and the weight of operation swabs. The transfusion policy of the hospital was followed regarding transfusion needs, and patients were transfused postoperatively if their hemoglobin level was 4.5 mmol/L or lower. Surgical time and surgical visibility during the operation were registered by the same surgeon.</p></sec><sec id="ss6"><title>Statistics</title><p>Sample size was based in part on the KOOS score (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Roos et al. 1998</xref>) and in part on earlier studies with knee ROM and surgery with and without a tourniquet (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Wakankar et al. 1999</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Ledin et al. 2012</xref>). A minimum change of 10 points was considered clinically significant. A power calculation was determined to 80%, the confidence intervals were set to 95%, and any p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Data such as KOOS, VAS pain, and other continuous variables that were normally distributed were analyzed with Student&#x02019;s t-test (unpaired). Mann-Whitney U-test was used for continuous variables that were not normally distributed. The chi-squared test was used to analyze categorical variables. Data are presented as mean (SD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical analyses were performed with STATA 11.0.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="ss7"><title>Results</title><p>Patients were similar regarding age, weight, sex, preoperative KOOS score, and radiographic osteoarthritis grade (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table</xref>).</p><sec id="ss8"><title>Primary outcomes</title><p>

They found that tourniquet use for less than 30 min was safe, with no systemic response detectable. In our study, the Tq group had more pain and also a higher requirement for analgesics, which may have been due to the local ischemic conditions caused by the tourniquet and longer surgical time than in arthroscopic procedures.</p><p>We found similar surgical time and visibility in the 2 groups. Control of intraoperative bleeding was not an obstacle. Pre- and postoperative tranexamic acid was given, and during initial surgery the knee was flexed so that further hemostasis was achieved. Surgical time is an objective measure of difficulties caused by impaired visibility; thus, it appears that not using a tourniquet had no effect on surgical visibility. We recognize that our grading of surgical visibility was subjective, although the same surgeon performed all the operations.

This has been established in several studies, where no technical difficulties or difficulties in achieving a dry bone surface have occurred (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Abdel-Salam and Eyres 1995</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Tetro et al. 2001</xref>).</p><p>We registered one case of early tibial component loosening in the Tq group. The patient initially had no symptoms and mobilized well, but the loosening was detected at week 8 on plain radiographs. The implant failure had occurred due to impaired subchondral tibial bone quality caused by a cyst, which had not been recognized before or during surgery. After revision, the new implant was well fixated 1 year later.</p><p>In conclusion, this randomized study has shown that TKA surgery without a tourniquet results in better functional outcomes and improved knee ROM in the early period of rehabilitation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>AE: study design, data collection, statistics, analysis, and writing.
