lives. Frailty is an emerging concept in medicine yet to be explored as a
risk factor in cardiac surgery. When it comes to CABG surgery, randomized
controlled clinical trials have primarily focused on low-risk (ROOBY,
CORONARY), elevated-risk (GOPCABE) or high-risk patients (BBS), but not on
frail patients. Therefore, we believe that off-pump CABG could be an
important technique in patients with limited functional capacity to respond
to surgical stress. In this study, the authors introduce the new national,
multicenter, randomized, controlled trial "FRAGILE", to be developed in the
main cardiac surgery centers of Brazil, to clarify the potential benefit of
off-pump CABG in frail patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>FRAGILE is a two-arm, parallel-group, multicentre, individually randomized
(1:1) controlled trial which will enroll 630 patients with blinded outcome
assessment (at 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years), which aims
to compare adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events after off-pump
<italic>versus</italic> on-pump CABG in pre-frail and frail patients.
Primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction,
cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation, low cardiac output
syndrome/cardiogenic shock, stroke, and coronary reintervention. Secondary
outcomes will be major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, operative
time, mechanical ventilation time, hyperdynamic shock, new onset of atrial
fibrillation, renal replacement therapy, reoperation for bleeding,
pneumonia, length of stay in intensive care unit, length of stay in
hospital, number of units of blood transfused, graft patency, rate of
complete revascularization, neurobehavioral outcomes after cardiac surgery,
quality of life after cardiac surgery and costs.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>FRAGILE trial will determine whether off-pump CABG is superior to

coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) surgery is superior to conventional on-pump
coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. There is an ongoing debate about the
benefits and disadvantages of OPCAB. Initial trials have shown that off-pump CABG is
feasible in selected low-risk patients and offers results similar to those of CABG
performed with the conventional on-pump technique (on-pump CABG)<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. In institutions with experience in off-pump CABG, the rates of
major adverse events and of complete revascularization and graft patency have been
similar to those with on-pump CABG<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. These positive results have been called into question by
reports of inferior graft patency and higher rates of repeat target-vessel
revascularization associated with off-pump CABG<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The Randomized On/Off Bypass (ROOBY) trial<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> showed that, among low-risk patients, the rate of death or
major adverse events at 30 days after surgery was similar with off-pump and on-pump
CABG, but off-pump CABG was associated with a higher rate of incomplete
revascularization at 1 year.</p><p>Short-term mortality and morbidity after off-pump and on-pump CABG were similar in a
recent trial involving 4752 patients with a mixed operative-risk profile (the CABG
Off- or On-Pump Revascularization Study [CORONARY])<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The German Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting in Elderly Patients
(GOPCABE)<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> study focused
exclusively on patients 75 years of age or older. However, this trial would not
elucidate the potential benefit of off-pump CABG in high-risk patients because this
specific group of German patients were moderate risk patients.</p><p>The results of the Best Bypass Surgery (BBS) trial<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>, performed on 341 high-risk patients (European
System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation "EuroSCORE"&#x0003e;5) undergoing on-pump
CABG or off-pump CABG, reported no significant differences in the composite of
adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events or in any of the following outcomes:
all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, low cardiac
output/cardiogenic shock, stroke, and coronary reintervention.</p><p>However, in our opinion, the definition of high-risk patient should be interpreted
carefully, since the EuroSCORE identifies patients based on 18 independent
variables, many of which were not considered in the study. Risk factors such as
previous cardiac surgery, critical preoperative state, emergency operation, and poor
left ventricular dysfunction were excluded. Furthermore, active endocarditis,
pulmonary hypertension, other than isolated CABG, surgery on the thoracic aorta, and
postinfarction septal rupture were not considered due to the nature of the study.
Chronic pulmonary disease and neurological dysfunction were not defined according to
EuroSCORE, and there is no information on patients with unstable angina.</p><p>In the real world, with more than 1500 patients, we showed lower mortality among
patients who underwent off-pump CABG<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. So, after a certain cut-off EuroSCORE &#x0003e; 4.5 or 2000
Bernstein-Parsonnet score &#x0003e;17.75, off-pump CABG significantly reduces death
rates. Indeed, numerous large retrospective studies and meta-analyses have shown
significant short-term improvements after OPCAB and comparable long-term outcomes. A
recent risk-adjusted analysis of the national Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)
database assessing 876,081 patients demonstrated a significant reduction in death
and stroke (11% and 34% reduction, respectively) after OPCAB, seen in both low- and
high-volume centers<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. After
that, it is important to reconsider the best approach for patients with higher
surgical risk for CABG.</p><p>Clearly, a base is being built with strong scientific evidence that this is the group
that experiences the most benefit from off-pump CABG. This evidence allows not using
cardiopulmonary bypass to be the main surgical approach, and complete
revascularization and greater use of arterial grafts in patients with high surgical
risk as the second plan<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Actually, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have failed to demonstrate a
significant mortality benefit for OPCAB<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. However, the available RCTs were underpowered to detect
significant differences between the groups and suffered from high selection and
exclusion biases. Even more important is the fact that the available RCTs so far
have primarily focused only on low-risk (ROOBY, CORONARY), elevated-risk (GOPCABE)
or highrisk patients (BBS), but not on frail patients in whom the benefits of OPCAB
should be well defined. Moreover, the conversion rates (12.4% in ROOBY, 7.9% in
CORONARY, and 5% in GOPCABE) may suggest that some of the participating surgeons
were inexperienced because expert centers report conversion rates between 2% and
4%<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>, which
significantly affects long-term outcomes.</p><p>We believe that avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass should be viewed primarily as a step
toward avoiding aortic manipulation. Despite the long-term benefits of surgery, some
patients may choose percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the treatment of
complex multivessel disease to avoid the morbidity associated with CABG, of which
stroke is the most feared. Expert OPCAB surgeons can offer equivalent durability of
graft patency as in CABG, with a lower rate of stroke if aortic manipulation is
avoided.</p><p>Authors make mistakes in pointing out that on-pump CABG should be able to be
performed under all circumstances, on all patients, at all institutions, regardless
of their cardiac volume<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. Thus,
for example, owing to this rather conflicting evidence, either PCI or CABG surgery
could be offered to patients with chronic kidney disease, depending on the
complexity of coronary disease and comorbidities. If PCI is recommended, appropriate
measures should be employed to prevent contrast-induced worsening of renal function.
If CABG surgery is the preferred revascularization strategy, the off-pump technique
might reduce the risk of acute kidney injury<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>On the other hand, cardiac scores, including EuroSCORE and STS, have been developed
to predict the risk of adverse outcomes following surgery. Frailty, an independent
predictor of mortality and complications, is not included in these risk algorithms.
Emerging evidence suggests that frailty is a better marker of biological age and
more important than chronological age<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. Afilalo et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> determined that
patients with slow preoperative gait speed (&#x02265;6 s to walk 5 m) had a 2 to 3
fold increased risk of mortality and major morbidity for any given level of
STS-Predicted Risk of Mortality or Major Morbidity (PROM) compared with normal
speed. Gait speed added to STS-PROM marginally increased model performance from 0.70
(0.60-0.80) to 0.74 (0.64-0.84). Forty-three percent of patients died or sustained a
major complication assessed as high STS-PROM risk (&#x02265;15%) together with slow
gait speed, compared with 21.7% low STS risk with slow gait and 18.9% high STS risk
with normal gait. Afilalo et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> subsequently evaluated the prognostic value of various
frailty, disability and cardiac risk scores to identify the optimal combination to
predict adverse outcome. Patients with slow gait speed and &#x02265;3 impairments on
the Nagi disability scale predicted in-hospital morbidity and mortality above that
of the Parsonnet cardiac risk score (AUC 0.76 <italic>vs.</italic> 0.72 with
Parsonnet score alone). Lee et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> performed a retrospective review of a large cardiac registry,
comparing outcomes between non-frail and frail individuals (coded as having
deficiencies in the activities of daily living, need for walking aids or diagnosis
of dementia). Frailty was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality
(risk-adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-3.0;
<italic>P</italic>=0.03) and mortality at 2 years (risk-adjusted hazards ratio
[HR] 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.2; <italic>P</italic>=0.01).The benefits of CABG without
cardiopulmonary bypass in pre-frail and frail patients are still undetermined.</p><p>In conclusion, frailty is defined as a geriatric syndrome of impaired resiliency to
stressors (such as cardiac surgery) that has been delineated recently in the
cardiovascular literature. However, the benefits of CABG without cardiopulmonary
bypass in these patients are still undetermined. We believe OPCAB remains an
important technique for the improvement of coronary surgery. The biggest question
right now is whether pre-frail and frail patients will benefit more from off-pump or
on-pump CABG.</p><p>The aim of this paper was to describe the FRAGILE trial protocol which intends to
clarify the potential benefit of off-pump CABG in pre-frail and frail patients; we
will conduct a national multicenter RCT comparing off-pump <italic>versus</italic>
on-pump CABG in frail patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>The FRAGILE study will be a national multicenter RCT to be conducted in 10

not eligible for angioplasty treatment by the heart team approach and those
suitable to undergo either off-pump or on-pump CABG.</p><p>There is a dose-response relationship, in relation to the number of fragility
criteria and patient outcomes. The categorization of the fragility variable was
performed after the studies showed that the risk increases gradually over 3
categories (0-1, 2-3, 4-5), with risk of similar events within each category.

before the study will be between 50-100 off-pump surgeries for the off-pump CABG
surgeons and 250 on-pump surgeries for the on-pump CABG surgeons. It will not be
mandatory for the same surgeon who operates the off-pump CABG cases to also
operate the on-pump CABG cases, but always respecting the established protocols
for each surgical technique.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical Technique</title><p>Surgical access to the heart will be gained through a median sternotomy in all of
the patients. In order to reduce the risk of bleeding and transfusions an
absorbable hemostat is used to sternal bone marrow and recovery of red blood
cells in all patients. Off-pump surgery will be performed with the use of heart
stabilizers. Patients will be heparinized with 250 IU/kg intravenously to
achieve activated clotting time &#x0003e;200s. The proximal anastomosis will be
performed according to protocol to be discussed with our advisor. The distal
anastomosis will be constructed with the help of mechanical stabilizers and
cardiac positioner. Intracoronary shunts will be used routinely. On-pump surgery
will be performed in normothermia, with the use of aortic cross-clamping and
cold cardioplegic arrest. Patients will be heparinized with 500 IU/kg to achieve
an activated clotting time &#x0003e;480 s. Heparin will be neutralized with 1 mg
protamine sulfate per 5000 IU given. During the trial, there will be no changes
in the 2 surgical techniques that followed a pre-established protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Storage, Follow-Up and Outcome Measures</title><p>All variables from the study will be stored online through a REDCap Web Platform
(http://www.project-redcap.org/).The REDCap is a secure web application for
building and managing online surveys and databases. REDCap can be used to
collect virtually any type of data, it is specifically geared to support data
capture for research studies. This will be done through national healthcare
card, address and telephone numbers. On the basis of the registers, it will be
collected copies of hospital records and death certificates during the follow-up
period. The neurocognitive tests will be planned in accordance with the
statement of consensus of assessment of neurobehavioral outcomes after cardiac
surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>We will assess health-related quality of life using the World Health Organization
quality of life questionnaire<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. Neurocognitive and quality of life tests will be carried
out at baseline and at 6 months postoperatively. No follow-up visits will be
planned; however, patients will be routinely seen by the referring cardiologist
1 and 6 months after the operation. Hospital records and death certificates will
be blinded for the allocated treatment and forwarded to 2 randomly selected
members of the adjudication committee, who will assess whether each of the
pre-specified outcomes had occurred. In case of disagreement, the 2 assessments
together with a copy of the record of the event will be sent to a third member,
who will have to select the most likely assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>The Primary Endpoint</title><p>It will comprise mortality rates and complications (allcause death, acute
myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, acute respiratory distress
syndrome and bleeding reoperation) occurring within 30 days of surgery. Hospital
mortality is defined as death occurring within 30 days after surgery. Myocardial
infarction is defined as the appearance of a new Q wave on the electrocardiogram
with an increase of CKMB&#x0003e; 100 IU/L and/or&#x0003e; 10% of the total CK level
and/or new wall movement abnormalities, with the exception of the septum,
documented on the echocardiogram. Neurological complications are defined as
stroke (neurological deficit&#x0003e; 24 hours with positive findings on computed
tomography) or transient ischemic attack (neurological deficit &#x0003c;24 hours with
positive findings on computed tomography). Renal insufficiency is defined as an
increase in plasma creatinine&#x0003e; 2 associated with a urinary output &#x0003c;0.5 mL
kg/h/in 12 hours. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is defined as the
presence of tachypnea (respiratory rate&#x0003e; 30 breaths/min), bilateral pulmonary
infiltrate on chest radiography, severe hypoxemia (arterial oxygen partial blood
pressure/inspired oxygen fraction &#x0003c;200), the need for positive pressure
end-expiratory flow&#x0003e; 5 cmH2O, no evidence of left ventricular failure (wedge
pulmonary capillary pressure &#x0003c;18 mmHg), and no pathological features to
explain these findings. Reoperation for bleeding is defined as the need to chest
reopening in the presence of&#x0003e; 500 mL of blood by the chest tube within the
first hour, &#x0003e;400 mL within the second hour, &#x0003e;300 mL within the third hour,
or total bleeding &#x0003e;1000 mL within the fourth hour.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary Outcome Measures</title><p>

</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The sample size of the FRAGILE trial was based on the ability to detect a 40%
reduction in the primary outcome in the off-pump group compared with the on-pump
group, assuming an event proportion after on-pump CABG of 20.8% and accepting a
risk of type I and II error of 5% and 20%, respectively, and a crossover rate of
5%<sup>[<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. Consequently,
at least 630 patients will be enrolled.</p><p>All of the data will be analyzed according to intention-to-treat
(<italic>i.e.</italic>, based on treatment allocation). Therefore, we will
report treatment-received analyses according to the intervention actually
received. Baseline characteristics and operative characteristics will be
compared with the use of chi-square test, t-test, or Kruskal-Wallis test, as
appropriate. Dichotomous data will be presented as numbers and percentages.
Continuous data will be presented as mean and standard deviation or median and
interquartile range. The continuity corrected chi-square test will be used for
comparison of the 30-day endpoint. Mantel-Haenszel chi-square tests will be used
to adjust for study-center effects. Treatment effects at 30 days will be
expressed as OR and 95% CI. For the 12-month endpoint, Kaplan-Meier curves will
be constructed, and the study groups will be compared with use of the log-rank
test. HR and 95% CI derived from the Cox proportional hazards model will be
provided for the composite outcome and individual components. All statistical
analyses will be performed with the use of the R-3.1.2 language for handling and
storage of data and performing of statistical calculations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The elderly represent the fastest growing group of patients referred for cardiac
surgery, with the proportion of patients aged 75 years or older steadily rising from
16% in 1990 to 25% in most recent estimates<sup>[<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>. Advanced age is frequently accompanied by a larger burden
of comorbid conditions and greater illness severity. In the setting of cardiac
surgery, elderly patients are more likely to have extensive coronary artery disease
and concomitant valvular disease and are more likely to require urgent or emergent
surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Nevertheless, elderly patients have consistently been shown to derive sizeable
benefits from cardiac surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup>.
This risk-benefit dichotomy renders the process of selecting appropriate elderly
patients particularly challenging for the cardiac surgeon.</p><p>Frailty is defined as a geriatric syndrome of impaired resiliency to stressors that
has been delineated recently in the cardiovascular literature<sup>[<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>. In several observational studies
and registry data in which detailed statistical analyses were carried out, mortality
and morbidity have been found to be significantly reduced after off- pump CABG
compared with on-pump CABG in high-risk patients (<italic>e.g.</italic>, patients
with advanced age or cardiac and systemic comorbidity)<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The results of BBS randomized trial are in contrast to these findings. Overall 30-day
mortality in this trial was 4.4%, which was less than the predicted mortality rate
of 7% according to the EuroSCORE but in agreement with the predicted 3.1% according
to the STS risk score. This study shows that the risk patients were overestimated by
the EuroSCORE and this sample will be composed of low and moderate risk patients by
the STS risk score<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In the GOPCABE trial, there was no significant difference between off-pump CABG and
on-pump CABG performed in elderly patients with respect to the composite endpoint of
death, stroke, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, or new renal
replacement therapy after surgery. With a mean age of 78 years and a predicted
in-hospital mortality of 3.8%, the study cohort does not represent a population with
a high operative risk. The results of previous studies are consistent with regard to
high-risk patients<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>.Therefore, this trial does not
support the assumption that off-pump CABG cannot improve the early outcome in
high-risk patients.</p><p>In contrast to the ROOBY trial<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>,
the GOPCABE study did not show a significant difference in survival or major adverse
events at 1 year after surgery. This absence of difference may be a consequence of
the requirement for substantially greater experience with off-pump CABG in the
GOPCABE trial than in the ROOBY trial.</p><p>With the growth of minimally invasive and transcatheter cardiac interventions, the
expansion of risk prediction beyond traditional risk factors and risk scores has
become a high priority. Clinicians may use this integrative approach of combining
risk scores including frailty and disability to better characterize elderly patients
referred for cardiac interventions and identify those who are vulnerable and at
increased risk. A multidisciplinary team involving cardiac surgery, cardiology,
geriatric medicine, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy may be well suited to
address these diverse elements which contribute to postoperative risk<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The CORONARY trial falls short of delivering a knockout victory for the off-pump
technique. There were no significant differences in the rate of the composite
primary outcome of death, stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction or new renal
failure at 30 days between off-pump and on-pump CABG. However, off-pump CABG was
associated with fewer transfusions, reoperations for bleeding, acute kidney injury,
and respiratory infections or failure. Thus, the off-pump technique may be best in
certain subgroups of patients and we must choose the procedure that is best for
them<sup>[<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup>. We hypothesized
that the frailty status would contribute to the risk in patients undergoing on-pump
CABG and that off-pump CABG could be advantageous for frail patients.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Some limitations of our trial are to be noted. Firstly, the assessment of graft
patency will not be performed by coronary catheterization (test which indicated
surgery). In contrast, coronary computed tomography angiogram will be performed
in all patients for this purpose. Secondly, the events will not be adjudicated
by a blinded adjudication committee. All data will be provided by the local
investigators according to the protocol definitions.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026;
