with a Swiss ball on static and dynamic balance abilities in elderly (&#x02265;65&#x02005;years) subjects.
[Subjects and Methods] Twenty elderly subjects with no relevant orthopedic history of a
back condition were selected for trunk stabilization exercises with a Swiss ball
(Thera-Band, USA). The subjects performed these trunk stabilization exercises for 20
minutes, five times per week for 4 weeks. The experimental group (n=10) was blindfolded
during these balance exercises, while the control group control group
(<italic>n</italic>=10) was not. [Results] The experimental group showed significant
improvements in velocity in the evaluation of static balance and in time, total distance,
and left/right movement distance in the evaluation of dynamic balance after the
intervention, whereas the control group showed significant improvements in time in the
evaluation of dynamic balance. A significant intergroup difference was observed after the
intervention for velocity gain. [Conclusion] Exercising with a blindfold stimulates other
senses by blocking visual information, and hence it enhances improvements in balance
ability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Trunk stabilization</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Elderly</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Balance is important for the young and the old, and in the elderly, impaired balance has
been associated with reduced functional ability and an increased risk of falls<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Balance has been defined as the ability to maintain one&#x02019;s equilibrium when one&#x02019;s center of
gravity shifts (dynamic balance), as in walking and running, and when one&#x02019;s center of
gravity remains stationary (static balance), as during standing or sitting<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several neural and biomechanical factors
work together to achieve balance, especially the visual, vestibular, and somatosensory
systems<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Preventive exercises are most commonly used to reduce the risk in elderly individuals with
declining balance ability. In addition, since trunk muscle strength in the elderly is much
weaker than limb muscle strength, function improvements in the lumbar region enhance overall
body function, improve balance and walking ability, and reduce fall risks<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Swiss ball exercise is used as a rehabilitative tool to correct posture and to treat and
prevent pain in the neck and waist, because it can increase muscle strength, endurance,
flexibility, and coordination and be used to improve perceptual balancing ability. Trunk
stabilization exercises with a Swiss ball can also improve core muscle activation and
physical functions, because it enhances balance sense and ability by powerfully stimulating
proprioceptors<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Exercises conducted on uneven surfaces, such as a Swiss ball, can generate more activity
than exercises on even surfaces and are effective for preventing musculoskeletal damage by
improving dynamic balance<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>According to Seo et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, Swiss ball
exercises effectively improve balance ability in elderly women, and Song et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that Swiss ball and resistance
exercises can improve the balance abilities of scoliosis patients.</p><p>However, most exercises are performed without blocking vision, which has been shown to have
great effects on the ability to balance while standing<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, little research has been conducted to determine the
effects of blocking vision on the ability to balance during balance exercises performed with
a Swiss ball. Therefore, we investigated the effects of balance exercises with a Swiss ball
on static and dynamic balance abilities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted on 20 elderly people living in community homes in D city, South
Korea. The study selection criteria applied were as follows: (1) &#x02265;65&#x02005;years old, (2) no falls
within the previous year, (3) the ability to walk independently for more than 10&#x02005;m without
an ambulatory assistive aid or an assistant, and (4) the absence of any disease that might
affect test results. Those with a visual impairment, hearing damage, or a nervous system or
vestibular organ problem and those who were unable to understand the nature of the
experiment were excluded. All subjects were given information on the study, and all provided
written informed consent prior to participation in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p><p>After completing initial assessments, the 20 subjects were randomly assigned to an
experimental group (<italic>n</italic>=10) or a control group (<italic>n</italic>=10) using
preprepared sealed envelopes containing the letters A or B, which indicated the experimental
and control groups, respectively. Randomization was conducted by a third party unaware of
the study content.</p><p>The subjects performed trunk stabilization exercises with a Swiss ball for 20 minutes, five
times per week for 4 weeks. Trunk stabilization exercises were carried out using a
professional exercise ball (Thera-Band, The Hygenic Corporation, Akron, OH, USA). Ball
diameters were chosen on an individual basis so that the subjects&#x02019; heels could comfortably
touch the ground when sitting on the ball. A research assistant demonstrated how to use the
ball<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>One set of trunk stabilization exercises was composed of ten repetitions of five different
routines. Ten sets were completed in each exercise session with a two-minute break between
sets. First, a subject was asked to sit on a ball while lifting one or both arms. Second,
the subject sat on the ball with the feet (soles and heels) on the ground while bending the
hip and knee joints at 90-degrees, and was then asked to maintain the trunk in an upright
position for 20 seconds. Third, the subject performed pelvic tilt (anterior/posterior,
left/right) and rotation exercises. Fourth, the subject placed the ball under his/her trunk
while in a four-point kneeling position and lifted the arms and legs in the following
manner: right arm with left leg and then left arm with right leg consecutively for five
seconds. Fifth, with the subject in the prone position, the ball was placed beneath the feet
and the hips were lifted for five seconds. During these exercise routines, the experimental
group was blindfolded, but the control group was not.</p><p>Balance ability was assessed using times taken to perform routines and using distances
moved from left to right or forwards and backwards, and balance ability scores were
evaluated using a Good Balance System (NCE GB8300, Metitur, Finland). The subjects stood on
the foothold of the device and practiced three times to ensure that the test could be
performed properly, and three repetitive measurements were averaged<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Intergroup differences in general characteristics before the intervention were compared
using the independent t-test. Intragroup comparisons of variables before and after the
intervention were performed using the paired samples t-test. Intergroup comparisons of pre-
to post-intervention differences in were performed using the independent t-test. IBM SPSS
Statistics ver. 20.0 (IBM Corp., Amonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analysis, and p
values of &#x0003c;0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Twenty subjects (experimental group=10, control group=10) completed the experiment.</p><p>The experimental group showed significant post-intervention improvements in velocity in

The present study was aimed at examining the effects of
trunk stabilization exercises using a Swiss ball whilst blindfolded on balance ability in
elderly (&#x02265;65&#x02005;years old) subjects. It was found that both the experimental and control groups
achieved improvements in dynamic and static balance abilities. In particular, the
experimental group achieved a significantly greater increase in static balance ability than
the control group. Static balance ability is defined as the ability to maintain one&#x02019;s
balance on even surfaces, whereas dynamic balance ability is defined as the ability to
maintain one&#x02019;s balance when standing on unstable and/or moving surfaces<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, exercising with a blindfold stimulates other
senses by blocking visual information, and hence improves balancing ability. In a study
conducted by Bonan et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, exercise
with a blindfold was performed by twenty chronic stroke patients. It was found that balance
ability was significantly improved, and this was ascribed to reduced reliance on visual
information and forced use of somatosensory and vestibular senses. These results are in
agreement with the results of the present study. We found that after four weeks of
blindfolded balance exercise, balance ability in our elderly cohort improved significantly
more than after four weeks of non-blindfolded balance exercise.</p><p>Some limitations of the present study warrant consideration. First, the small sample size
may have biased our results, and thus, our findings cannot be generalized to all elderly.
Second, due to the lack of follow-up after the intervention, the durability this
intervention could not be determined. Third, functional measurements were not performed to
determine whether or not a functional benefit was achieved in terms of the activities of
daily living. Therefore, we suggest that additional studies with long-term follow-up
assessments should be performed to evaluate the long-term benefits of trunk stabilization
exercise without visual information.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by a Daegu University Research Grant (2015).</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Fernie</surname><given-names>GR</given-names></name><name><surname>Gryfe</surname><given-names>CI</given-names></name><name><surname>Holliday</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The relationship of postural sway in standing to the
