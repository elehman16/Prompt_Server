According to the posturo-kinetic capacity (PKC) concept, any factor enhancing postural chain mobility and especially spine mobility, may facilitate the development of APA and thus speed performance. &#x0201c;Spinal Manipulative Therapy High-Velocity, Low-Amplitude&#x0201d; (SMT-HVLA) is a healing technique applied to the spine which is routinely used by healthcare practitioners to improve spine mobility. As such, it may have a positive effect on the PKC and therefore facilitate gait initiation. The present study aimed to investigate the short-term effect of thoracic SMT-HVLA on spine mobility, APA and speed performance during gait initiation. Healthy young adults (<italic>n</italic> = 22) performed a series of gait initiation trials on a force plate <italic>before</italic> (&#x0201c;pre-manipulation&#x0201d; condition) and <italic>after</italic> (&#x0201c;post-manipulation&#x0201d; condition) a sham manipulation or an HVLA manipulation applied to the ninth thoracic vertebrae (T9). Participants were randomly assigned to the sham (<italic>n</italic> = 11) or the HVLA group (<italic>n</italic> = 11).The spine range of motion (ROM) was assessed in each participant immediately after the sham or HVLA manipulations using inclinometers. The results showed that the maximal thoracic flexion increased in the HVLA group after the manipulation, which was not the case in the sham group. In the HVLA group, results further showed that each of the following gait initiation variables reached a significantly lower mean value in the post-manipulation condition as compared to the pre-manipulation condition: APA duration, peak of anticipatory backward center of pressure displacement, center of gravity velocity at foot-off, mechanical efficiency of APA, peak of center of gravity velocity and step length. In contrast, for the sham group, results showed that none of the gait initiation variables significantly differed between the pre- and post-manipulation conditions. It is concluded that HVLA manipulation applied to T9 has an immediate beneficial effect on spine mobility but a detrimental effect on APA development and speed performance during gait initiation. We suggest that a neural effect induced by SMT-HVLA, possibly mediated by a transient alteration in the early sensory-motor integration, might have masked the potential mechanical benefits associated with increased spine mobility.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anticipatory postural adjustments</kwd><kwd>gait initiation</kwd><kwd>spinal manipulation HVLA</kwd><kwd>T9 vertebrae</kwd><kwd>range of motion</kwd><kwd>posturo-kinetic capacity</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="73"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="8968"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The coordination between posture and movement is known to be a key factor in motor performance. Gait initiation, which is the transient phase between quiet standing posture and ongoing walking, is a classical model used in the literature to investigate this coordination (e.g., Mann et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>; Breni&#x000e8;re et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Yiou et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Honeine et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). It is composed of a postural phase preceding the swing foot-off, which corresponds to the &#x0201c;anticipatory postural adjustments (APA)&#x0201d;. The postural phase is followed by an execution phase ending when the peak of forward center of gravity (COG) velocity (or speed performance) is reached (Breni&#x000e8;re et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Lepers and Breni&#x000e8;re, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). During these APA, the forward propulsive forces required to reach the peak COG velocity are generated by an anticipatory backward center of pressure (COP) shift. The larger this shift, the greater the speed performance (Breni&#x000e8;re et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Lepers and Breni&#x000e8;re, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). The relationship between APA and speed performance during gait initiation illustrates the biomechanical concept of &#x0201c;Posturo-kinetic capacity (PKC)&#x0201d; (Bouisset and Zattara, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Bouisset and Do, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), according to which the motor performance of any motor task (in terms of speed, force or precision) depends on the capacity of the central nervous system to generate appropriate APA. According to this concept, any factors that would impair (or conversely enhance) APA development may impair (or enhance) the motor performance. This PKC concept was substantiated by experimental studies which investigated the relationship between postural chain mobility, APA and motor performance during various motor tasks such as isometric ramp push (Le Bozec and Bouisset, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), pointing (Lino et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Teyss&#x000e8;dre et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), and more recently, trunk flexion (Diakhat&#x000e9; et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) or sit-to-stand (Diakhat&#x000e9; et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Alamini-Rodrigues and Hamaoui, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Hamaoui and Alamini-Rodrigues, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2017a</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). In these studies, postural chain mobility was varied by changing the seat-thigh contact (Teyss&#x000e8;dre et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Le Bozec and Bouisset, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Diakhat&#x000e9; et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), by increasing the muscular tension along the torso (Hamaoui et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Hamaoui and Le Bozec, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) or by restraining the spine mobility at different levels by means of splints (Alamini-Rodrigues and Hamaoui, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Hamaoui and Alamini-Rodrigues, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2017a</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). These studies showed that the restriction of the postural chain mobility, and especially the spine mobility, has a negative influence on APA and motor performance. Conversely, according to the PKC concept, enhancing the postural chain mobility should have a positive influence on these parameters. Besides this purely mechanical influence, APA associated with stepping initiation are also known to be finely tuned to the continuous proprioceptive (Ruget et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and cutaneous inflow (Do and Gilles, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Ruget et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) arising from the postural body segments. Perturbations of this sensory inflow, e.g., by reducing the plantar support or by vibrating the ankle muscles, have been shown to alter APA and motor performance.</p><p>&#x0201c;Spinal Manipulative Therapy High-Velocity, Low-Amplitude&#x0201d; (SMT-HVLA) is a healing technique applied to the spine that has been used for centuries by healthcare practitioners including Osteopaths, Chiropractors and Physiotherapists to relieve symptomatic patients from acute and chronic low back/neck pain and/or to improve spine mobility (Wiese and Callender, <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). As such, SMT-HVLA may have the potential to improve the PKC and thus motor performance. As stressed in the literature (e.g., the review of Pickar and Bolton, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), a number of sustained changes in the spinal biomechanics have been thought to occur as a result of SMT-HVLA. For example, the impulsive thrust delivered during the manipulation may alter the segmental biomechanics by releasing trapped menisco&#x000ef;ds, releasing adhesions, or by diminishing distortion in the intervertebral disc. In addition, recent studies reported relaxation of paraspinal muscles following SMT-HVLA as revealed with decreased electromyographic (EMG) activity (DeVocht et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Lehman, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Increased spine mobility might result from such changes in the spinal biomechanics and/or EMG activity. Interestingly, this technique is nowadays widely used by healthy athletes (runners, footballers, sprinters etc.) just before a competition in order to reach their &#x0201c;peak performance&#x0201d; (Leonardi, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). However, it must be noted that the effect of SMT-HVLA on the articular free play is still controversial (for review see Millan et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>), with mitigated results on sports performance (Miners, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Shrier et al. (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) compared jump height and running velocity with and without pre-event SMT-HVLA in elite healthy athletes. These authors found that there was no significant effect of SMT-HVLA on the countermovement jump height and sprint times. However, they also stressed that the direction and magnitude of the observed changes were consistent with a clinically relevant performance enhancement. A similar conclusion was stated by Humphries et al. (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) with regard to the immediate effect of lower cervical spine manipulation on handgrip strength and free-throw accuracy of asymptomatic basketball players. These authors reported a slight increase in free-throw percentage, which according to them, deserved further investigation.</p><p>Besides the potential increase in spine mobility, movement kinematics may also be potentially influenced by neurophysiological changes induced by SMT-HVLA. For example, studies on the anesthetized cat have shown that spinal manipulation induced changes in the discharge of somatosensory afferents from the paraspinal region (Pickar, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Pickar and Bolton, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Reed et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), including those afferents innervating muscle spindles, Golgi Tendon Organs and high threshold mechanoreceptors. There are currently no unequivocal data regarding whether SMT-HVLA activates nociceptors. In humans, changes in the sensori-motor pathways following SMT-HVLA have been reported in the literature, but with sometimes contradictory results. For example, studies using the Hoffman reflex (H-reflex) technique indicated that spinal manipulation induced a decreased motoneuronal excitability in asymptomatic subjects (Murphy et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Dishman and Burke, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) and in low back pain patients (Suter et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), while Niazi et al. (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) indicated, on the contrary, an increased excitability. Data collection and data analysis methodology of the H-reflex have been evoked by these latter authors to explain this discrepancy with the literature. At the cortical level, it seems that there exists a consensus concerning the alteration of the sensorimotor processing and sensorimotor integration following spinal manipulation, as evidenced with the somatosensory-evoked potential technique (e.g., Haavik-Taylor and Murphy, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Taylor and Murphy, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Haavik Taylor and Murphy, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; see &#x0201c;Discussion&#x0201d; Section on this aspect).</p><p>As stressed in the literature (e.g., Pickar and Bolton, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), the extent to which these mechanical and neurophysiological responses to spinal manipulation reflect beneficial outcomes (e.g., pain relief or enhanced spine mobility) remains unclear. However, each of these responses has the potential to induce changes in the coordination between posture and movement, which strongly relies on both sensory inputs from the postural limbs and postural joint mobility as stressed above. The present study, therefore, aimed to investigate the short-term effect of SMT-HVLA on spine mobility, APA and speed performance during gait initiation in young healthy adults. We first hypothesized that a SMT-HVLA applied to the ninth thoracic vertebra (T9) will increase the spine range of motion and facilitate APA development in the gait initiation paradigm, which is known to involve spine mobility (e.g., Ceccato et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Second, we also assumed that the various short-term neurological effects of this manipulation may either improve or reduce the PKC and task performance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>The study was a randomized investigation that included 22 right-handed young healthy adults. The non-probability convenience method was used, i.e., participants were randomly assigned to one of the two following groups using the envelope method (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>): 11 participants (six female, five male; 28 &#x000b1; 4 years [mean &#x000b1; SD]; 64 &#x000b1; 8 kg; 169 &#x000b1; 8 cm) were assigned to the HVLA group and eleven participants (five female, six male; 29 &#x000b1; 4 years; 63 &#x000b1; 8 kg; 170 &#x000b1; 8 cm) to the sham group. Participants were blinded to their group allocation. They had no known contraindications to spinal manipulation such as recent history of trauma, known metabolic disorders, inflammatory infectious arthropathies, or bone malignancies. None of them suffered from back pain during the experiment or have suffered in the past months. In addition, participants were all na&#x000ef;ve about SMT-HVLA manipulation. They all gave written consent after having been informed of the nature and purpose of the experiment which was approved by local ethics committees from the CIAMS Research Unit, Equipe d&#x02019;Accueil (EA) 4532. The study complied with the standards established by the Declaration of Helsinki. Our study was assigned the following trial registration number: 2017-002389-34.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study flow diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnhum-11-00343-g0001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Experimental Task and Conditions</title><p>All experiments took place in the Biomechanics laboratory of the Paris Saclay University which is located within the Kremlin Bic&#x000ea;tre Hospital (Paris, France). Physical conditions (room temperature and time of the day) were common to all treatment groups (see below), and also constant before/after the manipulation.</p><p>Participants initially stood barefoot in a natural upright posture on a force plate embedded at the beginning of a 6 m walkway track. The feet were shoulder-width apart, with the arms alongside the trunk and the gaze directed forward to a small target at eye level and out of reach (2 cm diameter, 5 m distant). The locations of the heel and big toe of each foot in the initial posture were marked with sections of adhesive tape placed on the force plate and were used as a visual reference on which participants positioned themselves under the supervision of the experimenters. From the initial posture, participants performed two series of ten gait initiation trials: one just before, and a second one immediately after a specific manipulation (pre- and post-manipulation conditions, respectively) depending on their group (HVLA or sham). All ten trials within each condition were averaged. In these two conditions, participants initiated gait at a spontaneous velocity and at their own initiative following an auditory signal delivered by the experimenter, and then continued walking straight until the end of the track. Participants initiated gait with their preferred leg in all trials. One blank trial was provided in the pre-manipulation condition (not recorded) to ensure that the instructions were well understood by the participant and that the material was operational. The rest time was approximately 10 s between trials. The Range of Motion (ROM) of the thoracic spine was assessed (see description below) for each participant in the HVLA and sham groups immediately before and after the HVLA or sham manipulations (see description below), respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>HVLA and Sham Manipulations</title><p>The HVLA and sham manipulations complied with the 2016 Consensus on Interventions Reporting Criteria List for Spinal Manipulative Therapy (CIRCLE SMT; Groeneweg et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Both manipulation procedures were performed by one of the authors of the present study, an experienced professional physiotherapist and osteopath practitioner with 10 years of clinical experience in his own practice. The practitioner is also a teacher at the Ecole Nationale de Kin&#x000e9;sith&#x000e9;rapie et R&#x000e9;&#x000e9;ducation (France). He has received extensive training in the study protocols and was certified for both thoracic lift manipulation and sham procedure by simulating multiple study visit scenarios overseen by research team members.</p><p>SMT-HVLA was applied to the ninth thoracic vertebra (T9) since this vertebra is described as the &#x0201c;walking vertebra&#x0201d;, a concept arising from the classical article of Wernham (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). This concept is based on the fact that the T9 vertebra is the inflexion point of the curvature change of thoracic cyphosis in lumbar lordosis. This vertebra ensures the junction between the thoracic and lumbar segments, mainly in their counter-rotation movement, especially during walking. In this plane, the center of rotation between the thoracic and the pelvic belts is presumably positioned between L3 and T7 (Konz et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p><p>In the HVLA group, the spinous process of the ninth thoracic vertebrae (T9) of the participant was identified by the practitioner and was marked with a pen. The participant stood upright with the hands positioned on the transverse processes of the selected vertebra with palms facing the back. The practitioner stood behind him/her with the front foot positioned between the participant&#x02019;s feet. The practitioner circled the participant&#x02019;s trunk by passing his arms under his/her armpits, and his chest was in contact with the palms of the participant&#x02019;s hands. From this posture, he applied a single manual rapid horizontal pressure to the T9 vertebrae, followed by a single rapid vertical traction of the vertebral column. This technique corresponds to the standing thoracic &#x0201c;lift-off&#x0201d; technique. Before the manipulation, the practitioner systematically informed the participant that the sound of a cavitation was not a sign of success, and after the manipulation, that the manipulation was successful.</p><p>In the sham group, the experimental protocol was exactly the same as in the HVLA group with regard to the T9 marking, the initial/final postures, and the information given to the participant on the efficacy of the manipulation (positive verbal reinforcement). This guaranteed the blindness of participants with respect to their group allocation. Only the manipulation differed between the two groups. The manipulation used in the sham group corresponded to the &#x0201c;light touch methodology&#x0201d; validated by the North Texas Chronic Low Pain Trial (Licciardone et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In this manipulation, the practitioner did not apply any compression or traction of the vertebral column but solely maintained the above-described posture with the participant for 10 s.</p><p>The HVLA and sham manipulations took place beside the force plate to ensure minimal time between the end of the manipulation procedure and the beginning of the first gait initiation trial of the post-manipulation condition.

The reliability and accuracy of inclinometers in measuring lumbar lordosis and cervical spine flexion and extension ROM have been assessed in previous studies (Lewis and Valentine, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Garmabi et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The measurement of the spine ROM was conducted according to the standard protocol set out in the American Medical Association guide to the evaluation of permanent impairment (Doege and Houston, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Cocchiarela and Andersson, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). The spinous process of the first and last thoracic vertebrae (T1 and T12) and the second sacral vertebrae (S2) of the participant were identified by the experimenter and marked with a pen while the participant stood upright. The inclinometers were then placed on these marks two by two (T1 and T12 or T12 and S2) and were calibrated to zero in this position. The participant was then instructed to perform maximum trunk flexion and extension with legs stretched. Each movement was repeated two times with the inclinometer positioned at T1/T12 then at T12/S2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The mean ROM value obtained in these two trials was computed. For each movement direction, trunk inclination was computed as the difference between the values provided by the two inclinometers (thoracic flexion/extension: T1/T12; lumbar flexion/extension: T12/S2). The thoraco-lumbar flexion and extension were calculated from the sum of the thoracic and lumbar values in flexion and extension, respectively.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Positioning of the two inclinometers for the evaluation of the spine range of motion. <bold>(A)</bold> Inclinometers are positioned over the spinous process of the first and last thoracic vertebrae (T1 and T12, respectively) and are calibrated in this position for the evaluation of the maximal thoracic flexion <bold>(C)</bold>. <bold>(B)</bold> Inclinometers are positioned over T12 and the spinous process of the second sacral vertebrae (S2) and are calibrated in this position for the evaluation of the maximal lumbar flexion <bold>(D)</bold>.

Only the postural dynamics along the anteroposterior axis were considered in the present study as we were mainly interested in the speed performance of gait initiation. Instantaneous COG acceleration was obtained with the ratio [ground reaction forces/subject&#x02019;s mass] following Newton&#x02019;s second law (&#x003a3;F = m&#x003b3;, where &#x003a3;F, the sum of external forces applied to the whole body; m, body mass; &#x003b3;, COG acceleration).

Participants purposely performed series of gait initiation trials before and after sham or SMT-HVLA manipulations. Spine ROM and classical biomechanical gait initiation parameters were compared in the pre- and post-manipulation conditions.</p><p>The results showed that the spine ROM, and especially the maximal thoracic flexion, was larger post-manipulation than pre-manipulation in the HVLA group, which was not the case in the sham group. The mean increase was 20%. The HVLA manipulation applied to T9 had, therefore, a beneficial effect on spine mobility, even in a group composed of young adults with no known spine pathologies. A similar result was found in the sole study to date that tested the effect of thoracic HVLA manipulation on spine ROM (Schiller, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). However, this study only examined right and left thoracic lateral flexion using a goniometer (BROM 2), and the population tested included patients with thoracic back pain. To our knowledge, the other studies focusing on thoracic HVLA measured the cervical ROM, and reported small or no beneficial effects (Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Iglesias et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Suvarnnato et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). These negligible variations have led us to exclude the cervical section from spine ROM measurement.</p><p>SMT-HVLA has been shown to have a beneficial effect on spine-related pain, both clinically and in experimentally-induced pain (for reviews see Millan et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). However, it remains unclear from the literature if it has an immediate noticeable biomechanical effect on spinal motion that can be measured in terms of an increased ROM (Millan et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>). One of the main goals of healthcare practitioners applying SMT-HVLA manipulation is to increase spine ROM, e.g., in athletes before competition or in patients with spine stiffness. A recent review on this aspect emphasized that some studies found spinal manipulation to have limited effect on the ROM, while others found it had none (Millan et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>). These mitigated effects could probably stem from many factors such as the different tools used in research and in clinical practice to measure ROM (single/double/triple inclinometers, goniometers, a rangiometer, tape measures, visual estimation, spine motion analyzer, etc.), the direction, duration and force applied to the participant&#x02019;s spine, the expertise of the practitioner etc. The present study shows that analogical inclinometers may be used to detect an increased spine ROM following thoracic SMT-HVLA.</p><p>Postural mobility, and especially spine mobility, is known to be a key factor of the PKC (Bouisset and Zattara, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Bouisset and Do, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). According to the PKC concept, any factor that may enhance (or conversely, alter) this capacity would favor (or hinder) the motor performance and postural stability. This concept has been substantiated by many recent experimental studies which manipulated spine mobility using various means, e.g., by the application of splints at different levels of the spine (Alamini-Rodrigues and Hamaoui, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), by experimentally-induced trunk muscular tension (Hamaoui et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Hamaoui and Le Bozec, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), or by changing the contact surface between the thighs and seat in the sitting posture (Lino et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Teyss&#x000e8;dre et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Le Bozec and Bouisset, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Diakhat&#x000e9; et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). It has been shown that constraining spine mobility may disturb postural equilibrium when maintaining erect posture as revealed by measuring the COP. In dynamical tasks, such as sit-to-stand (Diakhat&#x000e9; et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Alamini-Rodrigues and Hamaoui, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), maximal isometric ramp push (Le Bozec and Bouisset, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), arm pointing (Lino et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Teyss&#x000e8;dre et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) or trunk flexion (Diakhat&#x000e9; et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) from the sitting posture, facilitating spine mobility has been shown to favor APA development and thus motor performance. Based on the results of these studies&#x02014;and given that spine mobility is known to be highly solicited during locomotion and gait initiation (e.g., Thorstensson et al., <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>; Ceccato et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Cusin et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), APA development and motor performance could have been expected to be facilitated following SMT-HVLA. It is also noteworthy that T9 is described as the &#x0201c;walking vertebra&#x0201d;, a concept arising from the classical article of Wernham (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). This concept is based on the fact that the T9 vertebra is the inflexion point of the curvature change of thoracic cyphosis in lumbar lordosis. This vertebra ensures the junction of the thoracic and lumbar segments, mainly in their counter-rotation movement, especially while walking. As such, the T9 HVLA manipulation is commonly used by healthcare practitioners in patients with locomotor deficiencies. However, its impact on the locomotor function has to date never been evaluated in systematic studies. In contrast to our expectations, APA amplitude and duration decreased following manipulation in the HVLA group, by 24% and 6%, respectively. This was not the case in the sham group, which shows that this result could not be ascribed to a placebo effect. Not only were the APA parameters reduced, but their efficiency (computed as the ratio [COG velocity at foot-off/APA duration]) was reduced (by 23% as compared to the pre-manipulation condition). In other words, the capacity of the postural system to generate forward propulsive forces during the limited duration of APA was less efficient post-manipulation. As a consequence of the lower initial (foot-off) COG velocity, the peak COG velocity (speed performance) and step length both reached lower values post-manipulation in the HVLA group (compared to the pre-manipulation condition, the decrease was 14%, 12% and 11%, respectively). This finding was expected since it is well-known that the two latter step parameters are positively correlated with the amplitude of APA, i.e., the higher the peak anticipatory backward COP shift is, the higher the speed performance and step lengths are (Breni&#x000e8;re et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). Because there was no change in APA parameters post-manipulation in the sham group, step length and speed performance remained the same as in the pre-manipulation condition. Because in the present study, spine mobility was increased following the HVLA manipulation, which is known to be a factor of improved motor performance, the question arises as to why APA development and speed performance were impaired instead of being improved.</p><p>Besides its mechanical effect on spine mobility (for reviews see Pickar, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Millan et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>), SMT-HVLA is known to induce transient changes in the sensorimotor pathways and structures involved in the coordination between posture and movement. As stressed in the &#x0201c;Introduction&#x0201d; Section, studies using the H-reflex technique to investigate the effect of SMT-HVLA on motoneuronal excitability reported controversial findings, i.e., both an increased (Niazi et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and a decreased excitability (Murphy et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Dishman and Burke, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Suter et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) have been found. It seems however that there exists a consensus concerning the effects of spinal manipulation on the sensorimotor processing and integration at the cortical level, as evidenced with the somatosensory evoked potential technique (SEP). Specifically, recent studies reported an alteration of the amplitude of the cortical SEP peaks N20 and N30 following SMT-HVLA (Haavik and Murphy, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Lelic et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The N20 peak is known to represent the arrival of the afferent volley at the primary somatosensory cortex (Desmedt and Cheron, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Nuwer et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Maugui&#x000e8;re, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), while later peaks such as the N30 SEP peak are thought to reflect early sensory-motor integration (Rossi et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; regarding the possible generators of this peak, see Haavik and Murphy, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Lelic et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In addition, studies in the anesthetized cat have shown that spinal manipulation induced changes in the discharge of mechanoreceptors from the paraspinal region, especially group Ia spindle afferents (Pickar, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Reed et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The extent to which the cortical and afferent responses to spinal manipulation reflect beneficial outcomes (e.g., pain relief), remains largely unclear in the literature; however, what is clear, is that these responses have the potential to induce changes in the coordination between posture and movement, which is known to strongly rely on proprioceptive inputs from the postural limbs, and even more importantly, on how the CNS processes, interprets and transforms this afferent information into motor commands (Paulus and Brumagne, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Haavik and Murphy, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Lelic et al. (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) recently speculated that since spinal manipulation is known to reduce pain and improve function in clinical trials (Botelho and Andrade, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Mieritz et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Schneider et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), the observed reduction of the N30 amplitude following SMT-HVLA may reflect a beneficial change. However, it should be noted (as the authors did) that reduced N30 SEP peak amplitudes have also been found in the literature in pathological populations such as Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (Cheron et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Kang and Ma, <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), known to have deficits in APA production during both voluntary lower (e.g., Delval et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and upper limb tasks (e.g., Bazalgette et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). Kang and Ma (<xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) even reported that frontal N30 status indicated the motor severity of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease. During gait initiation, disturbances in Parkinson&#x02019;s disease include reduced APA and abnormal APA timing (Delval et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). During arm elevation, postural movements are known to be less anticipatory in Parkinson&#x02019;s patients than in controls (Bazalgette et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). In the present study, APA were also less anticipatory, had a smaller amplitude and were less efficient in the HVLA group following manipulation than prior to manipulation. Globally taken, the results from the literature may thus suggest that a reduction of the N30 amplitude after HVLA manipulation may reflect a transitory alteration in the cortical integration of sensory-motor information, and may thus reflect a negative change. If so, such alteration has the potential to affect motor coordination during locomotor tasks such as gait initiation. In other words, we propose that a neural effect, possibly mediated by a transient alteration in the early sensory-motor integration following SMT-HVLA could be one of the mechanisms responsible for the present results. This neural effect may have masked the potential mechanical benefits associated with increased spine mobility.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>There are some limitations to the present study that should be pointed out. First, this study only focused on a biomechanical investigation. It is clear that studies linking the changes in motor behavior observed in the present study, to the changes of activity in the neural structures and pathways reported in the literature should be carried out to further substantiate the data interpretation. This is why we used the term &#x0201c;pilot&#x0201d; in the title of this article. Second, it should be emphasized that only short-term effects were investigated. It is not excluded that thoracic HVLA manipulation may have a long-term beneficial effect on APA and speed performance. Third, the biomechanical responses described in this study were obtained from young healthy participants and may not be generalizable to other populations, including patients with spinal pain. Finally, it is known that a manipulation is rarely specific to only the adjustment site (Ross et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). This non-specificity is amplified by the technique used in this article as it is an indirect technique. There is no direct contact of the practitioner with the chosen vertebra since the compressive force is indirectly transmitted by the hand of the patient between his own vertebrae and the thorax of the practitioner. We point out that the role of T9 vertebra and the interest of its manipulation is based solely on empirical knowledge although these notions are still taught in physiotherapy and osteopathy schools. Currently, some studies suggest that the center of rotation of the thoracic zone in the horizontal plane corresponds to a very wide area (T7&#x02013;L3; Konz et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present results showed that thoracic HVLA manipulation in young healthy participants has an immediate beneficial effect on spine mobility but a detrimental effect on APA development and speed performance during gait initiation. It thus seems that HVLA manipulation should be considered with caution by participants who seek an immediate increase of speed performance during locomotor tasks.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>SD and EY designed the study; collected, analyzed and interpreted the data; drafted and revised the manuscript; gave final approval.
