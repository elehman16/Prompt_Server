Here we report one of the study&#x02019;s five components, with the specific objectives of (i) exploring the cost-effectiveness of IUT compared with clinical assessment plus non-invasive tests (henceforth described as &#x02018;IUT&#x02019; and &#x02018;no IUT&#x02019; respectively) in women with SUI or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) prior to surgery, and (ii) determining the expected net gain (ENG) from additional research.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Study participants were women with SUI or stress-predominant MUI who had failed to respond to conservative treatments recruited from seven UK urogynaecology and female urology units. They were randomised to receive either &#x02018;IUT&#x02019; or &#x02018;no IUT&#x02019; before undergoing further treatment. Data from 218 women were used in the economic analysis. Cost utility, net benefit and value of information (VoI) analyses were performed within a randomised controlled pilot trial. Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated over 6&#x000a0;months to determine the incremental cost per QALY of &#x02018;IUT&#x02019; compared to &#x02018;no IUT&#x02019;. Net monetary benefit informed the VoI analysis. The VoI estimated the ENG and optimal sample size for a future definitive trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">At 6&#x000a0;months, the mean difference in total average cost was &#x000a3;138 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.071) in favour of &#x02018;IUT&#x02019;; there was no difference in QALYs estimated from the SF-12 (difference 0.004; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.425) and EQ-5D-3L (difference &#x02212;&#x02009;0.004; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.725); therefore, the probability of IUT being cost-effective remains uncertain.

On average, up to 6&#x000a0;months after treatment, &#x02018;IUT&#x02019; may be cost-saving compared to &#x02018;no IUT&#x02019; because of the reduction in surgery following invasive investigation. However, uncertainty remains over the probability of &#x02018;IUT&#x02019; being considered cost-effective, especially in the longer term.

The most prevalent types are stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence (MUI), which jointly account for 65&#x02013;85% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines state that cystometry is not required prior to conservative treatments or surgery when a diagnosis of SUI is likely on clinical grounds (i.e. where there are no symptoms of over active bladder or voiding dysfunction, no anterior compartment prolapse, and no previous surgery for SUI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">A number of previous studies have considered the use of invasive urodynamic testing (IUT) in determining the optimum treatment strategy for SUI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, differences in inclusion criteria and methods used mean that there is continuing uncertainty over the current position of IUT in the diagnostic pathway of SUI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. IUT use in the UK varies; a 2002 survey of gynaecology and urology units performing IUT found that only half had a guideline on the indications for its use and 85% performed cystometry, the most commonly used form of IUT, in all women with UI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">The continuing uncertainty over the clinical utility of urodynamic investigation resulted in calls for further high-quality primary research from major UK and international bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As a result, the UK National Institute for Health Research &#x02013; Health Technology Assessment programme (NIHR-HTA) commissioned a mixed methods feasibility study (INVESTIGATE-I), including an external pilot randomised controlled trial, in order to clarify how best to address this uncertainty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Given the limited evidence on the cost-effectiveness of IUT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], an economic evaluation was incorporated in the INVESTIGATE-I study. This study is the first to concurrently estimate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of IUT in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The economic evaluation included cost utility, net monetary benefit (NMB) and value of information (VoI) analyses. The aims of the economic components, reported here, were to inform an economic analysis for a future definitive clinical trial and to estimate the sample size required to achieve a definitive answer on the cost-effectiveness of IUT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par31">The INVESTIGATE-I randomised controlled pilot trial was undertaken in seven centres across the UK.

The aim of the study was to evaluate whether IUT, compared with basic clinical assessment and non-invasive tests, altered treatment decisions and outcomes in women suitable for surgical treatment. The treatments provided as part of the study included surgical and non-surgical treatments. Participants had a 6 month follow-up period and both costs and utilities were the primary outcomes for the economic evaluation. Treatment costs, including information on IUT, were collected via a case report form (CRF) completed by clinical staff during the woman&#x02019;s initial treatment phase. Follow-up resource use was collected via a self-completed Participant Costs Questionnaire completed at 6&#x000a0;months. Data on utilities were based on responses to the self-completed SF-12 and EQ-5D-3L administered at baseline and 6&#x000a0;months.

The economic evaluation was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Estimation of costs</title><p id="Par34">Healthcare resource use and costs were estimated for all women using data collected within the trial and from routine sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Resource use and costs were categorised as those used prior to treatment, to determine the optimum treatment strategy (i.e. the costs of IUT), those used in providing treatment (i.e. the costs of surgery and alternative non-surgical treatments), and those incurred after treatment (i.e. other healthcare resources used over a 6 month period following the start of treatment). We assumed non-invasive investigations would be similar across both arms and hence excluded these from our analysis. There may be an argument for reporting the investigation costs prior to treatment separately from those incurred by and after treatment. However, since the former are of necessity different (favouring &#x02018;no IUT&#x02019;), it is our view that the cost of the total package of care (before, during and after treatment) is the more relevant outcome.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Resources and costs prior to treatment</title><p id="Par35">The cost of IUT was estimated using a micro-costing approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which provides a more accurate estimation of costs than a &#x02018;top-down&#x02019; approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

Although conventional dual-channel subtracted cystometry with simultaneous pressure/flow voiding studies (henceforth abbreviated to &#x02018;<italic>cystometry</italic>&#x02019;), videourodynamics and ambulatory urodynamics were all permitted within the study protocol, only cystometry was costed as it was performed in 92% of women randomised to &#x02018;IUT&#x02019;. Thus, if any IUT was undertaken, the cost of cystometry was used. The consumable resources used in cystometry were obtained from clinical staff at one participating site (Liz Dixon, personal communication, July 2013). The cost of the primary staff member who performed the investigation was based on information, collected via a CRF, on the length of time in the consulting room and staff grade. Based on clinical advice, we judged that a nurse (UK band 5) would also be present for the IUT, so this cost was included in the &#x02018;IUT&#x02019; cost.

The initial treatment for women randomised to &#x02018;IUT&#x02019; was based on the findings from investigation and could include surgical and non-surgical approaches. The cost of surgery was taken from the NHS reference cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] for &#x02018;vaginal tape operations for urinary incontinence&#x02019;.

The principle underpinning EVSI is that the allocation of funds for research to reduce clinical and economic uncertainties has financial and opportunity costs.

A positive ENG indicates that the added value of additional research exceeds the costs. EVSI also enables the prediction of the economically and statistically efficient sample size in each randomised arm of a future economic evaluation as part of a randomised controlled trial. This sample size was then doubled to account for a two-arm trial and inflated to account for dropouts&#x02014;in this case, the rate of non-response to the SF-12 and EQ-5D-3L questionnaires.

It follows that the VoI analysis builds upon an inherently &#x02018;underpowered economic evaluation&#x02019;, with the aim of establishing how large an adequately powered definitive study would need to be.</p><p id="Par58">Despite its limited statistical power, the pilot trial undertaken within the INVESTIGATE-I package remains one of the largest studies undertaken addressing the clinical utility of IUT in SUI and stress-predominant MUI, and the largest to consider cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. During the planning of INVESTIGATE-I, two other trials were identified as ongoing, and both have since been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although the protocols were rather different, both employed a non-inferiority design and reported no benefit from IUT. Both of these earlier studies included women with SUI or stress-predominant MUI, but in contrast to INVESTIGATE-I, both also required that urine leakage on stress should be clinically demonstrated. It has long been recognised that patients with predominant symptoms of SUI who also have clinically demonstrable stress leakage are very likely (97%) to have urodynamic stress incontinence on invasive testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and some clinical guidelines have followed this evidence base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Our intention in the feasibility study INVESTIGATE-I was to broaden the inclusion criteria, to include those in whom stress leakage was not necessarily clinically demonstrated, so that we might potentially influence policy and practice for a greater number of women following a future definitive trial.</p><p id="Par59">In a model-based economic evaluation in women with overactive bladder and/or urge-predominant MUI, it was found that IUT was cost-effective only in women with urge-predominant MUI and that women with overactive bladder symptoms should receive treatment on the basis of the clinical diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The question of how much different is the cost-effectiveness of IUT in women with SUI only compared to women with stress-predominant MUI is therefore pertinent. Although we have not undertaken such a sub-group analysis in this feasibility study, it could usefully be incorporated into a future definitive trial.</p><p id="Par60">It has been argued on the basis of systematic review and meta-analysis that comprehensive clinical assessment is a sufficient investigation in the diagnosis of SUI or stress-predominant MUI without voiding difficulties, as long as the women undergo careful office evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In contrast, Serati et al. found that, even in women with a preliminary categorisation of &#x02018;uncomplicated SUI&#x02019;, the additional information provided from invasive investigation can alter treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]; they did not however provide data on the outcomes from treatment. In INVESTIGATE-I, there was a 20% reduction (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) in surgical treatment in the &#x02018;IUT&#x02019; arm suggesting that IUT provided additional information which influenced treatment decisions. In addition, only a small number of women report pure symptoms of SUI and hence satisfy current NICE criteria for undergoing clinical assessment only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Whilst we would therefore concur that IUT influences treatment, the issue of how far it affects treatment outcome remains unresolved.</p><p id="Par61">In previous work, it has been implied that there would be cost-savings associated with omitting IUT from the diagnostic pathway of SUI and stress-predominant MUI; however, there is no evidence to support this conclusion as the studies included in the meta-analysis provided no information on cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Our results do not support this assumption as cost-savings (mean diff &#x02212;&#x02009;&#x000a3;138; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.07) were associated with IUT. The bootstrapped 95% CI (&#x02212;&#x02009;&#x000a3;258, &#x000a3;12) does include 0 but the upper end of the CI, which would favour &#x02018;no IUT&#x02019;, is close to zero, and possibly of no economic significance as less than 1% of the bootstrapped iterations would support there being cost-savings from &#x02018;no IUT&#x02019;. Perhaps the more appropriate interpretation of these results is that for one in five women there is a potential cost-saving of &#x000a3;1244 from the IUT strategy as a result of avoiding surgical treatment. These cost-savings would be reduced by the costs of the investigation (IUT) itself and subsequent non-surgical treatments prescribed as a consequence. However, given that non-surgical treatments are relatively low cost compared to surgery, it is anticipated that cost-savings would still result. It must be emphasised that INVESTIGATE-I was a pilot study and the economic analyses were not powered to determine whether these cost-savings were statistically significant. Nevertheless, possible additional costs are small and of questionable economic significance.</p><p id="Par62">Both unadjusted and adjusted analyses were performed as part of the economic analysis. The importance of using SUR to adjust for potential imbalances in the trial data, due to individual characteristics, which could influence costs and effects is widely recognised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The implications of not adjusting for these imbalances could result in the differences in outcomes being overestimated and hence could result in policy-makers being misinformed. In both of our analyses, the estimated incremental cost difference remained consistent; however, the unadjusted analysis overestimated the incremental difference in QALYs, particularly the EQ-5D-3L results. This difference in QALYs has affected the ICER in that &#x02018;no IUT&#x02019; would be considered cost-effective in the unadjusted analysis but not the adjusted analysis at current willingness-to-pay thresholds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. For a future definitive study, we would recommend the use of both analyses to estimate costs and effects as this would reduce any potential uncertainty around the probability of IUT being considered cost-effective.</p><p id="Par63">It is acknowledged that there is a large amount of missing data in these analyses, with less than 50% of patients returning completed questionnaires at both baseline and 6&#x000a0;months, 48% had QALYs estimated from the EQ-5D-3L and 45% from the SF-12. Although the uncertainty caused by the dropout rate is incorporated into the analyses, the need for caution in interpretation is clear, particularly since somewhat more data were missing from the intervention than control arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Potential solutions to increase the response rates are presented elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par64">The difference in the utility scores estimated from the EQ-5D-3L and SF-12 is not surprising as they both capture different dimensions to estimate quality of life and have different recall periods; the EQ-5D-3L asks participants to measure their health today and the SF-12 asks participants to recall their health over the last 4&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In the case of INVESTIGATE-I, the SF-12 is arguably more sensitive to changes in UI and has been shown to be more responsive than the EQ-5D for capturing changes in less chronic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. That being said, going forward, the EQ-5D is recommended by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and the introduction of the EQ-5D-5L has increased the sensitivity of the questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In addition, the response rate to the EQ-5D tends to be higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], which was also evident from this study; hence, the EQ-5D-5L should be considered as the preferred economic outcome measure in a future study.</p><p id="Par65">To our knowledge, this is the first full economic evaluation comparing IUT with basic clinical assessment to basic clinical assessment alone in the investigation of SUI and stress-predominant MUI in women prior to surgical treatment, albeit in the context of a feasibility study. As previously mentioned, the advantage of including IUT in the investigation of SUI and stress-predominant MUI in women prior to surgical treatment is that women would receive treatment tailored to their diagnosis and potentially avoid unnecessary surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This could generate cost-savings as non-surgical treatments are relatively low cost compared to surgical treatment. Although performing IUT could change the diagnosis or treatment, it does not necessarily mean that the woman&#x02019;s quality of life improves (this is supported by the QALY results and the results of the Value of Urodynamic Evaluation (ValUE) trial) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Longer-term data are needed to identify whether women experience any changes in outcomes over time and whether the cost-savings associated with IUT are maintained in the long term. If a woman who has avoided surgical treatment on the basis of IUT continues with non-surgical treatment in the long term, then cost-savings may be maintained. If, on the other hand, she does not benefit from conservatism, and later goes on to have surgical treatment, then clearly no savings will have been made, and indeed additional costs will accrue. Within INVESTIGATE-I, no patients went on to have surgery after initial non-surgical management, perhaps because of the short time horizon of the pilot; in a definitive trial, we would recommend that a minimum 12 month follow-up be considered.</p><p id="Par66">Norton et al. performed a cost simulation on the results of the ValUE trial as a secondary analysis to determine the costs associated with urodynamic studies (UDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. They concluded that millions of dollars could be saved in the USA by omitting preoperative UDS in women with uncomplicated stress-predominant urinary incontinence prior to surgical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, given their inclusion criteria, this is unsurprising as the majority of women who received UDS underwent surgical treatment (94.6%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Their conclusions should not be generalised outside of their patient group and the USA, hence are not applicable to our population.</p><p id="Par67">Where our data are useful is in the judgement of whether further research to address the uncertainty in the results would be valuable. The VoI analysis suggests that there is added value (at least &#x000a3;19 million for the UK alone) to be gained from additional research. It is reassuring that despite the lack of statistical significance surrounding our results, a conclusion can be drawn that there are potential cost-savings associated with IUT and additional value to be gained from further research. The primary clinical outcome used in the INVESTIGATE-I pilot trial was the International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire (ICIQ) Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (ICIQ-FLUTS) total score. There is consistency in the sample size calculations estimated from the standard statistical criteria looking for a minimum clinical difference of 3 points in ICIQ-FLUTS score (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;410) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and the EVSI results for both the SF-12 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;404) and EQ-5D-3L (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;416). Using all three estimations to determine the sample size of a future definitive trial means the trial will be powered to determine both the clinical and economic effectiveness of IUT. This combination of approaches is rarely performed and is consistent with recent recommendations on sample size determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">As with any sample size calculation, there are uncertainties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In the case of sample sizes based on the EVSI results, one uncertainty is around the methodological approach to estimate cost-effectiveness. Arguably, the better method is to estimate cost-effectiveness based on the SUR approach and hence base estimates of the EVSI on these results. This was not possible as not all of the required data were available. Had it been possible, we would expect the estimated sample size to be slightly higher.</p><p id="Par69">Although it is an overused conclusion in clinical research and reviews, we can say with some certainty that there is additional value to be gained from future research to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of IUT in the investigation of SUI and stress-predominant MUI in women prior to surgical treatment. Future studies should consider expanding the time horizon beyond 6&#x000a0;months to determine the long-term benefits associated with surgical and non-surgical treatment options, incorporate the woman&#x02019;s perspective in the economic evaluation and, if using similar outcome measures, should consider using the sample size estimates determined in the current VoI analysis and previously published conventional power calculations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The combination of our economic results with the economic results of a future definitive trial should result in sufficient evidence to inform NICE or other policy making organisations internationally in making recommendations on the value of IUT in the diagnostic pathway of SUI and stress-predominant MUI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par70">This is the first full economic evaluation of IUT in diagnosing SUI or stress-predominant MUI in women whom stress leakage was not necessarily clinically demonstrated, albeit in the context of a feasibility study. Our findings suggest that IUT may be cost-saving compared to basic clinical assessment and non-invasive tests in the investigation of SUI and stress-predominant MUI prior to surgical treatment, assessed over the short term. There is additional net value to be gained from further research in this area and the question should be addressed by a trial that is both appropriately powered to detect clinical and economic differences between IUT and basic clinical assessment, and extended over a longer time scale. A sample size of 404&#x02013;416 randomised women should be capable of providing definitive answers to these questions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec22"><p>
