<bold>Background:</bold> Antiretroviral drugs are used to treat patients with HIV infection, with good evidence that they improve prognosis. However, mutations develop in the HIV genome that allow it to evade successful treatment&#x02014;known as drug resistance&#x02014;and such mutations are known against every class of antiretroviral drug. Resistance can cause treatment failure and limit the treatment options available. Different types of tests are often used to detect resistance and to work out whether patients should switch to a different drug regimen. Currently, the different types of tests include genotype testing (direct sequencing of genes from virus samples infecting a patient); phenotype testing (a test that assesses the sensitivity of a patient's HIV sample to different drugs), and virtual phenotype testing (a way of interpreting genotype data that estimates the likely viral response to different drugs). The researchers of this study did a trial to find out whether providing an additional virtual phenotype report would be beneficial to patients, as compared with a genotype report alone. The main outcome was HIV viral load after 12 months of treatment, but the researchers also looked at differences in drug regimens prescribed, number of treatment changes in the study, and changes in CD4+ (the type of white blood cell infected by HIV) counts.</p><p>
<bold>What this trial shows:</bold> The researchers found that the main endpoint of the trial (HIV viral load after 12 months) was no different in patients whose clinicians had received a virtual phenotype report as well as a genotype report, compared with those who had received a genotype report alone. In addition, the average number of drugs prescribed was no different between patients in the two different arms of the trial, and there was no difference in number of drug regimen changes, and no change in immune response (measured using CD4+ cell levels). However, more drugs predicted to be sensitive were prescribed by clinicians who got both a genotype and virtual phenotype report, as compared with clinicians who received only the genotype report.</p><p>
<bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> The size of the trial (338 patients recruited) was large enough to properly test the hypothesis that providing a virtual phenotype report as well as a genotype report would result in lower HIV viral loads. Randomization of patients to either intervention ensured that the comparison groups were well-balanced, and the researchers also tested whether selection bias had affected the results (i.e., testing for the possibility that clinicians could predict which intervention participants would receive, and change recruitment into the trial as a result). They found no evidence for selection bias occurring within the trial. However, interpreting the results is difficult because the trial did not directly compare the two different testing platforms, but rather looked at whether providing a virtual phenotype report as well as a genotype report was better than providing a genotype report alone. The investigators also acknowledge that since the trial was conducted, the cutoffs for interpreting genotype information as resistant have been lowered. The findings may therefore not translate precisely to the current situation.</p><p>
<bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> Other cohort studies and clinical trials have shown that patients offered resistance testing respond better to antiretroviral therapy compared with those who were not, but the clinical effectiveness of different resistance testing methods is not known. This study provides additional data on the respective benefits of genotype testing versus genotype plus provision of virtual phenotype. Another trial comparing genotype versus virtual phenotype has also found that the different interpretation methods perform similarly.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Hales G, Birch C, Crowe S, Workman C, Hoy JF, et al.

Resistance has subsequently been described for each licensed antiretroviral therapy (ART). Some mutations causing resistance to one drug are known to confer cross-resistance to others within the same class [<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The development of resistance to ART significantly reduces drug efficacy and is an important cause of treatment failure.</p><p>HIV drug resistance testing is a recommended component of several international ART treatment guidelines [<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Three different methodologies are currently used to evaluate ART susceptibility in clinical HIV isolates; genotype, phenotype, and virtual phenotype. In addition to the different analytical techniques, myriad platforms for the interpretation of laboratory data are available. Genotype testing involves the sequencing of viral genes and the interpretation of mutations detected in the gene sequence. Phenotypic testing directly measures the susceptibility of a clinical HIV isolate to antiretroviral drugs. The virtual phenotype predicts ART susceptibility on the basis of mapping defined point mutations against an extensive database comprising virus gene sequences with defined phenotypic susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs [<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>None of the current methods for resistance testing is ideal. Genotypic testing may not correlate completely with phenotype, requires expert interpretation, and relies heavily on the availability of unvalidated, rules-based algorithms. The technique requires a minimum plasma HIV-1 viral load of approximately 1,000 RNA copies/mL. Phenotypic testing is slow and only available in highly specialised laboratories. Moreover, the relationship between phenotypic inhibitory concentrations (IC50, IC90) and virologic response under continuing drug pressure (the so-called cutoff) requires constant adjustment as more laboratory and clinical information becomes available. Both types of resistance testing may fail to detect minor quasi-species that may have clinical significance. Quality control of genotypic testing for sequence quality, the ability to detect nucleotide mixtures, the interpretation of sequences obtained, and clinician familiarity with the report generated, so that informed treatment choices are made, remain issues of concern.</p><p>In general, both genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing has been shown to provide virologic benefit (reduction in viral load and increased proportion of patients with HIV viral load below the limits of detection) compared with control arms [<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Clinicians have been encouraged to incorporate resistance testing as part of their routine clinical assessment of patients prior to initiating and/or changing therapy [<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. There is preliminary evidence that there are costs/benefits arising from the use of resistance testing [<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. More recently, in a meta-analysis of published trials, the clinical effectiveness of HIV resistance testing was questioned [<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>While phenotypic and virtual phenotypic testing have been compared [<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the relative utilities of virtual phenotypic and genotypic testing have not been assessed. The CREST (can resistance testing enhance selection of therapy) Study was designed as a randomized, prospective evaluation of antiretroviral prescribing and surrogate marker outcome following provision of resistance tests using a genotype alone or a genotype plus virtual phenotype. The study also supported a national quality assurance program for genotype testing (that incorporated a unifying interpretative algorithm) and the development of clinician familiarity with HIV-1 resistance testing at a time when such testing was not routinely available in Australia or New Zealand.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>HIV-infected patients taking combination ART, with plasma HIV RNA viral load &#x0003e; 2000 copies/mL, who were willing to change therapy and who were more than 18 years of age were eligible to enter the study.

Evidence for subgroup effects were formally assessed by testing for statistically significant interactions between subgroup and randomized treatment group. At the request of the journal, we also performed one further subgroup analysis according to whether patients were the first or second randomized within each randomization block [<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

A no-resistance test control arm was not used because at the time of conducting the trial neither investigators nor patient advocate groups felt there was sufficient clinical equipoise for a control group. Approximately 40% of study patients had viral loads below the level of detection at week 48. Previous studies have also shown the benefit of resistance data when selecting a new ARV regimen [<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The choice of which test to use remains a decision for individual clinicians, who may be influenced by factors such as the test method offered, confidence in the quality of performance of complex laboratory testing procedures, cost, turnaround time, and ease of interpretation of the test report provided.</p><p>In this heavily pretreated group of patients, we found no virological or immunological differences at week 48 between these two resistance test platforms.</p><p>Subsequent to this study, the clinical cutoffs for resistance employed by virtual phenotyping were lowered from &#x0003e;10-fold to 2.0, 2.0, and 1.8 for didanosine, zalcitabine, and stavudine, respectively. As such it is tempting to dismiss the relevance of the findings. We would argue that the impact of the new cutoffs would be to reduce the number of drugs that are reported back to clinicians as being sensitive and in so doing further reduce the apparent differences between the two virtual phenotype and the genotypic test platforms. This view cannot be informed by data from our trial because the necessary analyses are not possible.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>It is reasonably well-established that extensive prior use of ART results in multidrug resistant virus and that the utility of drug resistance testing in heavily pretreated patients is questionable because their options are very limited [<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, we found no evidence to suggest that the two test platforms provided any clear benefit in the predefined patient strata with more or less than eight prior regimens and those with virus with resistance to more or less than six available drugs. This observation is supported by findings from the MuSa Study [<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Our randomised comparison provided clinicians with either one or two forms of report and interpretation describing the scale and scope of antiretroviral drug resistance in clinical isolates taken from patients in the trial. It is not possible to ascertain with confidence which report carried more weight when clinicians reviewed the results provided for patients in group B. Consequently there may be concern that many decisions regarding future treatment in that group were made on the basis of interpretations provided by the genotype result alone. However, our data clearly show that virtual phenotype results provided clinicians and their patients with significantly more treatment options and this resulted in significantly more apparently active drugs being prescribed for patients enrolled in group B. As such, we contend that for the most part our randomised comparison maintained integrity and that the results should be viewed as valid and robust comparisons. Of some importance in this regard is the fact that it is not possible to exclude an interpretation of genotype from the virtual phenotype report since the observed point mutations for a given sample are an integral part of that report.</p><p>A majority of clinical HIV isolates in each study arm had at least one ARV with either intermediate or full sensitivity. However, clinician prescribing was limited as not all of these ARVs could be used. For example, a viable combination regimen could not be constructed from three NNRTI drugs. A further limitation of this study is that the impact of low dose ritonavir, used to inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and thereby increase the plasma levels of co-administered PIs, was not examined. Further work is needed to interpret resistance results when a boosted PI regimen is planned [<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Ongoing refinement and modification of the test platforms does impact upon the generalizability of these results.</p><p>CREST resulted in all Australian and New Zealand HIV reference laboratories being able to offer HIV genotype testing and participation in a local quality assurance program. Other outcomes were sharing of expertise, collaboration between different laboratories, and the availability of a standardised genotypic interpretation and reporting format developed and maintained by Australian experts. The study was undertaken in a wide variety of settings and provided investigators with access to HIV resistance test reports. The genotype report was designed to be user friendly for both those experienced and inexperienced in interpreting the results. The provision of a resistance test result significantly impacted the choice of ARVs prescribed across all sites, both in general practice and in specialist hospitals.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overall Evidence</title><p>Overall, CREST found that HIV resistance test results affected ARV prescribing but there was no additional benefit derived from receiving a virtual phenotype report in addition to a genotype report. This may be due to factors including the quality of the genotype interpretation developed for CREST and the high biological cutoff used in the virtual phenotype analysis. Similar data have been generated in one other trial [<xref rid="pctr-0010018-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Across a range of studies conducted in a diverse patient population there is little data to indicate that any of the myriad interpretation methods offer reliable and predictable benefits. The choice of test platform should probably therefore reflect factors such as availability, cost, and familiarity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPORTING INFORMATION</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010018-sd001"><label>CONSORT Checklist</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010018.sd001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(56 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010018-sd002"><label>Trial Protocol</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010018.sd002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(1.0 MB DOC)</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="ack"><title/><p>We are extremely grateful to the patients for their participation.
