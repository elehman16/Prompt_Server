It has been suggested to start the process with the SA approach and then switch to the long-axis (LA); however, to our knowledge, this combination has not been evaluated.

Resident physicians in post-graduate years 1&#x02013;2 performed a simulated ultrasound-guided internal jugular vein puncture using the SA and SLA approaches on manikins. Twenty resident physicians were randomly assigned to two equal groups: (1) one group performed punctures using the SA approach followed by SLA; and (2) the other performed the same procedures in the opposite order. We compared the success rate and procedure duration for the two approaches. Procedural success was defined as insertion of the guide-wire into the vein while visualizing the needle tip at the time of anterior wall puncture, without penetrating the posterior wall.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Six resident physicians (30%) performed both approaches successfully, while 12 (60%) performed the SLA approach, but not the SA, successfully. Those who performed the SA approach successfully also succeeded with the SLA approach. Two resident physicians (10%) failed to perform both approaches. The SLA approach had a significantly higher success rate than the SA approach (P &#x0003c; 0.001). The median (interquartile range) procedure duration was 59.5 [46.0&#x02013;88.5] seconds and 45.0 [37.5&#x02013;84.0] seconds for the SLA and SA approaches, respectively.

Its success rate has significantly increased, while complications have decreased, compared with the conventional anatomical landmark-guided method [<xref rid="pone.0189258.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189258.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>There are two ultrasound-guided puncturing techniques: the short-axis (SA) and the long-axis (LA) approaches. In the former, the SA image of the target vein is acquired, and the vein is punctured perpendicularly to the ultrasound probe. The needle tip is then visualized as a dot on the screen of the ultrasonography monitor. The position of the target vein relative to the direction of needle advancement can be visualized, as can the adjacent vessels, such as the common carotid and vertebral arteries. However, it is sometimes difficult to visualize the needle tip during advancement when using the SA approach. This can result in posterior wall puncturing (PWP) of the target vein [<xref rid="pone.0189258.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189258.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or the inadvertent puncture of the common carotid artery and pneumothorax [<xref rid="pone.0189258.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189258.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Alternatively, the needle tip is continuously visualized as it advances from the skin to the target veins when using the LA approach. However, it is technically difficult to detect the center of the target vein and visualize the entire length of the needle when using this approach. Discerning the position of the target vein in relation to adjacent vessels is also challenging when using this approach [<xref rid="pone.0189258.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189258.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and the risk of arterial puncture increases. To facilitate the visualization of the needle in the LA view, it has been suggested that the procedure should begin using the SA approach, followed by the LA approach [<xref rid="pone.0189258.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, no studies have demonstrated the utility of this combined technique.</p><p>We hypothesized that a combined short- and long-axis (SLA) approach, which would incorporate the advantages of the SA and LA approaches, would facilitate visualization of the needle tip and prevent PWP. The aim of this study was to compare the SLA approach with the SA approach, when administered by novice operators in a simulated model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The study protocol conformed to the Guidelines for Epidemiologic Studies issued by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of Japan, and was approved by the institutional review board of Kyoto Medical Center.

The participants were residents in either their 1st or 2nd year post graduation from medical school. None of the residents had specialized in any particular branch of medicine at the time and all had very limited experience with central venous punctures in clinical practice (median: 0.5; interquartile range: 0&#x02013;4.5 times). They were blinded to the study and were assigned to two groups using simple randomization without concealment and blinding. One of the investigators (J.

Puncturing was performed using a simulator model doll (M93B CVC Insertion Simulator II, Kyoto Kagaku Co., Ltd, Kyoto, Japan). Group A physicians first performed the SA approach followed by the SLA approach.

Before starting the punctures, an intensivist supervisor, who specialized in ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization and was double certified by the Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists and the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine, provided a 30-min tutorial to explain and demonstrate the procedure; a video was also presented. After the tutorial, the resident physicians performed the procedures while the supervisor observed the physicians without intervening.</p><p>For the SA approach, the transducer was positioned at the puncture site on the manikin to visualize the target vein in the SA view.

We hypothesized that needle tip visualization may be associated with PWP occurrence, and that preventing PWP could guarantee high procedural success rates, which we used as our composite endpoint. No previous studies have evaluated the rate of needle tip visualization during SLA; therefore, we used the rate of LA instead of SLA. Assuming that needle tip visualization using the SLA approach is similar to that with the LA approach, and a correlation between paired observations is equal to 0.40, we estimated that 19 trials would provide 80% power at an &#x003b1;-level of 0.05.

We used the McNemar test to compare the procedural success rates of the two approaches. The procedure durations were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Values are expressed as median [interquartile range]. The number of skin punctures for needle redirection and the number of attempts were compared using paired t-tests.

Although this technique has been reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0189258.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the present study demonstrates the superiority of a novel technique that combines the SA and LA approaches.</p><p>Using the SLA approach, the needle tip can be initially visualized between the skin and anterior wall of the target vein in the SA view, and the relationship between the needle and adjacent vessels can be easily discerned. Next, the operator switched to the LA view, where needle penetration through the anterior wall of the target vein can be confirmed in real-time, which is the advantage of this approach. It is possible to visualize the needle penetrating the anterior wall of the target vein in real-time using only the LA approach; however, in this approach, the thin ultrasound beam must be aligned with the midline axis of the longitudinal plane of the target vein and with the whole length of the needle, which is quite challenging for novice operators.</p><p>Needle tip visualization rate at the time of anterior wall puncture has been reported to be 62% and 23% in LA and SA, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0189258.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, in our study, the visualization rate was 90% using the SLA approach, which was significantly higher. In the SLA approach, the direction of the advancing needle and the midline axis of the target vein can be aligned in the SA view, and then, by rotating the probe and overlapping the thin ultrasound beam, the three axes can be aligned and needle tip visualization is improved. When attempting to visualize the entire length of the needle, puncturing the needle precisely in the fixed LA view is quite difficult; however, adjusting the transducer to the fixed needle is comparatively easier.</p><p>In this study, resident physicians were able to puncture the target vein with a PWP rate of 10% using the SLA approach. PWP has been reported to occur in 31% and 37% of procedures using the SA and LA approaches, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0189258.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In another study, researchers have shown that 64% of resident physicians experienced PWP using the SA approach [<xref rid="pone.0189258.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These results indicate that many operators lose sight of the tip of the needle when performing either the SA or LA technique. However, we overcame this problem by using the SLA approach, which facilitates continued visualization of the needle tip in real-time during the entire procedure.</p><p>A recent RCT reported that the success rate of ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization in the subclavian vein was significantly higher when using SA than when using LA [<xref rid="pone.0189258.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which seems contradictory to our results. We speculate that the differences could be due to methodology: the procedure was performed 1) in real patients and 2) not by a novice operator. These methodological differences may account for the differences in experimental outcomes. Moreover, this study endpoint did not include PWP; therefore, the outcomes cannot be compared.</p><p>It has been reported that the SA approach is significantly faster than the LA approach when performed by novice physicians [<xref rid="pone.0189258.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; however, the difference in the duration of the two procedures remained unclear. Although the duration of the procedures did not differ significantly between the two techniques in our study, the time required for rotating the transducer and adjusting it to visualize the entire length of the needle in the LA view may have contributed the longer duration of the SLA technique. Nevertheless, a median time difference of approximately 15 seconds would presumably not affect patient outcomes in clinical practice.</p><sec id="sec016"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has several limitations. First, the sample size of this study is small, and we used the rate of needle tip visualization using LA, instead of SLA, and SA approach in sample size calculation. This might have resulted in an underestimation of the required sample size and could be associated with statistical bias. Second, this study was limited to using a manikin, rather than a human body, which shows significant variations in anatomy and collapsible vessels. Further analysis in live patients would be needed. Third, this study involved resident physicians who are not familiar with ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization. Therefore, it is unknown how well-trained physicians will perform the new SLA procedure. Finally, we randomized the order in which the residents performed both approaches. Each resident may gain additional experience by mastering one technique first before switching to the other.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study showed that the SLA approach is an easily learned, safer procedure for novice operators performing ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization in a manikin model. The clinical utility of this technique in real patients is worth exploring.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Kiyoshi Ichihara (Department of Clinical Laboratory, Yamaguchi University Hospital, Ube, Japan) for advice regarding statistical analysis.
