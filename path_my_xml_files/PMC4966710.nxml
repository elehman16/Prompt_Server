Most available analgesic drugs are often either ineffective or not tolerated, with many side effects. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous widely distributed <italic>N</italic>-acylethanolamina involved in neuroinflammation and pain-generating processes. Formulations containing ultra-micronized palmitoylethanolamide (um-PEA) are available but their effectiveness on chronic pain in highly heterogeneous geriatric patients is not clear and probably not generalizable. We planned to adopt the <italic>N</italic>-of-1 trial approach to test the effectiveness of um-PEA objectively at the individual level in our older outpatients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Persons 65&#x000a0;years or older referring to the Geriatric Unit of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca&#x02019; Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico of Milan complaining of noncancer chronic pain of any origin will be eligible. Each trial will be a placebo-controlled randomized crossover trial including two um-PEA (600&#x000a0;mg twice a day) and placebo treatment pairs. The um-PEA or placebo 3-week periods will be separated by 2-week washout intervals to overcome possible carryover effects. Pain intensity, need of on-demand analgesic medications, and impact on daily activities will be evaluated. Cognitively impaired patients will be eligible as long as an expression of pain can be recognized and its frequency assessed by a caregiver. Trial results will be discussed with the patient or caregiver and the treating physician to decide whether to continue the treatment. The impact of the <italic>N</italic>-of-1 approach on the physician&#x02019;s management plan and confidence will be assessed. We will secondarily meta-analyze the performed <italic>N</italic>-of-1 trials to obtain an estimate of the average effect of um-PEA compared with placebo using a frequentist and Bayesian approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>While pursuing an ultimate clinical objective, i.e. to empirically and objectively decide the best treatment choice for an individual older patient with chronic pain, these series of geriatric <italic>N</italic>-of-1 trials on PEA will bring the principles of evidence-based medicine into the care of patients not usually represented in conventional randomized controlled trials, and realize a patient-centered outcome approach necessary to improve appropriate prescribing in elderly patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02699281">NCT02699281</ext-link>.

In particular, the prevalence of chronic or persistent pain among older people ranges from 45&#x000a0;% to 80&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Persistent pain is a frequent reason for physician office visits among older persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], with women being more likely to report persistent pain than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Among older adults, the most frequent noncancer pain complaints are osteoarthritic back pain, especially in the low back or neck (around 65&#x000a0;%), musculoskeletal pain (around 40&#x000a0;%), peripheral neuropathic pain (typically due to diabetes or post-herpetic neuralgia, 35&#x000a0;%) and chronic joint pain (15&#x000a0;%&#x02013;25&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In fact, persistent pain may or may not be associated with a well-defined disease process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Persistent pain and its inadequate treatment are associated with adverse outcomes in older people: functional impairment, falls, slow rehabilitation, mood changes, and sleep and appetite disturbances, resulting in a higher consumption of healthcare resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Achieving pain control in geriatric patients is complicated by many issues. First, older people may underreport pain, and in this population persistent pain has often complex and multifactorial manifestations. Self-reporting is deemed to be the gold standard in pain assessment but older people might find difficult to complete self-reported questionnaires of pain and functional status, developed and validated in younger patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Pain evaluation is particularly cumbersome in older patients affected by dementia, who can express pain through unusual verbal and non-verbal modalities. Facial expression, verbalizations, non-verbal sounds, body movements, variations in interpersonal relationships, and mental status changes might be pain manifestations, and should be taken into account in pain evaluation even if extremely non-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Second, the somatosensory system changes with aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], through the alteration or loss of myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], an impairment in the endogenous opioid and non-opioid inhibitory systems of pain modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and a modified neuroplasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. All these changes lead to a reduced pain threshold, dysfunctional pain signaling, hyperalgesia, and central sensitization.</p><p>Third, pharmacological management of chronic pain is particularly challenging in the elderly. Owing to age-related body changes affecting drug pharmacokinetics, and because of multimorbidity and polypharmacy, older patients are generally more likely to experience drug-related adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In particular, safety concerns can arise with most of the available analgesic drug classes. Given a better safety profile than traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen is usually indicated as first line therapy for pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, concerns about its efficacy on low back pain and osteoarthritis of the hip or knee, and about its actual safety, especially at the upper end of standard analgesic doses, have been raised by two recent systematic reviews of, respectively, randomized placebo-controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are more effective in the treatment of chronic inflammatory pain, but are burdened with many side effects, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, renal injury, and cardiovascular toxicity, which increase in frequency and severity with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These safety issues are only partially mitigated with cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Although their potential efficacy on persistent noncancer pain has been proved in some controlled trials, the adverse effects associated with opioids represent a barrier to their adoption and a frequent reason of drug discontinuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition to other usual adverse effects, such as constipation and nausea, a negative impact on vigilance and cognitive performance is common in older persons. Newly prescribed opioid treatment has been associated with a higher risk of falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], so that the 2015 update of Beers criteria on potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults included it among the considerations on disease and syndrome interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Although tolerance to central respiratory depression develops quickly, rapid dose increase, drug&#x02013;drug interaction with other central nervous system depressants, and drug accumulation or accidental overdose are potential determinants of respiratory failure onset during opioid treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>So called adjuvant (or pain-modulating) drugs, co-administered with other analgesics, have been found to be effective in attenuating pain perception, particularly in the treatment of neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. They include antidepressants, anticonvulsants (e.g. pregabalin and gabapentin) and other medications that alter neural membrane potentials, ion channels, cell surface receptor sites, synaptic neurotransmitter levels, and other neuronal processes involved in pain signal processing. To minimize their potential adverse effects, these central nervous system drugs must be carefully titrated and monitored frequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>All pain-modulating therapies target neurons, the principal component of the pain unit. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that immune cells, in particular mast cells and microglia, play a substantial role in the somatosensory system, being the primary interlocutors for pain neurons, both in the periphery and at the spinal and supraspinal levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Immune cells are located in proximity to sensory nerve endings and vasculature. After an injury or in the presence of an inflammatory stimulus, immune cells release mediators, such as bradykinin, prostaglandins, and histamine, stimulating nociceptors and playing an important role in the induction, amplification, and maintenance of chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Physiological activation of microglia generally leads to resolution of neuroinflammation and restoration of tissue homeostasis. With aging, both microglia and mast cells increase their reactivity with a more intense response to a stimulus and a more robust production of pro-inflammatory cytokines lasting for an extended period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. All these findings support the hypothesis that non-neuronal cells might be important therapeutic targets for the treatment of chronic pain, especially in older persons.</p><p>Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous <italic>N</italic>-acylethanolamina widely distributed in different tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It is synthesized on demand and its levels vary after stress or injuries, like those associated with pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In murine models of chronic inflammation and chronic or neuropathic pain, PEA seems to be able to reduce the recruitment and activation of mast cells, the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, and endoneural edema, thus reducing both pain and inflammation while preserving peripheral nerve morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Micronized or ultra-micronized PEA (m- and um-PEA) is available in Italy as an active molecule in several products classified as &#x02018;Food for Special Medical Purposes&#x02019; (European Commission Directive 1999/21/EC), indicated for use &#x02018;under medical supervision&#x02019; to treat conditions whose pathogenesis involves neuroinflammation. Evidence on the efficacy and safety of PEA in the treatment of chronic or neuropathic pain, alone or as add-on therapy, published as full articles or conference abstracts, in peer-reviewed or non-peer-reviewed journals, is currently based mostly on observational studies and case series, and on a few double-blind or open label randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Recently, in a meta-analysis of published and unpublished data, Paladini <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] confirmed the efficacy of PEA on pain intensity independently of sex, age, and type of pain, even if with a smaller effect in people older than 65&#x000a0;years. Serious product-related adverse events were not reported in any of the included studies.</p><p>The mechanism of action and the safety profile make PEA an appealing choice for pain relief in older people. However, the evidence base for its efficacy to treat chronic pain in the elderly is not fully convincing. In addition, formulations containing um-PEA, like <italic>Normast&#x000ae;</italic>, are available in Italy only out-of-pocket and a treatment cycle at the doses recommended by the product information sheet would cost the patient about &#x020ac; 60. Given that the required treatment for persistent pain would probably be longer, the cost should be balanced by the actual effectiveness. These reasons represented the rationale to adopt a randomized <italic>N</italic>-of-1 trial as a more objective and personalized prescribing approach, compared with the conventional trial (i.e. &#x02018;prescribe and see&#x02019;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In general, <italic>N</italic>-of-1 trials are within-patient randomized multi-period crossover trials to compare, in a double-blind fashion, therapeutic strategies (e.g. an active drug versus no treatments, or two different active therapies), with time periods as randomization units and the patient as control for herself or himself. This study design can be theoretically used to test new drugs along their way to marketing authorization. In our case, we will adopt this approach to determine the best therapeutic choice for a certain patient in clinical practice, objectively and empirically, with randomization and blindness as instruments to overcome those factors (e.g. natural history of the disease, &#x02018;placebo effect&#x02019;, expectations) that might bias conventional trials of therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In particular, the series of <italic>N</italic>-of-1 trials on PEA for chronic pain in older patients will be part of the activity of the Geriatric <italic>N</italic>-of-1 Service, an experimental project that we have implemented, with the approval of the local ethical committee, following the pioneering experience of Guyatt and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] but in the specific context of geriatric medicine, which suffers most from the limits of parallel group randomized controlled trials, the current paradigms of evidence-based medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This study protocol has been realized according to the CONSORT extension for reporting N-of-1 trials (CENT) 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and the SPIRIT statements. The SPIRIT&#x000a0;and CENT checklists for our paper are provided as Additional files <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>, respectively.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The primary (clinical) objective of our study is to apply the <italic>N</italic>-of-1 trial approach to test the effectiveness of um-PEA 600&#x000a0;mg (<italic>Normast&#x000ae;</italic>) twice a day for chronic pain in a certain patient referring to our geriatric unit in whom the treatment might be indicated, and to assist decisions on long-term treatment of that patient.</p><p>As a secondary (research) objective, we aim to obtain an overall estimate of the effectiveness of um-PEA 600&#x000a0;mg twice a day compared with placebo and evaluate the possible determinants of between-trial heterogeneity, through a meta-analysis of the <italic>N</italic>-of-1 trials performed for clinical purposes. Contextually, a classical frequentist meta-analytical approach will be compared with a Bayesian approach, and the potentialities of a Bayesian-based cumulative study design explored.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>Each trial will be a blinded placebo-controlled randomized trial. Each trial&#x02019;s duration will be 18&#x000a0;weeks, comprising two um-PEA and placebo treatment pairs assigned in a random order according to a pairwise randomization scheme. Thus, the sequence of each pair can be either um-PEA/placebo or placebo/um-PEA. Each treatment period will last 3&#x000a0;weeks. The treatment periods of each pair and the two pairs will be separated by 2-week washout intervals to minimize carryover effects. A run-in period will not be routinely performed, but will be considered when deemed appropriate (for example, in case of history of allergies to drugs or drug excipients).

The onset time of PEA is not easily predictable from its pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. According to the available literature, most people notice the effects within 1&#x000a0;week, but sometimes 6&#x02013;8 weeks are required, especially for chronic pain syndromes. Regarding a possible carryover effect, no sufficient data are currently available, either from basic or clinical research studies, to make a definitive statement. However, given the type of mechanism of action, a possible residual effect might be expected. Concerning the dose, in the heterogeneous literature on the use of the product for pain control, different doses have been tested, from 300&#x000a0;mg a day to 2400&#x000a0;mg a day, either once or split into three doses per day. The product information sheet for Normast&#x000ae; 600&#x000a0;mg suggests &#x02018;1&#x02013;2 tablets a day for 20&#x02013;30 days&#x02019;.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Eligibility criteria for participants</title><p>Older patients complaining of chronic pain of likely osteoarticular or neuropathic origin will be eligible for the study.

To help with the assessment, in the paper used for the assessment, the numeric horizontal line will be accompanied with labels and pictures (modified from the Faces Pain Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]) expressing the intensity of pain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The patient or caregiver will also be asked to report the daily use of on-demand analgesic medications, specifying the type and dosage of drug taken (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The impact of pain on patient daily activities will be evaluated at the baseline and at the end of each week, using a short questionnaire modified from the Back Pain Functional Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This is a self-report measure to evaluate the patient&#x02019;s functional status, proposed for use in both clinical and research settings. It consists of 12 items (derived from existing questionnaires and interviews with physical therapists), investigating work, hobbies, home activities, bending or stooping, dressing shoes or socks, lifting, sleeping, standing, walking, climbing stairs, sitting, and driving. It has been validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and extensively used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], even with older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The scale was selected among the several available instruments for functional impairment due to chronic pain because of its comprehensiveness combined with a reasonable number of items. The questionnaire takes about 5&#x000a0;min to complete. Although it was conceived as a scale for back pain evaluation, the study authors also judged it as adequate to assess the functional impact of any osteoarticular or neuropathic pain. Although the scale has been used with older people, we slightly modified the Back Pain Functional Scale to make it more appropriate for geriatric patients. We reduced the walking distance from 1 mile (1610&#x000a0;m) to 200&#x000a0;m and the number of stairs from 20 to 10. In addition, we substituted the original rating scale (over six points) with a Likert five-point scale, in which 1 corresponds to &#x02018;no difficulty to perform activity&#x02019;, 2 to &#x02018;a little bit of difficulty&#x02019;, 3 to &#x02018;medium difficulty&#x02019;, 4 to &#x02018;great difficulty&#x02019;, and 5 to &#x02018;impossibility to perform the activity&#x02019;. The modified Back Pain Functional Scale is reported in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The total score is obtained as a mean of the scores for all items. When required, the questionnaire will be tailored to the patient usual activity and performance, thus removing those items that do not apply (e.g. if the patient does not drive, the question referring to driving will be removed). If at the enrollment visit the patient appears to value the impairment of one daily activity that is not included in the questionnaire, a specific item will be added.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Pain assessment scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1496_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig><fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Questionnaire for functional status assessment</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1496_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p>At the baseline visit, the ability of the patient to compile the questionnaire unaided after instructions will be verified.

We opted to investigate this hypothesis at the individual level, in our routine practice, applying the <italic>N</italic>-of-1 approach to a geriatric population. Research and clinical practice become intimately intertwined on the ground of geriatric <italic>N</italic>-of-1 trials<italic>.</italic> Indeed, while they borrow typical research instruments (e.g. randomization, placebo) to achieve their ultimate clinical objective, i.e. to determine the best therapeutic choice for patients, reliably and empirically, they also meet the aims of innovative and timely research. They bring principles of evidence-based medicine into the care of older patients scarcely represented in conventional randomized controlled trials. Moreover, <italic>N</italic>-of-1 trials promote and exploit a patient-centered research that goes beyond the need of generalizability and even beyond the limits of the comparative effectiveness research. In particular, they embody the spirit of patient-centered outcomes research necessary to prioritize medicaments and improve appropriate prescribing in older patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Patient-centered outcomes research is indeed possible even with older patients who, contrary to expectations, have been shown to take into account competing outcomes when deciding on therapeutic alternatives, and to value the effects of treatments on cognitive, physical, and emotional functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p>We also expect that putting the patient at the center of our practice and research, modifying the trial design according to patient expectations, needs, and difficulties, might help to mitigate those well-known barriers concerning participant enrollment and adherence encountered in the conduction of trials involving older persons. Learning how to listen to the patient&#x02019;s needs, even when not traditionally expressed, makes patient-centered practice and research possible even with cognitively impaired people. In particular, this series of <italic>N</italic>-of-1 trials on PEA will help to enhance our capabilities to interpret, measure, and treat pain in its alternative expressions.</p><p>The meta-analysis of the <italic>N</italic>-of-1 trials on PEA we conduct will provide aggregate information on the product that can be used to inform treatment decisions for other patients not participating in the trials.</p><p>Finally, the project, in its entirety, will represent a way of filling the gap between science and practice, facilitating the involvement of patients and clinicians in the production of evidence, and promoting the creation of &#x02018;a real clinical learning community&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Trial status</title><p>At the time of manuscript submission, four patients have been enrolled and randomization has begun.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CONSORT, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials; PEA, palmitoylethanolamide; um-PEA, ultra-micronized palmitoylethanolamide; SPIRIT, Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec25"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1496_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>SPIRIT 2013 checklist.
