Deficiencies of these micronutrients are prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, where approximately one fourth of the population are at risk of zinc deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], ~20% of pre-school children suffer from iron deficiency anemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and &#x0003e;40% of children have subclinical vitamin A deficiency, based on serum retinol concentration &#x0003c;0.70&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

For example, some studies found that adding zinc to iron supplements reduced their impact on iron status, although a meta-analysis of available studies concluded that there was no significant effect of concomitant zinc supplementation on the response of iron status indicators and hemoglobin (Hb) to iron supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Zinc may also affect vitamin A metabolism through its involvement in protein synthesis and cellular enzyme functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but there are only a limited number of studies that have evaluated the effect of combined zinc and vitamin A supplementation on vitamin A status, and the results are inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Home fortification of children&#x02019;s foods using small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) providing ~110&#x02013;120&#x000a0;kcal/day (20&#x000a0;g dose) or medium-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (MQ-LNS) providing ~250&#x02013;500&#x000a0;kcal/day (45&#x02013;90&#x000a0;g dose) is a promising strategy to support normal linear growth and development in young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

Thirty-four communities accessible during the rainy season were stratified by health clinic catchment area and randomly allocated to intervention cohort (IC, 25 communities) or non-intervention cohort (NIC, 9 communities), in such a way to ensure balanced cohorts with respect to population size, distance from a paved road, and distance from the city of Bobo-Dioulasso. A total of 3220 children 9&#x02013;10 month of age (~95% of those screened) were enrolled in the study after meeting all the enrollment criteria (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Two colors represented each treatment group, and all participants, field staff, study statistician and investigators were blinded to the intervention groups during the trial. Cluster randomization at the level of the concession was chosen to reduce the risk of cross-contamination within the family compound through food sharing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intervention</title><p>Children in the IC were assigned to receive one of the following daily supplements from 9 to 18 months of age: 1) SQ-LNS without added zinc, and placebo tablet (LNS-Zn0); 2) SQ-LNS with 5&#x000a0;mg added zinc, and placebo tablet (LNS-Zn5); 3) SQ-LNS with 10&#x000a0;mg added zinc, and placebo tablet (LNS-Zn10); or 4) SQ-LNS without added zinc, and 5&#x000a0;mg zinc tablet (LNS-TabZn5). Supplementation of children in IC started the day after the baseline screening. Children in the NIC (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;785) did not receive SQ-LNS or tablets from 9 to 18&#x000a0;months of age, but received SQ-LNS with 10&#x000a0;mg zinc for 9&#x000a0;months beginning at 18 mo of age after the final blood sample was collected. Caregivers in the IC communities were instructed to administer 20&#x000a0;g SQ-LNS per day in two separate servings, preferably mixed in a small portion of the child&#x02019;s meal, and to give the dispersible tablet once daily at least 30&#x000a0;min away from meals. At enrollment and throughout the study, the caregivers were advised to continue breastfeeding and feed diverse foods to the child, and IC caregivers were reminded that SQ-LNS should not replace other components of the diet. Adherence was assessed by obtaining reported information on SQ-LNS and tablet consumption, collecting any remaining SQ-LNS and tablets and empty packages, and by direct observation in a subgroup of children, as reported in more detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>At baseline, all children were treated for anemia, fever, malaria, and caregiver reported diarrhea following the national health policy in Burkina Faso.

Children with a positive rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for malaria received malaria treatment for three days (amodiaquine-artesunate, 1 tablet/d) and an antipyretic (paracetamol, 1/2 tablet/d for three days), and children with confirmed fever and a negative RDT and no other clinical symptoms received paracetamol only for three days. Oral rehydration salts (ORS: 1 sachet/d for 4&#x000a0;days) were given to children with reported diarrhea. Caregivers in the IC were advised to start the supplementation even during illness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Biochemistry subgroup</title><p>A subset of 1065 children from the IC and NIC were randomly selected for the biochemistry subgroup and asked to provide a venous blood sample as described below. The biochemistry subgroup included only one child from a concession to avoid reduced accuracy of estimation due to intra-cluster correlation, and excluded children with reported fever or diarrhea symptoms on the day of enrollment or on the scheduled blood collection day.

ZPP was assessed in capillary blood samples at the field laboratory using a hematofluorometer (206D, AVIV Biomedical Inc., Lakewood, NJ, USA) after a maximum of 4&#x000a0;days of storage in the refrigerator, during which ZPP is considered stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

Logarithm-transformed ROH values were tested for their correlation with logarithm-transformed RBP values from the same child at the same age using the Pearson correlation test, and a linear regression was generated (Proc GLM). There was a high correlation between ROH and RBP measured in the 40 samples (<italic>R</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.78, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001).

In this population, the RBP cutoff corresponding to 0.70&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol ROH/L is 0.94&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol RBP/L. The sensitivity of this population-adjusted cutoff to detect low ROH (&#x0003c;0.70&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L) was 82% and the specificity was 83%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Data analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were carried out using SAS software for Windows (9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). Descriptive statistics (means, geometric means (95% confidence interval) and proportions) were used to assess baseline information by group, and to compare children included in the biochemistry subgroup with those not included. Variables that were not normally distributed were transformed using Box-Cox transformations to find the optimal transformation. Analysis was done with logarithm-transformed variables, which were back transformed for reporting of descriptive results.</p><p>Plasma concentrations of zinc, pF, sTfR and RBP and capillary whole blood ZPP were adjusted categorically for the presence of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Participants were stratified into four inflammation categories based on elevation of one or both acute phase proteins, or no inflammation using the method described by Thurnham et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and cutoffs of 5&#x000a0;mg/L for CRP and 1&#x000a0;g/L for AGP. Body iron stores (BIS) were calculated using the ratio of both adjusted and unadjusted sTfR and pF concentrations using the formula developed by Cook et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Micronutrient deficiencies were defined using the following cutoffs, for both adjusted and unadjusted values: zinc deficiency (pZC &#x0003c;65&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/dL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], anemia (Hb &#x0003c;110&#x000a0;g/L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], iron deficiency [ID, pF &#x0003c;12&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], sTfR &#x0003e;8.3&#x000a0;mg/L, BIS &#x0003c;0&#x000a0;mg/kg, and ZPP &#x0003e;70&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/mol heme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]], and vitamin A deficiency (RBP &#x0003c;0.94&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L).

Breastfeeding and 24&#x000a0;h-complementary feeding indicators were constructed according to World Health Organization guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. 7-day intake of vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables were summarized as continuous scores ranging from 0 to 7. Consumption frequencies of vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables were also categorized dichotomously (&#x0003c;3 or &#x02265;3 d/week). Definitions of infectious diseases identified in IC children are reported in more detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Briefly, diarrhea was defined as caregiver report of three or more liquid or semi-liquid stools during a 24-h period. An episode of diarrhea was defined as the period starting the day the child first had diarrhea preceded and followed by a two-day, diarrhea-free period. Fever was defined as any fever reported by the caregiver or elevated auricular temperature (&#x0003e;37.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C), as measured by the field workers. An episode of fever was defined as the period starting the day the child first had fever preceded and followed by two days when the child had not had fever. Malaria was defined as the presence of reported or confirmed fever during the 24&#x000a0;h preceding the morbidity visit, associated with a positive RDT. An episode of malaria was defined as the presence of a new episode of reported or confirmed fever and a positive malaria RDT obtained &#x0003e;21&#x000a0;days after a previous treated malaria episode.</p><p>Outcomes for inflammation, zinc, iron and vitamin A status and changes in the outcomes between baseline and at 18 months were compared by intervention group and cohort using analysis of covariance for continuous outcome variables and logistic regression for dichotomous variables. Differences in the outcomes between baseline and at 18 months were tested using repeated measurement of covariance for continuous outcomes and the random statement of the logistic regression for dichotomous variables. Analysis included a random effect of the community to account for intra-community correlation. Intervention group and cohort were used as the main effects, and covariates were tested individually in a binary model with the outcome before including the variables with <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.1 in the final model. All the outcomes were adjusted for baseline values. Covariates tested were previously listed in our plan of analysis, which was written before the study code was broken, and included child age, sex, baseline anthropometric characteristics and maternal and household characteristics, study season and 18 months acute phase proteins. Indicators of iron status and RBP were adjusted additionally for baseline RDT, iron supplementation and breastfeeding and 24-h complementary feeding indicators. Covariates which were significantly associated with the outcome were tested for their potential modifying effect of the intervention groups and cohort. We also tested baseline pZC for its potential modifying effect of the intervention cohort and group, and recent high-dose vitamin A supplementation of the intervention groups on RBP at 18 months within the IC. Intervention group means were compared post-hoc using least-square means with the Tukey-Kramer test. Tables report the comparison among the four intervention groups and between the combined intervention groups and the non-intervention cohort (IC vs. NIC). Additional 5-group comparisons were conducted and reported only when deemed helpful to clarify subtle differences in the results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>Among the 1065 children randomly selected for possible participation in the biochemistry sub-group, 66% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;701) were eligible on the scheduled day (i.e. free of symptomatic diarrhea and fever, as reported by the caregiver).

Children who received LNS-Zn10 had a lower adjusted geometric mean pF and BIS compared to LNS-Zn5 (22.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L vs. 30.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.034 for pF; and 2.21&#x000a0;mg/kg vs. 3.35&#x000a0;mg/kg, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.047 for BIS), although the prevalence of low adjusted pF and low adjusted BIS was not significantly different among intervention groups.

In particular, the prevalence of ID fell from 23% to 14% in the IC (a relative change of &#x02212;42%), whereas it did not change in the NIC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Similarly, the prevalence of ID, when defined by adjusted BIS, was significantly different between the two cohorts at 18 months and only fell significantly in the IC over the course of the study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In contrast, the prevalence of elevated adjusted ZPP did not differ by cohort and increased from 96% to 99% (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01). The difference in prevalence of ID between IC and NIC was similar whether or not the indicators were adjusted for inflammation (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). IDA was lower in both cohorts at 18 months, but decreased significantly only in the IC (IDA defined by pF decreased relatively by 51% in the IC vs. 7% in NIC, and IDA defined by sTfR decreased relatively by 63% in the IC vs. 16% in the NIC).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Effect of SQ-LNS combined with malaria and diarrhea treatment on % relative change in prevalence of adjusted indicators of iron deficiency and anemia from 9 to 18&#x000a0;month of age in rural Burkinabe children. * Significantly different between the two cohorts (p &#x0003c; 0.05)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12887_2016_765_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

</p><p>At 18 months, 22% of children reportedly consumed vitamin A-rich fruits at least 3&#x000a0;days during the previous week, and none reportedly consumed vitamin A-rich vegetables with this frequency. There was no relationship between reported consumption of vitamin A rich fruits and RBP concentration. Twelve percent of children in the IC reportedly received a high-dose vitamin A supplement during the month preceding the biochemistry visit at 18 months. However, reported receipt of high-dose vitamin A supplement was not associated with RBP concentration at 18 months. Similarly, RBP concentration at 18 months was not significantly related to baseline pZC, and pZC did not modify the effect of intervention group or cohort on final RBP concentration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Different amounts of zinc provided either in SQ-LNS or as a dispersible zinc tablet did not affect the final pZC or other markers of micronutrient status, except for the lower final mean pF concentration and lower BIS in children who received LNS-Zn10 compared to those who received LNS-Zn5. By contrast, SQ-LNS, provided along with malaria and diarrhea treatment in the intervention cohort, increased the children&#x02019;s final iron status, Hb concentration and vitamin A status, compared with those in the non-intervention cohort. The intervention package also reduced the prevalence of iron deficiency, anemia and IDA, compared with the NIC, although most children remained anemic at 18 months. Hb concentration increased significantly more among children in the IC who participated in the study mostly during the rainy season, when food is generally less available and malaria and diarrhea are more common, suggesting that the benefit may be greatest during periods of food insecurity and/or more frequent infections.</p><p>One third of children had subclinical zinc deficiency at baseline and more than half of all children had subclinical zinc deficiency at endline. Thus, zinc deficiency is a public health concern in the study population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Nevertheless, the lack of a change in pZC after zinc supplementation with the dispersible tablet differs from the results of multiple other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], including a short-term study completed in the same geographic region in which supplements were given under direct observation and produced a sizeable increase in pZC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The lack of change in pZC among children supplemented with zinc tablets in the present study could indicate low adherence to supplementation with tablets or failure to provide the tablets between meals. In fact, we have previously reported that tablet adherence was less than 30% in a subgroup of children who were observed for 12&#x000a0;h at home; and more than half of the time, the tablet was given less than 30&#x000a0;min after either a meal or SQ-LNS had been served, contrary to what was recommended according to the study protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The lack of change in pZC among children who received additional zinc through SQ-LNS is consistent with results from most previous trials that provided supplemental zinc mixed with food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Zinc provided with food is presumably less well absorbed than when provided as a tablet or syrup apart from meals, or the absorbed zinc is metabolized differently post-absorption.</p><p>Zinc supplementation had no effect on Hb concentration and anemia prevalence, regardless of the dose or form of supplementation. This is in agreement with a meta-analysis of zinc supplementation trials, which found that daily zinc supplementation (10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;mg) among children &#x0003c;15&#x000a0;years of age had no effect on Hb concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Zinc supplementation also had no effect on most iron status indicators except for the lower pF concentration and lower BIS found in children who received LNS-Zn10, possibly due to inhibition of iron absorption in the presence of higher amounts of zinc. Nevertheless, iron status was increased by concurrent supplementation of zinc and iron despite the slightly smaller magnitude of response with the higher dose of zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Provision of supplemental zinc did not significantly affect the final prevalence of vitamin A deficiency or mean adjusted RBP at 18 months. Previous studies on the impact of adding zinc to vitamin A supplements on vitamin A status have yielded inconsistent results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Smith suggested that the effect of zinc on response to vitamin A supplementation may be conditioned by the severity of zinc deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This was not confirmed in our study. Although zinc deficiency was a public health concern in the study population baseline pZC had no effect on the response of RBP to zinc supplementation.</p><p>Anemia prevalence was reduced by 20% in the IC, but most children were still anemic at 18 months, and anemia remained a severe public health problem in this population. Because SQ-LNS provided the recommended daily allowance of more than 20 micronutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], including iron, vitamin A and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, other factors, such as malaria, intestinal helminthes, other infections and hemoglobinopathies may have contributed to the high anemia burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, in a separate analysis including only children from the IC, the frequency of malaria episodes during the 9 months of the intervention was not associated with the change in Hb concentration or anemia prevalence at 18 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>At 18 months, the intervention reduced the prevalence of ID by 39&#x02013;45% compared with the NIC, depending on the ID indicator. Almost all children had high ZPP at 18 months, which suggests that ZPP may not be a useful indicator of iron status in this population due to the high burden of malaria and other infections. Previous studies indicate that ZPP values may be falsely increased in individuals with infections, chronic inflammation, hemoglobinopathies and high lead intakes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p>Our findings regarding the effects of SQ-LNS on Hb and iron status are similar to results from LNS interventions in other low-income countries. In a study in Ghana, 6 months old infants supplemented for 6 months with SQ-LNS containing 9&#x000a0;mg iron/daily dose also had increased iron status and lower anemia prevalence compared to a non-intervention group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In a randomized clinical trial in Malawi, moderately malnourished children 6&#x02013;18 months of age who received 25&#x000a0;g/d of a milk-based fortified spread for 12&#x000a0;weeks had a greater change in Hb (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD: 11&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;21&#x000a0;g/L) compared to children who did not receive any supplement (1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;20&#x000a0;g/L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In contrast, supplementation of 6&#x02013;18 months old children with MQ-LNS (46 to 70&#x000a0;g, containing 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g vitamin A, 9&#x000a0;mg iron and 9&#x000a0;mg zinc per 46&#x000a0;g) did not affect iron status, Hb concentration or prevalence of anemia during an efficacy trial in rural Honduras compared to a control population who received, similarly to the intervention population, food vouchers and nutrition counselling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our findings are also similar to results of trials of micronutrient powders (MNP), which provide 12&#x000a0;mg iron, 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g retinol and 5&#x000a0;mg zinc per daily dose. A recent meta-analysis found that daily MNP supplementation among 6&#x02013;23 months old children reduced anemia prevalence by 31% and iron deficiency by 51% compared to placebo or no intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p>The intervention package increased mean plasma RBP concentration, but did not affect the prevalence of low RBP concentration. Similarly, supplementing 6&#x02013;18 months old Honduran children with MQ-LNS containing 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g vitamin A significantly increased plasma retinol concentration after 6 months compared to a control group, although this difference was no longer present after 12 months of supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Our study has several strengths including: 1) the different micronutrient status indicators examined; 2) the large sample size; 3) the continuous training and supervision of field workers responsible for collecting data and obtaining the biological samples; and 4) the post-hoc calculated design effect (1.0&#x02013;1.7) was accounted for by the inflated sample size in the NIC, which shows that our effective sample size has not been reduced greatly for most of the indicators. We also recognize several limitations of our study, which include the lack of an illness treatment only cohort to differentiate between the effect of SQ-LNS supplementation and the effect of malaria and diarrhea treatment. In addition, due to the lack of information on malaria infection at 18 months, we could not adjust pF and RBP for the presence of asymptomatic malaria, as recently proposed by Wessells et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results indicate that supplemental zinc provided in SQ-LNS or as a dispersible tablet increased Hb and vitamin A status. Although children who received SQ-LNS containing 10&#x000a0;mg zinc had a lower pF response than those who received SQ-LNS containing less zinc, there were no group-wise differences in the final prevalence of ID or anemia in the IC. The lack of a change in pZC after supplementation with a zinc tablet containing 5&#x000a0;mg zinc and with SQ-LNS containing 5 or 10&#x000a0;mg zinc suggests possible low adherence to the dispersible tablet and/or poor absorption of supplemental zinc when provided with food, or different post-absorptive metabolism of zinc when absorbed. Despite the lack of an effect of zinc supplementation in this study population, SQ-LNS along with malaria and diarrhea treatment was beneficial in reducing the prevalence of ID and anemia and increasing vitamin A status in young children.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AGP</term><def><p>&#x003b1;-1-acid glycoprotein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BIS</term><def><p>Body iron stores</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p>C-reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IC</term><def><p>Intervention cohort</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ID</term><def><p>Iron deficiency</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IDA</term><def><p>Iron deficiency anemia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIC</term><def><p>Non-intervention cohort</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>pF</term><def><p>Plasma ferritin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>pZC</term><def><p>Plasma zinc concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RBP</term><def><p>Retinol-binding protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROH</term><def><p>Retinol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SQ-LNS</term><def><p>Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>sTfR</term><def><p>Soluble transferrin receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ZPP</term><def><p>Zinc protoporphyrin</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the entire iLiNS-ZINC study staff and especially the biochemistry team.
