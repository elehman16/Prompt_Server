Cardio-metabolic disease risk increases with greater remoteness where specialist services are scarce. Nurse-led interventions are effective for the management of chronic disease. The aim of this clinical trial is to determine whether a nurse-implemented health and lifestyle modification program is more beneficial than standard care to reduce cardio-metabolic abnormalities and future risk of CVD and diabetes in individuals with MetS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">MODERN is a multi-centre, open, parallel group randomized controlled trial in regional Victoria, Australia. Participants were self-selected and individuals aged 40 to 70&#x000a0;years with MetS who had no evidence of CVD or other chronic disease were recruited. Those attending a screening visit with any 3 or more risk factors of central obesity, dyslipidemia (high triglycerides or low high density lipoprotein cholesterol) elevated blood pressure and dysglycemia were randomized to either nurse-led health and lifestyle modification (intervention) or standard care (control). The intervention included risk factor management, health education, care planning and scheduled follow-up commensurate with level of risk. The primary cardio-metabolic end-point was achievement of risk factor thresholds to eliminate MetS or minimal clinically meaningful changes for at least 3 risk factors that characterise MetS over 2&#x000a0;year follow-up. Pre-specified secondary endpoints to evaluate between group variations in cardio-metabolic risk, general health and lifestyle behaviours and new onset CVD and type 2 diabetes will be evaluated. Key outcomes will be measured at baseline, 12 and 24&#x000a0;months via questionnaires, physical examinations, pathology and other diagnostic tests. Health economic analyses will be undertaken to establish the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The MODERN trial will provide evidence for the potential benefit of independent nurse-run clinics in the community and their cost-effectiveness in adults with MetS.

For three of these risk factors, 9% of the Australian adult population are overweight or obese, have dyslipidemia and elevated BP in combination, with 66% of the population having three or more of any behavioural or biomedical risk factor (at the same time) for developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and chronic kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The proportion of adults with antecedent risk for cardio-metabolic disease increases with increasing remoteness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; this geographical pattern of inequality is reflected by higher rates of CVD and diabetes prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and hospitalizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Notwithstanding the definition used to identify subjects with MetS, having multiple risk factors is detrimental to increased disease risk in a dose-response gradient with more components of the MetS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. CVD morbidity and mortality outcomes are between 2 to 2.4-fold higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and stronger for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) risk of between 3 to 5-fold greater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] in individuals with MetS. CVD is the most common clinical sequelae in those with T2DM and MetS itself promotes the development of both of these conditions due to the association between components and atherosclerosis and dysglycemia. Fortunately, in people with MetS, a meta-analysis has demonstrated the benefits of lifestyle and pharmacological interventions for reversal of MetS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and decreased likelihood of developing CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

However, no randomized controlled trial with standard care as the comparator over the longer term to evaluate health benefit and cost-effectiveness of community nurse-led clinics has been established to date in higher risk, non-urban settings.</p><p id="Par8">Therefore, our aim was to assess the effectiveness of a nurse-led clinic program that modulated health and lifestyle factors to reduce cardio-metabolic abnormalities and future risk of CVD and T2DM in individuals with MetS. It was hypothesised that there would be more adults with MetS in the nurse-facilitated health and lifestyle modification group compared to standard care who achieve the primary endpoint of meeting target risk factor thresholds or minimum changes that would be considered clinically significant for any 3 or more risk factors that characterise the MetS over 2&#x000a0;year follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par9">MODERN is a multi-centre, open, parallel group randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of nurse-facilitated health and lifestyle modification (intervention group) vs. standard care (control group) on a primary cardio-metabolic end-point (achievement of risk factor levels to eliminate MetS or minimal clinically meaningful change in risk factor levels for MetS) in at risk regional residents aged between 40 and 70&#x000a0;years.

Census data were used to ensure that a representative sample of the age and sex distribution of each regional community between 40 and 70&#x000a0;years were recruited. The sampling strategy involved large scale promotion of the study to key local workplaces, community groups (e.g. Rotary) and Local Members of Parliament, community engagement at local markets and stalls, direct and indirect postal invitations, radio and newspaper advertising and social media (e.g. Facebook). Individuals responded to participate and a brief screening questionnaire administered via telephone or face-to-face was initially used to determine age and history of CVD or other chronic disease. Eligible participants made an appointment to undergo screening to identify MetS from 26 September 2014 and recruitment was completed on 1 April 2016.

Findings will determine whether a nurse-implemented health and lifestyle modification program is more effective at improving MetS components and other major risk factors for the development of CVD and T2DM compared to standard care in adults who are in jeopardy the most by living away from urban areas where socioeconomic disadvantage is higher and specialist health care increasingly scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Importantly, our longer term study over 2-years with re-evaluation at 5&#x000a0;years of changes in health outcomes and health care utilisation will assess the enduring effect of nurse education and self-care and management coaching on CVD and T2DM prevention. Pending positive results and cost-effectiveness, we envisage more nurse-led clinics to be adopted outside of major cities and encompassing other chronic diseases as a key primary preventative initiative.</p><p id="Par33">The novelty of the MODERN study will establish the feasibility of nurses to safely and effectively screen for the presence of MetS and deliver cardio-metabolic management based on a written protocol that integrates a systematic approach to individual assessment of risk and tailored management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Nurse-led models of care provide the opportunity to maximise the use of finite resources and reserve health professional contacts for higher risk individuals. The response to the MODERN trial results however should not discount the role of general practitioners and specialists in managing chronic disease. In practical terms, MODERN will provide a model that improves the earlier detection and quality of preventative care through clear therapeutic targets for lifestyle change and risk factors, techniques to instigate behaviour change, schedules of follow-up visits and guidance to seek additional GP (or other health professional) input. With MetS driving the twin global epidemics of CVD and T2DM and the extent of the underlying burden imposed by MetS, the model being tested represents a pragmatic utilisation of the potential for nurses to manage cardio-metabolic disease and prevent or delay the development of CVD and/or T2DM.</p><p id="Par34">The detailed health economic evaluation component of the MODERN trial has the distinct advantage to enhance the translation of research findings into sustainable improvements in routine clinical practice and patient outcomes. Supporting health economic analyses are lacking in the Australian context and evidence relating to the cost-effectiveness of nurse-led clinics remains an obstacle to overcome before next generation models of care can improve the quality of preventative health. At present, it is incontrovertible that components of the MetS cause risk for CVD and T2DM and the MetS is an ideal target for risk reduction programs, carried out by nurses with the competence and skill set that uphold cardio-metabolic disease prevention. The results of the MODERN trial will add to the evidence-base for the success or failure of a nurse-led health service delivery of care for combatting the likelihood of CVD and T2DM in individuals with the MetS.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Appreciation to Associate Professor John Furler for contributing to the funding success of the MODERN study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par35">The MODERN study is funded by a Project Grant (ID No. APP1069043) from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia who had no involvement in the design of the study and in writing the manuscript and will play no role in the collection, analysis and interpretation of data to be derived from the study.
