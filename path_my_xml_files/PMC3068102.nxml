However, despite common use of a combination of herbal medicine and acupuncture in clinical practice, the current level of evidence is insufficient to draw a conclusion for an interaction and efficacy of herbal medicine and acupuncture. Therefore, considering these methodological flaws, this study was designed to assess the interaction and efficacy of an available herbal medicine, Keigai-rengyo-to extract (KRTE), and acupuncture for treatment of acne using the 2 &#x000d7; 2 factorial design and the feasibility of a large clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A randomized, assessor single blinded, 2 &#x000d7; 2 factorial pilot trial will be conducted. Forty four participants with acne vulgaris will be randomized into one of four groups: waiting list group (WL), KRTE only group (KO), acupuncture only group (AO), and KRTE and acupuncture combined treatment group (KA). After randomization, a total of 8 sessions of acupuncture treatment will be performed twice a week in the AO- and KA groups, respectively. Patients in the KO- and KA groups will be prescribed KRTE 3 times a day at a dose of 7.4 g after meals for 4 weeks. The following outcome measurements will be used in examination of subjects: the mean percentage change and the count change of inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions, the Skindex 29, visual analogue scale (VAS) and investigator global assessment (IGA) from baseline to the end of the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>The trial is registered with the Clinical Research Information Service (CRiS), Republic of Korea: KCT0000071.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease encountered in dermatology practice; it is caused by changes in pilosebaceous units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It is common in adolescence and may proceed into adulthood, affecting roughly 33% of people between the ages of 15 and 44 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], or affecting nearly 80% of adolescents and young adults aged 11 to 30 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Acne vulgaris is a chronic dermatosis of the pilosebaceous follicle with four fundamental etiopathogenic factors: sebaceous hyperproduction, follicular hyperkeratinization, increase of <italic>Propionibacterium acnes </italic>colonization, and periglandular dermal inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Western medical treatment options generally target one or more of the factors implicated in these acne pathogeneses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] with topical or systemic agents, phototherapy narrowband light (blue or red), and acne vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Despite this treatment for care of acne vulgaris, a substantial number of acne patients widely seek to use traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) due to a lack of response to western medical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and their concern regarding side effects, such as burning, erythema, desquamation, pigmentation, xerosis, and chapped lips, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Herbal medicine and acupuncture are two of the major tools of TCM therapy and have been frequently administered for treatment of acne symptoms in clinical practice worldwide, particularly in East Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In South Korea, Japan, and China, the evidence-based potentiality for safe and effective use of herbal medicine and acupuncture in treatment of acne vulgaris has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, the current level of evidence is poor due to the small number of good quality studies, small sample size, short duration, and variation in the composition of herbal interventions or acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In addition, despite common use of a combination of herbal medicine and acupuncture in clinical practice, these studies have rarely demonstrated an interaction between herbal medicine and acupuncture, and have rarely used a waiting list- or western medical treatment group as a control group.</p><p>Considering these methodological flaws, we will conduct a trial to assess the interaction effect and efficacy of Keigai-rengyo-to extract (KRTE) and acupuncture using the 2 &#x000d7; 2 factorial design and the feasibility of a large clinical trial. KRTE is an herbal medicine that is often prescribed for treatment of acne; it is approved by the Korea Food and Drug Administration. Females, through the menstrual cycle, can be easily affected by the level of sex hormones, such as estrogen and androgen, relevant to increased sebum production, which play a central role in development of acne; therefore, we will restrict the participants to male patients with acne vulgaris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Method/Design</title><sec><title>Objective</title><p>The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and interaction of KRTE in male patients with acne vulgaris and evaluate the feasibility of a large clinical trial.</p><p>The null hypothesis is as follows: (1) there is no interaction of KRTE and acupuncture treatment on mean percent change of inflammatory acne lesions between baseline and the end of the trial; (2) mean percent change of inflammatory acne lesions between baseline and the end of the trial is equal in both the KRTE treatment group and the waiting list group; (3) mean percent change of inflammatory acne lesions between baseline and the end of the trial is equal in both the acupuncture treatment group and the waiting list group.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>This study is a randomized, 2 &#x000d7; 2 factorial, waiting list controlled, assessor single blinded and single-center pilot trial.</p><p>The study will be sequentially conducted as follows: enrollment after screening via inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomization, a treatment period of 4 weeks, and assessment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Flow chart of the study</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-12-82-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Participants and Eligibility</title><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>According to the Korean acne grading system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], patients are divided into 6 grades.

They will take a one-day training course for this trial. This course will include the study protocol, methods for acupuncture treatment, and basic information on clinical research. Eight sessions of acupuncture treatment will be performed twice per week for four weeks in patients who will be assigned to the AO and KA groups. Patients will receive acupuncture treatment at 11 classical acupuncture points and/or <italic>ah shi </italic>points that were randomly selected at papules and nodules on the face by the acupuncture practitioner.

These points will be treated with 0.25 &#x000d7; 30 mm disposable acupuncture needles (Dongbang Co., Korea). Selection of these acupuncture points was based on a literature review and previous studies of acupuncture treatment of acne vulgaris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and from the attending doctor's clinical experience and they will be located according to WHO standard Acupuncture Point Locations in the Western Pacific Region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].

Skindex 29 will be checked at weeks 0 (baseline) and 4 (end of the trial). VAS and IGA will be checked every session from baseline (just before randomization) and through the 4 weeks after randomization. A Lumix DMC-LX2 digital camera (Panasonic, Osaka, Japan) was used to photograph each patient's face, so that inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions could be counted at weeks 0 (baseline) and 4 (end of the trial).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><sec><title>Statistical analysis plan</title><p>Statistical analysis will be conducted on an intension-to-treat basis with a 95% confidence interval using SPSS version 12.0 for Windows.
