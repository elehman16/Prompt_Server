In a recent study, across the different types of cancer, 19% of patients had clinical levels of anxiety, and 12.9% having clinical levels of depression. In addition, other patients had subclinical levels of anxious (22.6%) and depressive (16.5%) symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Many cancer survivors suffer long-term emotional distress with symptoms of anxiety and depression often persisting for years following completion of cancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There is a need for sustainable delivery of effective interventions for depression and anxiety in routine cancer care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>CBT for the treatment of depression and anxiety in cancer</title><p>Fortunately there are clinically effective interventions available for the treatment of clinical depression and anxiety disorders in the cancer setting. A 2012 meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] concluded that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for depression in cancer care while earlier studies found evidence for CBT in treating anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Additionally CBT in cancer care represents good value for money [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The barriers to accessing the clinically and cost-effective evidence based treatment of face-to-face CBT for depression and/or anxiety in the psycho-social context include: under-recognition of the problem by the patients, under-recognition of the need for screening and treatment of emotional health problems within teams and the lack of appropriately trained mental health professionals in many communities to provide evidence based care to cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Leykin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] noted that too few cancer patients and survivors receive evidence-based interventions for psychological difficulties and that &#x0201c;<italic>internet interventions have the potential to fill an important gap in quality cancer care by augmenting limited available mental health services</italic>&#x0201d;. Furthermore, internet interventions overcome privacy and stigma concerns, allow access to therapy at a time and place convenient to the patient, including those living in rural and remote communities, and are reliable, cost-effective and reproducible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Online CBT for emotional health problems comorbid with physical illness</title><p>Online cognitive-behavioural interventions (iCBT) have been demonstrated to be effective for mild to severe anxiety and depression in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and the overall effect-size is comparable to face-to-face CBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. International interest is increasing in harnessing internet delivered interventions, such as iCBT, to tackle emotional health symptoms in patients with comorbid physical health conditions. Trials are underway to evaluate iCBT in treating comorbid emotional health symptoms in Cardiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and Diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>There are numerous online programs, including some iCBT interventions, to assist cancer patients. A 2015 literature analysis identified <italic>five</italic> social support groups, <italic>seven</italic> online systems integrating information and <italic>four</italic> online therapies for psycho-social/physical symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Some programs are beginning to show results. In early stage cancer care, the &#x02018;Finding My Way&#x02019; trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] provided preliminary support for the efficacy of an online intervention that teaches participants skills to adjust and cope after cancer diagnosis. Two further recent small studies have focused on the emotional health of cancer survivors. A recent Dutch RCT evaluated the &#x02018;Cancer Aftercare Guide&#x02019;, a self-management e-Health intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] which showed clinically relevant decreases of depression and fatigue in cancer survivors. An Australian feasibility study specifically for testicular cancer (eTC) survivors showed preliminary results in lowering depressive symptoms in a small group of survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There are now larger trials underway looking at iCBT for severe fatigue in breast cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>However, no intervention has been evaluated in a randomised controlled trial for a clinical depressive and/or anxiety disorder. A pilot program looking an CBT principles in a cancer survivor population with varying depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] &#x0201c;<italic>suggests that properly designed web-based interventions may be effective for reducing depressive symptoms among cancer patients</italic>&#x0201d; and a Canadian feasibility open trial using a transdiagnostic iCBT intervention, in a group of 18 participants, showed the potential of using iCBT to decrease depressive and anxious symptoms in cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>ADAPT and development of iCanADAPT</title><p>The development of iCBT tailored to the cancer context and its integration into clinical care pathways is desirable at a system wide level to allow the integration of physical and emotional treatment. Clinical pathways provide evidence-based recommendations to guide best practice and consistent care for specific patient concerns in homogeneous patient groups. Clinical pathways are desirable at a system wide level to allow increased access to an appropriate level of interventions according to the severity of the patients&#x02019; symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. &#x02018;ADAPT&#x02019;, or the &#x02018;Anxiety and depression pathway program&#x02019;, is a large multi-centred clustered implementation RCT funded by Cancer Institute NSW in 2015. ADAPT will evaluate different strategies of integrating and/or improving psycho-social care pathways in cancer care. One of the strategies included in the ADAPT program is the potential future use of iCBT as a treatment intervention. The &#x02018;iCanADAPT Early&#x02019; iCBT program was developed as part of ADAPT to specifically address the needs of early stage cancer survivors, with a co-morbid clinical depressive and/or anxiety disorder.</p><p>The Clinical Research Unit for Anxiety and Depression (CRUfAD), UNSW at St Vincent&#x02019;s Hospital, Sydney, has developed a number of iCBT programs for anxiety and depressive disorders including a transdiagnostic mixed anxiety and depressive disorder program for the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. CRUfAD modified this proven intervention and further specific cancer content was included. The further content was influenced by current evidence-based cancer-specific face to face CBT and a number of recently developed interventions in heterogeneous cancer patients (Finding my way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], eTC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]), Conquer Fear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]). &#x02018;iCanADAPT Early&#x02019; was iteratively reviewed by an expert panel comprising psycho-oncologists, psychiatrists, and consumers and revised accordingly. The final iCBT program is clinician supervised and delivered over a sixteen- week time period. The course is broken into eight lessons and tailored to the cancer context. The CBT skills incorporated facilitate the processing of cognitive and affective aspects of the cancer experiences and include stress management, problem solving, and other practical skills to manage symptoms.</p><p>Funded by the NSW Institute of Psychiatry, CRUfAD will conduct an RCT of the &#x02018;iCanADAPT Early&#x02019; program, comparing the iCBT intervention to treatment as usual for early stage cancer survivors who meet criteria for a comorbid diagnosis of anxiety and/ or depression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Aims of &#x02018;iCanADAPT Early&#x02019; study</title><p>

At minimum, individual email contact is made to each participant after the completion of Lesson 1 and Lesson 2. Thereafter, further email and/or phone contact will be made to participants depending on their needs. Typical reasons for clinician contact include an increase in distress scores, a participant question relating to content or a participant taking an unexplained break from logging in. Participants will have the opportunity to volunteer feedback about their most recent lesson/week(s) before each subsequent lesson and these responses will occasionally prompt clinician contact.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Treatment as usual (TAU) group</title><p>Participants allocated to the TAU group may access their local general practitioner, community or cancer centre (mental) health services during the course of their waiting period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Clinician guidance for TAU group</title><p>Each participant&#x02019;s questionnaire responses (week 1, 8 and 16) are reviewed. A generic email is sent from the Virtual Clinic system to thank participants for completing their questionnaire. Clinician contact will only be made if there are unexpected high HADS, or K-10 scores, or significant change from the scores previously obtained. Upon completion of the 16-week waiting period, and upon completion of the final set of TAU questions, the participants will transition to iCBT and then receive clinician guidance during their iCBT program as described above.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Measures</title><sec id="Sec21"><title>Primary outcome measure</title></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Hospital anxiety and depression scale, total score (HADS-T)</title><p>The primary endpoint is anxiety and depression severity at post treatment as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Total score (HADS-T) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The HADS was developed as an outcome measure to assess anxiety and depression that avoids reliance on the measurement of somatic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, or insomnia) that may be experienced by people with cancer as part of the presenting illness. HADS-T is a fourteen item self-report questionnaire divided into two sub-scales, HADS-D, depression subscale and HADS-A, an anxiety subscale. The HADS-T is the total HADS score and is the combined score of the depressive and anxiety sub-scales. High scores indicate greater morbidity. This validated measure is widely used in clinical settings and has been validated in cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>
<bold>Kessler-10 Psychological Distress Scale</bold> (K10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]: The K10 contains 10 items ranked on a 5-point scale designed to measure non-specific psychological distress. High scores indicate higher distress. The K10 has been validated in a mixed cancer-type population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, the K10 is a quickly administered online tool and is advantageous for monitoring iCBT patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. For the current study, the time frame was modified to assess psychological distress in the past 2&#x000a0;weeks rather than the past 30&#x000a0;days.</p><p>
<bold>Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale, Question 9</bold> (PHQ9-Q9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]) <bold>and Beck Depression Inventory-II, Item 9</bold> (BDI-II,i9), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]: The HADS-T and the K-10 do not contain questions regarding either a passive death wish or suicidal ideation. Therefore, these two screening questions for &#x02018;better off dead&#x02019; thoughts and suicidality are included in the assessment of patients, and score changes are automatically reported. These questions allow the monitoring clinician to make contact with participants should changes occur.</p><p>
<bold>Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory</bold> (FCRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]: The 42-item Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory was chosen as it is an aggregate score of seven sub-scales ranging from triggers to level of insight into the problem. The FCRI severity subscale is reported to be the most informative regarding a patient&#x02019;s level of fear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. High scores indicate greater fear of cancer recurrence. Possible associations between the FCRI subscale scores and the clinical diagnoses via the ADIS, and/or other determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] including treatment response, will be assessed.</p><p>
<bold>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy &#x02013; General</bold> (FACT-G, version 4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]: The FACT-G is a 33-item general cancer quality-of-life measure. FACT-G has been established as a valid and reliable measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. FACT-G was chosen over other quality of life measures as it has scales looking at the impact of symptoms on relationships and supports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p>
<bold>Credibility and Expectancy/Satisfaction Questionnaire</bold> (CEQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]: At baseline, participants will complete two treatment expectancy questions: (1) &#x0201c;At this point, how logical does the program offered to you seem?&#x0201d; (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0201c;Not at all logical&#x0201d;; 9&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0201c;Very logical&#x0201d;) and (2) &#x0201c;At this point, how successfully do you think this treatment will be in reducing your depression and anxiety symptoms?&#x0201d; (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0201c;Not at all useful&#x0201d;; 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0201c;Very useful&#x0201d;). Following the combined intervention, participants will also rate treatment satisfaction: &#x0201c;How satisfied are you with the skills that this program has taught you to manage your depression and anxiety?&#x0201d; (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0201c;Not at all satisfied&#x0201d;; 9&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0201c;Very satisfied&#x0201d;); &#x0201c;How confident would you be in recommending this treatment to a friend who experiences similar problems?&#x0201d; (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0201c;Not at all confident&#x0201d;; 9&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0201c;Very confident&#x0201d;); followed by two questions about difficulty with the program and requesting additional feedback, which will require free text responses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Data management</title><p>All data will be collected via the Virtual Clinic software and stored on the Virtual Clinic server. All information collected will be coded with a participant identification number to allow data-to-patient matching. Additional clinical material not obtained via the online application, mainly pertaining to data obtained via the diagnostic intake interview, will be collected and stored in written format in a secure location in CRUfAD. Any identifiable information will remain confidential, except as required by law. Only members of the site research team will have access to participant information and data in order to monitor patient progress. During data analysis, re-identifiable data (i.e. coded data) will be used. At study completion, non-identifiable data will be written to a password-protected database. All data will be extracted from the Virtual Clinic servers. Analysis will be conducted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).</p><p>Participants will be informed in writing that the research team plans to disseminate the trial results in peer-reviewed scientific publications and presentations. Participants are informed that in any such dissemination, their anonymity will be maintained. Participants will be sent (via email) a written summary of the results in lay terms following completion of the trial study phase.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>There is no prior published research outlining effectiveness of iCBT for treatment of a clinical depression or anxiety disorder in a cancer setting. In order to calculate sample size, data was taken from published randomised controlled trial of a transdiagnostic iCBT program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Assuming the effect size of &#x0003e;0.6, and taking power at 80% with alpha set at 0.05%, sample size is calculated to be 44 per group. This is to detect a 0.6 effect size for the iCBT group to improve more than the treatment as usual group. Recruitment of 50 per group will be undertaken to account for attrition.</p><p>All analyses will be conducted at conclusion of the trial period, i.e. when all participants in the treatment group have completed the iCBT program. All analyses will be implemented in SPSS. Consideration will be given to the stratification into &#x02018;active treatment&#x02019; and &#x02018;post-treatment&#x02019;.</p><p>Significance testing of group differences regarding demographic data and pre-treatment measurements will be conducted using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and <italic>&#x003c7;</italic>2 where the variables consist of nominal (or categorical) data. Intent-to-treat (ITT) mixed models using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation will be used to account for missing data due to participant drop-out. Mixed models do not assume that the last measurement is stable (the last observation carried forward assumption) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. REML models are appropriate for RCTs with multiple time points and pre-to post-only designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The assumption that data are missing at random (MAR) will be evaluated using binary logistic regression to predict drop-out (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no drop-out, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;drop-out) and by comparing these two groups on baseline measures. Significant effects will be followed up with pairwise contrasts comparing mean pre-treatment to mean post-treatment scores. Mediation analyses will be used to examine the association between change in depression and anxiety symptoms over treatment and change in each of FCRI and FACT-G in separate analyses. Tests of the indirect effects (mediation) will be conducted using PROCESS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Discussion</title><p>This RCT will evaluate the efficacy of an iCBT intervention for clinical depression and/or anxiety in people with early stage cancer going through treatment or post-treatment. As the majority of e-health interventions in psycho-oncology to date focus on supportive care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], this is a novel program as it will evaluate iCBT in clinical depression and/or anxiety. Fortunately, cancer survivors have an overall &#x0201c;positive attitude&#x0201d; to self-management and e-Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p>If proven efficacious, and acceptable to patients, the iCBT intervention would be added to the armoury of psychological treatments offered to cancer survivors suffering from anxiety and depression symptoms generally. It will be a core component of the forthcoming ADAPT Cluster Randomized Controlled trial. Moorey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] importantly asked in 2013 &#x0201c;<italic>I know they are distressed, what do I do now?&#x0201d;.</italic>, He outlines that, despite many advances in Psycho-Oncology, services need to incorporate less labour intensive methods of delivery of therapy (primarily CBT), in order to be widely accessible and sustainable. He proposed that internet therapy will have a role in the changing interface of how care is provided in the cancer setting. This trial will add to the research aiming to address the short fall he outlines. It will add to recent work on the role of online interventions in other areas of supportive care, such as fatigue and acute distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], for people living with, or survivors of cancer. As an RCT aiming to recruit over 100 participants, it will add to the literature base and build on the pilot and feasibility studies in this area of psycho-oncology. Furthermore this trial will add to the growing literature of the use of iCBT for treating emotional health problems in patients with a co-morbid physical illness.</p><p>Online, or internet, interventions are easy to access, including in rural areas, accessible by the user at any time, private and confidential, self-empowering, scalable and cost-effective and can meet the needs of most patients, freeing staff to see only the most severe cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As Mitchell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] pointed out &#x0201c;<italic>screening is generally ineffective without aftercare</italic>&#x0201d;; hopefully iCBT can become a viable, evidence-based treatment option in the future, thereby increasing treatment afforded to patients screening positive for distress and depression.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p>Trial registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12616000231448, registered 19<sup>th</sup> February 2016 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/">www.anzctr.org.au</ext-link>).
