Various surgical treatment options are available, however no statistically significant differences have been found between the different surgical treatments. This supports the suggestion that the improvement might be a result of the post-operative rehabilitation rather than the surgery itself. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has become a recognized treatment option for larger cartilage lesions in the knee. Although ACI has been compared to other surgical treatment such as microfracture and mosaicplasty, it has never been directly compared to simple arthroscopic debridement and rehabilitation alone.

However, these characteristics come with a cost. It is aneural and avascular which explains its limited ability to self-repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Damage to the cartilage, which is common in young active adults, will therefore lead to permanent damage. These injuries are very common, with a reported prevalence of 12&#x000a0;% in the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Focal cartilage lesions predispose to development of early onset osteoarthritis, which in turn may lead to long rehabilitation periods and loss of function and time off work. Musculoskeletal problems are one of the major reasons for workers compensation and especially for younger patients this may lead to a significant reduced quality of life and loss of income [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Treatment of symptomatic cartilage injuries in the knee is therefore of particular interest and importance to the patient, the surgeon and the society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The ideal treatment for isolated cartilage injuries aims at recreating a healthy hyaline-type tissue with similar strength and durability as the normal cartilage in the rest of the joint. Current surgical treatment options include debridement, microfracture, autologous osteochondral transplantation (mosaicplasty) and autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Several studies conclude that microfracture is not effective for larger lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The purpose of arthroscopic debridement is to remove loose intraarticular tissue debris and inflammatory mediators down to the subchondral bone, but not through it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. ACI attempts to re-implant the patient&#x02019;s own chondrocytes over the defect to permit the chondrocytes to heal back onto the bone and mature into a hyaline-like cartilage. ACI have been directly compared to microfracture and mosaicplasty in randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The results indicate improved knee function in (carefully selected) patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], but studies have been criticized for methodological weaknesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The Cochrane database reported that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that ACI is superior to other treatment strategies for treating full thickness cartilage defect of the knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>No statistically significant differences have been found between the different surgical treatments. This supports the suggestion that the improvement might be a result of the post-operative rehabilitation rather than the surgery itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, inclusion in a clinical trial is known to improve symptoms by itself, known as the Hawthorne effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>All studies on cartilage reconstructive surgery have put the patients through a strict, careful, intensive and prolonged rehabilitation following the procedure, which could contribute to the clinical improvement observed. Wondrasch and co-workers implemented an active rehabilitation program in 48 patients with focal cartilage damage to a weight-bearing area of the knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. None of the patients had any form of surgery to their injury. After three months there was a statistical significant and clinical meaningful improvement in KOOS score, load progression and hop score, to the point where 31 (65&#x000a0;%) of the patients declined further surgery for their cartilage lesion. This indicates that good results can be achieve with physiotherapy alone. Dozin and coworkers compared ACI versus mosaicplasty, where all candidates where evaluated arthroscopically with debridement of the lesion 6&#x000a0;months prior to definitive treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. All candidates completed an intensive rehabilitation protocol following the debridement, but before the cartilage surgery. This included non-weight bearing for two weeks and immediate active and passive physiotherapy. After two weeks isometric and proprioception exercises were introduced, as well as gradually strengthening exercises. 31&#x000a0;% of the candidates experienced substantial clinical improvement following the debridement and physiotherapy alone, and needed no further (surgical) treatment, questioning the need for cartilage treatment as a first port of call in such patients. The authors conclude that further randomized clinical trials are needed, where ACI should be compared to debridement alone. This is a missing link in our knowledge of cartilage reconstructive surgery and hampers further progression in cell therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Purpose of this study</title><p>The purpose of this trial is to compare autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) with arthroscopic debridement (AD) in symptomatic cartilage injuries larger than 2&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> in patients aged 18&#x02013;50 years old in regard to both subjective and objective variables at predefined times as described under &#x0201c;variables&#x0201d; in section 6.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study is part of &#x0201c;The Norwegian Cartilage Project (NCP): A multidisciplinary Approach to Improve the Treatment of Injured Articular Cartilage&#x0201d;, which is a total of five studies regarding cartilage injuries in the knee, including clinical trials, register studies and basic research studies.</p><p>This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled study with 2 treatment arms (ACI and AD).

The online survey will continue as long as the patient is under the care of a physiotherapist, while the training diary will be continued to the end of the project (24&#x000a0;months) to estimate the amount of home exercise performed by the patient.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Phase 1 - Accomodation</title><p>Inpatient rehabilitation consists of placing the leg in a Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) machine within the range as tolerated due to pain and swelling, aiming to achieve 30&#x02013;70&#x000b0; day 1 after surgery. The patients should use the machine for 6&#x02013;8 h every 24&#x000a0;h. The physical therapist instructs the patients in exercises such as active dorsiflexion/ plantar flexion of the ankle to encourage lower extremity circulation and isometric contraction of the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gluteal musculature to maintain muscle tone and minimize muscle loss. This also includes abduction exercises for the hip. The patients remain non-weight bearing for two weeks, but are allowed touch-down weight-bearing (the foot or toes may touch the floor, but not support any weight) through the affected limb using crutches.</p><p>When discharged from the hospital, the patients are encouraged to continue range of motion exercises; flexion/extension of the knee 500 repetitions three times a day. In this phase, 2 to 3 supervised physical therapy sessions are scheduled for each patient. Interventions such as ice, compression, electrical muscle stimulation, muscle activation of the quadriceps, hamstrings, gastrocnemius and gluteal muscles and gait training is included. Swimming is allowed when the wounds are healed.</p><p>After two weeks, protected weight-bearing is carefully introduced within the pain threshold and gradually increased up to full weight-bearing (continues into phase 2). Crutches are used until the patient walks normal without limping.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Phase 2 - Rehabilitation</title><p>The patients attends 2 or more supervised physical therapy sessions per week, in addition they perform 1 to 2 unsupervised training sessions per week. Cardiovascular training on a stationary bike and progressive knee and hip resistance training and neuromuscular training are performed in this phase. All strengthening exercises are performed with both the injured and uninjured limbs. When full weight-bearing is achieved, long distance walking with increasing distances is encouraged and cross-country skiing can be allowed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Phase 3 - Return to activity/sport</title><p>This phase is individualized according to the goals for each patient. The patients attend 1 or more supervised sessions per week, in addition they perform resistance training for a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4 sessions per week. Cardiovascular and neuromuscular training can be performed daily. Where a return to sport is planned, it is important that sport-specific activities are included as functional progressions within the rehabilitation program.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Outcome measures (dependent variables)</title><sec id="Sec17"><title>Demographics</title><p>Demographics to be collected at inclusion is age, gender, height (cm), weight (kg), BMI, injury mechanism (if any), previous medical history, current medication, smoking, social status, work status and nationality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Primary endpoint</title><p>The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is a patient reported outcome measure validated to use in cartilage research studies and will enable comparison of our results with other reports. It assesses five domains; pain, symptoms, activity of daily living, sport and recreational function and knee-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. KOOS knee-related quality of life (QoL) subscore is the primary endpoint, where the primary aim is the difference in KOOS QoL subscore in the ACI group compared to the AD group at 2&#x000a0;years follow up. There will not be any interim analysis before 2&#x000a0;years follow up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Secondary endpoints</title><p>A combination of self-explanatory questionnaires, clinical parameters, clinical hop tests and radiographs and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be used as secondary endpoints. The secondary aims will be the difference between the two treatment groups and within the group at predefined times as described below. The secondary aims are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>KOOS score: all subscores except the knee-related QoL subscore which is the primary aim.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Tegner score; To evaluate the level of physical activity.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Lysholm score; A condition-specific outcome score containing eight domains; limp, locking, pain, stair-climbing, use of support, instability, swelling and squatting.</p></list-item><list-item><p>EQ-5D; A generic measure of health status that provides a simple descriptive profile used in the clinical evaluation of health care.

The normality of continuous data will be assessed by examining the histograms. If necessary, a suitable transformation will be considered to symmetrize the data.</p><p>Due to along follow-up period with 5 (7) measurement points, repeated observations will be available for each patient. A mixed model correctly adjusting for intra-patient correlations will be used to assess the trend in primary and secondary end-points. The model will contain random effects for intercepts and slopes, if significant. Fixed effects for time (likely non-linear) and group will be included together with the interaction between the two. The interaction will quantify possible differences between arms regarding time profiles and serve as an omnibus test. For continuous end-points, linear mixed model will be estimated, while generalized linear model will be fitted to dichotomous end-points. Relevant pairwise comparisons will be performed by deriving individual time point contrasts within each study arm. The results will be presented as estimated means of odds ratios together with the corresponding 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals (CI) and <italic>p</italic>-values. The estimates will further be adjusted for possible confounders such as age of the patient and severity of the cartilage lesion in the multivariate regression models.</p><p>The results with <italic>p</italic>-values below 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Two-sided tests will be used. The data analysis will be conducted using SPSS v.22 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) and SAS v 9.4.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Sample size</title><p>It has previously been shown that a change in subscore of 8&#x02013;10 of KOOS QoL (quality of life) is clinically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Therefore, for power analysis a difference in change of 10 between two treatment groups was assumed. A SD for change of 15 was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. With the power of 80&#x000a0;% and significance level of 5&#x000a0;% the estimated minimum number of patients was 37 in each group. By adding 10&#x000a0;% due to loss during follow-up, we therefore plan to include a total of 82 patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Risk assessment</title><p>Some patients may find it unpleasant when asked about demographic information. The treatment of choice in this patient population is not established, but standard clinical care include both arthroscopic debridement (AD) and autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). There are no additional risks of this study other than the potential risks of standard clinical practice.</p><p>Potential risk of AD is rare with a frequency&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;% and include infection, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), arthralgia, headache, joint effusion/swelling, nasopharyngitis.</p><p>Potential risk of ACI is rare, but slightly higher than for AD, as this treatment involves a second operation with a mini-opening of the knee. Four major complications requiring surgery following ACI have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Malfusion of the repair tissue to the bed of the lesion (3.8&#x000a0;%)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Delamination of healthy cartilage near lesion (2.8&#x000a0;%)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Hyperthrophy of the repair tissue (&#x0003e;2&#x000a0;%)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Insufficient degenerative tissue (&#x0003e;2&#x000a0;%)</p></list-item></list></p><p>Other complications are rare and occurs in&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;% of patients, such as wound break down, infection, DVT and joint stiffness.</p><p>Both treatments have a risk of failure, meaning that the pain and stiffness in the knee does not improve despite surgery, and further surgery might be required.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><p>The treatment of isolated full thickness cartilage lesions of the knee is difficult, and various surgical techniques are available. Since its introduction in the late 1980s Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation has become a recognize method for larger lesions. This method is costly and demands patience and strict compliance from the patients. The results have been promising, but the method has not been directly compared to physiotherapy. This study will therefore answer pertinent questions regarding the added benefit of ACI compared to physical rehabilitation alone. The results will help surgeons improve clinical outcome after cartilage injuries of the knee.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACI</term><def><p>autologous chondrocyte implantation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AD</term><def><p>arthroscopic debridement</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ADL</term><def><p>activity of daily living</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AHUS</term><def><p>Akershus University Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AOT</term><def><p>autologous osteochondral transplantation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPM</term><def><p>Continuous Passive Motion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DVT</term><def><p>deep vein thrombosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Eq5D</term><def><p>European quality of life five dimensions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HKA</term><def><p>hip knee ankle</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICRS</term><def><p>International Cartilage Repair Society</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ISPOR</term><def><p>International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KOOS</term><def><p>knee injury and osteoarthirtis outcome score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mmHg</term><def><p>millimeter of mercury</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRI</term><def><p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NaCl</term><def><p>sodium chloride</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NCP</term><def><p>The Norwegian Cartilage Project</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OD</term><def><p>osteochondritis dissicans</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p>quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT-CEA</term><def><p>Randomized Clinical Trial-Cost-Effectiveness Analysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROM</term><def><p>range of motion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>visual analogue scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>PHR Drafted and edited the protocol, performed literature search and lead the project group.
