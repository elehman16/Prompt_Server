The WHO includes women of reproductive age as a high-risk group for infection. The primary consequence of infection in this population is anaemia. During lactation, anaemia may contribute to reduced quality and quantity of milk, decreasing the duration of exclusive breastfeeding and lowering the age at weaning. To date, no study has investigated the effects of maternal postpartum deworming on infant or maternal health outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A single-centre, parallel, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial will be carried out in Iquitos, Peru, to assess the effectiveness of integrating single-dose 400&#x02005;mg albendazole into routine maternal postpartum care. A total of 1010 mother-infant pairs will be randomised to either the intervention or control arm, following inhospital delivery and prior to discharge. Participants will be visited in their homes at 1, 6, 12 and 24&#x02005;months following delivery for outcome ascertainment. The primary outcome is infant mean weight gain between birth and 6&#x02005;months of age. Secondary outcomes include other infant growth indicators and morbidity, maternal soil-transmitted helminth infection and intensity, anaemia, fatigue, and breastfeeding practices. All statistical analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Research ethics board approval has been obtained from the McGill University Health Centre (Canada), the Asociaci&#x000f3;n Civil Impacta Salud y Educaci&#x000f3;n (Peru) and the Instituto Nacional de Salud (Peru). A data safety and monitoring committee is in place to oversee study progression and evaluate adverse events. The results of the analyses will be published in peer-reviewed journals, and presented at national and international conferences.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01748929.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>albendazole</kwd><kwd>helminthiasis</kwd><kwd>PARASITOLOGY</kwd><kwd>postpartum</kwd><kwd>randomised controlled trials</kwd><kwd>intervention study</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This is the first study to evaluate the effectiveness of postpartum deworming on maternal and infant health outcomes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Results of this trial will provide empirical evidence to inform the WHO recommendation for deworming in women of reproductive age.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A large sample size (n=1010) allows for high-powered primary and secondary analyses.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This is a single-centre trial which can affect generalisability of the results to other areas with different prevalence profiles and transmission patterns of soil-transmitted helminth infections.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study is limited to soil-transmitted helminth infections and does not include the other parasitic infections.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s1a"><title>Background</title><p>Worldwide, over two billion people are infected with intestinal worms (hookworm, <italic>Ascaris</italic> and <italic>Trichuris</italic>), collectively referred to as the soil-transmitted helminths (STHs).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> STH infections discriminate across socioeconomic strata, such that the most vulnerable individuals, who reside in areas where adverse health, social, and economic outcomes predominate, carry the greatest disease burden. The WHO and other organisations consider women of reproductive age to be a high-risk group for STH infection primarily because of the anaemia that is caused by hookworm<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and <italic>Trichuris</italic><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> (whipworm) infections. This exacerbates the already increasing iron requirements of pregnancy, with iron deficiencies extending into the early lactation period.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> More than 50% of pregnant women, especially in developing countries, are estimated to be anaemic.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> During lactation, anaemia is thought to adversely affect milk production, which can decrease the duration of exclusive breastfeeding and lower the age at weaning,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and ultimately impact negatively on infant growth.</p><p>Lactating women in developing countries are at risk of suffering from a shortage of dietary fat and micronutrient deficiencies due to a suboptimal diet and parasitic infections, including STHs, which compete for micronutrients, like iron.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The consequences of co-occurring malnutrition and infection in a new mother may include an impact on breast milk composition<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>and subsequently, negatively affect the nutritional status of infants.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> STH infections can cause reduced absorption of dietary fat leading to lower energy intake and inadequate absorption of vitamin A. Reduced transfer of vitamin A into breast milk may cause insufficient vitamin A acquisition in infant liver stores, leading to vitamin A deficiency over the first 6&#x02005;months of life and beyond.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Although maternal iron stores do not directly affect breast milk concentrations of iron,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> maternal anaemia may play a role in the frequency and duration of breastfeeding due to reduced energy levels.</p><p>To date, no study has investigated the effect of providing deworming treatment to women during the early postpartum period on infant or maternal health outcomes. In effect, the WHO recommendation to specifically include lactating women within the high-risk group of women of reproductive age in deworming campaigns<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> is based on expert opinion and not on empirical evidence. Systematic reviews on deworming have, however, been conducted on other subgroups of women in the reproductive age (eg, non-pregnant, non-lactating women; pregnant women). A 2010 systematic review on deworming in non-pregnant populations<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> included two studies of women in the reproductive age: one trial<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> that specifically excluded lactating women, and one observational study<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> that included lactating women, but in which lactation status was not ascertained. Four trials to date<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;19</xref> have been conducted in pregnant populations, and are summarised in three systematic reviews.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> None of these trials used the same intervention (ie, the same anthelminthic and micronutrient combination) or had the same follow-up time frame. While data from pregnant populations are of value, given the different nature of the interface between mother and child at the time of deworming, it is unclear whether the results are generalisable to lactating women.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Rationale</title><p>Malnutrition is the leading cause of mortality in children under 5&#x02005;years of age in developing countries, with over 150 million children classified as underweight, stunted and/or wasted.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Poor nutrition predisposes children to infection, leading to increased risk of mortality,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> higher risk of cognitive deficits, lower educational achievement and lower productivity as adults,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> thus perpetuating the poverty cycle into future generations. The health of mothers and young children are intimately intertwined, and the 1000-days period from conception to the age of 2&#x02005;years is a crucial time in shaping the health and development of children.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> It is within this critical window when interventions can have the greatest impact on future health throughout the entire lifespan.</p><p>Deworming has been shown to be one of the safest and most cost-effective interventions for reducing disease burden in endemic countries, and is the cornerstone of prevention and control measures against STH infections.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> There is evidence from veterinary research in ruminants that has shown that worm infections can negatively affect the quality of milk and impair production.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In addition to modifying the nutritional and immunological composition of milk,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> worm infections also suppress energy and protein availability prior to parturition,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> which can influence feeding behaviours. Administration of deworming treatment has been shown to improve milk production in cattle.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>The proposed deworming intervention is expected to improve capacity for breastfeeding, and quality and quantity of milk transfer to infants by reducing maternal anaemia, improving appetite and increasing energy levels. Mothers with improved nutritional status and enhanced energy levels may be more likely to initiate and continue exclusive breastfeeding to the 6-month recommended time point, and beyond. Additionally, improved maternal nutritional status may influence the passage of certain nutrients (eg, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B-6 and vitamin B-12, among others<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) to breast milk during breastfeeding. This may, in turn, improve nutritional status of infants, and enhance their growth and development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008560F1">figure 1</xref>). Integration of deworming into early postpartum care, therefore, has the potential to improve health outcomes for two vulnerable populations simultaneously.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015008560F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Proposed mechanism for the effect of soil-transmitted helminth infections on maternal and infant health.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015008560f01"/></fig><p>The aim of the current study is to provide rigorous empirical evidence on the benefits and underlying biological mechanisms of maternal postpartum deworming in STH-endemic areas in order to inform global public health policy.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Research objectives</title><sec id="s1c1"><title>Primary research objective</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To determine the effectiveness of maternal postpartum deworming on mean weight gain in infants between birth and six months of age.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s1c2"><title>Secondary research objectives</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To determine the effectiveness of maternal postpartum deworming on the following infant outcomes: (A) weight and height indices (ie, z-scores for weight-for-age, weight-for-height and height-for-age); and (B) infant morbidity (ie, occurrence of diarrhoea, respiratory illness, fever, and ear infection in the previous 2&#x02005;weeks).</p></list-item><list-item><p>To determine the effectiveness of maternal postpartum deworming on the following maternal outcomes: (A) STH infection and intensity; (B) anaemia; (C) self-reported fatigue; and (D) self-reported breastfeeding practice.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To determine the effectiveness of maternal postpartum deworming on indicators of breast milk quality, and quantity.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>A parallel, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) will be used to examine the effectiveness of integrating single-dose albendazole administration into routine in-hospital maternal postpartum care on infant and maternal health outcomes, in Iquitos, Peru.

An estimate of mean weight gain was obtained from data on children aged between 5 and 7&#x02005;months residing in Bel&#x000e9;n in 2010. The estimate of 4.24&#x02005;kg with a SD of 1.01&#x02005;kg is the weight gain expected in the placebo group.

<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> However, since the intervention for the proposed trial is given to women rather than infants, and since there is the possibility for effect dilution (ie, treating both STH infected and non-infected mothers), a mean weight gain difference of at least 200&#x02005;g is expected between the two intervention groups.
