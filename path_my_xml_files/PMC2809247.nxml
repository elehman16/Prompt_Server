In this setting, when laboratory monitoring is limited, establishing its safety is crucial, particularly when toxicity may be potentially higher due to the high burden and often additive effects of infection, malignancy or malnutrition.</p><p>There are very limited clinical data on the pharmacokinetic interaction of azoles and nevirapine. A healthy volunteer study suggested that co-administration of 200 mg of itraconazole daily and 200 mg of nevirapine daily did not increase nevirapine concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP451C8">8</xref></sup> In contrast, a retrospective Thai study suggested that co-administration of fluconazole (200 or 400 mg daily) increased mean trough nevirapine concentrations from 6.5&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;3.0 mg/L in those not taking fluconazole to 9.8&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;4.3 and 12.2&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;6.8 mg/L in those taking it (200 and 400 mg, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP451C9">9</xref></sup> In our prospective study with controls, we have demonstrated an almost 30% increase in total exposure (AUC) to nevirapine when taking fluconazole.</p><p>Hepatic toxicity is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication among HIV-infected individuals who receive nevirapine as part of their antiretroviral regimen. Asymptomatic hepatitis occurs in 8%&#x02013;28% of individuals and clinical hepatitis occurs in &#x0223c;1%&#x02013;5%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP451C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP451C10">10</xref></sup> The rate of severe biochemical hepatotoxicity (defined as transaminases &#x0003e;5&#x000d7; ULN) in our main cohort was 5.2% and 6.3% in the fluconazole and placebo arms, respectively. Despite the increased exposure of nevirapine in patients receiving fluconazole, we could find no evidence of a concentration&#x02013;toxicity relationship. This may be partially explained by data suggesting that dose-dependent hepatotoxicity does not occur until nevirapine concentrations are &#x0003e;6000&#x02013;8000 ng/mL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP451C11">11</xref></sup> In this study, the median <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> for those taking fluconazole and nevirapine was 6546 ng/mL. The lack of increased risk of hepatotoxicity with co-administration is also in keeping with Thai data that did not detect increased toxicity, despite increases in trough nevirapine concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP451C9">9</xref></sup></p><p>There are caveats to the interpretation of this study. The dose of fluconazole used for prophylaxis (200 mg three times per week) was relatively low and there is a potential for higher treatment doses of 400&#x02013;800 mg per day to cause even greater elevations of nevirapine concentrations. The absence of increased rates of hepatotoxicity in the main study overall does need to be interpreted in the context that study participants were at low risk for nevirapine hepatotoxicity with normal transaminases at baseline, had relatively low CD4 cell counts, had been on nevirapine for a median of 55 weeks and the hepatitis B and C status of participants was uncertain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP451C4">4</xref></sup> Nevertheless, this study clearly demonstrates that despite significant increases in exposure when nevirapine was co-administered with 200 mg of fluconazole three times a week, this was not associated with evidence of hepatotoxicity and gives reassurance for the use of these two agents together in settings when monitoring is not available.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was funded by the Medical Research Council, UK (grant number G0100035).
