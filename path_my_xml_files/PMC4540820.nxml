muscle thickness. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-seven chronic low back pain patients
participated in this study. Each participant was randomly assigned to one of three
exercise groups, namely, a prone bridge exercise group, supine bridge exercise on a Swiss
ball group, and supine bridge exercise group. The thicknesses of the transverse abdominis
(TrA), internal oblique (IO), and external oblique (EO) were measured using ultrasound.
[Results] After eight weeks of training, the three groups showed significant increases in
the thicknesses of the TrA, IO, and EO. Among the groups, TrA and IO showed significantly
different muscle thicknesses. [Conclusion] The prone bridge exercise significantly
affected the thicknesses of the TrA, IO, and EO unlike the supine bridge exercises. Based
on the results of this study, the prone bridge exercise is a more effective method to
improve trunk stability than conventional supine bridge exercises.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Bridge exercise</kwd><kwd>Muscle thickness</kwd><kwd>Chronic low back pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is one of the common health problems in modern society, with
70&#x02013;80% of the population having experienced back pain at least once in their lifetime<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Picavet and Haxes<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that 27% of the European population suffers from
CLBP. People with CLBP show more muscle atrophy, especially of the lumbar deep muscles<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Movement limited by low back pain causes morphological changes in the lumbar muscles that
induce decreased muscle strength and endurance<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Decreased muscle strength and endurance negatively affect lumbar
stability and eventually cause functional limitations<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Back pain in the lumbar area weakens the lumbar flexors and extensors<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Specifically, aside from the erector spinae and other
abdominal muscles, the transverse abdominis of low back pain patients is weaker than that of
healthy people<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Back pain diminishes
activity levels and results in muscle atrophy, with decreased muscle strength and a
decreased sectional area of the muscles around the spine. As endurance and flexibility
decrease due to these reasons, the range of back movement becomes limited<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recent studies on and treatments for CLBP have been focused on increasing trunk stability
to minimize recurrent episodes and maximize prevention. The main topics of these studies are
trunk stability and the muscles involved in spine alignment and posture<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Trunk muscles are co-activated to stabilize the trunk.
Therefore, the co-activation of the trunk muscles is necessary to achieve trunk stability
and to prevent and treat back pain<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Many studies have suggested trunk stability exercises in different positions with or without
an unstable platform device to strengthen the co-activation of trunk muscles<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Bridge exercises are the most commonly used among the trunk
stability exercises with different positions. Back pain patients are comfortable in assuming
the bridge position and pain is reduced. Moreover, bridge exercises activate the superficial
and deep trunk muscles at an appropriate ratio and strengthen the gluteus and lower leg
muscles<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In previous studies, prone
bridge exercises activated the rectus abdominis, external oblique, and internal oblique more
than supine bridge exercises<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, and prone
bridge exercises on a Swiss ball activated the rectus abdominis and external oblique more
than supine bridge exercises<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study aimed to compare the effects of conventional supine bridge exercises and prone
bridge exercises on trunk muscle thickness to determine which type of exercise is more
efficient.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 37 patients (13 males and 24 females) with CLBP participated in this study. For
patients with chronic lumbar pain, basic physical therapy (H/P, ICT, and U/S) was performed

The subjects understood the experimental purpose and methods and agreed
voluntarily to participate in the study. All the participants read and signed an informed
consent form approved by the local ethics committee of the Catholic University of Daegu.</p><p>All participants were randomly assigned to one of the three exercise groups (supine bridge
exercise, supine bridge on a Swiss ball exercise, and prone bridge exercise). First, the
participants in the supine bridge exercise group (Exercise 1) performed the bridge exercise
in the supine position with their knee joints at 90 degrees, both arms spread at about 30
degrees, and both hands on the ground. They kept their head and neck in a straight position,
with their eyes looking at the ceiling. Second, the participants in the supine bridge on a
Swiss ball exercise group (Exercise 2) performed the same exercise as the Exercise 1 group,
but they placed their legs on a Swiss ball. Lastly, the prone bridge exercise group
(Exercise 3) performed the bridge exercise in a prone position with their elbows at 90
degrees, their bodies supported by their forearms and toes, their neck slightly extended,
and their eyes looking toward the front. The subjects performed three sets of five reps for
each exercise, which consisted of 30&#x02005;s work and 30&#x02005;s rest periods, on three days each week.
The exercise programs were conducted for eight weeks at a designated training facility under
the supervision of a trained physical therapist who ensured that each subject performed the
exercises correctly.</p><p>To measure trunk muscle thickness, ultrasonography (Sonoace 6000, Medison, Republic of
Korea) with a frequency of 6&#x02013;8.5&#x02005;MHz and a gain range of 20&#x02013;80 was conducted. Ultrasound
images of the TrA, EO, and IO were obtained in B-mode with a 7.5&#x02005;MHz linear transducer. To
minimize the difference between testers, one trained physical therapist participated as an
examiner. During measurement, the subjects were in a supine position with a pillow under
their knees. The ultrasound transducer was positioned at the intersection point between a
line from the anterior superior iliac crest to the midaxillary area and a horizontal line
passing through the belly button<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.
All images were collected at the end of normal exhalation to control for the influence of
respiration on the transverse abdominis<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Image acquisition was performed three times, and the mean values
were used for statistical analysis.</p><p>The data were analyzed using PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS Inc.). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used
to verify the normal distribution of the variables. A paired t-test was used to determine
the changes in the trunk muscle thicknesses before and after the exercises, and an analysis
of covariance of muscle thickness before the exercise was used as the covariate. The
Bonferroni post hoc test was also performed to identify the differences in the thicknesses
of the trunk muscles among the various exercises. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The three exercise groups showed significant changes in TrA, EO, and IO thicknesses after

To investigate an effective method of bridge exercise, the existing traditional bridge
exercise was performed along with a prone bridge exercise, and the trunk muscles&#x02019;
thicknesses were subsequently measured. The purpose of trunk stability exercises is to
protect the spine from recurrent micro-damage of muscles, pain due to spine instability, and
degenerative changes in the spine<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Muscle strengthening exercises are performed for the prevention and treatment of
musculoskeletal diseases and for the improvement of exercise capacity<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, patients with low back pain show decreased
muscle strength of the spine extensors and abdominals. Specifically, the strength of the TrA
is weaker in individuals with low back pain than in those without<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The strength of the deep muscles around the lumbar spine in patients with low back pain is
also unbalanced. Patients with low back pain demonstrate decreased proprioception, which
causes position sense impairments and eventually spine instability. As a result, patients
with low back pain experience recurrent back pain<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. For this reason, many studies have been conducted to improve deep
muscle strength. However, to date, minimal research has been conducted on direct measurement
of deep muscles. Ultrasound can be used to show deep muscle thickness even when muscles
contract for certain movements<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reliability of ultrasound was proved
in previous studies<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study used ultrasound to measure the effect of eight weeks of bridge exercise on
muscle thicknesses. The results show that the thicknesses of the TrA, IO, and EO increased
significantly after prone bridge exercise, followed by supine bridge exercise on a Swiss
ball and then supine bridge exercise. Interestingly, the muscle thicknesses of the TrA, IO,
and EO after prone bridge exercise increased significantly more than after conventional
bridge exercise. With prone bridge exercise, the deep muscles, TrA, and IO are activated
more to stabilize the trunk and make it thicker. Increased muscle thickness means increased
muscle activation. Subjects with low back pain are known to have postural control
impairments; therefore, a postural control program should be considered part of their
rehabilitation plan<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Trunk stability
plays an important role in postural control, and the functions of the TrA, IO, and EO are
crucial for trunk stability<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, prone bridge exercise significantly increased the thicknesses of these
muscles compared with other bridge exercises. Therefore, prone bridge exercise could be
suggested as a method of improving postural control for patients with back pain. The reasons
for the significant improvement of muscle thicknesses with prone bridge exercise compared
with the other bridge exercises can be suggested biomechanically and physiologically.
Biomechanically, the prone position has a smaller base of support compared with the other
bridge exercises. Therefore, to maintain postural control, increased muscle activation is
required<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, the prone bridge
exercise raises the individual to resist gravity during the process of the spinal flexion
pattern. That is, as the elbows and toes touch the ground, the trunk muscles are required to
counteract gravity through co-contraction. Physiologically, the prone bridge position, with
the upper and lower extremities acting as a bridge, activates the muscles placed
transversely first (e.g., the TrA and then the IO and EO) for trunk stability. This is why
increased muscle activation is induced.</p><p>The subjects in this study reported difficulty in lifting their pelvis during supine bridge
exercises when pain worsened. However, they reported easiness in assuming the prone bridge
posture compared with the supine bridge postures. Accordingly, patients with acute back
pain, not only those with CLBP, can also perform the prone bridge exercise safely. In
conclusion, prone bridge exercise is the more efficient for improving trunk stability and
increasing trunk muscle thicknesses compared with the supine bridge exercises in patients
with CLBP. A limitation of this study is that we only measured the thicknesses of the IO,
EO, and TrA muscles. As the study measured only muscle thickness, the study results are hard
to generalize. Moreover, bridge exercises mobilize many muscles in the trunk and
extremities, and other factors can affect muscle thickness. Hence, further studies will be
required to examine muscle activity with electromyography.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Itoh</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Itoh</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Katsumi</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>A pilot study on using acupuncture and transcutaneous
