However, current evidence regarding the success, as defined by not requiring any retreatments, or survival of teeth after different excavations is insufficient for definitive recommendation, especially when treating deciduous teeth. Moreover, restoration integrity has not been comparatively analyzed longitudinally, and neither patients&#x02019;, dentists&#x02019; or parents&#x02019; preferences nor the clinical long-term costs emanating from both initial and retreatments have been reported yet.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The planned study is a prospective multicenter, two-arm parallel group, randomized controlled clinical trial comparing selective and stepwise excavation in deciduous molars with deep, active caries lesions without pulpal symptoms. We will recruit 300 children aged between three and nine-years-old with a minimum of one such molar. Patients participating in another study, or those with systemic diseases, disabilities or known allergies to used materials as well patients with teeth expected to exfoliate within the next 18 months will be excluded. After inclusion, sequence generation will be performed. Initial treatment will follow dental routine. During excavation, leathery, moist and reasonably soft dentin will be left in proximity to the pulp followed by adhesive restoration of the cavity. Afterwards, patients&#x02019;, dentists&#x02019; and parents&#x02019; subjective assessment of the treatment will be recorded using visual analogue or Likert scales. Re-examination will be performed after six months, and only then teeth will be allocated to one of the two interventions. Selectively excavated teeth will not be treated further, whilst for stepwise caries removal, a second excavation will be performed until only hard dentin remains. Clinical re-evaluations will be performed after 12, 24 and 36 months. Restorations will be reassessed using modified Ryge criteria. Objectively or subjectively required retreatments will determine success and survival. Retreatments will be evaluated both subjectively and regarding generated costs.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Based on the results of the trial, decision-making for treating deep caries lesions in deciduous molars based on multiple criteria should be feasible.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02232828">NCT02232828</ext-link> (registered on 29 November 2014).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Caries</kwd><kwd>Costs</kwd><kwd>Dentin</kwd><kwd>One-step excavation</kwd><kwd>Partial excavation</kwd><kwd>Two-step excavation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>The treatment of deep caries lesions is associated with significant risks for the pulp, including pulpal exposure and postoperative pulpal complications, which might eventually compromise the retention of the tooth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Moreover, treating deep lesions might be associated with pain and subjective burden both during and after treatment, and might generate long-term costs due to retreatments being required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>For deciduous teeth, various treatments for deep lesions have been described: complete excavation aims at removing all infected and affected carious dentin, with the inherent risk of pulpal exposure. In contrast, stepwise (two-step) excavation leaves carious dentin after the initial excavation step, then seals residual caries under a temporary restoration, and re-enters the cavity in a second step to eventually attempt complete excavation. This approach is thought to facilitate arrest and remineralization of the lesion and to induce development of tertiary dentin, thereby reducing the risk of pulpal exposure and postoperative complications after the second excavation step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Since several studies found sealed residual lesions to be clinically and microbiologically arrested, the need to re-enter was increasingly questioned within the last decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Selective (one-step) incomplete or partial excavation seals carious dentin under a definitive restoration, omitting any re-entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Sealing the lesion is thought to deprive residual bacteria from dietary carbohydrates and has been found to exert significant antibacterial effects, thus arresting the lesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>However, doubts remain regarding the effects of sealed carious dentin on the long-term quality of the restoration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Moreover, it remains unknown if patients prefer one treatment over the other, which might be especially relevant when treating children. Several studies comparing complete with selective or stepwise excavation of deciduous teeth have been published, but only one three-arm study compared selective with stepwise excavation of primary teeth (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In addition, none of these studies assessed patient- or dentist-centered outcomes, that is, preferences, or analyzed clinically assessed long-term costs emanating from both excavations.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

We plan to enroll 300 patients with one or more deeply carious, sensitive and non-symptomatic deciduous molar. One molar per patient will be randomly allocated to receive one of two treatments (selective or stepwise excavation). The total follow-up time will be three years after completion of the initial treatment. Success, survival and restoration integrity will be assessed after one, two and three years. Patients&#x02019;, parents&#x02019; and dentists&#x02019; preference will be assessed after each treatment using visual analogue or Likert rating scales. Costs will be assessed for the initial and follow-up treatments and will be based on a micro-costing approach. The study has been approved by the ethics committee of the Charit&#x000e9; - Universit&#x000e4;tsmedizin Berlin (approval number: EA4/057/14), the Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University Greifswald (approval number: BB 112/14) and the RWTH University of Aachen (approval number: EK 283/14). The study is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT02232828).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>The study will take place in three dental university clinics in Eastern, Northern and Western Germany. All are publically funded teaching hospitals. We will include children aged between three and nine-years-old with a minimum of one sensitive, clinically and radiographically non-symptomatic, retainable, deeply carious deciduous molar with a caries lesion involving either only the occlusal or the occlusal and exactly one proximal (mesial or distal) surface. The lesion will be required to radiographically extend into the inner third of the dentin (D3) and show signs of activity, such as plaque retention, papillary bleeding and/or softness of the surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Patients will require parental consent for participation. In addition, patients&#x02019; cooperation for treatment under no or only local anesthesia will be expected.</p><p>Patients participating in another study, patients with parents planning to move away within the next three years, patients who are not residents of the federal states of Berlin, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Nordrhein-Westfalen, as well as patients with systemic diseases or disabilities will not be included. Patients with known allergies to dental materials used within the study as well as those with teeth expected to exfoliate within the next 18 months will also not be included.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Sample size</title><p>The required sample size was calculated based on the primary outcome parameter, success (see below). We anticipate a hazard ratio of 1.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] of stepwise excavated compared with selectively excavated teeth. If &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 and 1-&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.9, a sample size of n&#x02009;=&#x02009;66 per group is required. Assuming an annual drop-out rate of 20%, 114 patients per group will be required. The total required sample size would thus be n&#x02009;=&#x02009;228. To allow possible subgroup analyses, a total of 300 patients will be recruited (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;100 per center).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Recruitment will be performed within the pediatric clinics of the participating centers. Both referred and in-house patients will be approached after routine examination was performed. Eligible patients and their parents will receive the study information and consent forms. Written consent will be given by the parents of the children. There will be a minimum time period of 48 hours between receipt of study information and consent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Allocation and blinding</title><p>If more than one primary molar is eligible, the decision as to which tooth will be included into the study will be performed using random number tables (WH) before treatment is commenced. Sequence generation will be performed after inclusion via random number tables (WH). Allocation will be performed via sealed opaque envelopes after the six-monthly recall examination (six months after selective excavation) by the treating dentists. Thus, both the first excavation step and the first re-examination will be performed blinded as to whether further excavation will be performed or not. Clinical follow-up examinations will also be performed blinded to treatment group allocation. Blinding during the second excavation step and blinding of patients as to which treatment was performed will not be possible, but patients will be informed not to reveal treatment allocation to the examiner during follow-up examinations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Outcomes will be assessed by the treating dentists or study nurses. The primary outcome of the study will be success (not requiring any re-intervention). Secondary outcomes will include survival (not requiring extraction), restoration integrity, assessed via modified USPHS-criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], patients&#x02019; subjective assessment of the treatment using a visual analogue scale (for stepwise excavation, assessments will be performed twice and mean visual analogue scale results will be calculated), dentists&#x02019; and parents&#x02019; subjective assessment of the treatment using grades 1 (very good) to 6 (very bad) and initial and follow-up treatment costs (calculated by combining costs for staff, as assessed by time required for the procedures and the number of personnel involved, and costs for transportation of patients or materials).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Intervention and data collection</title><p>In the first visit, a full assessment and intraoral examination will be performed.

If informed consent is given, treatment will be provided in the second visit, with local anesthetics being applied according to individual needs. Removal of enamel and cavity preparation will be performed using water-cooled diamond instruments. Caries removal in the periphery including the enamel-dentinal junction will be performed using rose head burs and/or an excavator until hard, dry dentin remains. Pulpo-proximal caries will be removed until leathery, slightly moist and reasonably soft dentin remains. Operating dentists will be calibrated prior to study commencement regarding these criteria using extracted teeth. Moisture control will be performed using cotton rolls and continuous aspiration.

We therefore expect adverse or severe advents to be similar to those associated with routine treatment. Specific study-related adverse or severe events will be allergy or severe reaction to a study material used (local anesthetics, bonding and/or compomer) or rare, uncommon reactions (unexpected bleeding, unexpected severe pain and/or uncontrollable anxiety) to or during the performed interventions. Any adverse event to treatments provided within the study will be investigated and reported to the ethics committee. In case of serious adverse events requiring un-blinding, code-breaking is possible. If the investigation is terminated prematurely or suspended, the principal clinical investigator (FS) will promptly inform the clinical investigators of all centers. Additionally, the ethics committee will also be informed immediately.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The treatment of deep caries lesions bears significant risks for the pulp of the tooth, including pulpal exposure, especially in deciduous teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For the latter, two opposite strategies for treating deep caries are currently available. On the one hand, more conservative options aim at retaining pulpal integrity and health. On the other hand, more invasive strategies anticipate an eventual loss of pulpal vitality and perform pulpotomy instead. Whilst the latter treatment may be highly successful, requiring few re-interventions and often retaining primary teeth until their exfoliation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], it might be both more burdensome for children and more costly compared with less invasive strategies. Moreover, it might not be feasible in many circumstances, requiring local or even general anesthetics and further, advanced restorations using, for example, preformed crowns. Given the polarized distribution of deep lesions both between and within countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], incomplete caries removal followed by direct restoration might be an option, which is applicable especially for conditions which, or patients who, do not allow for other options.</p><p>In the planned study, our main outcome variable will be success, followed by survival. Admittedly, both have to be seen as having limited precision and reliability: Since we omit regular radiographic evaluations and rely solely on clinically determined need to retreat, we might miss &#x02018;failures&#x02019; and thereby systematically bias our results. However, our approach is both clinically relevant and ethically sound; in a clinical setting, regular radiographic re-examination is unlikely due to concerns of radiation. Moreover, the need for re-intervention would be determined subjectively too, especially when treating children, since only few dental practitioners would aim at endodontically treating asymptomatic teeth based only on a negative &#x02018;vitality testing&#x02019; result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>In the planned study, retreated teeth will not be excluded from further analyses, but followed. Thus, we will be able to not only determine the initial efficacy of both treatments, but measure their long-term effects. These long-term effects have been found to determine both the retention time of the tooth and the total generated costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Moreover, they are additionally burdening children, and might have further effects regarding their attitudes toward the dentist.</p><p>In general, patients&#x02019; assessment of different therapies is relevant especially when treating children, since personal experiences or preferences shape both long-term attitudes and short-term compliance. The opinion of providers (dentists) might be relevant to implement less invasive caries treatments in general practice; only having the evidence (knowledge) is often insufficient for translating change into a primary care setting. Here, personal experience and attitudes are of high importance for the acceptance of a treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Dentists&#x02019; attitudes regarding selective excavation have been additionally shaped by fear of restorative failure, especially if legal regulations such as guarantee times are in place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. We therefore aim at focusing not only on pulpal failures, but will also assess restoration integrity.</p><p>The mentioned regulative framework is put in place by political decision-makers. The latter are, again, only limitedly influenced by evidence and driven by several indirect factors like political reward, feasibility or justifiability of change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Justifiability might be given if a new treatment option is more cost-effective than the established standard especially in a cost-driven environment with low overall priority like dental treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Comparing the cost-effectiveness of selective versus stepwise excavation might further assist the implementation and clinical decision-making regarding treatment of deep caries lesions in deciduous molars.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov and the study is open for recruitment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>FS, SP and CF conceived the study and its design and participated in its coordination.
