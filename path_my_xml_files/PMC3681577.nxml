In our daily lives, 50 or 60 Hz is the most common frequency of electricity, which falls in the extremely low frequency (ELF) range. Particularly, concerns have been expressed about the potential adverse effects of EMF exposure on developing children. The World Health Organization (WHO) Research Agenda for ELF fields concluded that there were no substantive health issues related to ELF electric fields at levels generally encountered by members of the public. The WHO Research Agenda recommended further research concerning the possible effects of exposure to ELF magnetic fields
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, most previous studies of ELF magnetic field exposure on children have focused on the occurrence of childhood leukemia and central nervous system cancers, the malignancies most frequently mentioned in connection with ELF-EMF among children
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Several pooled analyses and reviews found a generally consistent, albeit moderate, association between exposure of children to EMFs and the risk of childhood leukaemia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], although no definitive biological mechanism has been identified
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important role not only in physiological situations, but also in various pathological settings. Among the different available noninvasive techniques for assessing the ANS, heart rate variability (HRV), which is obtained from heart rate, has emerged as a simple, noninvasive method to evaluate the sympathovagal balance at the sinoartrial level
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Respiration rate is also closely associated with HRV
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Therefore, we selected the three parameters including heart rate, HRV, and respiration rate to assess ANS activity. There are some studies investigating the effects of ELF-EMFs on heart rate and HRV only for adults
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Some previous studies investigated subjective symptoms or EMF perception in ELF-EMFs for adults
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, there are very few studies regarding subjective symptoms and EMF perception in children. We examined subjective symptoms and EMF perception as well as physiological parameters. Therefore, when the three factors above are measured simultaneously, the results could be more reliable.</p><p>Children might be more sensitive to radiation in some or all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Concerns about the potential vulnerability of children to EMFs have been raised because of the potentially greater susceptibility of their developing nervous systems. In addition, their brain tissue is more conductive, EMF penetration is greater relative to their head size, and they will have a longer lifetime of exposure than adults
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>In this double-blind study, we measured heart and respiration rates for both adult and teenager groups, then obtained HRV using the measured heart rate. In addition, participants were asked to describe subjective symptoms and EMF perception during pre-exposure, sham and real exposures, and post-exposure. The aim of this study was to test whether 60 Hz magnetic fields affect heart rate, respiration rate, and HRV, or give rise to subjective symptoms in adults and teenagers. We also compared the ability of adults and teenagers to perceive exposure to a magnetic field. We tested the null hypothesis that we would observe no differences in autonomic nervous system, subjective symptoms, or EMF perception between real and sham exposures for the two groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Participants with electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) who attributed their symptoms to appliances and/or high voltage transmission lines or mobile phones were excluded using the EHS screening tool developed by Eltiti et al.

This double-blind study had 60 participants in two groups: 30 adults and 30 teenagers (because the experiment was demanding and potentially stressful, we did not recruit children younger than 13 years old).

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows the experimental setup used to examine participants and the 60 Hz magnetic field exposure system. The magnetic field generator consisted of an arbitrary function generator (33220A, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and a coil pair constructed for this study. The coil pair was adopted to produce more uniform magnetic fields in a head than a single coil. Each coil had 2000 turns with a radius of 10 cm, height of 20 cm, and coil thickness of 0.7 mm. The output of the function generator was controlled using LabVIEW 2009 (National Instruments, Austin, TX). During the experiment, participants were positioned in the centre of the space between the coils (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The distance between the coils was 50 cm and the coil pair was covered with fabric to conceal it. The participant&#x02019;s head was positioned in the centre between the coils by adjusting the chair height to expose the head at 12.5 &#x003bc;T. Since the brain controls the ANS, many previous studies exposed the head to magnetic fields

Sham and real sessions were conducted as a double-blind test to minimise test bias from a participant and an experimenter recognising the operational state of the magnetic field generator. Experiments were performed for two days, one day for a real session and a second day for a sham session (or vice versa). Regardless of whether the sham or real exposure came first, the second session was always conducted at approximately the same time of the day as the first session, to maintain the participant&#x02019;s physiological rhythm. The order of sham and real sessions was randomly assigned to each subject and counterbalanced on our automatic exposure control program using LabVIEW 2009 (National Instruments) to minimise experimental bias. The sham exposure was the first session for 17 teenagers and 18 adults. Time between the sessions was a minimum of one day and a maximum of 20 days.</p><p>The average ELF electric and magnetic fields were 0.75 &#x000b1; 0.10 V/m and 0.03 &#x000b1; 0.00 &#x003bc;T during sham exposure and 3.52 &#x000b1; 0.95 V/m and 12.49 &#x000b1; 0.02 &#x003bc;T during real exposure, respectively.

<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref> shows the percentages of subjects who believed they were being exposed during exposure (real or sham) in the adult and teenager groups. We compared the percentages of those perceiving exposure during actual exposure (second through sixth inquiries) using McNemar&#x02019;s test and found no significant difference between real and sham exposures in the adult or teenager groups. To test for delayed effects of real exposure on post-exposure perception (seventh through ninth inquiries), we applied the same test and found no significant difference in the percentages of those who believed they were being exposed following real and sham exposures in the adult (<italic>P</italic> = 0.687, <italic>P</italic> = 0.125, <italic>P</italic> = 0.625) or teenager (<italic>P</italic> = 0.687, <italic>P</italic> = 0.625, <italic>P</italic> = 1.000) groups. Also, no significant difference was seen during pre-exposure (first inquiry) between real and sham exposures in adult (<italic>P</italic> = 0.687) or teenager (<italic>P</italic> = 0.250) groups, indicating that the conditions experienced by participants before real and sham exposures were the same.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). Therefore, we concluded that neither the adult nor the teenager group correctly perceived the magnetic fields.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Obtaining approval of parents was difficult, which made recruitment of teenagers difficult. Another limitation of this study was that we used only one exposure intensity. In future studies, the effects of ELF-EMFs in various exposure intensities on adults and teenagers should be investigated. Although the order of sham and real sessions was randomly assigned to each subject and counterbalanced on our automatic exposure control program to minimise experimental bias, more subjects received sham exposure for the first session. Ideally, the same number for each session is the best. However, the skewness is small and probably makes no difference.</p><p>Neither the adults nor the teenagers showed significant differences in heart or respiration rate between real and sham exposures or among stages. For LFP/HFP, however, significant differences were seen between some stages during both real and sham exposure sessions in both groups. One disadvantage of the LFP/HFP analysis is that it is considerably influenced by stress, which can increase or decrease LFP/HFP
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Hjortskov et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] reported that psychological stress could result in an increased LFP/HFP. Nam et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] reported that LFP/HFP monotonically increased at each exposure stage in both EHS and non-EHS groups during 30 min of sham exposure. In this experiment, one of the potential sources of stress was the requirement that the subjects not move during the 64-min experiment. In fact, the &#x0201c;no-movement&#x0201d; requirement was the factor that drew the most complaints from the participants. Therefore, the significant increase in LFP/HFP with time during both the real and sham exposure sessions for both groups must have resulted from factors other than field exposure such as psychological stress, anxiety, or environmental factors.</p><p>Sait et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] reported that a 50 Hz 28 &#x003bc;T magnetic field had no effect for either heart rate or HRV in 20 adults. Graham et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] performed ELF-EMF meta-analysis of seven studies and concluded that there was no effect of overnight exposure to 60 Hz magnetic fields on either heart rate or HRV. However, in some studies, exposure to 50/60 Hz magnetic fields ranging from 20 &#x003bc;T to 200 &#x003bc;T have been found to cause slowing of the heart rate and as well as to change HRV
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Laboratory research into the effects of EMF exposure on heart rate and HRV has been inconclusive
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. To our knowledge, there are very few provocation studies regarding ELF EMFs on children or teenagers.</p><p>An interesting pattern was observed in the LFP/HFP results in Table&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>. In sham sessions, LFP/HFP continuously increased from stage I to stage IV for the adult and teenager groups. However, in real sessions, LFP/HFP increased more rapidly, but then decreased during stage IV for both groups. This pattern could represent a subtle magnetic field effect that increased LFP/HFP during exposure (stage II and III), but disappeared after exposure (stage IV), which was not observable as statistically significant with the current study design and group size. The interaction term (exposure and stage) was not statistically significant in either the adult or teenager groups. As the pattern of changes was similar in the both groups, we performed a further check and found that the interaction term was not significant in a combined analysis of adult and teenager groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.103).</p><p>In this study, neither the adult group nor the teenager group showed significant differences in any of the four stages between real and sham sessions for any of the eight symptoms surveyed. Mortazavi et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] concluded that no significant differences occurred in the prevalence of symptoms such as headache, fatigue, difficulty in concentration, vertigo, or attention disorders between healthy university students who used and did not use computer monitors (cathode ray tubes or CRTs). These monitors produce ELF as well as very low frequency (VLF) magnetic fields. McMahan et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] also reported that the incidence of subjective symptoms was higher in subjects who were worried about the effects of magnetic fields, rather than in subjects actually exposed in people living near power lines. In conclusion, ELF magnetic fields did not give rise to subjective symptoms in adults or teenagers in this study.</p><p>No significant differences were seen in the percentages of participants who believed they were being exposed between the real and sham exposures in either the adult or the teenager group. No significant differences in percentages of perception were seen for either group among participants who believed they were being exposed during either pre-exposure or post-exposure periods between real and sham exposures. Also, no significant differences were observed in the percentages of perception for either the adult or teenager groups during sham exposure sessions (pre-exposure, sham exposure, post-exposure). Therefore, our experimental protocol appeared to be minimally biased since we confirmed no delayed effects, no differences in pre-exposure condition, and no difference in the percentage of those who believed they were being exposed during the pre-exposure, sham exposure, and post-exposure periods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In both adults and teenagers, exposure to a 60 Hz magnetic field had no effects on heart rate, respiration rate, LFP/HFP, or subjective symptoms. Neither adults nor teenagers could perceive the magnetic fields, and we observed no indication that the teenagers perceived the magnetic field better than the adults. Therefore, based on our physiological data, survey of subjective symptoms, and percentages of participants who believed they were being exposed, we conclude there are no effects of 32 min exposure to a 60 Hz 12.5 &#x003bc;T magnetic field on the variables examined in adults or teenagers.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANOVA: Analysis of variance; ANS: Autonomic nervous system; CRT: Cathode ray tube; ECG: Electrocardiogram; EEG: Electroencephalograms; EHS: Electromagnetic hypersensitivity; ELF: Extremely low frequency; EMF: Electromagnetic field; HFP: High-frequency power; HRV: Heart rate variability; LFP: Low-frequency power; n: Number; VLF: Very low frequency; WCDMA: Wideband code division multiple access; WHO: World Health Organization.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>SKK recruited subjects, collected experimental data.
