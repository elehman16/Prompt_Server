An example of such a phenotype established through this process is that of the &#x02018;frequent exacerbator&#x02019; identified in the ECLIPSE cohort. In that analysis, the presence of two or more exacerbations in the previous year was shown to strongly predict the occurrence of an exacerbation in the coming year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></p><p>Statistical techniques may assist in the identification of COPD phenotypes, with cluster analysis being the most commonly used approach.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9 R10 R11 R12">9&#x02013;12</xref> Cluster analysis uses algorithms to group a patient population, without an a priori hypothesis, into cohorts where those in the same group are more similar to each other than they are to those in other groups.

Variables with several responses were collapsed into fewer categories as appropriate, such that all categories had at least 100 participants (eg, exacerbations requiring hospitalisation in the previous year) or were eliminated from consideration during the cluster analysis (race, anti-haemorrhagics, anti-hypertensives (eg, anti-adrenergics and smooth muscle agents), vasodilators and vasoprotectives (eg, topical haemorrhoid treatments and anti-varicose therapy)).</p><p>The best split of the tree was determined by maximising the subgroups according to the treatment interaction effect, and the subgroup membership was then assigned to each patient based on the selected tree. Internal validation was performed by using a split sample, so that a random sample of 50% of the patients was selected to create the tree and the remaining half was used for the computation of rate ratios and CIs to test statistical significance.</p><p>Generalised linear models using a negative-binomial function were used to compare the likelihood of having an exacerbation by examining the treatment by subgroup interaction.

1: diuretic users with treatment for cardiovascular comorbidity; cluster 2: reversible, not taking diuretics; cluster 3: not reversible, not taking diuretics. Participants in clusters 1 and 2 benefited from receiving combination therapy with SFC, compared with SAL alone, with a greater reduction in exacerbations. This exercise identified two groups that are more likely to respond to SFC. The largest benefit with SFC was observed in cluster 1, but the difference in RR between clusters 1 and 2 did not quite reach statistical significance.</p><p>A number of hypotheses can be put forward to explain the lower exacerbation rates with SFC relative to SAL among diuretic users. The use of diuretics may identify a group of patients with, or at risk of, CVD, such as those with hypertension or heart failure, though with the limited data available from the source studies, this cannot be confirmed. There was a significantly higher use of CVD medications in cluster 1, which suggests a preponderance of CVD diagnosis in this group; it may also suggest the presence of metabolic syndrome, as more patients in cluster 1 were in receipt of statins and ACE inhibitors than those in other clusters; furthermore, the proportion of patients with diabetes was greater in cluster 1 than in other clusters, as was the baseline BMI. Metabolic syndrome is more frequent among COPD than non-COPD patients, reflecting CVD and diabetes to be concurrent with airway obstruction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></p><p>ICS (FP) could exert a benefit on exacerbations in COPD patients with CVD if (1) CVD comorbidity reflects an increased inflammatory state related to COPD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> and (2) if CVD is a driver for COPD exacerbation occurrence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> and severity,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> as has been reported. It is therefore plausible to conjecture that subjects with CVD would exhibit higher levels of inflammation than those without CVD. Inflammation, as demonstrated by the elevated C reactive protein or fibrinogen, increases the risk of a COPD exacerbation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> and this logic supports the value of the addition of an ICS (FP) in cluster 1.</p><p>The heterogeneity of COPD is well established<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> and it has recently been suggested, through use of a rigorous assessment of comorbidity, that patients with CVD and metabolic syndrome form discrete clusters of COPD patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> which are represented in our analysis in cluster 1. Another assessment of comorbidity in COPD has found that certain CVDs increase the risk of all-cause mortality in COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> Although the TORCH study failed to show a significant effect (p=0.052) of FP/SAL versus placebo for all-cause mortality,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> a subsequent analysis of CV-related mortality and AEs found a positive effect of FP/SAL versus SAL in terms of CV-related outcomes,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> which further implies a potential benefit of ICS in COPD patients with comorbid CVD.</p><p>It is also possible that participants in cluster 1 (diuretic users) were pre-disposed to an increased exacerbation risk as a consequence of heart failure, especially as compared with clusters 2 and 3, more patients in cluster 1 were in receipt of antithrombotics, &#x003b2;-blockers and cardiac therapy, all of which suggest a greater degree of heart failure in cluster 1 compared with the other clusters. Heart failure can be aggravated by increased aortic stiffness, a marker of cardiovascular risk found in greater prevalence among COPD patients than in the general population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> Dransfield <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> recently found that SFC lowered aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV), a marker of aortic stiffness, in COPD patients with elevated aPWV.</p><p>Another possible explanation of the lower rate in moderate/severe exacerbations with SFC over SAL in cluster 1 reflects the direct activity of the concomitant diuretic therapy. Recent studies have examined the effectiveness of diuretics in the treatment of chronic respiratory diseases, in particular furosemide (which was the predominantly used diuretic in cluster 1). Mechanistically, furosemide inhibits inflammatory cytokines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> and enhances the anti-inflammatory impact of ICS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> Clinically, it has been shown to alleviate exertional dyspnoea in COPD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> and to protect against bronchoconstriction in asthma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33 R34 R35">33&#x02013;35</xref></p><p>The findings in cluster 1 relating to comorbidity in COPD are of particular interest, given the recent publications on the prevalence and impact of comorbidity in COPD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>

There was also reversibility in cluster 1 (median, 18.6%). Participants exhibiting reversibility have been shown to have greater improvement in lung function compared with those without reversibility, which could explain the significant effect of SFC relative to SAL in terms of a lower rate of moderate/severe exacerbations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> Recent data suggest that an improvement in the lung function of 100&#x02005;ml relates to a reduction in the exacerbation rate of 12%,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> while a 12% increase in the exacerbation rate has been reported for each 100&#x02005;ml loss of lung function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> The effect of SFC in COPD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> has been shown to provide a significantly greater effect on lung function in reversible versus irreversible participants. This suggests a potential mechanism for the lower rate of moderate/severe exacerbations in clusters 1 and 2 for patients receiving SFC. The rationale for this is that a greater improvement in lung function is typically associated with a greater effect on exacerbations (eg, Jones <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>).</p><p>The role of reversibility as a distinguishing feature in COPD has recently been questioned. While it is apparent that COPD subjects can be more or less reversible, there is considerable within-patient variability both in single testing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> and in testing on multiple occasions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref> Subject reversibility will vary over time, such that over 1&#x02005;year only 4% of patients were reversible on every occasion tested.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref> As such, it has been shown that while the percentage of reversible patients is between 20% and 30% in any given population at any time (as was the case in these studies), the actual patients who are reversible may change. Despite the limitations with reversibility, there is evidence that participants who are more reversible are likely to have a more robust bronchodilator response to treatment than those who are less reversible.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> None of the participants in cluster 3 exhibited reversibility by definition, and this, together with the highest prevalence of current smokers (which is known to attenuate ICS effects in COPD),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref> may explain why no difference was observed between SFC and SAL in this cluster.</p><p>Although the studies excluded participants with current asthma based on the investigator's judgement, participants could have had a history of asthma but not a diagnosis of active asthma. It has been suggested that asthma and COPD form part of the same disease continuum,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref> and though this is a controversial concept, the idea of an asthma&#x02013;COPD overlap syndrome may give insight into the response to combination ICS/LABA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref> Forty per cent and 59% of patients in clusters 1 and 2, respectively, were &#x02265;12% reversible and had an increase of &#x02265;200&#x02005;ml in FEV<sub>1</sub>. However, the reversibility stratum (&#x02265;12% and &#x02265;200&#x02005;ml) was adjusted for in the overall negative binomial model examining the mean annual exacerbation rates and was found to be not statistically significant, suggesting that any impact of reversibility as determined by both &#x02265;12% and &#x02265;200&#x02005;ml was minimal.</p><p>A number of recent studies have investigated COPD heterogeneity, and have identified independent factors such as dyspnoea, airway inflammation and asthma-like features,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref> or subgroups associated with differential outcome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref> However, only one<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> has validated the COPD subtypes identified against clinically meaningful outcomes. Garcia-Aymerich <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> identified three clusters of subjects, comprising those with severely impaired lung function, those with more mildly impaired lung function and, importantly, those with more mildly impaired lung function <italic>and</italic> evidence of cardiovascular disorders, obesity, diabetes and systemic inflammation. The clusters identified in the present study align to some extent with those already identified, such as increased reversibility and the presence of CVD. This suggests a convergence of COPD subtypes that warrants further examination.</p><p>Cluster analysis is limited due to its retrospective nature and the fact that it is limited to assessing only the categorical variables collected at baseline. In addition, the splitting into groups is automated by the computer-driven algorithm to maximise treatment differences, and is not necessarily robust; thus, external validation is warranted. As this analysis includes only those patients with a history of exacerbation, it is also difficult to generalise to participants with COPD who do not have a history of exacerbation.</p><p>In conclusion, a cluster analysis of participants taking part in two exacerbation studies of SFC versus SAL identified three distinct groups of COPD subjects based on diuretic use and reversibility. These participants varied in their response with participants in two of the three groups experiencing a greater reduction in the annual rate of moderate/severe exacerbations with SFC versus SAL. Those in the remaining group received no additional benefit in terms of reduction in the annual moderate/severe exacerbation rate over that provided by SAL alone. This study highlights the future potential for a personalised medicine approach to the treatment of patients with COPD. It additionally suggests how this methodology can be used to generate potential hypotheses for future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e153" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001838.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e154" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001838.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Editorial support in the form of development of the manuscript's first draft under the guidance of the corresponding author and coauthors, editorial suggestions to draft versions of this paper in collaboration with the corresponding author and coauthors, assembling tables and figures, collating author's comments, copyediting, fact checking, referencing and graphic services was provided by Geoff Weller, PhD, at Gardiner-Caldwell Communications.
