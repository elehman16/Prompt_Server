Profound haemodynamic and metabolic alterations can accompany large volume liposuction. Due to paucity of literature on the effect of different tumescent solutions on the electrolyte balance and haematological changes during large volume liposuction, we carried out this study using two different wetting solutions to study the same.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Total 30 patients presenting with varying degrees of localized lipodystrophy in different body regions were enrolled for the study. Prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted by Department of Plastic and Cosmetic Surgery, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi from January 2011 to June 2012. Patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each by using computer generated random numbers. Tumescent formula used for Group A (normal saline [NS]) was our modification of Klein's Formula and Tumescent formula used for Group B (ringer lactate [RL]) was our modification of Hunstadt's formula. Serum electrolytes and hematocrit levels were done at preinduction, immediate postoperative period and postoperative day 1.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Result:</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 15.0.

Patients require strict monitoring of vital parameters and usually Intensive Care Unit is not required. There was no statistical difference in the electrolyte changes using NS or RL as tumescent solution and both solutions were found safe for large volume liposuction.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEY WORDS</title><kwd>Electrolyte changes during liposuction</kwd><kwd>haemogram changes during liposuction</kwd><kwd>large volume liposuction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The most common definitions of large volume liposuction refer to total 5 l volume removed during the procedure (fat plus wetting solution).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Profound haemodynamic and metabolic alterations can accompany large volume liposuction.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Due to paucity of literature on the effect of different tumescent solutions on the electrolyte balance and haematological changes during large volume liposuction, we carried out this study using two different wetting solutions (normal saline [NS] and ringer lactate [RL]) to study the same.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>To study the effect of large volume liposuction on haematological changes and electrolyte balance using NS and RL in the tumescent solution.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>

A safe dose of lidocaine using the tumescent solution has been estimated to be 35 mg/kg. On the basis of clinical investigations of plasma liodcaine, they concluded that most patients can be discharged approximately 8 h after surgery as long as the tumescent lidocaine dose is 35 mg/kg or less. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind that dose-independent lidocaine toxicity may also occur in the early postoperative period.

The lowering was statistically significant but was within the normal range (3.5-5.5 mEql/L) and the patients were asymptomatic clinically. The preoperative potassium values in Group B were lower compared to Group A, though both the groups have shown a fall in the potassium from the baseline levels, which could be due to haemodilution. In Group B however, the serum potassium levels on postoperative day one were higher compared to the immediate postoperative period, which could be due to use of RL in the tumescent solution in Group B.</p><p>In a similar study conducted by Lipschitz <italic>et al</italic>. on 5 patients using RL as the tumescent solution, the rapid onset of hypokalaemia intra operatively (3.3 &#x000b1; 0.16 mmol/L) was significant for all patients.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In the same study levels, 20% greater than baseline occurred 8 h postoperatively, but no hyperkalaemia occurred.</p><p>There was no hyperkalaemia in our study. The reason for an increase in the potassium levels 8 h postoperatively, as stated by Lipschitz <italic>et al</italic>. in their study, could be due to release of intracellular potassium from the lysed adipocytes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>CHANGES IN CALCIUM LEVELS</title><p>In our study, a lowering of serum calcium concentration from baseline occurred in both the groups in the immediate postoperative period as well as the postoperative day 1 and the values were comparable. To confirm true hypocalcemia, we measured the ionised calcium values in the preoperative, immediate postoperative period as well as the postoperative day. We found that the changes in the value of ionised calcium in both the groups in the immediate postoperative as well as postoperative day one periods were not statistically significant and the values remained in the physiologically normal range (1.1-1.4 mmol/L), and most patients were asymptomatic, requiring no active intervention.</p><p>One patient in Group A and 2 patients in Group B, in the immediate postoperative period had serum calcium values below the normal range (&#x0003c;8 mg/dl), out of which only 1 patient in Group B who underwent 12.6 L liposuction had clinically significant hypocalcaemia and ionized calcium of 0.97 which is below the normal range. She also developed hypotension which did not improve with a fluid challenge. She was supplemented with IV calcium and the hypocalcaemia as well as the hypotension was corrected within 2-3 h.</p><p>Even on the postoperative day one, 6 patients in Group A and 5 patients in Group B (11 out of 13 had total aspirate more than 8 L) had serum calcium values below the normal range (&#x0003c;8 mg/dl), but the ionised calcium remained in the normal range and the patients were asymptomatic, hence no action was taken.</p><sec id="sec2-17"><title>Change in hematocrit</title><p>The preoperative, immediate postoperative and postoperative day 1 values for haematocrit were comparable between the groups and no blood transfusion was required.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-7"><title>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</title><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Statistically significant electrolytes and haematocrit changes occur during large volume liposuction and patients should be kept under observation for at least 24 h.</p></list-item><list-item><p>There was no statistical difference in the electrolyte changes using NS or RL as tumescent solution and both solutions were found safe for large volume liposuction.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Extreme care should be taken in patients with borderline electrolytes and hematocrit levels. These patients can manifest signs of electrolytes imbalance, so close monitoring should be done for clinical symptoms. Intra operative and postoperative fluid replacements with relation to the vital parameters and urine output will decrease the chances of fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.</p></list-item></list>
