position during the recovery period after maximal exercise and to identify an effective
position after high-intensity exercise. [Subjects and Methods] Fifteen male university
students in their twenties participated in the study. The subjects were randomly assigned
to the supine position, the sitting position, or the trunk forward leaning position during
the recovery period following maximal exercise. Oxygen uptake, minute ventilation volume,
respiration rate, and heart rate according to posture were measured in a stable state, at
maximal exercise loading, and at 1, 3, and 5 minutes after maximal exercise. [Results]
Changes of cardiopulmonary function according to posture during the recovery period after
maximal exercise showed that minute ventilation volume was smaller in the trunk forward
leaning position than in the sitting or supine positions, and oxygen uptake also declined.
[Conclusion] The trunk forward leaning position has a more positive effect on pulmonary
ventilation after high-intensity exercise.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cardiopulmonary function</kwd><kwd>Trunk forward leaning position</kwd><kwd>Maximal exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The graded exercise test is a non-invasive procedure that can be performed easily for the
diagnosis of cardiopulmonary diseases. The test has been used extensively to evaluate the
cardiopulmonary functions of patients with cardiopulmonary disease and healthy individuals
and to analyze risk factors, and is also used to assess exercise performance before
prescribing exercise or to evaluate exercise safety before conducting high-intensity
exercise programs<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The physiological parameters involved in cardiopulmonary function
in terms of exercise physiology include maximal oxygen uptake, pulmonary ventilation,
oxygen-carrying and carbon dioxide-carrying capacities of blood, and cardiac output<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Maximal oxygen uptake is defined as maximal
ability to consume oxygen per unit time, and is used as an objective assessment tool for
cardiovascular endurance assessment<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>,
though it is most commonly to provide data for assessing maximal exercise performance and
cardiopulmonary function through aerobic processes. Changes in body posture affect
cardiopulmonary function, and the effect of gravity depends on the position of the human
body<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, it has been reported that rapid changes in
cardiopulmonary function occur during the initial recovery period after maximal
exercise<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Despite reports that
cardiopulmonary function is significantly affected by body position, no established
guidelines have been issued regarding the stationary position adopted for the exercise test
or regarding recovery period after high-intensity exercise. Thus, this study was undertaken
to measure cardiopulmonary function according to body position during the recovery period
after maximal exercise and to identify an effective position after high-intensity
exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 15 male university students in their twenties attending a
university located in Daegu Metropolitan City, and who voluntarily agreed to participate in
the study. These 15 study subjects had no evidence of any orthopedic disease, visual
impairment, visual field defect, a congenital thoracic deformity, rib fracture or any
pulmonary, renal, endocrine system, orthopedic or rheumatic disease that may have prevented
proper functioning of the respiratory system. Furthermore, they had no history of thoracic
or abdominal surgery, and did not have a cardiovascular disease, such as, arrhythmia. All
subjects meeting the inclusion criteria were given verbal and written information on the
purpose of this study and provided written informed consent. In addition, the human rights
of subjects were protected. After subjects had been provided with an explanation about the
intent and purpose of this study, those who signed a research agreement were randomly
assigned to the supine position, the sitting position, or the trunk forward leaning position
during the recovery period following maximal exercise. The anteversion angle of the trunk
forward leaning position was set at 60&#x000b0;. In order to reduce the effect of fatigue, general
characteristics were examined and body mass indices (BMI) were measured after they had
rested for one day. The Bruce protocol was used for the graded exercise test, and the
setting criteria of the maximal exercise were considered as follows: (1) maximal heart rates
of the subjects reached over 90% of age-predicted heart rates, (2) the Borg ratings of
perceived exertion of the subjects were above 17. The exercise test was conducted in a
laboratory at 18 &#x000b1; 1&#x02005;&#x000b0;C and RH 50 &#x000b1; 5%, after a 4 to 5 hours fast and a 30 minute
stabilization period. Oxygen uptake, minute ventilation volume, respiration rate, and heart
rate according to posture were measured in a stable state, at maximal exercise loading, and
at 1, 3, and 5 minutes after maximal exercise, and the means and standard deviations of
measured values were calculated. In order to prevent fatigue caused by exercise during the
experiment from affecting measured values in other positions, measurements were made over 3
days, and each item was remeasured by the same measurer. The mean values were then
calculated for statistical analysis, which was conducted using SPSS Ver. 20.0 for Windows.
One-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine the changes between measurement
points, and to determine the significance of differences in measured values in different
postures at each time point. The LSD method was used as a post hoc test. Statistical
significance was accepted for p values&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Demographic characteristics of the subjects were shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Subjects</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI (kg/m&#x000b2;)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n=15</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.6 &#x000b1; 1.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">174.6 &#x000b1; 5.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">78.5 &#x000b1; 10.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.5 &#x000b1; 2.3</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>BMI: body mass index</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>.

exercise to improve exercise performance by investigating changes in cardiopulmonary
function according to posture during the recovery period following maximal exercise. In this
study, analysis showed that minute ventilation volume and oxygen uptake decreased in the
trunk forward leaning posture during the recovery period. In particular, a significant
decrease in minute ventilation volume was observed at the 5-minute time point during the
recovery period after maximal exercise. These results suggest that the trunk forward leaning
posture improves ventilatory capacity during the recovery period after maximal exercise, and
thus, enables rapid recovery of the respiratory system after high-intensity exercise<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have also been conducted on the relation between
pulmonary function and posture. Bullock stated that when a person lies in the supine
position blood flow in the pulmonary circulation is increased, and that this decreases the
volume of gas inhaled into the thoracic cavity and contents of the abdomen pressurize the
diaphragm, which reduces inhalation and results in reduced pulmonary function<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Takeshi et al. reported that measurements
of respiration according to activity of the rectus abdominis showed that since abdominal
contents pressurized the diaphragm in the supine posture, lung function was significantly
better in the sitting than in the supine posture<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, no significant differences in oxygen uptake
were observed in different postures when measurements were made in a stable state, at the
point of maximal exercise loading, or at 1, 3, and 5 minutes into the recovery period after
maximal exercise. However, during the recovery period, oxygen uptake decreased in the order
trunk forward leaning &#x0003e; sitting &#x0003e; supine posture, and the highest oxygen uptake was
observed in the supine posture, as has been shown previously<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The main limitation of this study is that since 15 students in
their twenties were enrolled, caution should be exercised when generalizing our results.
Furthermore, personal dietary habits, nutrition, and genetic characteristics of subjects
were not taken into account, and although measures were taken to minimize psychological
agitation before the experiment, no formal psychological treatment was applied to evaluate
the effects of psychological state. Finally, although personal exercise during the
experimental period was controlled, individual exercise ability was not considered. Taken
together, our results about changes of cardiopulmonary function according to posture during
the recovery period after maximal exercise showed that minute ventilation volume was smaller
in the trunk forward leaning position than in the sitting or supine positions, and oxygen
uptake also declined, though not significantly. Therefore, we conclude the trunk forward
leaning position has a more positive effect on pulmonary ventilation after high-intensity
exercise. By applying this position, patients with ventilatory difficulties can quickly
restore the cardiopulmonary function after trainings or exercises to improve their
ventilatory capacity.</p><p>In order to perform various exercise tests or help to restore the efficiency of
cardiopulmonary function to a stable state quickly after intense exercise by applying this
position, further studies are required of various interventions and on patients with
ventilatory difficulties.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lauer</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><name><surname>Okin</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name><name><surname>Larson</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Impaired heart rate response to graded exercise.
