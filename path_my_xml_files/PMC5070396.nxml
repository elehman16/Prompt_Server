Prospective data have shown that premature LH surge occurs in almost 23% of COS cycles (95% CI 22&#x02013;43%),[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] which appears quite significant and can interfere with the optimal timing of the insemination.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] LH surge can be effectively prevented by administering a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or GnRH antagonist.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Use of GnRH agonist is not recommended in IUI cycles because of prolonged administration of injections prior to and during stimulation to achieve complete downregulation of GnRH receptors, risk of excessive follicular stimulation, and higher cost and inconvenience to the patient.</p><p>On the other hand, GnRH antagonist competitively blocks the GnRH receptors and immediately causes pituitary suppression, thereby reduces LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion within 2&#x02013;4 h. The efficacy of GnRH antagonist in prevention of premature LH surge is well-established.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The inhibitory effect of GnRH antagonist is reversible, dose-dependent and is associated with the equilibrium between endogenous GnRH and GnRH antagonist concentration.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Cetrorelix (Cetrotide, EMD Serono) and Ganirelix (Antagon, Organon) are the two GnRH antagonists available for clinical use.</p><p>The protocols of GnRH antagonist administration in COS-IUI cycles are well-defined; however; the flexible regimen is the one which is used commonly in mild stimulation cycles.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>

Monitoring was performed from day 7 to day 8 of cycle with Transvaginal sonography (TVS) and dose adjustment was done according to the follicular development. In the study group, when a dominant follicle of 15 mm or more was detected, a GnRH antagonist (cetrorelix) was started at a dose of 0.25 mg/day subcutaneously until hCG administration [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

The role of GnRH antagonist in prevention of premature LH surge is well-established.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In IVF-embryo transfer cycles, GnRH antagonist gives comparable pregnancy rates to GnRH agonists with significant reduction in the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) incidence.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>The present study takes into account the suppressive effect of GnRH antagonist on premature LH surge in timing of IUI so that it may help in improving pregnancy rate in gonadotropin-stimulated cycles. However, the effect of GnRH antagonist on clinical pregnancy rate could not be confirmed in our study, probably due to certain limitations.</p><p>The present study being time bound for 12 months, we could not take a larger sample size to reach a statistically significant difference in clinical pregnancy rate.</p><p>From the available evidence, we found that premature LH surge did not start before follicle size of 14&#x02013;15 mm in majority of cases.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Hence, we have taken follicle size &#x0003e;15 mm as the cutoff limit to start GnRH antagonist so as to reduce the task of monitoring to minimum. In the control group, we measured urinary LH surge beyond the follicle size of 15 mm until the ovulatory trigger. In control group, premature LH surge started in six cycles which were excluded from the analysis. Had these cases been included, it would not have affected the outcome.</p><p>Natural intercourse was not restricted in any of the groups, therefore excluding the bias of spontaneous conception; however, the inclusion of subfertile couples minimizes that effect. To avoid a hypothetical effect of antagonist on function of corpus luteum, we routinely gave luteal phase support to all women in both groups.</p><p>Both groups were comparable in demographic characteristics regarding age, BMI, cause, and duration of infertility as well as baseline FSH, LH, estradiol (E2) levels, which rule out the selection bias. Similarly, there was no significant difference in most of the treatment variables between the two groups, except the total dose of gonadotropin which was significantly higher in GnRH antagonist group (900 IU vs. 750 IU).</p><p>There is conflicting evidence regarding multifollicular development and increased pregnancy rates with the use of GnRH antagonist in gonadotropin-stimulated IUI cycles. G&#x000f3;mez-Palomares <italic>et al</italic>. and Bakas <italic>et al</italic>. found a significant increase in the number of dominant follicles with GnRH antagonist compared to no GnRH antagonist (2.4 vs. 1.3 and 2.1 vs. 1.4), and they concluded that addition of GnRH antagonist leads to increased pregnancy rates in multifollicular cycles.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] On the other hand, Allegra <italic>et al</italic>. found no difference in number of dominant follicles with the addition of GnRH antagonist (3.08 vs. 3.20).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Similarly, the number of dominant follicles was not different between study and control groups (2.0 vs. 2.0) in our study. On comparing the clinical pregnancy rates in multifollicular cycles with monofollicular cycles, there was a statistically significant difference favoring multifollicular cycles in both the groups; however, there was no significant difference between the study and control groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>].</p><p>Ovarian follicles are most LH sensitive between 11 and 15 mm sizes.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] While the growth and maturation of a dominant follicle are not affected by sudden LH withdrawal induced by GnRH antagonist, there is arrest in growth of intermediate size follicles,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] i.e., when one follicle takes lead and GnRH antagonist is added to suppress LH, the rest of the follicles having higher LH threshold get atretic and there are ultimately lesser follicles achieving dominance. This hypothesis also forms the basis of our secondary outcome, i.e. ovarian hyper-response rate which was not addressed in any of the previous trials. The significant reduction in ovarian hyper-response rate with the addition of GnRH antagonist (8.9% vs. 16.7%) proves its role in reduction of OHSS, which is not acceptable in an IUI cycle. There was no case of OHSS in our study. More number of mature follicles also increases the risk of multiple gestations. There was no statistically significant difference in multiple pregnancy rates in study and control groups (14.3% vs. 9.2%). There was no case of high-order multiple pregnancies (HOMP) in our study. No increase in multiple pregnancies, OHSS, or HOMP is attributable to the strict cancellation criteria in our study. Pregnancy loss rate was also similar between the study and control groups (17.9% vs. 14.8%).</p><p>In our study, the clinical pregnancy rate was 27.6% and 26.5% and ongoing pregnancy rate was 22.7% and 22.5% in the study and control groups, respectively. We owe such high success in IUI cycles to perfect timing of ovulation and insemination. After hCG injection, ovulation starts around 36 h later and sequential thereafter. Therefore, at 44&#x02013;48 h post-hCG, the oocyte should be somewhere in the fallopian tube and &#x0003c;12 h old thus, should be able to give best results in terms of pregnancy if IUI is performed at that time. In addition, washed sperms in prepared semen can fertilize oocyte only within the next 2&#x02013;3 h because removal of seminal plasma initiates sperm capacitation by changes in the acrosome. Therefore, best time for insemination to maximize the chances of fertilization is within 2&#x02013;3 h of semen preparation.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] These results suggest that success rate of IUI mainly depends on timing of hCG injection and single well-timed insemination, that too within 12 h postovulation as the fertilizable life span of a mature oocyte is only 12&#x02013;24 h[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and of washed sperms is 2&#x02013;3 h.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Hence, too early or too late, an insemination would be futile in terms of achieving a pregnancy.</p><p>Most studies performed so far were heterogeneous in sample size, selection criteria, stimulation protocols, timing of administration of hCG, timing of IUI, number of inseminations, luteal phase support and so were the pregnancy rates.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] The timing of insemination was between 32 and 42 h in most of the studies, and in some studies, double insemination was performed, which could have led to difference in pregnancy rate. Further, very few studies compared pregnancy loss rate, multiple pregnancy rate, ovarian hyper-response rate, and incidence of OHSS.</p><p>If we compare large randomized controlled trials (RCTs), almost half of them do not demonstrate any significant beneficial effect of GnRH antagonist addition in gonadotropin-stimulated IUI cycles; however, most of the studies are underpowered in terms of sample size [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Review of literature</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JHRS-9-151-g007"/></table-wrap><p>The meta-analysis done by Kosmas <italic>et al</italic>. included six RCTs up to 2006 and showed a beneficial effect in favor of GnRH antagonist (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.05&#x02013;2.33). Based on OR derived from meta-analysis, the number of patients needed to prevent one additional LH rise was 4 (95% CI 3&#x02013;6) and to achieve one additional clinical pregnancy, with the addition of GnRH antagonist was 19 (95% CI 10&#x02013;81). In addition, it showed a parallel trend for multiple pregnancies.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>In the last Cochrane systematic review, regarding optimal stimulation protocols for IUI, five RCTs up to 2007 were included and it was concluded that adding a GnRH antagonist does not increase pregnancy rate (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.83&#x02013;2.8).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>So far only two large double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials have been done on this issue by Lambalk <italic>et al</italic>. and Cantineau <italic>et al</italic>., both of which proved that GnRH antagonist addition does not increase pregnancy rate and live birth rate, respectively, in gonadotropin-stimulated IUI cycles.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The results of our study are in line with the available evidence. Further meta-analysis or a Cochrane review update is definitely required to disentangle this issue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Addition of GnRH antagonist to gonadotropin-stimulated IUI cycles results in no significant difference in clinical pregnancy rate, pregnancy loss rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, or multiple pregnancy rates, but it significantly lowers the ovarian hyper-response rate.</p><p>These results suggest that most important determinant of achieving optimal pregnancy rates in IUI cycles is perfect timing of insemination in relation to ovulatory trigger (44&#x02013;48 h) and semen preparation (2&#x02013;3 h). Other factors such as choice of stimulation regimen, prevention of premature luteinization with the use of GnRH antagonist can only marginally add on to the success.</p><p>Clearly, this study does not support the routine use of GnRH antagonist in COS-IUI protocols in terms of chances of success, but we strongly believe that some points need to be better defined. The sample size recruited in this study is not sufficient to disentangle this issue. Nevertheless, GnRH antagonist treatment could allow flexible timing of hCG injection and insemination, thereby decreasing the need of extensive cycle monitoring and avoiding IUI during weekends. The role of GnRH antagonist in preventing OHSS in COS-IUI cycles is also worth consideration.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors are thankful to Dr. Mohinder Kochar, Dr. Shweta Mittal, Dr. Neeti Tiwari, Dr. Ruma Satwik, Dr. Tejshree Singh, and Dr. Dattaprasad Inamdar for providing subjects and inputs for the study.
