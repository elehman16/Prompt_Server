NASH is a distinct clinical entity characterized by steatosis, varying degrees of lobular inflammation, and fibrosis of the liver, which can potentially progress.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] NAFLD is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in United States. The estimated prevalence of NAFLD is 20&#x02013;30% and NASH is 3.5&#x02013;5%.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] NAFLD occurs in patients of both genders, all ethnicities, and in all age groups, including children.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Reports have also suggested that the prevalence of NAFLD among Asian Indians is comparable to that seen in the West.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] NASH probably causes around 80% of cases of cryptogenic cirrhosis and progresses to advanced fibrosis in 32&#x02013;37% of patients.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Between 5 and 20% of noncirrhotic NASH patients develop cirrhosis during a 10-year follow-up,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and perhaps 1 in 200 NASH patients develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) over a 7-year follow-up.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The pathogenesis of NASH involves initial insult that leads to development of macrovesicular steatosis with accumulation of hepatic fat. IR is the main contributing factor of this dysregulation of lipid metabolism. The second hit involves oxidative stress from mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, leading to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines that cause hepatic stellate cell activation, which results in fibrosis.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Currently, most hepatologists attempt to manage NASH using life style changes to reverse the consequences of metabolic disease, such as weight reduction with or without exercise, as well as standard therapeutic interventions to control associated diseases such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Pharmacological therapies including thiazolidinediones, which up-regulate the activity of the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-&#x003b3;, lipid-lowering agents, cytoprotective agents (ursodeoxycholic acid), antioxidants (vitamin E, hepatic iron reduction, betaine, <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl methionine, <italic>N</italic>-acetyl cysteine), etc., improve certain aspects of the liver damage associated with NASH. Nevertheless, the persistent underlying or residual pathology underscores the need for more effective innovative treatments.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Telmisartan is a unique angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) that blocks both the hits by modulating PPAR-&#x003b3; activity and thereby increasing insulin sensitivity, which decreases hepatic fat accumulation,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] as well as by blocking angiotensin II receptor, which inhibits hepatic stellate cell activation and thus suppresses hepatic fibrogenesis.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Telmisartan is also effective in mild to moderate hypertension, improves insulin sensitivity in Type 2 DM, and improves cholesterol and triglyceride levels. As most of the patients of NAFLD have features of metabolic syndrome, Telmisartan can be used for treatment of NASH with metabolic syndrome.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] We designed this randomized control trial (RCT) to observe the changes of histological activity and fibrosis in NASH patients after 1 year of Telmisartan therapy.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patient selection and randomization</title><p>This was an open-label RCT. Duration of the study was from January 2012 to September 2014. Patients of age 18&#x02013;65 years in whom NAFLD activity score (NAS) was greater than or equal to 5 in liver histology were selected as the sample of our study. Exclusion criteria were: 1. alcohol intake &#x0003e;20 g/day; 2. Presence of co-morbid conditions such as, chronic hepatitis of other causes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, cogestive cardiac failure; history of recent myocardial infarction, hypothyroidism, 3. Decompensated cirrhosis of liver; 4. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) more than five times of upper normal limit; 5. History of taking angiotensin receptor blocker or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Group 1 patients received 40 mg of Telmisartan once daily and underwent life style modification (TL) and group 2 patients underwent life style modification alone, for 1 year. Liver biopsy was repeated after 1 year. Moderate exercise consisting of 30 min of walk daily with dietary advice to avoid fatty foods and excessive sugar-containing diet were followed by patients in both groups. Diabetic patients were treated with life style modifications and if needed, Gliclazide or Glimepiride was added. Lipid-lowering agents were put on hold for the first 3 months, as literature shows that Telmisartan has mild lipid-lowering effect.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] If the patient was still dyslipidemic [total cholesterol (TC) &#x0003e;200 mg/dl, triglyceride (TG) &#x0003e;150 mg/dl], then statin was added. If the patient was still hypertensive after taking 40 mg Telmisartan, then the doses were increased up to 80 mg/day. In case further antihypertensive was needed, then atenolol or amlodipine was added.</p><p>Totally 50 patients were selected for randomization (35 of group 1/TL arm and 15 of group 2/L arm) and were followed for the next 1 year. Fifteen patients of group 1 and five patients of group 2 withdrew from the study due to lack of interest in doing end-of-study liver biopsy. So, a total 30 patients (20 in group 1 and 10 in group 2) were considered for statistical analysis, as per study protocol [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart for patient selection for the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJG-22-69-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Biochemical analysis</title><p>Estimation of fasting blood sugar (FBS), ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), bilirubin (B), TC, TG, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) in fresh serum was conducted in the university biochemistry laboratory using autoanalyzer. Serum samples obtained after an overnight fast of at least 12 h and immediately frozen at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C were used to determine the levels of immunoreactive insulin (IRI) by a chemiluminescence immunoassay.

Mean BMI improvement of responders was 2.37 &#x000b1; 2.64 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and of non-responders was 1.73 &#x000b1; 1.85 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<italic>P</italic> value: 0.459). Weight loss of 10% or more from baseline was observed in 13 patients; 9 (69.2%) of them had significant histological improvement, whereas 4 (30.8%) of them had no significant improvement. On the other hand, 17 patients did not show weight reduction of 10% or more; 8 of them (47.1%) had significant improvement and 9 (52.9%) had no significant improvement. Thus, weight reduction of 10% or more within 1 year did not have effect on patient response (<italic>P</italic> value = 0.225). Mean WC improvement of responders was 1.76 &#x000b1; 4.90 cm and of non-responders was 1.08 &#x000b1; 4.43 cm (<italic>P</italic> value = 0.695). HOMA-2 IR change did not significantly differ between responders and non-responders (<italic>P</italic> value = 0.167). ALT change could not differentiate responders and non-responders. GGT improved to 17.94 &#x000b1; 31.22 U/l in responders and deteriorated to 3.00 &#x000b1; 38.35 IU in non-responders (<italic>P</italic> value = 0.110) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Comparison of clinical, laboratory, and clinical characteristics of responders and non-responders</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJG-22-69-g005"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Predictors of patient response</title><p>Logistic regression analysis was performed to find the best predictor of patient response.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to see the effects of all confounding variables together. Multivariate analysis also showed that only TL group showed significant histological response (<italic>P</italic> value: 0.035; OR = 92.07, CI = 1.39&#x02013;6106). So, both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that only Telmisartan could has led to the response.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Logistic regression analysis of laboratory and histological parameters among responders</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJG-22-69-g006"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Probable side effects</title><p>Adverse events noticed during the study were mild headache, dizziness, and abdominal pain and they were similar in both groups.

So, total 30 patients were followed for 1 year and comparison was made between index and end-of-study liver biopsy of the patients. This study was performed to observe the effect of Telmisartan on the histological activity of NASH patients and, in fact, it is the first RCT that was carried out in Bangladeshi NASH patients. It revealed that Telmisartan significantly improved the histology of NASH patients.</p><p>The assessment of therapeutic agents for NASH is a complex process. Because there are no validated biomarkers of response to treatment, one must rely on histological assessment of liver biopsy tissue.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Both NAS and fibrosis score were taken into consideration to assess histological improvement in this study. NAS improvement was significantly higher with Telmisartan and life style modification than that observed with only life style modification. Similarly, fibrosis score improved in the first group, but deteriorated in the second group. Zein <italic>et al</italic>. reported in a RCT that Pentoxyphylline improved NAS &#x02265; 2 in 50% of patients.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In 2010, Sanyal <italic>et al</italic>. found in a large RCT that Vitamin E improved NAS &#x02265; 2 in 43% of patients.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Our RCT revealed that Telmisartan improved NAS &#x02265; 2 in 65% of patients. So, regarding improvement of NAS, Telmisartan is more effective than Pentoxyphylline or Vitamin E.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Our study revealed that Telmisartan improved both histological activity and fibrosis of NASH patients. In Yokohama <italic>et al</italic>.'s study, seven patients with NASH and hypertension were treated with 50 mg/day of Losartan for 48 weeks. Hepatic necroinflammation improved in five patients and hepatic fibrosis reduced in four patients.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Reduction of fibrosis could be explained from Bataller <italic>et al</italic>.'s study that activated human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) express the renin&#x02013;angiotensin system and synthesize angiotensin II. So, angiotensin II receptor antagonist could attenuate the progression of hepatic fibrosis by direct inhibition of activated HSCs.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Fujita <italic>et al</italic>. reported on the effect of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist Telmisartan on the development of NASH in a rat model. Telmisartan, but not the angiotensin receptor antagonist valsartan, markedly attenuated hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in these rats. The quantitative attenuation of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis of the liver were also similar to that of Telmisartan.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] These reports strongly support our findings of decrease in histological activity and fibrosis observed.</p><p>In the second group, there was significant NAS improvement, but only two patients had NAS improvement of &#x02265;2, that is, up to the level of operational definition of response. During 1 year of the study period, these two patients had lost 16% and 18% of their body weight, respectively. Significant weight loss was probably the underlying cause of histological improvement observed in these two patients. In 2010, Musso <italic>et al</italic>. described in a meta-analysis that weight reduction through life style modification had significant effect on histological improvement of NASH patients. But the meta-analysis could not quantify the cut-off value of weight reduction at which steatosis or NAS improved.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] As life style modification is considered the standard approach of patient management, the present study included this approach for both groups.</p><p>In the present study, 10% or more body weight reduced in 13 out of 30 patients. Among them, 9 (69.2%) had significant histological improvement, whereas 4 (30.8%) had no significant histological improvement. On the other hand, 17 patients did not lose weight of 10% or more; of them, 8 patients (47.1%) had significant histological improvement and 9 patients (52.9%) had no significant histological improvement. So, body weight loss of 10% or more could not affect the patient response significantly (<italic>P</italic> value: 0.225). The underlying cause was not clear, but these findings strengthen our study findings that the histological improvement caused by Telmisartan was more significant than that caused by weight reduction. Improvement in biochemical parameters such as HOMA-2 IR, ALT, GGT, TG, and HDL did not differ significantly between histological responders and non-responders. These findings reveal that biochemical improvement does not correlate with histological improvement. HOMA-2 IR deteriorated more in non-responders than in responders (&#x02212;0.38 &#x000b1; 0.70 vs &#x02212; 1.11 &#x000b1; 1.61), but could not reach statistically significant level (<italic>P</italic> value: 0.167).</p><p>Change in serum ALT was not different between responders and non-responders. On the contrary, serum GGT improved to 17.94 &#x000b1; 31.22 U/l in responders and changed to &#x02212; 3.00 &#x000b1; 38.35 U/l in non-responders. So, the present study shows GGT as a more reliable dynamic marker than ALT to assess improvement of NASH patients. These findings were not consistent with the findings of Zein <italic>et al</italic>. and Sanyal <italic>et al</italic>. In these two RCTs, histological improvement was consistent with serum ALT improvement.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] GGT was a more reliable marker of liver histology than ALT, which was previously described in another study also.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Regarding the safety profile, it was observed that Telmisartan had minimum side effects and they were similar in both groups. It has never caused significant hypotension in hypertensive and non-hypertensive NASH patients. Another study revealed that high systemic levels of Telmisartan, which were well tolerated, can be attained in normotensive adults of any age and in hypertensive subjects as well.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] None required treatment discontinuation after development of side effects in our study. Previous reports also suggested that Telmisartan was well tolerated with a low incidence of drug-related adverse events.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Another report also revealed that the adverse effect encountered with Telmisartan was less frequent than with other ARB or ACE inhibitors.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>The study limitations were the small sample size and the high number of drop-outs. With these small numbers of patients, it is very difficult to predict treatment response confidently. All patients recruited in this study were from a single tertiary-level hospital. So, the present study suffered from lack of multicenter, different ethnic categories of patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion; Telmisartan, an ARB, improved the overall histology of NASH patients significantly. It improved significantly NAS and fibrosis score. This histological improvement with Telmisartan was independent of weight reduction. Telmisartan was similarly effective in hypertensive and non-hypertensive NASH patients. Its therapeutic effect was unaltered, irrespective of metabolic factors such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, or metabolic syndrome. It had very minimum side effects during 1 year of treatment. We recommend conducting large multicenter, double-blinded RCTs to consolidate the findings of this study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Alam S, Kabir J, Mustafa G, Gupa UD, Hasan SKMN and Alam KAK declare that there is no financial relation with any person or organization for this study</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Angulo</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>GI epidemiology: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease</article-title><source>Aliment Pharmacol Ther</source><year>2007</year><volume>25</volume><fpage>883</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17402991</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ludwig</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Viggiano</surname><given-names>TR</given-names></name><name><surname>McGill</surname><given-names>DB</given-names></name><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: Mayo Clinic experience with a hitherto unnamed disease</article-title><source>Mayo Clin Proc</source><year>1980</year><volume>55</volume><fpage>434</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7382552</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Browning</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><name><surname>Szczepaniak</surname><given-names>LS</given-names></name><name><surname>Dobbins</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Nuremberg</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Horton</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Prevalence of hepatic steatosis in an urban population in the United States: Impact of ethnicity</article-title><source>Hepatology</source><year>2004</year><volume>40</volume><fpage>1387</fpage><lpage>95</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15565570</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Brancati</surname><given-names>FL</given-names></name><name><surname>Diehl</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The prevalence and etiology of elevated aminotransferase levels in the United States</article-title><source>Am J Gastroenterol</source><year>2003</year><volume>98</volume><fpage>960</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12809815</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Amarapurkar</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Kamani</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Gupte</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Agal</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Population based study</article-title><source>Ann Hepatol</source><year>2007</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>161</fpage><lpage>3</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17786142</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Misra</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Chowbey</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Makkar</surname><given-names>BM</given-names></name><name><surname>Vikram</surname><given-names>NK</given-names></name><name><surname>Wasir</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Chadha</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Consensus Group.
