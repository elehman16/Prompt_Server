Among several other promising treatment strategies in resected colon cancer, intraperitoneal anti-cancer drug administration with its appealing rationale of counteracting microscopic residual disease on peritoneal surfaces and occult metachronous liver metastases by achieving high intraportal drug concentrations has not yet undergone sufficient clinical evaluation. To determine whether a combination of this locoregional therapeutic concept with systemic intravenous administration of FU/LV would yield better results than conventional adjuvant chemoimmunotherapy with FU/levamisole, the present randomized study was initiated. A total of 241 patients with resected stage III or high-risk stage II (T4N0M0) colon cancer were randomly assigned to 'standard therapy' with FU and levamisole, given for a duration of 6 months, or to an investigational arm, consisting of LV 200 mg m(-2) plus FU 350 mg m(-2), both administered intravenously (days 1-4) and intraperitoneally (days 1 and 3) every 4 weeks for a total of six courses. In patients with stage II disease, no significant difference was noted between the two arms after a median follow-up time of 4 years (range 2.5-6 years). Among 196 eligible patients with stage III disease, however, a comparative analysis of the two treatment groups suggested both an improvement in disease-free survival (P = 0.0014) and a survival advantage (P = 0.0005), with an estimated 43% reduction in mortality rate (95% confidence interval 26-70%) in favour of the investigational arm. In agreement with its theoretical rationale, combined intraperitoneal and intravenous FU/LV was particularly effective in reducing locoregional tumour recurrences with or without liver or other organ site involvement (9 vs 25 patients in the FU/levamisole arm; P = 0.005). Treatment-associated side-effects were infrequent and generally mild in both arms, although a lower rate of severe (WHO grade 3) adverse reactions was noted in patients receiving locoregional plus intravenous chemotherapy (3% vs 12%; P = 0.01). The results of this trial suggest that combined intraperitoneal plus systemic intravenous chemotherapy with FU/LV is a promising adjuvant treatment strategy in patients with surgically resected stage III colon carcinoma.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00084-0155.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1349" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00084-0156.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1350" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00084-0157.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1351" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00084-0158.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1352" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00084-0159.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1353" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00084-0160.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1354" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
