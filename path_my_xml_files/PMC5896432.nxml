Clinically relevant risk markers of smoking-related diseases inform about the risk profile of new tobacco products in the absence of in-market epidemiological data. The menthol Tobacco Heating System 2.2 (mTHS) is a modified-risk tobacco product in development as an alternative to cigarettes (conventional cigarettes [CCs]).MethodsIn this parallel-group study, Japanese adult smokers (23&#x02013;65 years; &#x02265;10 mCCs/day) were randomized to mTHS, menthol CCs (mCC), or smoking abstinence (SA) for 5 days in confinement and 85 days in ambulatory settings. Endpoints included biomarkers of exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents and clinically relevant risk markers of smoking-related diseases.ResultsOne-hundred and sixty participants were randomized to the mTHS (n = 78), mCC (n = 42), and SA (n = 40) groups. Switching to the mTHS was associated with reductions in biomarkers of exposure compared with continuing mCCs. Reductions in 8-epi-prostaglandin F2&#x003b1; (biomarker of oxidative stress), 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 (biomarker of platelet activation), soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (biomarker of endothelial function), and an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (biomarker of lipid metabolism) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (biomarker of lung function) occurred in the mTHS group compared with the mCC group.

In 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued draft guidance for industry on the regulatory application of modified-risk tobacco products (MRTP).<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In this draft guidance, the FDA stated that the application &#x0201c;must provide scientific evidence regarding the effect of the product on the health of individuals.&#x0201d; As part of this application, the applicant must conduct a variety of studies to &#x0201c;[&#x02026;] enable FDA to fully assess&#x02014;whether using clinical risk endpoints in the case of a risk modification order or exposure risk endpoints in the case of an exposure modification order&#x02014;the health risks of the tobacco product as compared with other consumer behaviors.&#x0201d;</p><p>The evidentiary standard for assessing MRTPs, as expressed in the FDA&#x02019;s draft guidance, endorses the public health perspective for evaluating the population benefit-risk profile using CCs as a default comparator with a known risk profile. At the level of individual risk, ineffectiveness and lack of acceptance of the candidate MRTP nullifies the potential population benefit of the MRTP. In the context of MRTP assessment, nonclinical and clinical measures of relevance to long-term smoking-related disease that are sensitive to smoking cessation can be used to define the risk profile in premarketing settings, especially in the absence of long-term epidemiological and health outcome studies.</p><p>In the first stage of this process, it is important to conduct in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies to first examine whether the candidate MRTP does in fact reduce exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) of cigarette smoke, and to assess the potential toxicological effects.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Quitting smoking is known to reduce the excess risk of severe diseases, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref></sup> By switching to an MRTP associated with reduced exposure to HPHCs of cigarette smoke, we might expect to see similar reductions in clinically relevant risk markers for these diseases, as observed with smoking cessation.</p><p>A recent Japanese cross-sectional study revealed marked differences in a variety of biomarkers of cardiovascular disease between smokers and nonsmokers; some were lower in smokers, such as high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (a biomarker of lipid metabolism), and others were higher in smokers, such as fibrinogen, total white blood cell count (WBC) (biomarkers of inflammation); 8-epi-prostaglandin F2&#x003b1; (8-epi-PG-F2&#x003b1;; a biomarker of oxidative stress); and 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 (11-DTX-B2; a biomarker of platelet activation).<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The same clinical risk endpoints were examined in this study in smokers who switched to menthol THS 2.2 (mTHS) or abstained from smoking mCC.</p><p>With the objective to develop and commercialize reduced risk products, the Tobacco Heating System 2.2 (THS) (Philip Morris International, Neuch&#x000e2;tel, Switzerland) was designed to reduce the formation of HPHCs by heating rather than burning tobacco. The aerosol generated by the system delivers nicotine and flavor to the user. Several studies have examined the impact of the THS (and its prototypes) on biomarker of exposure levels in non-clinical and clinical studies, and demonstrated that the system markedly reduces exposure to HPHCs from THS aerosol compared with cigarette smoke.<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;10</xref></sup></p><p>Some studies have also investigated the impact of the THS on biologically relevant risk markers, and confirmed that this system was associated with favorable changes in biomarkers reflective of lipid metabolism and other risk markers associated with cardiovascular disease both in vitro and in vivo.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, results obtained in laboratory settings may not apply to humans; therefore, it is essential to verify whether switching to the THS is associated with improvements in relevant risk markers in humans, that is, with changes approaching those upon quitting all tobacco product use.</p><p>The present study was performed to examine the impact of switching to mTHS after 5 days of confinement and a further 85 ambulatory days in Japanese smokers. We conducted a three-way parallel-group study in which eligible participants were randomized to switching to mTHS, continuing menthol CCs (mCCs), or abstaining from smoking as the gold-standard for reducing the risk of smoking. The ambulatory period was included to examine the use and effects of mTHS under real-life conditions. This study was part of a clinical assessment program which assesses both the regular and the menthol variant of THS. The regular version was assessed first in two short term reduced exposure studies in confinement similar to the first part of the study reported here (NCT01959932 and NCT01970982). In addition, the assessment of the regular variant in ambulatory conditions is part of a 6-month Exposure Response study, currently underway in the United States (NCT02396381).</p><p>The primary and secondary objectives were to compare the changes in biomarkers of exposure to HPHCs. These results are described in a related article (Part 1). As part of the development of the THS and considering the FDA&#x02019;s draft guidance, we also investigated its impact on biologically and clinically relevant risk markers. These results are presented in this article.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s7"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was performed in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization, Good Clinical Practice, the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines,<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> national regulations, and was approved by the local Institutional Review Board in July 2013 before starting the study.

Spirometry with and without a short-acting bronchodilator was performed at the screening visit at least 1 hour after smoking to evaluate inclusion/exclusion criteria (ie, post-bronchodilator function) with the testing done without a bronchodilator first. Furthermore, spirometry without a bronchodilator was performed prior to product use on Day 0 (baseline), and on Day 6, and at the Day 90 visit (Day 91) for comparison with the baseline values. For spirometry testing the 2005 testing and quality recommendations by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society Joint Task Force on the standardization of spirometry along with the electronic data submission and documentation processes were followed. Spirometry predicted values were standardized to the NHANES III predicted set. All personnel performing spirometry testing were appropriately trained. The FEV<sub>1</sub> and forced vital capacity (FVC) were recorded and the ratio of FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The sample size was calculated based on the expected mTHS:mCC ratios of the concentrations of biomarkers of exposure, as observed in previous studies of heated tobacco products (NCT01780714 [unpublished data] and NCT01780688). A sample size of 160 participants randomized 2:1:1 to the mTHS, mCC, and SA groups, respectively, was considered sufficient to attain 80% power to show reductions of &#x02265;50% in the biomarkers of exposure chosen as the primary endpoints (Total 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol [Total NNAL], COHb, monohydroxybutenyl mercapturic acid [MHBMA], 3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid [3-HPMA], and S-phenylmercapturic acid [S-PMA]) in the mTHS group compared with the mCC group, using a one-sided test with 2.5% alpha level.</p><p>The primary analysis was conducted in the per-protocol (PP) set, which comprised all randomized subjects who were compliant to their randomized group, had not been mis-randomized, and had no major protocol deviations impacting evaluability. PP criterion in the mTHS and SA groups was no use of more than two CCs during a single day and no average daily use of more than 0.5 CCs. Missing values for the biomarkers were imputed using last observation carried forward. Non-normally distributed variables were natural log-transformed before analysis, and the results were back-transformed for presentation. Urine markers were analyzed adjusted for creatinine. The risk markers measured at baseline were summarized and Day 90 values were compared among the three groups by analysis of covariance adjusting for the baseline value, sex, and daily average mCC consumption at baseline.

The improvements in these markers approached those observed in the SA group which was included in this study as a gold-standard to evaluate the risk reduction associated with smoking cessation, and to examine whether the changes in the risk markers after switching to an MRTP mimic those associated with eliminating all tobacco product-related exposure. The changes in risk markers accompanied marked changes in biomarkers of exposure, which were apparent within 5 days of product use in confinement and were maintained for 85 days in ambulatory settings, as described in the co-publication (Part 1). As the analysis of clinical risk markers was descriptive, the findings require confirmation from separate clinical research.</p><p>The FDA highlights the assessment of clinical risk markers<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> while the Institute of Medicine report refers to intermediate clinical effects.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The clinical risk endpoints were selected from multiple clinical risk components across several biological processes, physiological systems, and mechanisms associated with smoking-related diseases, including inflammation, oxidative stress, platelet activation, lipid metabolism and lung function. Their selection was based on (1) epidemiological evidence suggesting a robust relationship between the clinical risk endpoint and at least one known smoking-related health outcome; (2) clinical evidence linking cigarette smoking to the clinical risk endpoint (consistent with the epidemiological evidence); and (3) clinical evidence linking smoking cessation to the reversibility of the endpoint. Many of the clinical risk markers evaluated in this study are described in the 2010 Surgeon General Report.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> (cf. Supplementary Material for a detailed list of references).</p><p>Several studies, including those by Miura et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and Sakaguchi et al.,<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> have evaluated the effects of MRTPs on biomarkers of exposure, but they did not examine the effects on clinical risk markers.</p><p>The present results are broadly consistent with those reported by Ogden et al., who compared tobacco-heating cigarettes, snus and ultra-low machine yield tobacco-burning cigarettes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref></sup> Ogden et al. evaluated similar biomarkers of risk, and noted that switching to tobacco-heating cigarettes was associated with reductions in platelets, sICAM-1, and WBC, while (&#x000b1;)5-iPF2a-VI (another F2-isoprostane) decreased after switching to ultra-low machine yield cigarettes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>In another study of relevance, Roethig et al. randomized adult smokers to either an electrically heated cigarette smoking system (EHCSS) or to continue CCs for 12 months.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Similar to our study, they reported that switching to the EHCSS was associated with reductions in biomarkers of exposure, including nicotine equivalents, plasma cotinine, total 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol, total 1-hydroxypyrene, urine mutagenicity, 4-aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adducts, carboxyhemoglobin, and 3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid, and these changes were accompanied by improvements in total white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, 11-DTX-B2, and HDL-cholesterol.</p><p>A recent Japanese cross-sectional study showed that many clinically relevant risk markers were markedly elevated in smokers as compared to nonsmokers.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Accordingly, the changes in risk markers observed in our study, and in the studies by Ogden et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and Roethig et al.,<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> suggest that reduced exposure to HPHCs after switching to an MRTP translated into improvements in risk markers similar to those associated with smoking cessation. The sensitivity of the majority of the risk markers to smoking status is further elucidated by reviewing the ratio and difference effects of nonsmokers versus smokers, based on the Japanese cross-sectional study publication,<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> in conjunction with the corresponding mTHS versus mCC results of the present study. Across all risk markers investigated in both studies, the results were fully consistent in direction and largely in size, with no or small effects observed for homocysteine and LDL in both studies. The cross-sectional study effects of fibrinogen, hs-CRP and HDL were within the 95% confidence intervals of the present study. After 90 days of switching from mCC to mTHS, 11-DTX-B2 reached about one third and 8-epi-PGF2&#x003b1;, SICAM-1 and WBC about half of the corresponding effect observed in the cross-sectional comparison of nonsmokers and smokers.</p><p>Lung function is defined by ventilation capacity, airway resistance and gas exchange capacity and influenced by lung elasticity and lung surface tension. A main characteristic of chronic pulmonary diseases such as COPD is the loss of lung elasticity, which develops gradually as a consequence of increased inflammatory responses and structural abnormalities such as increased thickness of the airway walls.<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref></sup> Airway resistance and a reduction in lung elasticity eventually lead to expiratory airflow limitation, the hallmark and earliest sign of COPD, resulting in delayed emptying and hyperinflation of the lung characterized by an increased residual volume (RV),<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> ultimately resulting in a decrease in vital capacity and FEV<sub>1</sub>.<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>Several studies have shown that subclinical inflammatory changes in small airways exist years before the advanced stages of COPD.<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;31</xref></sup> Although relatively few longitudinal studies have assessed the effects of smoking cessation on inflammation in smokers without chronic respiratory symptoms, these studies demonstrated that the inflammatory response decreased rapidly within the first few months after smoking cessation. Considering these earlier findings, it seems likely that the favorable changes in lung function as assessed by FEV<sub>1</sub> in the present study may be best explained by a decrease in the inflammatory state of the lung when switching from mCCs to mTHS, similar to the changes observed following smoking cessation.</p><p>With respect to risk reduction, including the risk of cardiovascular disease, the results of short-term studies, such as ours, cannot demonstrate whether switching to a candidate MRTP translates into disease risk reduction. However, it is important to measure surrogate markers which are fit for the purpose of MRTP risk assessment in short-term studies in order to predict the risk reduction profile and the potential effects of longer-term use<sup><xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> compared to continued cigarette smoking. They can subsequently be supported by larger confirmatory studies. Such cumulative and consistent evidence, covering multiple clinically relevant endpoints and related biological processes, physiological systems, and mechanisms, will provide a strengthened empirical basis of a candidate MRTP evaluation.</p><p>Some limitations of the present study warrant mentioning, including the potential for dual use (mTHS group) and restarting cigarette smoking (SA group) in the ambulatory phase, which may confound the results obtained in this period. However, the inclusion of a confinement period in which mTHS and mCC were distributed strictly according to randomization ensured that the products were used as allocated in this period. The same reduction in exposure observed under these very controlled conditions was sustained in an ambulatory, more real-life environment. Additionally, the product use recorded in the participants&#x02019; diaries, changes in exposure markers, and changes in the subjective effects of smoking (as reported in Part 1) indicate that dual use in the THS group was infrequent, and that the participants in the SA group showed good compliance to the intervention. Indeed, self-reported compliance with randomized allocation was high on Day 90, with the abstinence rate in the SA group &#x0003e; 90% and in the mTHS group 87.2% mostly mTHS users (&#x02265;70% THS use), 2.6% dual users (30% &#x0003c; THS use &#x0003c; 70%), and 3.8% mostly mCC smokers (&#x02264;30% THS use).</p><p>Another factor that warrants mentioning is that changes in the number of menthol tobacco sticks used per day and in smoking topography may influence some biomarkers of exposure, and potentially may influence the effects of MRTPs on risk markers. As described in Part 1, the participants in the mTHS group adapted their puffing behaviors through more puffs and similar total puff volumes relative to their mCC baseline puffing, resulting overall in similar nicotine concentrations in both groups. Accordingly, the changes in smoking topography or menthol sticks used are unlikely to contribute to the differences in exposure to cigarette smoke/aerosol and hence to the observed differences in biomarkers of exposure or clinical risk markers.</p><p>In one of the markers related to metabolic syndrome, waist circumference, an anomaly was observed at the level of summary statistics in that day 90 values were more than five centimeters short of the baseline values in all three groups. As the other metabolic markers, including weight, were virtually unchanged and since no causative explanation appeared even remotely plausible, we concluded that some change in measurement method had occurred between the two assessments, even though its nature could not be identified.</p><p>Finally, this study was primarily designed to establish the reduction in exposure to HPHCs. However, surrogate markers of smoking-related diseases were included in the analysis and the impact of mTHS compared to mCC on these markers resulted in changes which were consistent with those achieved by smoking cessation.</p><p>In spite of these restrictions, the weight of evidence in favor of the mTHS being a reduced risk tobacco product is compelling, and the available evidence can be gauged against the Hill criteria for product risk assessment purposes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> The observed effects of switching from mCC to mTHS are generally consistent with the prior expectations and knowledge from smoking cessation in terms of the size and favorable direction of the observed effects, consistent with findings from previous clinical studies, specific and plausible with regard to the a priori specified disease pathways. Moreover, the totality of the effects of switching to mTHS approach those seen subsequent to abstinence, thus supporting the notion of a biological gradient (dose&#x02013;response relationship). The accumulating evidence is coherent across different types of studies, including human data, experimental animal studies and in vitro models.</p><p>In summary, the findings support the presumption that the development of mTHS as consumer-acceptable inhaled nicotine delivery system would be an important advancement in pursuing harm reduction by converting adult smokers from mCC to mTHS. Analog to epidemiological information on health outcome-effects at the individual and population levels after smoking cessation, the examined clinical risk markers in this study are in line with clinical and biological effects expected with quitting combustible cigarettes.</p></sec><sec id="s24"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Switching to mTHS was associated with improvements in clinically relevant risk markers linked to oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, lipid metabolism, inflammation, and lung function. The directions of these changes in the mTHS and SA groups were similar and clearly distinct from those seen in the mCC group. Further longer term studies are ongoing to confirm the present results, and to verify the clinical relevance of the improvements in the surrogate markers for modified risk tobacco products observed here.</p></sec><sec id="s25"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>Nicotine &#x00026; Tobacco Research</italic> online.</p></sec><sec id="s26"><title>Funding</title><p>The study was funded by Philip Morris Products S.A.</p></sec><sec id="s27"><title>Declaration of Interests</title><p>
