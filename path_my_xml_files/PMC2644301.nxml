The underlying pathology of COPD in both the airways and the alveoli is inflammatory in nature[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], with the inflammation increasing as the disease progresses. Important differences between asthma and COPD pathology influence the response to treatment in each disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In asthma, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) reduce airway inflammation and improve lung function, as well as a range of clinical endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In COPD, ICS treatments have only a minimal effect on airway pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], which may explain their limited effect on rate of decline of lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the change in spirometric deterioration is only one of many important outcomes in COPD.</p><p>Among the major goals of therapy in COPD is the reduction of exacerbations, control of symptoms, and slowing the decline in health status, which may be distinct from lost lung function. A number of large randomized controlled trials have shown that treatment with ICS can achieve these effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, discontinuation of ICS therapy in subjects also using ipratropium rapidly led to the onset of recurrent exacerbations in many subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Based on this evidence, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] recommends the use of ICS in severe COPD with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) &#x0003c; 50% predicted and repeated exacerbations that require treatment with antibiotics or oral corticosteroids, a view supported by other evidence-based recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Mometasone furoate (MF), a synthetic 17-heterocyclic corticosteroid used for more than 15 years in the management of nasal inflammation and dermatoses, is now licensed for the treatment of bronchial asthma. MF appears to have a favorable side-effect profile and offers the practical advantage of a long duration of action, which permits QD therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Treatment with MF administered via a dry powder inhaler (MF-DPI) 400 &#x003bc;g QD or, in many patients, 200 &#x003bc;g QD PM, is effective and well tolerated in mild and moderate persistent asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. MF-DPI administered at a total daily dose of 800 &#x003bc;g/day (400 &#x003bc;g BID) is effective in patients with severe asthma previously dependent on maintenance oral corticosteroid therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, its effect, if any, in patients with COPD has not been established.</p><p>We hypothesized that MF-DPI 800 &#x003bc;g once daily in the evening would be statistically superior to placebo for changes from baseline in postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1 </sub>and total COPD symptoms, or the percentage of subjects with one or more exacerbations, or both. To test this hypothesis, a randomized, double blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial was conducted comparing the efficacy and safety of MF-DPI 800 &#x003bc;g once daily in the evening and MF-DPI 400 &#x003bc;g twice daily with placebo and with each other in subjects with COPD managed without ICS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study subjects</title><p>All subjects provided written informed consent approved by an Independent Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board. All subjects had a diagnosis of COPD based on currently accepted criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and were current smokers who failed a mandatory smoking cessation program or self-reported ex-smokers who had stopped smoking &#x02265; 12 months before the study. Eligible subjects had a prebronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC (forced vital capacity) ratio &#x02264; 70%, postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1 </sub>between 30% and 70% predicted, and low postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1 </sub>reversibility (&#x0003c; 10% of predicted normal). Per protocol, subjects did not receive inhaled, oral, or parenteral corticosteroids for 6 weeks prior to screening. During the study, ipratropium bromide, theophylline, short- and long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonists (with appropriate washout before study visits) were allowed.</p><p>Subjects with a clinical history of asthma or any other clinically significant medical illness other than COPD were excluded. Other exclusion criteria included a COPD exacerbation within 3 months before the baseline visit; ventilator support for respiratory failure within the past year; lobectomy, pneumonectomy, or lung volume reduction surgery; lung cancer within the past 5 years; nasal continuous positive airway pressure or oxygen use &#x0003e; 2 L/min or for &#x0003e;2 hours per day; initiation of pulmonary rehabilitation within the past 3 months; treatment with chronic or prophylactic antibiotics; inability to use the MF-DPI inhaler; and &#x0003c; 80% adherence in recording diary data between screening and baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in males and females of any race, &#x02265; 40 years of age, with a clinical history and spirometry diagnostic of COPD. The study was conducted at 95 sites in 11 countries. Subjects underwent a 2-week run-in before randomization, in which spirometry results, exacerbations, symptom scores, and health status were recorded to ensure clinical stability. Subjects who had an exacerbation during the run-in were rescreened 2 or 6 weeks after completion of antibiotic or oral corticosteroid therapy, respectively. These measurements were made at each subsequent clinic visit (weeks 1, 4, 13, 26, 39, and 52). Telephone contacts occurred at weeks 8, 17, 21, 30, 34, 43, and 47 to reinforce adherence to study procedures and monitor adverse events, exacerbations, and concomitant medication use. Eligible subjects were randomized via computer-generated code in a ratio of 2:2:1:1 to 52 weeks of treatment with MF-DPI 800 &#x003bc;g QD PM, MF-DPI 400 &#x003bc;g BID, placebo QD PM, or placebo BID. Dosing regimens (QD or BID) were not blinded. Spirometry was performed before, and 30 minutes after, inhalation of albuterol 400 &#x003bc;g. Testing was conducted to American Thoracic Society standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and the reference values of Crapo et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] were used to determine the % predicted FEV<sub>1</sub>. Subjects maintained twice-daily diaries documenting symptom scores, daily use of rescue medication, and cigarette consumption. Exacerbations requiring treatment with antibiotics or oral corticosteroids were recorded throughout the study. Subjects who discontinued during the treatment period continued to maintain their diaries, which were reviewed at follow-up visits. Health-related quality of life was evaluated at baseline and every 3 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>. Other prespecified efficacy variables were the percentage of subjects with 1 or more exacerbations during the study and the change from baseline in total COPD symptom scores. An exacerbation was defined as a clinically significant worsening of COPD symptoms requiring treatment with antibiotics and/or systemic steroids. Subjects who experienced 3 COPD exacerbations or needed more than 3 weeks of treatment for an exacerbation were discontinued. Total symptom scores were the average of daytime and nighttime scores for difficulty breathing, coughing, and wheezing. Subjects recorded scores for each of these symptoms in daily diaries. Difficulty breathing was rated on separate scales for daytime and nighttime scores of 0 (none) to 4 (severe), while coughing and wheezing were rated on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (very uncomfortable). Secondary efficacy evaluations were changes from baseline in St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and 36-item Short Form (SF-36) scores, prebronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>, prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator FVC and forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of vital capacity (FEF<sub>25%&#x02013;75%</sub>), and individual daytime and nighttime symptom scores.</p><p>Safety assessments included monitoring of adverse events, with specific oropharyngeal and forearm examinations, and assessment of vital signs at all study visits. Physical examinations and laboratory tests were done at screening and the final visit. Plasma cortisol levels were assessed at the baseline and final visits in subjects at approximately 15 centers; samples were taken at 4 AM, 5 AM, 6 AM, 7 AM, 8 AM, 9 AM, 10 AM, 12 PM, 4 PM, 8 PM, and 11 PM. In other selected centers, bone mineral density (BMD) in the lumbar spine and proximal femur, using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was assessed. The bone scans were performed by local radiologists and the results were reviewed by Synarc, Inc. (Portland, OR).</p><p>The efficacy and safety analyses were based on all randomized subjects (intent-to-treat population). A confirmatory analysis of subjects who met key eligibility and evaluability criteria was also performed. Results are expressed as least squares means (&#x000b1; SD). A longitudinal analysis-random coefficient model was used to evaluate treatment effects on postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1 </sub>and COPD symptom scores. Longitudinal analysis of results for postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1 </sub>extracted sources of variability due to smoking status, treatment, number of days on treatment, and treatment-by-time interaction, with a random slope and intercept for each subject. An unstructured covariance matrix, with variance of random intercepts and slopes and covariance between intercepts and slopes, was chosen to allow full flexibility of the model. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenzsel test was used to analyze exacerbation frequency.</p><p>The primary hypothesis was that 800 &#x003bc;g QD PM would be superior to placebo with respect to changes from baseline in postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1 </sub>and either total COPD symptom scores or proportion of subjects with one or more exacerbations during the study. The study design required that 780 subjects meet the criteria for evaluation of the 3 prespecified efficacy variables. To control for type I error, the pooled MF-DPI groups were to be compared with the pooled placebo groups. If pooled MF-DPI was significantly superior to pooled placebo for FEV<sub>1 </sub>and at least 1 of the other prespecified criteria, then the following comparisons were made: MF-DPI 800 &#x003bc;g QD PM versus pooled placebo, MF-DPI 400 &#x003bc;g BID versus placebo. If at least 1 of the MF-DPI treatments was superior to placebo, then the 2 MF-DPI treatments were compared with each other. Mean changes from baseline were compared at a 2-sided &#x003b1; = 0.05, providing at least 90% power to detect between the treatment means a difference of 50 mL in postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>, a difference of 0.2 in total symptom scores, and a 16% difference in the proportion of subjects having at least 1 exacerbation. This power was maintained throughout the stepwise comparisons of MF-DPI treatments with placebo. A post hoc analysis was performed to test whether the MF-DPI 800 &#x003bc;g QD PM and 400 &#x003bc;g BID were equivalent in terms of their effects on the co-primary endpoints of FEV<sub>1</sub>, total symptom scores, and exacerbations. The equivalence margin chosen was 50% of the difference between placebo and MF-DPI 400 &#x003bc;g BID. The post hoc analysis had 78% power to detect equivalence with regard to FEV<sub>1</sub>, 59% power to detect equivalence with regard to total symptom scores, and 21% power to detect equivalence with regard to exacerbations.</p><p>To protect against inflation of the error rate for multiple primary endpoints, comparisons of exacerbations and symptom scores were adjusted using a modified Bonferroni correction, with a 2-sided &#x003b1; = 0.025 for the more significant comparisons and &#x003b1; = 0.05 for the less significant comparisons. This was determined by the size of the results from the symptom score and exacerbation comparisons, the smaller of which was considered more significant as it required &#x003b1; = 0.025 for statistical significance, and the results of the larger value considered less significant, as it required &#x003b1; = 0.05 for statistical significance.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 911 subjects were randomized to treatment with MF-DPI 800 &#x003bc;g QD PM (n = 308), MF-DPI 400 &#x003bc;g BID (n = 308), or placebo (n = 295). Of these, 319 subjects discontinued treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The proportion of subjects discontinuing because of treatment failure was higher in the placebo group (8%) than in the MF-DPI groups (2%). The time to discontinuation was longest in the MF-DPI 800 &#x003bc;g QD PM group and shortest in the placebo group, with greater separation between active treatments and placebo over the treatment period. All treatment groups were similar with regard to baseline demographics and disease characteristics (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), smoking status, previous ICS use, and concomitant long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist use. Of the randomized subjects, 250 had entered the prescreening smoking cessation program. One hundred eleven (44%) of these 250 subjects had completed the program and 139 (56%) had discontinued the program. At baseline, approximately 30 subjects in each treatment group (n = 92) had DXA scans of the lumbar spine and femoral neck; approximately 20 in each group (n = 65) had DXA scans at study endpoint. These subjects had comparable demographic and disease characteristics to each other and to the overall study population. Their mean age was 65 years, 38% were females and 62% were males, and their mean postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1 </sub>was 1.46 L.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline demographics and disease characteristics in all randomized subjects</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center"><bold>MF-DPI 800 &#x003bc;g QD PM (n = 308)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>MF-DPI 400 &#x003bc;g BID (n = 308)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Placebo (n = 295)</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Mean age, y</td><td align="center">65.3</td><td align="center">65.0</td><td align="center">65.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sex, n (%)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Women</td><td align="center">95 (31)</td><td align="center">102 (33)</td><td align="center">92 (31)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Men</td><td align="center">213 (69)</td><td align="center">206 (67)</td><td align="center">203 (69)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Race, n (%)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;White</td><td align="center">271 (88)</td><td align="center">264 (86)</td><td align="center">252 (85)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Non-white</td><td align="center">37 (12)</td><td align="center">44 (14)</td><td align="center">43 (15)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mean body mass index, kg/m<sup>2</sup></td><td align="center">26.7*</td><td align="center">26.1*</td><td align="center">27.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mean COPD duration, y</td><td align="center">7.33*</td><td align="center">7.31<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center">7.26</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Pulmonary function</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Prebronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>, L</td><td align="center">1.32</td><td align="center">1.25</td><td align="center">1.26</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>, L</td><td align="center">1.45</td><td align="center">1.38</td><td align="center">1.41</td></tr><tr><td align="left">% FEV<sub>1 </sub>predicted</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Prebronchodilator</td><td align="center">43</td><td align="center">42</td><td align="center">42</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Postbronchodilator</td><td align="center">47</td><td align="center">46</td><td align="center">47</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Reversibility (%)</td><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">COPD severity, n (%)<sup>&#x02021;</sup></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;FEV<sub>1 </sub>50%&#x02013;&#x0003c;80% predicted</td><td align="center">97 (32)</td><td align="center">88 (29)</td><td align="center">81 (28)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;FEV<sub>1 </sub>30%&#x02013;&#x0003c;50% predicted</td><td align="center">142 (46)</td><td align="center">136 (44)</td><td align="center">127 (43)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;FEV<sub>1 </sub>&#x0003c; 30% predicted</td><td align="center">60 (20)</td><td align="center">67 (22)</td><td align="center">67 (23)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Missing<sup>&#x000a7;</sup></td><td align="center">8 (3)</td><td align="center">17 (6)</td><td align="center">20 (7)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>BID = twice daily; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; FEV<sub>1 </sub>= forced expiratory volume in 1 second; MF-DPI = mometasone furoate administered via a dry powder inhaler.</p><p>*n = 305</p><p><sup>&#x02020;</sup>n = 306</p><p><sup>&#x02021;</sup>Sum of % values may not be 100% due to rounding.</p><p><sup>&#x000a7;</sup>Screen failures or inadequate data (at least one valid measure of prebronchodilator or postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>, but not both, were available).</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Disposition of study subjects.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1465-9921-9-73-1"/></fig><sec><title>Pulmonary function</title><p>Significant improvements in postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1 </sub>were observed in both MF-DPI groups over the 1-year treatment period (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

No significant differences were observed between any of the treatment groups.</p><p>At endpoint, there was a significant decrease of 22.9% in the plasma cortisol level for subjects in the MF-DPI 400 &#x003bc;g BID treatment group compared with an increase of 3.7% for subjects in the MF-DPI 800 &#x003bc;g QD PM group (<italic>P </italic>= 0.040) and 5.3% for subjects in the placebo group (<italic>P </italic>= 0.007).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first randomized controlled trial to report the effects of once-daily therapy with an ICS in subjects with COPD. MF-DPI produced improvements in a range of efficacy endpoints that were generally comparable in magnitude to those reported with other ICSs when studied in subjects with moderate-to-severe COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] This study also demonstrated that MF-DPI 800 &#x003bc;g QD PM has comparable efficacy to dividing the dose into a BID regimen, especially for number and severity of exacerbations.</p><p>The primary outcome of this study was the change in postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>, which has been noted to improve in some, but not all, previous trials of ICS in COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. With both MF-DPI dosing regimens, there was an early and sustained improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub>, which was comparable to that seen with fluticasone 500 &#x003bc;g BID in similar subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In subjects receiving placebo, postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1 </sub>declined during the study, whereas it improved with both MF-DPI regimens. This change occurred independently of the initial degree of airflow obstruction, but was influenced by the patient's smoking status. Ex-smokers showed a greater improvement in postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1 </sub>with the ICS than subjects who continued to smoke despite a smoking cessation program. This effect was not explained by the previously described short-term improvement in lung function that occurs in individuals who stop smoking, a finding which is more evident when lung function is better preserved[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Subjects who successfully quit smoking during the smoking cessation program were ineligible for the study because they would show improvements in lung function that would interfere with the evaluation of treatment effects. The differences in FEV<sub>1 </sub>between the active treatment and placebo groups were similar to the differences in the acute response of FEV<sub>1 </sub>to high doses of oral prednisolone given for a shorter period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The relative lack of response among continuing smokers resembles the recently described clinical corticosteroid resistance in subjects with bronchial asthma who continued to smoke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A molecular basis for this form of relative corticosteroid resistance has been proposed and may be relevant to the pathogenesis of COPD[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The number of exacerbations reported by subjects in the present trial was lower than that reported in some previous studies, despite the many participants who had severe COPD, which is commonly associated with more frequent exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Unlike the ISOLDE and TORCH studies that accrued exacerbations over 3 years, subjects were studied for 12 months and a history of either chronic bronchitis or previous exacerbations was not an enrollment criterion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The use of regular telephone contacts may have improved patient compliance with therapy and enhanced the benefit of participating in a clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Although the number of events was lower than anticipated, the time to the first exacerbation was significantly increased in subjects receiving ICS. This form of analysis is a statistically efficient way of testing for an effect on exacerbation rate and is most appropriate when the subjects drop out in significant numbers during the trial. This was the case here, with an excessive number of subjects randomized to placebo withdrawing. This finding has been seen in other clinical trials using ICS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and subjects who drop out in this way are normally those who are deteriorating most rapidly in terms of lung function and health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The ability of subjects randomized to MF-DPI to complete the study is a further indication of a positive treatment effect. Furthermore, more placebo-treated subjects had severe exacerbations that required hospitalization or additional treatment, other than antibiotic therapy, suggesting that MF-DPI reduces both the number and severity of exacerbations. Based on pooled results for the MF-DPI groups, the number needed to treat to prevent an exacerbation in one year was 14.</p><p>The exacerbation rate is an important determinant of health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Despite the relatively low number of events observed, a significant improvement was observed in the SGRQ Total score in subjects receiving MF-DPI during the study. This was similar to the annual difference in SGRQ between placebo and active treatment in the ISOLDE study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and was comparable in magnitude to the improvement in health status in other studies where ICS treatments were withdrawn at random and subjects followed subsequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The improvement in the SF-36 physical function scale is in keeping with the improvement reported with fluticasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The diary card symptom scores changed in a comparable fashion to the health status measures. However, the lack of a validated symptom score for diary card data limits its quantitative interpretation. Nonetheless, significant changes were observed in the average diary card symptom score, which was the composite endpoint used to assess a range of COPD symptoms. Not every symptom was present in every individual, so the aggregate score tends to underestimate the benefit in subjects who were symptomatic. However, it provides important additional evidence that improvements in clinically relevant symptoms were occurring more frequently in subjects receiving ICS therapy.</p><p>The incidence and nature of adverse events were in keeping with those reported previously, with more subjects reporting symptoms of pharyngitis and a hoarse voice in the ICS group than in the placebo group. In the ICS group, the number needed to harm by causing a case of pneumonia was 49. Spontaneous bruising was a frequent finding in subjects receiving placebo but was more frequent with both ICS regimens. This might reflect greater bioavailability of MF, as a reduction in the plasma cortisol was observed in the subgroup of subjects in which this was recorded. However, these changes were modest, with values within the established normal range and no clinically significant hypoadrenalism identified. In the subgroup in which BMD measurements were made, there was evidence of some spontaneous improvement in the placebo group, a finding also noticed in the larger data set from the second Lung Health study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. This may reflect between-measurement variation in this test, and the apparent reduction in BMD with the MF-DPI BID regimen may also be a consequence of this variability. The lack of change in BMD seen with the MF-DPI QD regimen was encouraging and in keeping with the findings reported in the larger series of BMD measurements made in US participants in the TORCH study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. As in that report and in the INSPIRE study comparing tiotropium and the fluticasone propionate/salmeterol combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], we saw more episodes of pneumonia in the patients who received the mometasone treatment compared to those who did not. Like these other reports, treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid was associated with better health status and fewer exacerbations. The nature of these relatively infrequent events requires further clarification but large patient populations will be needed to achieve this.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the current findings in subjects with moderate-to-severe COPD provide further evidence of an effect of ICS treatment on a number of clinically relevant endpoints and demonstrate that MF has benefits similar to those reported for other ICS therapies. The observation of greater improvements in lung function in ex-smokers requires further prospective testing, but does suggest that this group of patients may benefit with ICS therapy. Longer-term changes in lung function should be examined in this patient population. Finally, the results demonstrate that once-daily therapy with inhaled corticosteroids is as effective as dividing the dose into a morning and evening regimen in COPD patients. This has practical relevance as inhaled therapy producing once-daily bronchodilatation is now available, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and the benefits of using inhaled corticosteroids in COPD are greater when they are used as part of a combination regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Our data suggest that MF can be used in a similar fashion to once-daily bronchodilator drugs, with the potential advantages of improved treatment adherence and convenience for the patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ATS: American Thoracic Society; BID: twice a day; BDP: beclomethasone dipropionate; BMD: bone mineral density; COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; DPI: dry powder inhaler; DXA: dual energy X-ray absorptiometry; FEF<sub>25%&#x02013;75%</sub>: forced expiratory flow (L/s) between 25% and 75% of vital capacity; FEV<sub>1</sub>: forced expiratory volume (L) in one second; FVC: forced vital capacity (L); GOLD: Global Initiative for COPD; ICS: inhaled corticosteroid; MCS: mental health component summary of the SF-36; MF: mometasone furoate; MF-DPI: mometasone furoate delivered via a dry powder inhaler; PCS: physical health component summary of the SF-36; QD PM: once daily in the evening; SD: standard deviation; SF-36: short form 36; SGRQ: St. George's respiratory questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>PMAC has spoken at an ERS evening symposium supported by the sponsors of this study and has conducted research into the role of other inhaled corticosteroids in COPD.
