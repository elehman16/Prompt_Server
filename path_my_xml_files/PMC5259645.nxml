Although the cause of acid&#x02010;related disorders is often multifactorial, healing of proximal GI tissue injury is based on sustaining an increased gastric pH. In human patients with acid&#x02010;related disorders, the mean percentage of time (MPT) that the gastric pH is above 3.0 and 4.0 in a 24&#x02010;hour period predicts tissue healing.<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> Thus, acid suppressant drugs represent the mainstay of the medical treatment of acid&#x02010;related disorders. Two classes of acid suppressants, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole, and histamine&#x02010;2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), such as famotidine, are commercially available.</p><p>In published studies in healthy dogs and cats, omeprazole has proven to be more effective at raising intragastric pH than famotidine and is often recommended for the treatment of erosive and ulcerative GI disease.<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> Despite this, famotidine continues to be widely used in veterinary medicine and there might be good reasons behind this practice. Unlike omeprazole, famotidine can be given with a full meal, is relatively inexpensive, is thought to have additional tissue healing effects including increased mucus and bicarbonate secretion, and is maximally effective within hours of administration.<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> Moreover, chronic administration of PPIs to dogs and cats might not be without complications. A recent meta&#x02010;analysis suggested an association between chronic PPI use and development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people.<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> Chronic use of PPIs has also been linked to a wide range of adverse effects in people, including an increased risk for the development of community&#x02010;acquired pneumonia, <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>&#x02010;associated diarrhea (CDAD), hypocobalaminemia, and decreased bone mineral content.<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> The development of adverse effects depends on the duration of exposure to the drug with some adverse effects occurring within days to weeks (eg, CDAD) and others developing after years of chronic use (eg, hypomagnesemia). Omeprazole administration for 60 days can result in hypergastrinemia, withdrawal&#x02010;induced rebound gastric acid hypersecretion, and potentially decreased bone mineral content in cats.<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> Additionally, aggressive acid suppression is not always warranted. Therefore, famotidine, a weaker acid suppressant associated with fewer adverse effects than PPIs in people, might be a reasonable choice of acid suppression in dogs when prolonged or less potent acid suppression is desired. However, the efficacy of prolonged famotidine use has not been explored in dogs. Repeat famotidine administration might lead to diminished efficacy in dogs. The acid suppressing effects of famotidine and other H2RAs in humans can decrease with continued administration perhaps because of a reduction in the degradation of parietal cell H2&#x02010;receptors over time.<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> In people, this effect occurs in as little as 8 days of continuous oral treatment.<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> Recognition of this phenomenon in dogs is needed to create successful acid suppressant therapy guidelines. In a study designed to evaluate serum gastrin concentrations in 11 dogs receiving oral famotidine at 0.5 mg/kg twice daily, gastrin was increased on day 3 but returned to normal on day 14 despite continued famotidine administration.<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> Although intragastric pH was not measured in that study, these results suggest a reduction in efficacy over time.</p><p>Despite its widespread use, studies have not been undertaken to investigate for a potential for a diminishing acid suppressing effect of famotidine over time in dogs. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to determine whether continued administration of famotidine leads to a reduced effect on intragastric pH in dogs. We hypothesized that famotidine would have a diminished effect on intragastric pH on day 13 compared to day 1.</p><sec id="jvim14615-sec-0008"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="jvim14615-sec-0009"><title>Study Animals</title><p>The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Tennessee approved the protocol for this study (Approval# 2456&#x02010;0516).

An IV catheter was placed, and general anesthesia was induced with propofol<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14615-note-1010">9</xref> to effect. General anesthesia was maintained in dogs with sevoflurane<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14615-note-1011">10</xref> in 100% oxygen after endotracheal tube placement. The entire esophagus and stomach were evaluated by endoscopy for any evidence of gross disease. Gastric biopsy samples were obtained by routine gastric endoscopic biopsy. Gastric tissue samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, paraffin embedded, sliced in 5&#x02010;&#x003bc;m sections, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and assessed by a single board&#x02010;certified pathologist (KN). After acquisition of biopsies, a pH capsule<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14615-note-1012">11</xref> was placed in the gastric fundus under endoscopic guidance as previously described.<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> Before use, all pH capsules and receivers were calibrated as previously described according to manufacturer's instructions.<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> All pH capsules were placed by the same investigator (MKT). The location of each pH capsule was kept consistent in each dog within and between treatment groups by utilizing the measurements on the capsule delivery device to measure the distance from the maxillary canine teeth to the area of capsule placement. On day 12 of both treatment periods as well as baseline (day 0) of the second treatment group, pH capsules were placed by radiographic guidance under sedation with dexmedetomidine and butorphanol, as previously described<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, to eliminate the need for repeated general anesthesia. Briefly, after sedation, dogs were placed in left lateral recumbency. The pH capsule was then blindly introduced transorally into the proximal stomach. We used the recorded length of the delivery device measurement for the first capsule placed endoscopically to place the second capsule in a similar location. For radiographic assessment, location of the capsule with its delivery device in respect to the stomach was evaluated on orthogonal (lateral and ventrodorsal) abdominal radiographs after published criteria for normal radiographic anatomy of the stomach in dogs.<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> Successful placement of the capsule within the fundus was ascertained by visualization of the device in the dorsal part of the stomach (at the level of or slightly dorsal to the esophageal hiatus) on the lateral view, and to the left of midline on the ventrodorsal view which corresponds to reported location of the gastric fundus on abdominal radiographs in dogs (Fig. <xref rid="jvim14615-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). The ability to visualize rugal folds in these fasted animals with a small amount of gas and no fluid or solid contents within the gastric lumen further aided in radiographic identification of the fundus. After confirmation of correct positioning, the pH capsule was adhered to the gastric mucosa with vacuum suction and a spring&#x02010;loaded pin as previously described<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. The delivery device was removed.

In 3 of the 6 dogs, mild lymphoplasmacytic gastritis (20&#x02013;50 lymphocytes and plasma cells per 400&#x000d7; field) was noted.

On 2 occasions (one with endoscopic guidance and one with radiographic guidance), the pH capsule failed to deploy from the delivery device. This was thought to be attributable to a malfunction of the delivery device itself. On the 3rd occasion, by which placement of the capsule was attempted with radiographic guidance, capsule attachment was unsuccessful because food particles obstructed the capsule's suction well. In all 3 cases, a new pH capsule was placed in the gastric fundus without complications. With respect to the adhered capsules, on 2 occasions, the Bravo pH capsule detached and exited the stomach before the end of the pH monitoring period. This occurred in 1 dog while receiving famotidine on treatment day 2 and one other dog while receiving placebo on treatment day 13. Therefore, data from these dogs were not included in the treatment comparisons on days in which the data were not available. In 5 dogs receiving famotidine and 3 dogs receiving placebo on day 3 and 3 dogs receiving famotidine and 4 dogs receiving placebo on day 14 of treatment, capsules remained in the stomach and, thus, additional data were gathered and described on these days but were not included in statistical comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="jvim14615-sec-0018"><title>Intragastric pH Recordings</title><p>The MPT that the gastric pH was &#x02265;3.0 and 4.0 in a 24&#x02010;hour period was used, in addition to mean intragastric pH, for analyses.<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> The mean &#x000b1; standard error MPT intragastric pH &#x02265;3 and &#x02265;4 as well as mean intragastric pH for dogs receiving famotidine and placebo on days 1&#x02013;2 and 12&#x02013;13 are listed in Table <xref rid="jvim14615-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref> and Figures <xref rid="jvim14615-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14615-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.

Our results demonstrate that dogs receiving famotidine had significant decreases in mean intragastric pH and MPT the intragastric pH was &#x02265;3 and &#x02265;4 on treatment days 12 and 13 as compared to days 1 and 2. In contrast, there were no significant differences in these variables when dogs received placebo for the same time period. The pH goals for the treatment of duodenal ulceration and gastroesophageal reflux disease in humans are to maintain an intragastric pH at or above 3 for at least 75% of the day and a pH at or above 4 for at least 67% of the day, respectively.<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> On day 1 of treatment, famotidine administration resulted in excellent gastric acid suppression in our study dogs, achieving a MPT intragastric pH &#x02265;3 and pH &#x02265;4 of 85 and 77%, respectively. On day 2, famotidine administration achieved a MPT intragastric pH &#x02265;3 and &#x02265;4 of 74 and 64%, respectively. By days 12 and 13, however, the gastric acid suppressing effects of famotidine declined significantly and failed to meet either pH goal for pH increase for humans in all dogs. Indeed, on treatment days 12 and 13, there were no significant differences in mean intragastric pH, MPT intragastric pH &#x02265;3, and &#x02265;4 between famotidine and placebo. Moreover, data from 5 dogs receiving oral famotidine suggest that there was already decreased control of gastric acidity on day 3 of treatment. For the most part, serum gastrin concentrations mirrored those of intragastric pH with serum gastrin concentrations being undetectable at baseline, increasing significantly on day 3, and falling by day 12 of famotidine treatment. These results suggest that famotidine might be a good treatment for short&#x02010;term control of clinical signs or prophylactic therapy but that the efficacy of famotidine decreases over time.</p><p>It is unknown if these findings with oral famotidine can be extrapolated to prolonged administration of parenteral forms of famotidine in dogs. However, studies in human subjects suggest that the effect of tolerance occurs even more rapidly, in as short as 12&#x02013;72 hours, when famotidine is administered IV.<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> More studies are needed to determine whether tolerance develops in dogs with repeated intravenous administration of famotidine.</p><p>In this study, we chose to investigate oral doses of 1.0 mg/kg q12h as this is the standard dose of famotidine used in our hospital for the treatment of ulcerative disease when a proton pump inhibitor cannot be used. We cannot say if lower doses of famotidine would have also resulted in tolerance in dogs, however, based on work done in people, the authors believe that lowering the dose would still result in tolerance. For example, tolerance developed in people treated with doses as low as 40 mg of famotidine at night and with a variety of doses of ranitidine (150 mg at night, 300 mg at night, and 150 mg twice daily).<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> Moreover, previous work evaluating the effect of lower doses of famotidine (1.0 mg/kg/d) on gastrin concentrations in dogs demonstrated that serum gastrin concentrations normalized within 7&#x02013;14 days of treatment despite continued famotidine administration. Although more work is needed, this work might suggest that lowering the dose of famotidine would not mitigate induction of tolerance in dogs.<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>
</p><p>Radiographic guidance to place pH capsules was used in this study, as reported in cats.<xref rid="jvim14615-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> The procedure was quick and easy to perform under sedation and obviated the need for the use of general anesthesia for pH capsule placement in the gastric fundus. The option to place pH capsules with sedation might allow for pursuit of continuous esophageal and gastric pH monitoring in patients where general anesthesia is not feasible or is ill&#x02010;advised.</p><p>This study included a small group of dogs with no known history, physical examination, or biochemical evidence of GI disease. However, 3 of the 6 study dogs had histopathologic evidence of mild lymphoplasmacytic gastritis. The importance of this finding is uncertain given that these dogs were free of clinical signs of disease; however, this emphasizes the importance of the crossover design for pharmacologic studies where each dog serves as its own control. Despite this, the 3 dogs with subclinical gastritis responded similarly to those without gastritis. pH data from all dogs, both with and without gastritis, demonstrated a decreased acid suppressing effect with repeated famotidine administration over time. Moreover, there were no significant differences observed in regard to the effect of famotidine on mean intragastric pH, MPT intragastric pH &#x02265;3, and &#x02265;4 between dogs with and without gastritis. Additional studies are needed to determine whether these results are also observed in dogs with clinical disease that warrants acid suppression therapy.</p><p>In conclusion, these results suggest that famotidine loses efficacy as an acid suppressant over time when administered twice daily in dogs. Thus, caution is advised when recommending long&#x02010;term oral administration of famotidine in dogs.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="jvim14615-sec-0022"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Dr Randy Buddington, Dr Emily Gould, Rachel Dickson, Shanna Hillsman, and Tammy Moyers for their technical support.</p><p>
