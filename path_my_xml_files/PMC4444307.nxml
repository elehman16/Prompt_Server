This is the first randomised controlled trial in which a blended treatment - including four face-to-face sessions and a smartphone application - was compared against a full behavioural treatment. Hence, the aim of the current paper was to examine whether a blended smartphone treatment was non-inferior to a full behavioural activation treatment for depression.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a randomised controlled non-inferiority trial (NCT01819025) comparing a blended treatment (<italic>n</italic>=46) against a full ten-session treatment (<italic>n</italic>=47) for people suffering from major depression. Primary outcome measure was the BDI-II, that was administered at pre- and post-treatment, as well as six months after the treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Results showed significant improvements in both groups across time on the primary outcome measure (within-group Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>=1.35; CI [&#x02212;0.82, 3.52] to <italic>d</italic>=1.47; CI [&#x02212;0.41, 3.35]; between group <italic>d</italic>=&#x02212;0.13 CI [&#x02212;2.37, 2.09] and <italic>d</italic>=&#x02212;0.10 CI [&#x02212;2.53, 2.33]).

One possibility is to use smartphone-delivered psychological treatments [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A challenge associated with using mobile phones as platform for psychological treatment is that the user must be able to interact with the program in a fast and easy way [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It has been suggested that singular treatment components, such as activity scheduling in behavioural activation (BA), might be a better target for smartphone applications than entire multi-component treatment packages [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. BA has been found to be effective in a series of meta-analyses in the treatment of depression [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and can be delivered by non-specialists [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, recent research has shown that BA can be delivered with the use of new mobile technologies (e.g. smartphones) [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In light of the research support for BA [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] as well as of the initial promising findings of smartphone-delivered psychological treatment for depression [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], we assumed that a combination of these two aspects might be useful to explore in such a way that the number of treatment sessions would be reduced by means of the smartphone applications. The evaluation of combined treatment methods shows promising results (e.g., combining an internet treatment program with live group sessions for social phobia) [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, these treatment programs mainly rely on self-help exercises, reading texts, and online group discussions with the support from therapist-guided sessions [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The starting point of our treatment was traditional face-to-face treatment with the addition of a smartphone tool for support. The goal was to reduce the therapist time in a full face-to-face BA treatment while maintaining the same treatment quality. It has recently been suggested that this kind of blended approach should be further investigated in randomised controlled trials, since initial evaluation show that both patients and therapists expect more benefits than drawbacks from this format [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a <italic>blended treatment</italic> that consists of a smartphone activity scheduling application in addition to a face-to-face treatment for major depression. Since it is known that BA works for major depression [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the study was designed as a non-inferiority trial. Thus, we used four face-to-face sessions plus the smartphone application and compared this outcome against a full regular ten-session program conducted without the smartphone support. We hypothesised that the new treatment would be non-inferior to the standard treatment and consequently, overcome the drawbacks that previous studies have suggested, namely that adding digital components also increases costs and workload among professionals [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>Participants were recruited by self-referral via advertisements in Swedish newspapers.

The period from the online screening to the onset of the treatments was as soon as possible, but no longer than 4 weeks. All diagnostic interviews (MINI) were conducted by MSc clinical psychology students mentioned below, who at post-measurement were blind to both participants&#x02019; conditions and the treatments they provided. At follow-up treatment, the interviews were conducted by other clinical psychology students, who were also blind to both the participant&#x02019;s condition and the treatment they provided.</p><p>The study was designed as a randomised controlled non-inferiority trial. An external person not involved in the study performed the randomisation. A true random number service (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.random.org">www.random.org</ext-link>) was used to ensure complete randomness. The random sequence was generated after inclusion of participants to ensure that assignment of intervention was concealed from the assessing psychologists and researchers involved in the study. Participants were allocated to the blended treatment or to the full BA treatment by using simple randomisation, which in larger samples can be trusted to generate similar numbers of subjects among groups [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

For the BDI-II, the subsequent non-inferiority margin was 2.50 points, which corresponds to a standardised mean difference of that magnitude, assuming a standard deviation of 5 BDI-II points. Based on Cohen&#x02019;s tables [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] we estimated that a sample size of 93 participants would be enough to establish a difference of 2.50 BDI-II points with a two-sided <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.05 and an independent t-test.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Blended treatment</title><p>The blended treatment consisted of four face-to-face sessions and a smartphone application that was used between the sessions. The treatment period ranged over nine weeks with face-to-face sessions every second or third week. The treatment structure was documented in a treatment manual. The manual was created specially for the current intervention by our research group, but inspired by Martell and co-workers&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] BA treatment manual. The treatment focused on replacing depressed behaviour with non-depressed (healthy) behaviour that leads to sustainable positive reinforcement. A detailed description of each session can be found in <xref rid="pone.0126559.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>. Since we only involved four face-to-face sessions, the current treatment was refined to target the mechanisms of increasing exposure to positive consequences of healthy behaviour and thereby increasing the likely recurrence of such behaviour (see <xref rid="pone.0126559.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> for screenshots of the application). Thus, components such as tackling avoidance and ruminative thinking were not part of the blended treatment. The application was distributed via a web link that was sent out by email prior to the first face-to-face session. The main purpose of the smartphone application was that participants were able to recall and save important non-depressed behaviour to increase everyday activity. This behaviour was specified in consultation with the therapist during the face-to-face sessions. The application also contained a database of 54 non-depressed behaviours divided into three different categories, which participants could add to their application (see SI 2 for the list of behavioural activities in the database). The database aimed to provide suggestions, support, and inspiration for the participants to add their own behavioural activities between the sessions. After a behavioural activity was completed, the participant could save this activity in the application and add a short comment. The participant had access to the statistics and summaries of the quantitative (e.g., behaviour frequency) and qualitative data (e.g., comments). There was also a back-end system, where the therapist could access all participants&#x02019; quantitative and qualitative data on a website. The therapist could use the back-end system to send short text messages to the participants via a messaging system, similar to a Short Message Service (SMS). The messaging system was used by the therapists to send personal encouraging messages every other or every third day to the participant as well as weekly general educational messages. The system worked as a one-way communication channel, that is, the participant was not able to respond to the messages. No sensitive personal data, through which the person could be identified, were saved. In addition, all internet (including the therapists&#x02019; back-end system) and smartphone activities (including the participants&#x02019; mobile application) were secured by means of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encrypted information. All participants were using their own smartphones. No monthly service charges for the phone were paid for.</p><fig id="pone.0126559.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0126559.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Description of session content for blended treatment.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0126559.g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Full behavioural activation</title><p>Following Martell et al.&#x02019;s treatment manual, the full comparison treatment consists of a ten face-to-face session BA treatment [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

Therapists were randomly assigned to participants with the restriction not to work with more than two participants from each group. Before the treatment started, the therapists were trained in BA, MINI, and the treatment manuals, as well as on how to use the smartphone application and the back-end system.

Tests of baseline differences between conditions were examined using independent samples t-tests for continuous distributed variables and chi-square tests of independence for categorical data. Primary and secondary continuous outcomes were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle using mixed effects models given their ability to handle missing data [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Differences between the blended treatment and the full BA were primarily investigated by modelling interaction effects between group and time. Random intercept models were selected for all measures.</p><p>According to the intention-to-treat principle, the models employed made use of all available data and retained all randomised participants. The mixed-effects models were estimated by means of full information maximum likelihood estimation. Maximum likelihood estimation provides unbiased estimates in the presence of missing observations under the less restrictive assumption that data are missing for ignorable non-random reasons [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Recovery after treatment was investigated using the BDI-II. To define responders on the BDI-II, we used Jacobson and Truax [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] procedures for calculating reliable and clinically relevant changes of significance to quantify clinical improvement in depressive symptoms on the BDI-II, which is recommended as a standard reporting method for all published research involving psychological interventions. In calculating reliable and clinically relevant criterions for changes of significance, we used data from the BDI-II manual for clinical means, standard deviations and reliability estimates (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha), and data from Dozois et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] for the non-clinical means and standard deviations. On the basis of these data, a participant had to improve by ten points or more from pre-treatment to post- and follow-up treatment to show reliable changes (see Jacobson &#x00026; Truax [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], for details of calculations). In addition, a score of 13 or below post-treatment and follow-up was required to meet criterions for clinically significant changes. This cut-off score was chosen based on the scoring of the BDI-II [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, to meet the criterions for recovery, a participant had to improve by ten points or more and score 13 or below. Differences in rates between treatments were analysed by using chi-square tests. Proportions were based on the full intention-to-treat sample: that is, participants who missed data at post- and follow-up treatment were regarded as non-responders.</p><p>The non-inferiority margin for the mean difference of change in total depression scores between the treatments for BDI-II was predefined as 2.50 points [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This margin separate a clinically important treatment difference from a clinically negligible one regarding the outcome measures and have been suggested in earlier non-inferiority trials [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The confidence interval approach was used to test non-inferiority, that is, if the two-sided 95% confidence limit is completely below the pre-specified positive non-inferiority margin (2.50), the blended treatment would be understood not to be inferior to the full BA. This is equivalent to performing a 2.5% significance test on the null hypothesis, which states that the treatment is inferior by the non-inferiority margin or more as compared to the condition [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

The total time a therapist spent in the back-end system on a participant throughout the treatment varied greatly ranging from 24 to 220 minutes (<italic>M</italic> = 80.67, <italic>SD</italic> = 41.56).

When adding the time to the back-end system, the average therapist time for the blended treatment was 321 minutes, which is 47% less compared to the full BA.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec027"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec028"><title>Main findings</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study with the aim to investigate the efficacy of a blended treatment that consists of a smartphone application as an add-on to face-to-face treatment for major depression. We could not establish whether the blended treatment was non-inferior to a full BA treatment. Nevertheless, the results showed no major differences between the blended treatment (including four face-to-face sessions and a smartphone application) and the full BA (including ten face-to-face sessions) on any of the outcome variables, neither from pre-measurement to post-measurement nor from pre-measurement to follow-up measurement. Moreover, the results revealed significant improvements from pre- to post-treatment on all the outcome measures in both treatment conditions along with large within-group effect sizes and high recovery rates, whereas treatment effects were kept at follow-up treatment. Also these results are comparable to Cuijpers et al&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] meta-analysis on face-to-face therapies for major depression, including CBT, BA, psychodynamic therapy and supportive counselling. In this meta-analysis of 92 studies, the overall response rate, defined as 50% reduction on any depression measure, was 48% [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Additionally, Cuijpers and co-workers [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] found that the BDI-II scores dropped on average 12.75 points at post-treatment for all studies using CBT (<italic>n</italic> = 14). In the blended treatment, 52.2% of the participants at post-measurement and 50.0% at follow-up reported a reduction of 50% or more on the BDI-II. The average reduction in BDI-II scores for the blended treatment group was slightly lower than the results in the meta-analysis: 13.79 from pre- to post-treatment, and 14.35 from pre-measurement to follow-up.</p><p>Thus, the main findings point towards that the blended treatment can possibly be as effective as a full BA treatment. The blended treatment also achieved comparable scores on the treatment credibility and working alliance as the full BA treatment, although the therapist time was reduced by an average of 47%. This should be seen in the light of the findings of dose&#x02014;response effects, showing that lower doses of psychotherapy have been associated with poorer outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. For example, one study showed that participants suffering from depression who had more than 9 CBT sessions were 2.5 times more likely to have adequate treatment response than those who had 9 or fewer sessions [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This allows us to suggest that the blended treatment method could be a promising cost-effective alternative to regular face-to-face treatment for major depression. However, more studies with larger sample sizes are required to establish this conclusion.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has several limitations. First, there was no randomisation to an attention-controlled placebo, which raises the issue of misinterpreting regression to the mean as indicated by two effective treatments. Also, a third group given four face-to-face sessions alone might have helped us to demonstrate the effect of the smartphone-application in isolation. However, the purpose was not to determine the effect of the smartphone application, but to examine its comparability to a full BA treatment&#x02014;a treatment, which previous research has established as effective for adult depression. A second limitation is that we recruited participants by means of advertisements and not within clinic settings. This limits the generalizability of the results, even if previous findings indicate that BA for depression is effective in regular clinical settings with similar outcomes as in studies involving public recruitments [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The mean scores of the BDI-II measures at baseline were comparable to previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and close to the limit of 29, which is proposed for defining severe depression [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A third limitation concerns the therapists in the study, who all were trained psychologists and were in the last semester of training of a five-year program. Therefore, it is possible that experienced therapists would have performed even better. However, the therapists were randomly assigned to participants and were equally distributed among the treatment groups. In addition, adherence to therapist manual was measured and the score was equivalent in both groups for both therapists and participants. Also, for the entire duration of the study, the therapists received continuous supervision from an experienced psychotherapist. A fourth limitation refers to the sample size. Non-inferiority trials usually require large samples to detect small and clinically meaningful differences between two active treatments [<xref rid="pone.0126559.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We did not have the resources to conduct a study with the assumption of a smaller standardized mean difference (e.g., 0.20) and associated confidence intervals. Therefore, we were not able to establish whether the blended treatment is non-inferior to a full BA treatment at the specified alpha-level (2.5%). A much larger sample would have been needed to detect effect differences between both treatment methods and to obtain more reliable effect estimates for both types of treatments.</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Implications and future research</title><p>Despite the limitations, this study points towards that therapists administering a blended treatment method could possibly treat nearly twice as many patients with major depression by using the smartphone application as add-on. We assume that the blended treatment format, in which the number of sessions is replaced by the smartphone support application while at the same time the therapist is still highly involved in the treatment, will have implications for the future planning of psychological services.</p><p>This study might pave the way for a broad range of trials including the blended treatment format. However, further studies are needed to establish that the blended treatment format is not inferior to a full treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec031"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126559.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a randomised trial.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126559.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126559.s002"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Original dataset from trial.</title><p>(SAV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126559.s002.sav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126559.s003"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Screenshots of the smartphone application.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126559.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126559.s004"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Behavioural activities listed in the database.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126559.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126559.s005"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Trials protocol translated to English.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126559.s005.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126559.s006"><label>S2 Protocol</label><caption><title>Trials protocol original in Swedish, part 1.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126559.s006.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126559.s007"><label>S3 Protocol</label><caption><title>Trials protocol original in Swedish, part 2.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126559.s007.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0126559.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
