While considering the elimination of these defects, two criteria should be considered, the esthetic aspects and the functional aspects. The former being the main concern of the patient and later being the main concern of the clinician and hence all attempt should be made to consider both while doing root coverage procedure.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The goal of the treatment is to restore the tissue margin to the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) and to create a normal gingival sulcus with a functional attachment.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>New technologies, instruments, and surgical techniques are therefore necessary to help the clinician ensure the best result and satisfy the patient's expectations. The surgical microscope has been thoroughly demonstrated as a useful tool in the other field, but use in periodontal surgery is scarcely documented. When maximum precision is required in performing surgery to satisfy particular esthetic demand, a surgical microscope that enhances complete visualization of the operative field represents a useful tool.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this clinical study was to compare of management of gingival recession using subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) and collagen membrane by microsurgical technique. In addition to the root coverage achieved various other parameters which were compared that were reduction in vertical gingival recession, reduction in horizontal gingival recession, gain in clinical attachment level (CAL), reduction in probing depth (PD), increase in attached gingiva (AG), increase in width of keratinized gingiva (KG), plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and improvement in patient sensitivity. All the parameters were compared at pre- and 12 months post-operatively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patient selection</title><p>A total of 40 patients aged between 20 and 50 years (mean age 34) who reported to Department of Dental Surgery of the hospital were selected for this study. All these patients were having localized gingival recession with an inadequate width of AG in the maxillary or mandibular anterior region. All these patients were explained about the treatment planning and the surgical procedure. The main selection criteria were used for the selection of patients were Millers Class I and Class II localized gingival recession with &#x0003c;2 mm KG, intact papillae to the mesial and distal aspect of the involved tooth, no clinical mobility, free of any restoration or caries, no traumatic occlusion. Pregnant females, chronic smokers, and tooth with severe malpositioning were excluded from the study.</p><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. Informed consent was taken prior to the study from each subject.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Surgical procedures</title><p>The subjects were divided into two groups Group A and Group B. Group A subjects were treated with the use of an SCTG and coronally repositioned flap whereas Group B subjects were treated using a resorbable collagen membrane and coronally repositioned flap.</p><p>A single operator performed all these surgical procedure and followed up all the cases. Identical clinical parameters were used for both these technique, and the same were recorded in a clinical data sheet which was specially designed for this study. All the surgical procedures were performed with the help of an operating microscope using 250 mm objective lens and &#x000d7;6 magnification. In addition to standard surgical instruments, microsurgical instruments were used to perform the surgery. For guided tissue regeneration (GTR) technique lyophilized natural resorbable collagen membrane with 25 mm &#x000d7; 25 mm &#x000d7; 0.2 mm dimension was used.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Preoperative preparation</title><p>Strict oral hygiene instructions were given to all individuals. Phases I therapy was carried out, and the patients were kept under observation for a period of 1 month prior to the surgical procedure. Patients, who could not maintain adequate plaque control, were excluded from this study. Preoperative photographs, routine blood, and urine investigation, Intraoral periapical radiograph of the involved tooth were taken prior to the surgery. All the measurements were taken by using same William's graduated periodontal probe and the measurement were recorded to the nearest 0.5 mm.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Group A: Subepithelial connective tissue graft technique</title><p>A local anesthetic solution containing 2% lignocaine with 1:80,000 adrenaline was administered at the surgical site. The case shown here was having 6 mm clinical attachment loss [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Horizontal and vertical incisions were given on either side of the recession site, and sulcular incision along the sulcus was given to reflect the flap.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The partial thickness flap was dissected carefully leaving the bone covered with periosteum and connective tissue as advocated by Langer and Langer.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Preoperative Group A (6 mm)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-20-189-g001"/></fig><p>Tension on the flap was relieved by a periosteal releasing incision as recommended by Harris.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The exposed root surface was thoroughly planned and kept free of any plaque. The measurement of the recipient bed was taken using the Williams graduated probe in both vertical as well as horizontal direction. The same measurement was used as a guideline while procuring the graft from the palate. The interdental papillae were de-epithelized. Adequate care was taken not to remove the papillae while doing this procedure. Moist gauze was placed on recipient bed to achieve homeostasis before the placement of the graft.</p><p>The connective tissue graft (CTG) was procured from the palate. Liu and Weisgold[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] type I&#x02013;A incision was used for harvesting graft [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. The donor area was sutured protected with the help of a prefabricated acrylic palatal stent. The graft was checked for its size, transferred to the recipient bed and sutured to the donor bed with 6&#x02013;0 Vicryl suture [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. The partial thickness flap was repositioned coronally to cover as much of the graft as possible and stabilized with 6&#x02013;0 polypropylene suture. No attempt was made to completely cover the graft as this would create tension in the flap. A Coe-Pak dressing was given over the graft.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Procurement of connective tissue graft</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-20-189-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Placement of connective tissue graft</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-20-189-g003"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Group B: Collagen membrane technique</title><p>The case shown here was having 7 mm clinical attachment loss [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>].

The exposed root surface was thoroughly planned, contoured and the curvature was reduced with air rotor with an adequate amount of air-water spray. A template was used as a guideline for trimming the collagen membrane initially. The coronal end of the membrane was placed just apical to the CEJ. It was then stabilized with 6&#x02013;0 Vicryl suture. A sling suture was placed at the level of CEJ and two lateral sutures at the apical portion of the membrane [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>]. The mucoperiosteal flap was repositioned coronally to cover the entire membrane and stabilized using 6&#x02013;0 polypropylene and lateral sutures.

Mean reduction in gingival recession in Group A 12 months postoperatively was 0.6 (&#x000b1;0.48) and in Group B was 1.15 (&#x000b1;0.61), respectively. The reduction in recession in both groups were statistically highly significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000). Similarly, an intergroup comparison of vertical gingival recession at 12 months was clinically insignificant with a <italic>P</italic> = 0.003. A comparison between baseline to 1, 3, and 12 months have been done between groups to assess the percentage of gingival recession coverage. It has been noticed that the coverage was better in Group A subjects at all time. At 12 months, Group A showed coverage of 81.42% where in Group B it was 70.08% which was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="G1">Graph 1</xref>]. Three cases in Group A had 100% root coverage whereas 1 case showed the same in Group B cases. Mean CAL was reduced from 5.7 (&#x000b1;1.30) to 0.60 (&#x000b1;1.4) at the end of 12 months in CTG group, and same in GTR group was 5.5 (&#x000b1;1.05)&#x02013;0.60 (&#x000b1;1.4). In the intergroup comparison showed statistically significant results at 12 months (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.029). The difference between AG changes was statistically significant [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="G2">Graph 2</xref>]. In CTG Group preoperative mean value of 0.38 was increased to 2.3 (&#x000b1;0.62) whereas in GTR group the preoperative mean value of 0.45 (&#x000b1;0.11) increased to 2.2 (&#x000b1;0.49). The intergroup comparison showed statistically insignificant increase at 12 months with the <italic>P</italic> = 0.002. Similarly, KG showed a statistical increase in both group but better result with CTG group. At the end of 12 months, in Group A subjects width KG increased from 1.78 (&#x000b1;0.72) to 3.1 (&#x000b1;0.47) while in Group B patients it was from of 1.75 (&#x000b1;0.77) to 2.5 (&#x000b1;0.46). Both results were statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000 and 0.001, respectively). Both procedures showed a reduction in the PD, PI, GI, and improvement in sensitivity clinically, but the observations were statistically insignificant [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Pre- and 12 months post-clinical measurements</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-20-189-g009"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Gingival recession coverage procedures have become an important part of periodontal therapy. Root sensitivity, root caries, and gingival margin discrepancies can be eliminated with these procedures. Patient's desire for improved esthetics has also increased its popularity. It is important to recognize the objectives of root coverage. Rubenstein <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] described that densely organized well-collagenated zones of AG serve as a physical barrier to the inflammatory spread to the nearby bone and effectively dissipate muscular and frenal pull and remain in health with normal function.</p><p>The result of this study shows that both CTG and GTR resulted in statically significant coverage of recession, the gain in CAL, increases in the amount of keratinized as well as AG. However, the clinical outcome was better in the CTG group than GTR group. The result showed Group A achieved better gingival recession coverage at 3 and 12 months postoperatively which were statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03 and 0.003, respectively). The result of the present study was in agreement with the study conducted by Harris[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Trombelli <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Elizabeth <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Various reasons could explain this difference in the outcome of these two techniques. The double blood supplies seem to be enough to nourish the entire graft and its successful outcome of CTG in the Group A subjects.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The possible reasons for unsatisfactory results for GTR procedure are the incidence of membrane exposure, size and shape of the defect, tension in the overlying flap, thin marginal tissue, and postoperative mechanical trauma due to noncompliance of patient to the instructions.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Trauma to the flap during dissection, the extent of flap undermining, positioning, and suturing of the flap and inadequate tissue integration of the membrane can affect the postsurgical tissue shrinkage that could lead to exposure of the membrane.</p><p>Percentage of root coverage achieved was assessed between the groups. A highly significant difference was achieved between Group A and Group B at the end of 12 months with the values of 81.42% and 70.08%, respectively with the <italic>P</italic> = 0.01. In this study, SCTG procedure gave a better root coverage than GTR procedures [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="G1">Graph 1</xref>]. This is in agreement with the previous studies carried out by other workers.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><fig id="G1" position="float"><label>Graph 1</label><caption><p>% of coverage</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-20-189-g010"/></fig><p>The result showed clinical improvements in SCTG group over GTR group for reducing the width of recession, and this was in agreement with the result seen in the study by Dimitris and Trombelli.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, it is not in agreement with the observations made by Wang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and M&#x000fc;ller <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The gain of CAL from baseline to 12 months was statistically significant in Group A when compared with Group B with a <italic>P</italic> = 0.29. Even though there was no statistical difference in CAL between 3 and 12 months among both groups, there was a gain clinically. The possible explanation for this is the phenomenon of creeping attachment. In this study, this difference seems to have taken place principally by this mechanism. Similar observations were made by Bell <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Matter and Cimasoni.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>As most of the cases treated exhibit minimal pocket depths, it was difficult to establish the extent of any possible influence in this study. However, in all cases pocket depths remained the same or were reduced after treatment. Comparison between the groups showed no difference between SCTG and GTR with regard to reduction in PD at any point of time.</p><p>One of the most important objectives of mucogingival surgery is to increase the width of AG. The comparison among the group clearly showed a highly significant increase in the width of KG in CTG group at 3 and 12 months postoperatively [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="G2">Graph 2</xref>]. The study is in agreement with the results of similar kind of study in the past.</p><fig id="G2" position="float"><label>Graph 2</label><caption><p>Width of attached gingiva</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-20-189-g011"/></fig><p>Subjective evaluation was done pre- and post-operatively for tooth sensitivity which revealed that none of the patients had severe postoperative sensitivity following surgery. Most patients had marked a reduction in root sensitivity. An intercomparison between the two groups suggest that both procedures could reduce the sensitivity markedly.</p><p>Postsurgical discomfort was more in Group A subjects due to the creation of a second surgical site. Common discomfort reported were bleeding from the donor area, developed sloughing of the flap in the donor area may be due to excessive thinning of the superficial flap. Adequate care was taken for the cases to avoid such complication. As per Reiser <italic>et al</italic>. the ideal area for the donor procurement is the premolar area and not extending beyond the distal aspect of the first molar.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] This protocol was strictly followed to the entire Group A subjects. GTR membrane can become partially exposed become contaminated and form a pathway for infection which may jeopardize the healing resulting unfavorable result as reported by Selvig <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Two cases reported with exposure of the coronal portion of the membrane which was trimmed and the area was irrigated with saline. These patients were instructed to give more emphasis on home care plaque control methods.</p><p>All the surgical procedures were performed using an operating microscope using &#x000d7;6 with a 250 mm objective lens [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>]. The key of microsurgery is precise control of gingiva.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The improved visual acuity and use of microsurgical instruments provided a new scope to the field of periodontal plastic surgery. The present study showed that use of microsurgical instrument definitely improves the outcome of surgery. The result of this study is in agreement with the study by Burkhardt and Lang[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Francetti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Operating microscope offers three distinct advantages to the periodontists. They are illumination, magnification, and increased precision in the delivery of surgical skill which is known as a triad of microsurgery.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Ergonomics of microsurgery</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-20-189-g012"/></fig><p>Only very few studies have carried out in past using operating microscope for gingival recession coverage. Hence to get a reliable and conclusive report regarding the advantage of periodontal microsurgery, more number of studies with long-term follow-up is required to be carried out. The smaller sample size and short follow-up period are the major limitations of the present study. Therefore, it would be desirable to carry out a study with a larger sample size and a longer follow-up. No attempt was made to compare the histological healing pattern between the groups. However, histological studies are suggested which determine the type of attachment and healing following the SCTG and GTR procedure using collagen membrane.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Analyzing the observations made at the end of 12 months follow-up, it is summarized that:</p><p>
