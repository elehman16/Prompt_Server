Sand flea disease is associated with a broad spectrum of clinical pathology and severe sequels are frequent. Treatment options are limited.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We assessed the effectiveness of the intermittent application of the plant-based repellent Zanzarin to reduce infestation intensity and tungiasis-associated morbidity in a resource-poor community in Brazil, characterized by a very high attack rate. The study population was randomized into three cohorts. Initially, during a period of four weeks, the repellent was applied twice daily to the feet of all cohort members. This reduced the number of embedded sandfleas to 0 in 98&#x00025; of the participants. Thereafter members of cohort A applied the repellent every second week twice daily for one week, members of cohort B every fourth week for one week, and members of cohort C served as controls. Infestation intensity and tungiasis-associated morbidity were monitored during five months. The intermittent application of Zanzarin for one week every second week significantly reduced infestation intensity from a median 4 lesions (IQR 1&#x02013;9) during the whole transmission season. In contrast, in cohort B (application of the repellent every fourth week) the infestation intensity remained twice as high (median 8 lesions, IQR 9&#x02013;16; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0035), and in the control cohort C 3.5 times as high (median 14 lesions; IQR 7&#x02013;26; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.004 during the transmission season). Tungiasis-related acute pathology remained very low in cohort A (median severity score 2; IQR 1&#x02013;4) as compared to cohort B (median severity score 5; IQR 3&#x02013;7; p&#x0003c;0.001), and control cohort C (median severity score 6.5; IQR 4&#x02013;8; p&#x0003c;0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our study shows that in a setting with intense transmission, tungiasis-associated morbidity can be minimized through the intermittent application of a plant-based repellent.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Tungiasis is a parasitic skin disease caused by the female sand flea <italic>Tunga penetrans</italic>. The disease is frequent in resource-poor communities in South America and sub-Saharan Africa and affects the poorest of the poor. Sand flea disease is associated with a considerable morbidity and may lead to tetanus in non-vaccinated individuals. The degree of morbidity depends on the intensity of infestation, i.e., the number of embedded sand fleas a person has. Since tungiasis is a zoonosis involving a host of animal reservoirs, and because an effective treatment is not at hand, in resource-poor settings elimination is not feasible. Preventing morbidity to develop is therefore the only means to protect exposed individuals from sand flea disease. Similar to other arthropods, sand fleas can be repelled before they penetrate into the skin. In this study we show that the intermittent application of a plant-based repellent, of which the major component is coconut oil, reduces the intensity of infestation dramatically during the whole transmission season and prevents tungiasis-associated morbidity from developing. The prevention can be performed at the household level by the affected individuals themselves with minimal input from the health sector.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tungiasis is a common, but neglected health problem in economically disadvantaged communities in tropical and subtropical countries <xref rid="pntd.0000879-AdeSerrano1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0000879-Matias1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The female sand flea <italic>Tunga penetrans</italic> penetrates into the epidermis of its host, undergoes a peculiar hypertrophy, expels several hundred eggs for a period of three weeks, and eventually dies in situ <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Feldmeier2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In endemic areas constant reinfestation is the rule and affected individuals frequently harbor dozens, sometimes hundreds of embedded parasites <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Feldmeier3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Tungiasis is acquired peri-domiciliary, but also inside the house <xref rid="pntd.0000879-LinsCalheiros1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Different species of animals act as reservoirs <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Heukelbach1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>The ectoparasitosis mainly affects marginalized populations in urban squatter settlements, in villages in the hinterland, and in traditional fishing communities along the littoral <xref rid="pntd.0000879-AdeSerrano1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Muehlen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0000879-LinsCalheiros1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0000879-Wilcke1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In these settings tungiasis is commonly associated with an important morbidity, such as intense inflammation of toes and heels, painful fissures, ulcers and abscesses, as well as deformation, and loss of nails <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Heukelbach1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0000879-Feldmeier2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Wilcke1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0000879-Kehr1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

There is no effective chemotherapy available to kill embedded sand fleas. Parasites need to be extracted surgically with a sterile instrument. However, this requires a skilled hand and good eyesight. In resource-poor communities surgical removal is inconsistently performed and causes more harm than good if not done correctly <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Feldmeier2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Heukelbach2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Winter1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. We have previously shown that a regular twice daily application of Zanzarin, a repellent based on coconut oil, for a period of three weeks, reduced the rate of newly embedded fleas by 92&#x00025;, and reversed tungiasis-associated clinical pathology almost completely <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Feldmeier6" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In this study we investigated, whether an intermittent application of the repellent protects inhabitants of an area with intense transmission against penetrating sand fleas during the transmission season, in Northeast Brazil a period of six month.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study area</title><p>The study was conducted in five neighborhoods (Luxou, Morro das Sandra's, Placas, Morra da Vit&#x000f3;ria and Novo Rumo) of the shantytown Vincente Prinz&#x000f3;n, a typical conglomeration of urban squatter settlements (favela) in Fortaleza, Northeast Brazil. The area is characterized by intense transmission of <italic>T. penetrans</italic>
<xref rid="pntd.0000879-Feldmeier3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The five neighborhoods are located on dunes near to the Atlantic Ocean. The area had been occupied by landless poor (&#x0201c;sem terra&#x0201d;) in the beginning of the 1950&#x02019;s <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Ariza1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The poor living conditions have been described previously <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Heukelbach3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In brief, most houses are constructed with recycled litter and do not posses a concrete floor. Illiteracy, unemployment, crime, alcoholism, drug traffic, abuse, as well as adolescent prostitution, and domestic violence are common. Sixty percent of the population have a monthly family income of less than two minimum wages (1 monthly minimum wage 300 Real &#x02248; 100 Euro) <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Ariza1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.

Individuals who intended to change their place of residence during the next six months were not eligible. Individuals with ulcerated lesions necessitating antibiotic treatment, and children less than one year were excluded. In total 142 participants were recruited.</p><p>The intensity of infestation and the degree of tungiasis-associated morbidity was assessed as described previously <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Kehr1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. After the admission examination the participants were randomized into three cohorts (A, B and C). In the first phase of the study individuals received a twice-daily application of Zanzarin for a period of four weeks. It was anticipated that this reduced the number of embedded sand fleas to almost zero <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Feldmeier6" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Thereafter participants were examined again and the degree of the tungiasis-associated morbidity was assessed. These data provided the baseline for the subsequent study phase.</p><p>During a period of five months members of Cohort A applied the repellent every second week twice daily for one week, and members of Cohort B every fourth week twice daily for one week. Cohort C served as control group and did not receive any protection.</p><p>During the intervention periods Zanzarin was applied by trained community health workers on the skin of the feet (up to the ankle) including the interdigital areas. The average volume applied was 3 ml per person and day (Calculation based on the number of 100 ml bottles used per day, divided by the number of treated individuals). Prophylaxis was performed in the morning between 6 and 8 a.m., and in the evening between 6 and 8 p.m. The exact time of application was recorded for each study participant. The application of the repellent was regularly checked by random visits to the households of the study participants by one of the investigators (J.B.). In addition, at each examination the participants were asked whether the repellent had been applied regularly. This ensured that the repellent was applied exactly as defined in the study protocol, not spilled, given away for money, or stolen. The participants were asked not to wash their feet for at least two hours after application of the repellent. However, they were allowed to take a shower whenever they wanted.</p><p>Unexpectedly, staff members were assaulted during the second part of the study. For safety reasons we decided to interrupt the regular follow-ups at calendar week 45. Monitoring was resumed at calendar week 47. Nonetheless, the application of the repellent was continued during this period.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Zanzarin</title><p>The repellent used was Zanzarin, a lotion based on coconut oil (<italic>Cocos nucifera</italic>), jojoba oil <italic>(Simmondsia chinesis)</italic> and <italic>Aloe vera</italic> (Engelhard Arzneimittel GmbH &#x00026; Co. KG, Niederdorfelden, Germany). The lotion is sold as a biocide with repellent activities against ticks and biting insects. The exact composition is described in an annexed file (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0000879.s003">Text S1</xref>). As Zanzarin has a peculiar odor, neither the investigator nor the patient were blinded to group assignment. Adverse reactions were interrogated and documented at each visit.

Clinical pathology was documented every four weeks. Lesions manipulated by the patient (such as partially or totally eliminated fleas leaving a characteristic crater-like sore in the skin), and suppurative lesions caused by the use of non-sterile perforating instruments, such as needles, and thorns, were documented as well.

The main outcome measure was the intensity of infestation, i.e. the number of sand flea lesions present at the time of examination. Secondary outcome measures were the severity score of acute, and the severity score of chronic pathology. As the variables assessed were not normally distributed and variances varied considerably, the median and the interquartile ranges were used to indicate the average and dispersion of data.

In Northeast Brazil transmission occurs mainly between July and December, i.e. a period of 6 months.</p><p>Since infestation rate and infestation intensity are closely related <xref rid="pntd.0000879-LinsCalheiros1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Kehr1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and assessment of the infestation rate is very laborious, we determined the infestation intensity in three cohorts at regular intervals, together with the degree of tungiasis-associated pathology. In cohort A (application of Zanzarin every second week for one week) the number of embedded sand fleas only slightly increased during the transmission season. In cohort B (application of the repellent every fourth week for one week) the intensity of infestation was considerably higher during this period. However, even the long intervention-free intervals resulted, at the end of the transmission season, in an infestation intensity of approximately half the number of embedded sand fleas found in the control cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000879-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>If sand fleas are effectively repelled, only a few new parasites will penetrate per unit of time. This is reflected by a low number of viable lesions (stage I to III of the Fortaleza classification). In fact, the median number of viable sand flea lesions per individual showed different patterns in each of the cohorts. Whereas in cohort A the median number of viable sand fleas was 1, in cohort B &#x02013; and even more so in cohort C - the number of viable sand flea lesions increased in a step-wise manner during the intermittent application of the repellent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000879-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These findings indicate that after the application of Zanzarin for one week a residual effect of the repellent seems to occur for a couple of days, but that an interval of four weeks without the application of the repellent is too long to prevent sand fleas invading the skin. Previous observations had raised the expectation that a residual effect may persist for more than one week <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Feldmeier6" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>The irritation and pain caused by embedded sand fleas is the reason why affected individuals try to get rid of the parasites with sharp instruments. Supposedly, the more sand fleas penetrate and embed per unit of time, the higher is the proportion of lesions manipulated with instruments. Hence, an effective repellent will be reflected by a low percentage of manipulated lesions. Indeed, the effectiveness of Zanzarin to prevent a high intensity of infestation to build up, is mirrored by the pattern of manipulated lesions in the three cohorts. In cohort A, manipulated lesions were completely absent until almost the end of the transmission season, whereas in cohort C the number of manipulated lesions started to increase almost constantly after the end of the initial intervention, and with a certain delay also in cohort B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000879-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>As expected, the almost complete interruption of transmission in cohort A prevented severe pathology to develop. This is mirrored by a decrease between 64&#x00025; and 88&#x00025; of the SSAT score during the transmission season, as compared to the degree of acute pathology at admission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000879-g005">Figure 5</xref>). A median SSAT score of 2 points at the end of the study in this cohort indicates an insignificant degree of acute pathology <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Feldmeier6" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. When the intervals between the application of Zanzarin were extended to three weeks, the degree of clinical pathology developing during the transmission season almost doubled, as compared to cohort A, and was only slightly less than in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000879-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Hence, regular application of Zanzarin every second week is necessary to reduce clinical pathology to an insignificant level.</p><p>The interval application of Zanzarin was less effective in reducing the presence of chronic pathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000879-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This is plausible, since chronic pathology, such as nail deformation and fibrosis of the skin around the nail rim, needs long time without new infestations, to resolve at least partially <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Feldmeier6" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, it is important to note that the application of the repellent every second week significantly reduced the SSCT score during the follow-up period, as compared to the value at admission.</p><p>Based on an average of 3 ml of Zanzarin applied per individual per day, a member of Cohort A needed a total of 210 ml of the repellent for the whole transmission season. If Zanzarin is bought in bulk quantity, 10&#x02013;12 US$ would be sufficient to protect one person against the debilitating sequels of tungiasis during the whole transmission season. Since children and the elderly are particularly affected by severe manifestations of sand flea disease <xref rid="pntd.0000879-Feldmeier4" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, prophylaxis could be targeted to these population groups, reducing the costs of the repellent. The application of a repellent is a simple and sustainable means to relief the poorest of the poor from a scourge that reappears each year with the beginning of the dry season. Prevention could be achieved by preparing the repellent from local coconuts by the affected individuals themselves with minimal input from the health sector. Taken together, the intermittent application of Zanzarin, twice daily for one week every second week, effectively interrupts transmission of <italic>T. penetrans</italic> in an area with a high attack rate, and prevents severe morbidity to develop.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0000879.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist.</p><p>(0.19 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0000879.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0000879.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Clinical trial protocol.</p><p>(0.19 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0000879.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0000879.s003"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Compounds of Zanzarin.</p><p>(0.02 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0000879.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the Associa&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o dos Moradores do Sandra's for supporting the study, and to Val&#x000e9;ria Santos, Marilene da Silva Paulo, Marvel, Jose Maria Lourenco, and Maria de F&#x000e1;tima Cavalcante for skillful assistance.
