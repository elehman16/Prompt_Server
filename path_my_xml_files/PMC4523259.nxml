They reduce the pain through blocking the nerve reversibly. In dental procedures, cartridge is used for local anesthesia which contains: lidocaine 2% (as a super effective medicine which is sustainable to high quality autoclaves and boiling (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and vascular constriction such as adrenalin to reduce toxicity of drug absorption and long-term effects of local anesthetic (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Deep anesthesia is very important particularly in dental surgery. Operator (choice of anesthetic technique) and patient (anatomical, pathological or psychological) are known as the main factors in anesthetic success or failure rates. According to Lopez <italic>et al</italic>. failure is defined as &#x0201c;If symptoms of anesthesia are not identified after a prudent period of 10-15 minutes following the anesthetic procedure&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Maxillary anesthesia is mostly successful except for the cases with abnormal anatomies or pathologic conditions. Maxillary teeth apexes are not surrounded by dens bone and expert operators mostly can anesthetize the nerves&#x02019; root in high success rate, easily. But this condition in adults&#x02019; mandibular is different in which success rate in pulpal anesthesia is low and much more difficult because higher density of cortical alveolar bone in mandibular teeth (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>There are some factors which affect the inferior alveolar nerve blocks success rate including: patient fear of receiving the anesthetic drug, systemic and local complication of intraoral injection, biologic diversity responsible to the drugs, anatomical variations, infections and inflammations, intra-vein injections and needle deflection, dens bone, bifid mandibular nerve, accessory mental foramen, anastomoses, expired solution and incorrect method of injection (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>In addition, there are three injection techniques for local anesthesia in mandibular restorative and surgical procedures: The inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB), Gow-Gates (GG) and Vazirani-Akinosis techniques.</p><p>IANB is the common injection technique for attaining local anesthesia in mandibular jaw. However the IANB does not always result in successful pulpal anesthesia (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Failure rates of 10-39% have been reported (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>In 1973 Gow-Gates used extraoral landmark for mandibular anesthesia. In this new technique the target site is the neck of the mandibular condyle (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Hung <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and Goldberg <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) used pulp tester to evaluate anesthesia and found no difference between the IANB and GG techniques, while Agren and Danielsson (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) found faster time of pulpal anesthesia for GG technique.</p><p>Some studies have shown higher success rates with the GG technique (95-96%) versus the conventional IANB (65-79%) during surgery (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), but Todorvice <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) found the conventional IANB was better than the GG technique.</p><p>Some studies found that the success rate of lip numbness in conventional IANB was similar to the GG technique (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) </p><p>This study attempted to compare the onset time, success rate and degree of pulpal anesthesia obtained from a conventional IANB and GG by using 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine in vital teeth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>- Ethics: The study was approved by the local ethics committee and conducted in accordance with the rules of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. An informed consent was signed by patients, and the study has been ethically approved by Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, dental school.</p><p>During this prospective randomized clinical study, 136 patients were studied. The patients admitted to the Orofacial Surgery Department of the University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.</p><p>Sample size calculations required up to120 adults which 136 adults participated (59 men and 77 women) in this study and each selected case required extraction of mandibular molars. The patients were between the ages of 15 and 50 years old without taking any drugs that would alter their perception of pain (opioids and non-estroidal anti-inflammation). In addition, they did not show any inflammations in injection site. Exclusion criteria were: periodontal diseases, physical and mental retardation, being younger than 15 and older than 50years of age, inability of enough mouth opening for GG injection, deep caries and large restorations in mandibular canine and premolar in side of injection.</p><p>The total of 136 patients divided in two groups: 63 patients for GG group and 73 patients for IANB group.</p><p>The study operators were specialists and residents of Orofacial Surgery Department of dentistry faculty who standardized their injection skills for two mandibular block methods.</p><p>For the injection purposes this study used standard syringes equipped with a blood aspiration device (Novocol, USA), fitted with a 27-gauge 0.4 &#x000d7; 35mm needle (Denject, Korea), 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine (Daroopakhsh, Iran).</p><p>- Before injection </p><p>The chosen teeth for experiment were first premolar and canine. The contra lateral canine was as the anesthetized control to certify the accuracy of the pulp tester operating. Clinical experiments revealed that all the teeth were free of large restoration, caries, and periodontal disease, also participants&#x02019; records showed no trauma or sensitivity.</p><p>Cotton rolls were used to isolate contra lateral canine and experimental teeth, while toothpaste was applied to probe tip (which was then placed midway between the gingival margin and the occlusal or incisal edge of the tooth) after that the teeth were tested by using Electrical Pulp Tester (Parkell, USA) to record baseline vitality. The current rate was increased from minimum (0) to the maximum (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The number associated with the initial sensation was recorded.</p><p>Furthermore, the neurosensory testing was performed on the patients&#x02019; lips to ensure the accuracy of light touch sensitivity before any injections (a soft hair brush drawn gently on the patients&#x02019; lower lip).</p><p>After finishing the test stage, The Orofacial specialists injected Lidocain 2% by using GG or IANB techniques to block mandible within 60-90 seconds. The operators aspirated during injection and positive or negative condition was recorded. After injection the timer was turned on.</p><p>For IANB technique, 1.5 ml anesthetic solution deposited during a period of 60-90 second and when the needle was withdrawn remaining anesthetic solution injected for lingual nerve anesthesia. In addition, 0.5 ml anesthetic solution injected for long buccal anesthesia.</p><p>For GG technique, 1.8ml anesthetic solution was deposited during a period of 60-90 seconds. After the injection, the subject was asked to keep his/her mouth wide open for 1 minute.</p><p>The onset of lower lip anesthesia tested with using a soft hair brush by drawing it gently on the patients&#x02019; lower lip, the patients also were asked about lip numbness. Within first five minutes after injection, the lips&#x02019; sensation in the lateral side of the lower lip was assessed and if this sensation was not present in this period, another five minutes was allocated to lapse and checked every minutes. Also failure of lower lip anesthesia was reported, if lips&#x02019; sensation was not altered after 10 minutes (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The buccal soft tissue was tested with tongue blade every two minutes for 10 minutes, and onset of soft tissue anesthesia was recorded in this period. At the same time, pulpal anesthesia of canine and premolar were tested by electrical pulp tester every three minutes after injection for 10 minutes. The negative responsible to number 8: EPT was assumed as successful pulpal anesthesia (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>The patients were requested to report any pain during the surgery or extraction procedure (soft tissue cutting, bone cutting, tooth extraction). A verbal analogue scale was engaged to evaluate the pain intensify during surgery ranging from 0: no pain; 1: mild and bearable pain; 2: moderate pain; 3: unbearable and severe pain.</p><p>According To this classification, 0 and 1 were assumed as injection success, whereas 2 and 3 manifested the failure of injection (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Two injection techniques for incidence of lip numbness, soft tissue anesthesia incidence, incidence of pulpal anesthesia, and anesthetic success were analyzed and compared by using SPSS ver.15.

In addition, the diverse anatomy of patients in the locations of the mandibular foramen and lingual decrease the success rate IANB technique.</p><p>Hung <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and Goldberg <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) in two separate studies demonstrated that all subjects achieved 100% lip numbness with both GG and IANB techniques, but this percentages were 95% and 92% for GG and IANB respectively in present study. It should be noted that this study examined the patient only for 10 minutes, while Goldberg <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) examined the patient for 21 minutes.</p><p>Furthermore, onset time of lip numbness in GG technique was slower than the IANB in this study, but no significant difference between two methods recorded. Sisk also revealed the onset time of lip numbness in GG group was slower because in this area the size of nerve fibers are larger and distance from the injection site is far (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, onset time for IANB of lip numbness was 3.2 minutes. Also, Waikakul and Punwutikorn reported 3 minutes onset time of lip numbness for the same method (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>In this study success rate of soft tissue anesthesia manifested no differences between GG and IANB techniques.

(<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) reported no difference between two methods too. 1.8 ml lidocaine was derived in GG and IANB groups (0.5 ml was administered for long buccal technique). Gow-Gates believed that for the GG technique there is no need for buccal infiltration. Goldberg <italic>et al</italic>. used 3.6 ml lidocaeine for both techniques (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), while Hung <italic>et al</italic>. used 2.7 ml for both groups (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). It seems that the increment of anesthetic solution does not affect soft tissue anesthesia.</p><p>Some studies used the electrical pulp tester (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) as present study.

However, in this study onset time of pulpal anesthesia in GG was faster but difference was not statistically significant.</p><p>In this study, patient were examined for 10 minute after the injection, therefore faster onset time of IANB does not affect the overall success rate of IANB technique.</p><p>In some studies such as Agren and Danielsson (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) the reason of slower onset time of GG technique was explained due to the injection site which was far from the inferior alveolar nerve.
