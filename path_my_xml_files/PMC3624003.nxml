The pre- and posttest consisted of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a Pelvi-Trainer and was video recorded, encoded, and saved on DVDs. These were evaluated by blinded raters using a modified objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS).

To improve surgical skills, various training possibilities such as virtual reality (VR) training and practical training in lab training classes are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although the value of these classes is undisputable, they are cost intensive, time consuming, and bonded to schedules and locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Unfortunately, not many alternatives exist. Most often, a surgical intern refers to a surgical manual to study and prepare for a scheduled procedure. These surgical manuals describe the procedure with illustrations and texts. One disadvantage of these surgical manuals is their tendency not to be up-to-date due to publishing procedures, which is a relevant problem of all print media in a continuously developing field such as surgery.</p><p>As in various other scientific fields, the Internet has become an alternative to print media, offering many alternatives and opportunities. For surgical educators, the Internet offers the possibility of standardizing general surgical trainings and assessments and the opportunity to develop national and international collaborations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, several Internet platforms have been established that provide surgical know-how in different formats as well as the use of different media and material. They all attempt to offer the latest actual practice. The disadvantages with most of these platforms are heterogeneous content, unknown benefit of the didactic method, and non-evidence-based content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>One advantage of the Internet is the use of multimedia. The multimedia approach uses different media at the same time to display certain content. The media work together. The media can be text, graphics, audio, animation, video, data, and the like. An example of multimedia is a Web site with information about the composer Mozart that includes text, an audio file sampling of his music, and perhaps even a video of a concert [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The use of various media takes advantage of the different channels of perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Evidence in the literature proves that multimedia-driven learning has advantages in medical fields wherein an understanding of complex temporal and spatial events plays an important role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Multimedia modules about aortic valve replacement have shown better educational value than print media with the same content for students studying heart surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>However, in addition to the conventionally used methods, a modern surgical curriculum requires cost- and time-effective training methods as well as the implementation of new didactic methods and material. A new pedagogic paradigm is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, it seemed necessary to evaluate the benefit of a multimedia-based platform in surgical education (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.webop.de">www.webop.de</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]: an Internet platform that combines these aspects with the basic background of the mental training method, visualizing nodal points.</p><p>Mental training is a cognitive training method taught by mental trainers that includes imagining a movement repeatedly. Findings have shown that mental training increases surgical performance by using operation primers (manuals describing the surgery in nodal points) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The current study tested whether use of the multimedia-based Internet platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.webop.de">www.webop.de</ext-link>) together with the operation primer, either in combination with practical training or no practical training, improves learning success compared with practical training or no training for participants with little laparoscopic experience. Learning success was defined as improved surgical performance in completing a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a Pelvi-Trainer.</p><p>The main questions of our study were as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>What is the effect of multimedia-based training on surgical performance?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What is the effect of practical training on surgical performance?</p></list-item></list></p><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Trial design</title><p>The randomized controlled trial (RCT) in this study was created using a pre- and posttest design.

Pelvi-Trainers simulate an abdomen in which surgeries can be reproduced in a realistic manner. The same laparoscopic instruments including an HF unit for electrocoagulation are used in the operating room (OR). The picture data recorded by the laparoscopic camera are converted to a monitor.</p><p>In the current study, the camera was guided by camera assistants, who exclusively moved the camera when told to do so by the operating participant. Laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed on pork livers with an intact gallbladder. The pork livers were purchased from a slaughterhouse in the vicinity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Multimedia-based training</title><p>The activity area consisted of a personal computer (PC) and a print version of an operation primer.

The pre- and posttest consisted of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the Pelvi-Trainer. Before the pretest, all the participants received a standardized explanation of the Pelvi-Trainer and the provided instruments as well as a short instruction for the task they were to perform. During the pre- and posttest, the participants did not receive any advice or instruction.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Participant flow</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="464_2012_2672_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>After the pretest, randomization took place in the manner described earlier.

The current study confirmed that multimedia-based training improved surgical performance of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a Pelvi-Trainer significantly when used alone or as combination training. The participants undergoing practical training alone did not achieve similarly improved results.</p><p>The groups had no major differences in terms of demographic or baseline test data, although the multimedia-based training group had the best results in the baseline tests. Because randomization was adequately concealed, this effect can be seen as unpredictable coincidence. Because the primary outcome criterion was the difference between posttest (follow-up) and pretest (baseline) results, &#x00394;OSATS was not affected by these higher baseline results. Quite the contrary, to achieve higher &#x00394;OSATS results, posttest values had to be even higher because pretest values were subtracted.</p><p>During the experimental phase, the participants could contact other people including their co-participants. To reduce bias of possible effects from these contacts, we performed the randomization after the pretest. Talking or changing intervention groups by the participants could thus be avoided.</p><p>Introduction to the Pelvi-Trainers was identical for all the participants because randomization took place after the introduction. The introduction was always performed by the same team members, who followed a written guideline containing the information they were allowed to present. Even if the introduction varied by different team members, this could not influence the results because one experimental group always consisted of one participant from each intervention group based on the study design, eliminating subsequent effects. Effects of the different camera assistants on the OSATS results also could be eliminated because they were blinded (in pre- and posttest) and not allowed to move the camera without the participant&#x02019;s command.</p><p>Before leaving the lab, all the participants had to sign an agreement that they would not take advantage of outside opportunities to improve their knowledge about laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Whether the participants kept their promise or not cannot be proven, but at least consecutive errors were avoided.</p><p>Immenroth et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] did not find any major differences in the global rating scale comparing mental training with practical training but rather in the task-specific checklist. Referring to these results, we defined our aim criterion as the difference between the follow-up test after intervention (training) and the baseline test before intervention, measured in terms of the OSATS criteria of the task-specific checklist: &#x00394;OSATS. A secondary outcome criterion was the &#x00394;OSATS of the global rating scale.</p><p>Findings have shown OSATS to be a feasible measuring tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] that can reliably and validly assess surgical skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The task-specific checklist determines the ability of the participant to perform the individual steps in the sequence of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the Pelvi-Trainer. Hence, it is a combination of cognitive and practical tasks. Comparing a task-specific checklist, Immenroth et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] assumed that the task-specific checklist evaluated the more cognitive components of a surgical procedure. The global rating scale should consider the motor skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Martin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] even declared global rating scales to be a better method of assessment than task-specific checklists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Most of the authors, having used OSATS in their studies, do not distinguish between the task-specific checklist and the global rating scale in terms of one being a better method than the other.</p><p>Our findings support the aforementioned opinion. Groups undergoing multimedia-based training had the best results in terms of the task-specific checklist and the global rating scale compared with the practical training group. Because cognitive comprehension (learning the individual procedural steps) is elicited in the task-specific checklist, it is not too surprising that the multimedia-based training group showed the best results in this assessment, although the participants were asked to transform the theoretical knowledge they had learned with multimedia-based training to practical performance in the Pelvi-Trainer.</p><p>Except the control group, all the intervention groups showed significant improvement in the global rating scale (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;0.001). An amazing result was that both groups undergoing multimedia-based training (multimedia-based and combination training) were better (respectively 6.94&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;5.35 and 7.94&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;6.35) than the practical training group (4.06&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4.09) in the global rating scale (see data tables) despite the assumption that the practical training group had more practical experience concerning the skills determined by global rating scale after the intervention (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab6"><label>Table&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Results of the objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) global rating scale (detail)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">&#x00394;OSATS</th><th align="left" rowspan="2">Multimedia-based training (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;18)</th><th align="left" rowspan="2">Practical training (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;17)</th><th align="left" rowspan="2">Combination training (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;18)</th><th align="left" rowspan="2">Control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;17)</th></tr><tr><th align="left">Global rating scale<sup>a</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Respect for tissue</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">1.2&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.7</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">0.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.2</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">1.3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.8</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">0.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Time and motion</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">1.3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.2</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">0.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.0</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">1.4&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.3</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">0.7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Handling of instruments</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">1.4&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.2</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">0.7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.1</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">1.7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.4</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">0.2&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Flow of motion</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">1.2&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.1</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">1.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.1</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">1.6&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.3</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">0.3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Knowledge of procedure</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">1.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.2</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">0.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.4</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">1.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.4</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">0.6&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Global rating scale data for each rated detail for all four groups as mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;standard deviation.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] that mental training showed more effect on the cognitive aspects of the procedure, we showed that multimedia-based training improves not only cognitive skills but also simple motor skills more than practical training alone. Apparently multimedia-based training not only teaches cognitive skills but also improves practical skills in a way that imparts the sense of tissue, the handling of instruments, and last but not least, the procedure itself. In a sense, this comprises the way surgery was taught in former days, with the surgical trainee adopting skills from the surgical teacher via a &#x0201c;see one, do one, teach one&#x0201d; approach. However, this way of teaching does not fit in our daily practice, and many physicians regard this training as insufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The time spent in the OR teaching raises enormous and inappropriate costs if this is the only venue of teaching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Additionally, this type of teaching is insufficient because trainees learn by practicing on real patients, and the residents feel inadequately trained to perform procedures by themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This consequent uncertainty leads to mistakes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Multimedia-based training offers a solution for these problems. The way the surgeries are presented in combination with videos allows the surgeon to &#x0201c;watch&#x0201d; the surgery and adopt the ways of the experienced surgeon. After undergoing multimedia-based training, the surgeon probably will feel better trained and more secure in the procedure itself, possibly avoiding potential mistakes. Before practicing on patients, the surgeon has already gathered some knowledge and will not use expensive time in the OR for practice.</p><p>As one of five Internet platforms, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.webop.de">www.webop.de</ext-link> provides surgical know-how of general and abdominal surgery that has been identified by a former review including 31 criteria for the fields of &#x0201c;content presentation,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;infrastructure,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;evaluation&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. We chose <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.webop.de">www.webop.de</ext-link> for our study to provide content in a uniform educational manner with the focus on easy understanding for the user. Comparable evaluations are unknown to us. It will be a task for future studies to compare the learning effects of the different platforms.</p><p>Although blind and randomized controlled trials are the best way to show possible differences in interventions, the results cannot be transferred to real-life teaching of young surgeons completely without considering the limitations of the study. Although it could be assumed that the relaxed atmosphere in the lab cannot be compared with the tense atmosphere in the OR, various studies have shown that skills acquired by simulation-based training seem to be transferrable to the setting in an OR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Findings have shown that even in simulations, surgeons experience stress levels, especially when undergoing crisis-simulation in virtual trainers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], whereas general statements concerning the influence of stress on the surgical performance cannot be made due to lack of homogeneous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, the stress factor of operating on an organ model of a dead liver rather than a living patient may not be comparable. It therefore may lead to better results than could have been achieved in the OR.</p><p>Contrariwise, the relaxed atmosphere in the lab may have led to carelessness and impreciseness of some participants due to the lack of any vital consequences. However, some of the participants may have acted better and some may have acted worse because of the lab atmosphere, so the lab environment may not have had any consecutive effect.</p><p>In 2002, Seymour et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] showed that VR simulation significantly improves OR performance of residents when carrying out a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. These data were achieved in a small study including 16 surgical residents. A review in 2008 urged caution in seeing the positive data of similar studies without looking beyond and considered the VR-to-OR skills transfer study model as a means of demonstrating the superiority of VR training activity over that of the simulator itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. All in all, it can be said that training improves OR performance compared with no training. But it is a task of the future to compare the value of the different training methods and their effect on OR performance. Therefore, we do not know whether our positive results with multimedia-based training can be transferred to the OR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Multimedia-based training significantly improved surgical performance of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a Pelvi-Trainer. Statistically, practical training did not significantly improve surgical performance. In conclusion, multimedia-based training is a low-cost, always-available means of education that should not replace face-to-face teaching. It can be seen as a reasonable additional tool to be included in surgical curricula because it leads to improvement in surgical performance. The benefit of learning with the multimedia-based Internet platform <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.webop.de">www.webop.de</ext-link> can be defined as proven. In addition, changes in the World Wide Web, with a shift to more social-networking activity in education and Web-based delivery to small, ubiquitous portable devices will increase opportunities for surgical e-learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The use of surgical online platforms such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.webop.de">www.webop.de</ext-link> will therefore become even more interesting.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank their colleagues Brigitte Habermalz, MD, and J&#x000fc;rgen Meyer, MD (both at the Department for Abdominal, Vascular, and Transplant Surgery, University of Witten/Herdecke, Cologne, Germany) for their help.
