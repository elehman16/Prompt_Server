Automatic postural responses systematically vary with the direction of an external perturbation in both onset and amplitude (Moore et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1988</xref>; Rushmer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1988</xref>; Jones et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>). Additionally, gradual transitions between muscle onsets and amplitudes occur with fine changes in perturbation direction within the repertoire of these automatic postural responses (Moore et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1988</xref>). Alterations in somatosensation from the limbs or trunk, however, have been shown to modulate automatic postural responses. For example, individuals with peripheral neuropathy of the lower limbs show task-specific distal-to-proximal muscle activation strategies similar to controls following translations of the support surface, but exhibit delays at all segmental levels by 20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;ms (Inglis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1994</xref>). Additionally, these individuals show an inability to appropriately scale their postural responses to variations in perturbation velocity and amplitude. Although the slowed sensory conduction in the lower legs is likely to account for the delays, reduced somatosensation altered the ability to scale the magnitude of the postural response.</p><p>Individuals with chronic low back pain (LBP) also demonstrate delayed and reduced EMG activity compared with controls in response to anticipated (Hodges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>) and unanticipated (Magnusson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1996</xref>; Radebold et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2000</xref>) postural perturbations. Moreover, acute experimentally induced LBP in healthy individuals has been shown to alter trunk muscle activity during trunk flexion&#x02013;extension (Zedka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1999</xref>), as well as reaching (Thomas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2007</xref>) and rapid-arm movement (Hodges et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2003</xref>) tasks. These findings indicate that individuals with acute or chronic LBP may have a biomechanical disadvantage and risk a fall or further injury in response to unexpected external perturbations.</p><p> Previous assessments of trunk muscle activity have employed protocols that approximate &#x02018;real-life&#x02019; perturbations. This study examines, for the first time, automatic postural responses in the presence of experimentally induced LBP to fast, functionally relevant, full body perturbations. These perturbations are produced by a computer-controlled platform that can be controlled in three-dimensional space to produce tilting or sliding perturbations that resemble tripping over an obstacle or slipping on a wet surface. The aim of the study was to determine if acute LBP, in healthy individuals, systematically alters the automatic postural responses to rapid tilting or sliding postural perturbations. Therefore, the onset time and amplitude of the EMG activity of the erector spinae (ES) and external oblique (EO) in response to anterior and posterior sliding and rotational tilting (toe-up and toe-down) of the support surface were compared before and after injection of hypertonic saline into the ES muscle. An examination of trunk muscle activity associated with functionally relevant postural perturbations, in healthy individuals, before and after experimentally induced LBP will reveal the immediate effects of pain on automatic postural responses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Ten healthy individuals (4 men, age 23&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.05&#x000a0;years, weight 69.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;13.52&#x000a0;kg, height 171.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;9.31&#x000a0;cm, BMI 23.45&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.73) participated in a single experimental session. Individuals with previous or current respiratory, cardiovascular, or neurological conditions, low back pain or musculoskeletal disorders affecting the spine or limbs were excluded. Additionally, pregnant individuals or persons requiring prescription medication were excluded. All participants signed an informed consent form before the experimental session. Ethics approval for the study was granted by the regional Ethics Committee (No. 20090053) and the procedures were conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinski.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Procedure overview</title><p>The experimental session consisted of a baseline followed by a control and an acute LBP condition. The control condition consisted of an injection of isotonic saline (IS) and the acute LBP condition in an injection of the hypertonic saline (HS) into the right lower back. In the baseline condition or immediately after each injection, participants stood on a moveable platform during which 32 randomized postural-perturbations were performed. For each perturbation bilateral surface electromyography (EMG) was acquired from the ES and EO muscles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Isotonic and hypertonic saline injections</title><p>A 1&#x000a0;ml bolus of isotonic (9&#x000a0;mg/ml NaCl, SAD, Denmark) or hypertonic (1&#x000a0;mmol/ml NaCl, SAD, Denmark) saline was injected with a 0.4&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;19&#x000a0;mm needle (BD Microlance&#x02122; 3, Becton&#x02013;Dickinson, Ireland) into the right ES, 40&#x000a0;mm lateral to the spinous process at the second lumber vertebrae (Zedka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1999</xref>; Hodges et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2003</xref>). The injection site was cleaned with alcohol prior to each injection. While the isotonic saline injection always preceded that of hypertonic saline, subjects were not aware which injection they were to receive. They were told that two would be given, and that one, both, or neither might be painful. Injections were given while the subject was in a prone position. Shortly (&#x0003c;1&#x000a0;min) after an injection, participants were assisted to a standing position and then onto the perturbation platform located directly in front of them.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Subjective pain intensity, quality and area</title><p>During the control and acute LBP conditions, the participants verbally conveyed their pain intensity to the investigator using a numerical rating scale (NRS) every 20&#x000a0;s for the duration of the 32 perturbations. Participants were asked to rate their pain on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 represented no pain and 10 represented the worst pain imaginable. Immediately following the cessation of the perturbations, participants completed a McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) (Melzack <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1975</xref>) and then shaded the area of perceived pain, if any, on a standardized body chart. Three or more occurrences of a pain quality descriptor from the MPQ were considered common and reported in the results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Postural-perturbations</title><p>Postural-perturbations were produced using a computer-controlled movable platform (Andersen and Sinkjaer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>). Participants were instructed to step onto the centre of the platform and position their feet, approximately, shoulder-width apart such that they were able to stand in a comfortable posture. Four different postural-perturbations were produced with varying inter-perturbation time intervals (Range 7&#x02013;20&#x000a0;s) in order to reduce the participants&#x02019; ability to predict the type and perturbation onset. The four perturbations consisted of an 8-cm anterior slide, 8-cm posterior slide, 10-anterior or posterior tilt of the platform around the middle axis in the frontal plane, refer to Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The platform had a constant velocity of 270&#x000a0;cm/ms and 120&#x000b0;/ms from starting position (ground height and level) to the end position for the slides and tilts, respectively. Pilot trials revealed that these postural-perturbation parameters resulted in marked activity of the ES and EO muscles without producing discernable compensatory postural movements of the arms and legs. In each experimental condition, all four perturbations were repeated eight times in random order for a total of 32 perturbations. After each perturbation the platform slowly returned to the starting position. The 32 perturbations were completed over a 4- to 5-min interval and a 5-min rest period occurred between each experimental condition. Prior to the onset of the experimental protocol the participants experienced each type of postural-perturbation. These postural-perturbations were considered unanticipated since any specific anticipation to a perturbation direction or type would, conceivably, increase the risk of instability (Lavender et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1993</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Illustration of the four perturbation types with respect to the participant&#x02019;s stance</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="221_2011_2629_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>EMG recordings</title><p>Bipolar surface EMG signals were detected from the ES and EO with pairs of electrodes (Ambu<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Neuroline 720, Denmark) positioned 20&#x000a0;mm apart following skin preparation. Three pairs of electrodes were placed over the ES muscle bilaterally at T12, L2, and L4, 40&#x000a0;mm lateral to the spinal column and one pair of electrodes was placed over EO muscle bilaterally, approximately 15&#x000a0;cm lateral to the umbilicus. An Ag/AgCl self-adhesive reference electrode (Ambu<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Neuroline Ground, Denmark) was attached over the spine at L2. The EMG signals were sampled at 2,048&#x000a0;Hz with a gain of 2,000 using a 128-channel surface EMG-USB amplifier (LISiN-OT Bioelettronica, Torino, Italy; -3&#x000a0;dB bandwidth 10&#x02013;500&#x000a0;Hz) and converted to digital form by a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter.</p><p>A trigger signal originating from the computer-controlled platform was used as a reference in order to determine the onset of ES and EO activity following each perturbation. The average rectified value (ARV) was estimated from the EMG signals over non-overlapping signal epochs of 50&#x000a0;ms. The first 50&#x000a0;ms epoch was recorded prior to the perturbation onset and the remaining epochs were recorded thereafter. The ARV of EMG was assessed as an average over 300&#x000a0;ms following the onset of the perturbation. The onset of muscle activity was determined using the signal processing method developed by Merlo and colleagues (Merlo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A three-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the main effects of condition (baseline, control, acute LBP) on EMG amplitude or onset for each muscle (ES, EO) and for each side (left, right).

Significant differences revealed by ANOVA were followed by post hoc Student Newman-Keuls (SNK) test.

First, acute unilateral experimental LBP resulted in a bilateral delay in EMG onset time and reduced EMG amplitude for the ES and EO, but only for the sliding perturbations. Second, the order of activation and the time interval between the onset of the ES and EO for the four perturbations were unaltered during the acute LBP condition. Third, only the onset time of the ES systematically varied with the differing perturbation types and directions. Together, these findings indicate that despite a delay in onset time and decreased EMG activity, the relative timing between the activation of the ES and EO was retained in response to rapid, unanticipated full-body perturbations during acute LBP.</p><p>In this present study, delays and decreased EMG activity of the ES and EO muscles were found following a unilateral injection of hypertonic saline in the low back in response to sliding postural perturbations. Previously, it has been shown that pre-activation of the trunk muscles, equivalent to 40% maximal extension effort, effectively reduced reflex responses of the trunk muscles to postural perturbations when compared with a 20% maximal extension effort (Stokes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2000</xref>). However, given that the EMG activity of the EO and ES prior to the onset of all perturbation types (sliding and tilting) did not differ between conditions, the reduced EMG activity and delayed onsets of the EO and ES found in response to the sliding perturbations can be attributed to the acute LBP intervention.</p><p>Interestingly, the unilateral injection of hypertonic saline resulted in a unilateral perception of pain in the lower back but a bilateral delay and reduction in EMG activity of the ES and EO. A bilateral change in the recruitment strategy of ES and EO may have been necessary in order to maintain stability of the spine. If only the muscle activity of the ES and EO on the painful side was altered a torque moment would ensue following the postural perturbations, which would subject the spine to potentially damaging shearing forces. In contrast to limb muscles, for example, the left and right internal obliques have comparable representations in the ipsilateral and contralateral primary motor cortices (Strutton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2004</xref>), which supports the possibility of bilateral motor control processes.</p><p>The marked decreases in the EMG activity and onset for the sliding perturbations, as opposed to the tilting perturbations may have resulted from differences in the overall displacement of the participant&#x02019;s centre-of-mass. For the sliding perturbations, inter-segmental moments of the spine would occur around the centre-of-mass, located within the trunk region, to a greater extent than for the tilting perturbations. In contrast, tilting would induce a greater stretch in the ankle and lower legs. Given the location of the painful intervention (low back) the onset time and EMG activity of the ES and EO is therefore more likely to be affected during the sliding, as opposed to the tilting perturbations. In accordance with this view, stretch reflexes elicited via the soleus or gastrocnemius may have triggered the postural response during the tilting perturbations (Bloem et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2000</xref>) as the ES muscles respond reflexively to activation of sensory receptors in the triceps surae muscles and Achilles tendon (Clair et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>). Although EMG activity of the lower limb muscles were not specifically examined in the present study, it is likely that the postural response during the tilting perturbations was triggered by sensory cues distal to the trunk.</p><p>The delayed onsets and deceases in EMG activity of the ES and EO in the acute LBP condition also concur with reports of delays or decreased trunk muscle activity in the presence of pain during the performance of simple rudimentary tasks (Thomas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2007</xref>) and following anticipated (Hodges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>; Hodges et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2003</xref>) and unanticipated postural perturbations (Magnusson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1996</xref>; Radebold et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2000</xref>). For example, deceased amplitude of the ES in response to sudden extension moments around the level of T4 has been shown during induced LBP in healthy individuals (Magnusson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1996</xref>). Increased co-contraction has been suggested as a mechanism that would explain these decreases in amplitude since prior activation of the affected muscles reduces the amplitude of the needed response to off-set the perturbation (van Dieen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2003</xref>). This suggestion, however, may only be applicable to anticipated postural perturbations since any specific anticipation, such as pre-tensioning of the ES muscles, would increase the risk of postural instability (Lavender et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1993</xref>).</p><p>In comparison with anticipated (anterior-posterior) postural perturbations, unanticipated perturbations can result in increased trunk displacement and muscle responses. However, when the temporal onset of the perturbation is well-known, there is a pre-activation of the trunk muscles and a reduction in trunk displacement and peak muscle activity following the perturbation (Thomas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1998</xref>). Further, the rectus abdominus, TrA, EO and ES have been shown to become simultaneously activated following unanticipated perturbations (ventral loadings during standing) to the trunk (Cresswell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1994</xref>). It has been suggested that activation of these trunk muscles following a postural perturbation serve to stabilize the spine by increasing intra-abdominal pressure. In this present study, a decrease in ES and EO muscle activity and delayed onsets were found during the acute LBP condition, which suggests that acute LBP may compromise the stability of the spine. It remains unclear at this time if the rectus abdominus and TrA, which largely generate intra-abdominal pressure, are similarly altered in response to unanticipated full body postural perturbations during LBP conditions.</p><p>The mechanisms contributing to the delayed muscle responses following postural perturbations in low back pain conditions remain unknown. Injection of hypertonic saline into the ES does not alter the stretch reflex in this muscle (Zedka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1999</xref>), which suggests an involvement of supraspinal structures or central commands. Nonetheless, these present findings demonstrated that an acute LBP condition altered the automatic postural responses during the sliding perturbations, which means that an unexpected event, such as a slip on a wet surface, may place an individual with LBP at a greater risk of further injury.</p><p>Although the acute LBP condition was associated with delayed activity, the relative timing between the onset of ES and EO for all four postural perturbations was maintained. Comparable findings have been shown in individuals with peripheral neuropathy of the lower limbs. Despite a common delay in onset times, similar task-specific distal-to-proximal muscle activation strategies were observed between these individuals and healthy controls in response to sliding perturbations (Inglis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1994</xref>). Magnusson and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1990</xref>) estimated that adequate postural control can be maintained if somatosensory feedback delays do not exceed 300&#x000a0;ms. This concurs with the findings of our study which showed that the delays (range 10&#x02013;35&#x000a0;ms) did not lead to a failure in the re-establishment of posture. However, it is unknown if individuals with chronic LBP would exhibit the same relative timing between the onset of ES and EO during similar postural perturbations and whether adequate postural control could be maintained.</p><p>In the case of experimental or chronic LBP conditions, a shift from temporally decoupled to coupled muscle activity has also been demonstrated for the transverses abdominis (TrA) muscle during rapid arm-movements (Hodges and Richardson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1996</xref>; Hodges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>; Hodges et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2003</xref>). These studies have consistently shown that pre-recruitment of the TrA prior to the deltoid no longer occurs during the rapid arm-movement task. However, these studies investigated the response to anticipated perturbations, which means that feed-forward motor control strategies or a greater involvement of supraspinal structures (Jacobs and Horak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2007</xref>) was employed to re-establish posture. Individuals with chronic LBP also demonstrate decreased variability in anticipatory postural adjustments (Jacobs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2009</xref>), which suggests a reduction in the repertoire of motor control strategies utilised to re-establish posture. In comparison with healthy individuals, LBP patients demonstrate the inability to switch off agonist and turn on antagonist muscles during unanticipated extension moments around the trunk (Radebold et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2000</xref>). Zedka and colleagues (1999) have also shown reduced ES activity during extension and increased ES activity during relaxation following hypertonic saline injection into the ES of healthy individuals. These studies suggest that acute or chronic LBP may compromise the ability to temporally decouple or modulate the onset times between trunk muscles which may increase the risk of fall or further injury.</p><p>Differing EMG onset and amplitudes of the ES and EO in response to the four unanticipated postural perturbations were found in this study. Opposing perturbation directions, namely the anterior- and posterior-related perturbations, produced distinct EMG onset and amplitudes of the ES and EO. As expected, the ES differed from the EO in both amplitude and onset for the posterior sliding perturbation and this difference was reversed for the anterior slides. An important note is that the EMG onset time of the ES occurred approximately 20&#x000a0;ms earlier for the posterior slide in comparison with the anterior slide perturbation. Although not as pronounced, this difference in ES onset time was also evident between the posterior and anterior tilting perturbations (approximately 10&#x000a0;ms). However, further analysis revealed that unlike the ES, the onset of the EO did not systemically vary with the direction or the type of the postural perturbation. These results indicate that re-establishment of posture and balance was a result of the individuals&#x02019; ability to rapidly and independently modulate ES with respect to EO activity. Moreover, this study showed that individual motor strategies (differences in the timing and amplitude of the ES and EO) for the anterior-posterior and posterior-anterior sliding and tilting perturbations (with and without pain) exist for healthy individuals. If the ability to independently modulate, relax or decouple muscle acitivity is compromised, as is evident in chronic LBP conditions (Radebold et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2000</xref>; Hodges et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2003</xref>), then the ability to safely re-establish posture and balance following an unexpected event will also be compromised.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study showed a delay in onset time and a decrease in the amplitude of EMG activity of the ES and EO in response to rapid, unanticipated full-body perturbations during an acute LBP condition in healthy individuals.
