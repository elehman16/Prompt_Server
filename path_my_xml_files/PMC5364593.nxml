Subjects will be assessed by trained professionals regarding oral health status, oral HRQoL, eating and nutritional risk, and swallowing ability. Swallowing ability will be measured with a teaspoon test and a swallowing capacity test (SCT).

At baseline, all subjects will be assessed for oral health status, oral HRQoL, eating and nutritional risk, swallowing ability, and swallowing-related QoL. Then, the intervention group will receive 5&#x000a0;weeks of training with an oral screen for neuromuscular training focused on orofacial and pharyngeal muscles.

For example, these impairments can lead to slower wound healing and increase the risks of developing pneumonia and other infections, pressure ulcers, and fall injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, being able to eat, to enjoy food, and to participate in the social activities associated with meals are important aspects of the quality of life (QoL) for older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. One important aspect of eating is the ability to swallow safely. The prevalence of impaired swallowing (i.e., dysphagia) is high among older individuals; thus, this impairment has been described as a &#x0201c;geriatric giant&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The prevalence of dysphagia in older populations has been reported to be 11&#x02013;80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], with variations among studies that depended on the degree of frailty in the cohort, the presence of neurological disease, and the evaluation method used. Many older people adapt slowly to dysphagia by eating slower and changing food consistency; thus, many hold the opinion that developing dysphagia is a natural consequence of aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In recent years, more attention has been directed toward swallowing rehabilitation, and different treatment designs have been developed to improve swallowing function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. One promising method of swallowing rehabilitation is training with an oral screen, which has been shown to improve dysphagia significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Another important aspect of eating is oral health. Good chewing function requires a sufficient number of healthy teeth or functioning prostheses for adequate occlusion. Without adequate chewing, it is difficult to comminute and digest the food, which results in impaired swallowing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Daily oral care is essential for good oral health. Older people that cannot perform oral care alone become dependent on health care professionals, which have differential knowledge about oral health, ambitions, and priorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>When older people that are chronically ill undergo treatment for an acute illness or hospital treatment, they often recover for weeks or months in intermediate- or short-term care facilities that provide basic nursing care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In Sweden, this type of care can be provided in a short-term care unit, a residential setting, or a hospital (for intermediate care). Short-term care can also include support for older people, when they are in frail conditions and are waiting for care-home placement, undergoing rehabilitation, require recurrent relief for family members that are informal caregivers, and even when they require end-of-life care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although thousands of older people are admitted yearly to Swedish short-term care units, there is little knowledge about the content of care and the effects on individual health, functioning, and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We also lack knowledge on how caretakers perceive the quality of care that they deliver. The scarcity of empirical studies on short-term care might be related to the expected methodological and ethical problems. For example, problems may be caused by the short care interval (individuals are admitted for only a few weeks), the frail state of older individuals, and the complex care organization. It has been suggested that conducting research in a short-term care context poses challenges related to obtaining informed consent, achieving sufficient power in intervention studies, and controlling for confounding factors, such as the different skill mixes and staffing levels in various care units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In summary, there is an urgent need for new knowledge concerning the content, quality, and effects of short-term care for older people.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims and research questions</title><p>The overall aims of this multidisciplinary, multicenter project are (<italic>i</italic>) to describe and analyze relationships between oral health and oral health-related quality of life (HRQoL), swallowing ability, eating ability, and nutritional risk for older individuals admitted to short-term care; (<italic>ii</italic>) to compare the perceptions reported by older individuals and staff on care quality related to oral hygiene and eating; and (<italic>iii</italic>) to study the feasibility and effects of a training program for older people that exhibit dysphagia, but have different diagnoses.</p><p>The research questions we will address are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>What is the state of oral health among the older people admitted to short-term care?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What is the state of swallowing ability among the older people admitted to short-term care?</p></list-item><list-item><p>How do the older people admitted to short-term care describe their oral health and their oral HRQoL?</p></list-item><list-item><p>How do the older people admitted to short-term care describe the quality of their oral care?</p></list-item><list-item><p>How do staff members in the corresponding short-term care unit describe the quality of oral care delivered?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Which factors impact the perceptions of care quality held by older individuals and the staff?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What are the differences and similarities between older individuals and the staff in their perceptions of care quality?</p></list-item><list-item><p>How does systematic training with an oral screen device for 5&#x000a0;weeks affect impaired swallowing function?</p></list-item><list-item><p>How do older people admitted to short-term care describe their swallowing-related QoL?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Is there any correlation between oral health, eating ability, and swallowing ability in older people admitted to short-term care?</p></list-item></list>

The sample in part 1 will comprise approximately 400 older participants. All participants will be assessed at baseline, and participants that exhibit low swallowing capacity (i.e., &#x0003c;10&#x000a0;ml/s) will be asked to participate in the interventional part of the study (part 2). In part 2, participating older persons will, after informed consent, be randomized into either the intervention or the control group, based on where they were admitted for short-term care. In addition to the baseline assessments, all participants in part 2 will be assessed after the intervention is completed (5&#x000a0;weeks) and 6-months post-intervention. The follow-up assessments will be conducted at the study participant&#x02019;s location (e.g., in the short-term care unit, in the individual&#x02019;s own home, or in a care home, where the older person resides at that time).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Ethics</title><p>This project has been planned in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], was approved by the Uppsala Regional Ethics Review Board, Sweden (Dnr 2013/100), and was retrospectively registered with Clinical Trials.gov, on July 4, 2016 identifier: NCT02825927.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Aged participants</title><p>All individuals admitted to the selected short-term care units will be eligible for study participation.

This device is designed to strengthen the facial muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], the oropharyngeal muscles, and the esophageal muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Moreover, it increases activity in all muscles, from the lips down to the diaphragm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The training protocol specifies using the device actively for 30&#x000a0;s, three times a day, before meals. Briefly, the oral screen is placed in the mouth, predentally, behind closed lips. The participant is asked to close the lips around the oral screen, to maintain it inside the lips; then, the participant pulls the handle horizontally, straight forward, as if to pull it out of the mouth, for approximately 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;s. The pulling force should be as high as possible without losing grip of the handle (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The pulling maneuver is performed three times, with a 3-s rest between each maneuver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. When a participant cannot manage training independently (e.g., unable to close the lips or unable to pull the handle), a staff member is instructed to assist, with information about possible modifications in the training.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Oral screen training.

</p><p>The control group will be asked to undergo the same assessments at the same times as the intervention group. Control participants will be given standard care (e.g., adjustments in food consistencies and posture instructions), according to the routines in the short-term care unit, where they reside.

The sample size calculation will be based on the assumption that the data will be normally distributed. To retain an overall type I error of 5%, the type I error will be set to 2.5% for the primary endpoint. Based on historical data, we assume that the standard deviation of the change in SCT level will be 3&#x000a0;ml/s. To detect a critical difference of 2.8&#x000a0;ml/s in swallowing capacity between the intervention and control groups with a power of 80% and type I error of 2.5%, a sample size of at least 22 subjects would be required to fulfill the study protocol in each group. The total number of subjects included must be somewhat higher, to compensate for drop-outs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The statistical package, IBM/SPSS&#x000ae;, will be used to perform all data analyses. <italic>P</italic>-values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe eating ability, oral health status, swallowing ability, quality of oral care, and swallowing-related QoL, among older individuals admitted to short-term care units. Descriptive statistics will also be used to describe the staffs&#x02019; perceptions of care quality. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariable regression (linear and logistic) analyses will be used to evaluate the associations between various dependent and independent variables. The Bonferroni correction will be used when multiple, pair-wise tests are performed on a single set of data, to reduce the chances of obtaining type I errors. Continuous variables will be presented as the mean value and standard deviation; categorical variables will be reported as the median and interquartile range. Differences between groups (e.g., intervention vs. control, older individuals vs. staff) will be assessed with independent sample t-tests (for continuous variables), chi-square tests (for categorical variables), and ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis (for more than 2 groups).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><p>This present protocol paper describes the design of a multidisciplinary, multicenter study, focused on Swedish short-term care, and we include a second, randomized case-controlled interventional study. This project has two important aims. First, it aims to describe important aspects of oral health, swallowing ability, and eating ability in older individuals, and to investigate the feasibility and effects of a program of oral screen training for dysphagia. Second, the project aims to study the quality of oral health-related care, as perceived by older individuals and staff in the short-term care units. The results of this project will provide important new knowledge for the development of short-term care for older individuals, in this specific care context, which has not been explored before. These resulting descriptions of the strengths and weakness in the quality of oral care will provide a basis for establishing guidelines for improving oral care in short-term care units. Moreover, in this context, the results of the swallowing training program with an oral screen will indicate whether this program will promote improvements in short-term care for this older population.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>Methodological and ethical problems were previously reported as challenges that explained the lack of empirical studies conducted in the short-term care context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, the present project includes several strategies to increase the probability of succeeding and to strengthen the results, as follows: (1) only participants with sufficient cognitive capacity are included; (2) older individuals in end-of-life care are excluded; (3) multiple short-term care units are included, housed in various settings and located in different parts of Sweden; (4) a cluster randomization trail design is implemented; (5) both clinical and self-reported assessments are considered; (6) the data collectors are professionals that hold relevant clinical experience in communicating with older individuals and assessing their oral health and swallowing ability; in addition the research team has experience in the care context, where the data will be collected.</p><p>By minimizing methodological and ethical challenges, our results, regarding oral health status, swallowing, eating ability, and nutritional risk, might not be representative of all older people in short-term care, e.g., individuals in the highest risk categories will not be included. Other methodological challenges might arise when performing the intervention study with late follow-up assessments (six months). These challenges include accessing information on where the participant is located at the time of the follow-up; managing the high risk of drop-out, due to mortality, in the study population; and recruiting for part 2 of the study. The latter problem is expected, because older people might have low motivation to participate in swallowing rehabilitation, due to fatigue, or because they have adapted to their situation and find no use in training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Measurement tools</title><p>The minimal eating observation and nutrition form - version II (MEONF-II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] is an easy-to-use, rapid, sensitive, screening tool that allows substituting of body mass index (BMI) with calf circumference, which increases its usability in this context, for assessing the risk of undernutrition. However, completing the form might be time-consuming for the nursing staff, and it requires a certain degree of familiarity with the older person.</p><p>The revised oral assessment guide (ROAG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] is a systematic assessment tool for detecting problems related to teeth and dentures in older individuals. It was designed to be used by nursing staff, and it is well-documented in Sweden, because it is included in Senior Alert, the national registry of quality in geriatric care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, the assessment is performed solely with a mouth mirror and flashlight, not in a dental clinic.</p><p>The SCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] is a simple, easy-to use screening test for determining the risk of dysphagia in a non-hospital context. The SCT is a feasible tool for evaluating training paradigms for treating dysphagia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The SCT requires an evaluation of age as a covariate, when performing data analysis.</p><p>Several self-assessment questionnaires (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) will be used in the present study to evaluate QoL related to different health areas, including: the OHIP-14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], the QPP-patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and the SWAL-QOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These questionnaires will contribute multifaceted information from the perspectives of older individuals. The results will guide further improvements in QoL in the short-term care context. However, answering questionnaires might be exhausting for older people. Therefore, there might be a risk of bias, if older individuals require support in reading and interpreting the questions. However, this type of support might lead to more accurate responses and fewer drop-outs.</p><p>The QPP-staff is a modified version of the QPP-patient questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The QPP-staff will provide important knowledge, from the perspective of nursing staff members, about the quality of care for older individuals in short-term care units. The challenges for this instrument are the risks of hasty, incomplete responses and drop-outs among the nursing staff members expected to complete the questionnaires. Due to the working situations of nursing staff, the many other tasks and priorities related to patient care might compromise their compliance with study requirements.</p><p>The Katz-ADL instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] has been used in geriatric care since the 1960s. It is a simple tool for assessing functional status in older individuals. It enables evaluations of rehabilitation during follow-up and the prognosis of recovery after an illness. This tool is sensitive to broad changes in declining health status; however, it can be limited in its ability to measure small improvements in rehabilitation.</p><p>If our findings show that the swallowing intervention could be useful in this context (older individuals with various diagnoses complicated with dysphagia), the training method should be implemented as a treatment option for all older individuals with dysphagia. The staff in all types of geriatric care should be educated in implementing this method. Additionally, a successful swallowing intervention would provide benefits beyond the eating and swallowing abilities of the individual, because it would also reduce morbidity and mortality. We expect that a better understanding of oral health in the older population studied will highlight the unaddressed needs related to oral care and malnutrition. Moreover, our findings will provide important quality indicators of good oral health and eating-related nursing care, in short-term care units.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>HRQoL</term><def><p>Health-related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Katz-ADL</term><def><p>Katz activity of daily living</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MEONF-II</term><def><p>Minimal eating observation and nutrition form &#x02013;version II</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OHIP-14</term><def><p>Oral health impact profile</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p>Quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QPP</term><def><p>Quality of care from a patient perspective</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RDH</term><def><p>Registered dental hygienist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROAG</term><def><p>Revised oral assessment guide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCT</term><def><p>Swallowing capacity test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SLP</term><def><p>Speech-language pathologist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SWAL-QoL</term><def><p>Swallowing quality of life questionnaire</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This study is funded by the &#x000d6;rebro County Region; the Regional Research Board of Uppsala-&#x000d6;rebro; Forte: the Swedish research council for health, working life, and welfare; The Kamprad family foundation for entrepreneurship, research, and charity; and Swedish Society for Clinical Nutrition.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>All project data will be stored in accordance with the Swedish Archives Act (Arkivlagen SFS 1990:782) and the Personal Data Act (Personuppgiftslagen SFS 1998:204) within the &#x000d6;rebro County Region.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>EC, KS, MP, MH, and LO planned the project, developed the research design, and calculated the sample size.
