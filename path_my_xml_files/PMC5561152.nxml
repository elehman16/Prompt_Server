This study examined whether applying insights from positive psychology to news production can reduce this potential harm, by reducing negative emotional responses and enhancing positive emotional responses to negative news, and by encouraging prosocial intentions. Moreover, we explored whether peer discussion strengthened these effects. Preadolescents (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;336; 9&#x02013;13 years old; 48.5% female) were exposed to either constructive (solution-based news including positive emotions) or nonconstructive news. Subsequently, half of the children assigned to the constructive and the nonconstructive condition participated in a peer discussion. The findings showed that exposure to constructive news resulted in more positive emotional responses and less negative emotional responses as compared to nonconstructive news. Moreover, discussing the news with peers led to more positive and less negative emotional responses among preadolescents who watched the nonconstructive newscast, and to more prosocial intentions among preadolescents who watched constructive news. In all, constructive news reporting and peer discussion could function as tools to make negative news less harmful for preadolescents.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>News</kwd><kwd>Positive (media) psychology</kwd><kwd>Constructive journalism</kwd><kwd>Peer discussion</kwd><kwd>Emotions</kwd><kwd>Prosocial intentions</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Informing preadolescents about what is going on in the world contributes to their socialization into critical and autonomous citizens (van&#x000a0;Deth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2011</xref>), and can encourage their prosocial intentions and behaviors (de Leeuw et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>). Journalists, politicians, and academics therefore argue that preadolescents&#x02019; engagement with news is important (Koltay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>; Tuominen and Kotilainen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>). In addition, preadolescents themselves say that they want to follow the news (Alon-Tirosh and Lemish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014</xref>; Carter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2009</xref>). However, it has been suggested that exposure to the predominantly negative stories in the news results in increased negative emotional responses, which in turn may lead to anxiety-related behaviors, such as having nightmares (e.g., Buijzen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2007</xref>; Riddle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012</xref>). Moreover, prior research indicated that negative, violent television content heightens antisocial behavior in preadolescents (c.f., Browne and Hamilton-Giachritsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2005</xref>). Therefore, the current study aims to examine the usefulness of other framings of the news to inform preadolescents between 9&#x02013;13 years old about negative news events. To this end, we investigate whether applying insights from positive psychology to news tailored at preadolescents can improve their emotional responses and may encourage prosocial intentions. We use stimuli from a Dutch children&#x02019;s television news program that targets an audience between approximately 9 and 13 years old (c.f., Walma van der Molen and de Vries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2003</xref>), because such tailored newscasts serve as major news source for preadolescents in several Western countries across the world (c.f., Alon-Tirosh and Lemish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014</xref>; Carter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2009</xref>; Walma van der Molen and de Vries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2003</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Positive Psychology in News: Constructive Journalism</title><p id="Par6">Inspired by notions from positive psychology, an innovative kind of news reporting recently emerged in the field of journalism, labeled &#x0201c;constructive journalism&#x0201d; (Gyldensted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>; Haagerup <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>; McIntyre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>). Positive psychology focuses on the flourishing of individuals, communities, and societies (Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2000</xref>), and constructive journalism aims to contribute to this by energizing and inspiring people through news reports (Gyldensted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>). To reach this aim, journalists are encouraged to give possible solutions for problems in their news stories and to foster a positive perspective on events by including positive emotions (Gyldensted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>; McIntyre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>). Therewith, constructive journalism takes distance from the negativity bias that dominates today&#x02019;s news reporting. Notably, constructive journalism is not about bringing more positive news, but about framing negative stories in a more positive, constructive way (Gyldensted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>; Haagerup <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>; McIntyre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>). Given the challenges that producers of newscasts tailored at preadolescents face when reporting about negative events (c.f., Alon-Tirosh and Lemish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014</xref>; Walma van der Molen and de Vries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2003</xref>), it is worth exploring whether introducing insights from positive psychology to news (via constructive news reporting) helps to improve preadolescents&#x02019; responses to news and to increase their prosocial intentions.</p><p id="Par7">The two principal strategies for creating constructive stories (i.e., solution-based news reporting and including positive emotions in negative stories) are derived from the field of positive psychology. First, Pals&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2006</xref>) idea of coherent positive resolution served as inspiration. Positive coherent resolution involves &#x0201c;the construction of a coherent and complete story of a difficult event that ends positively, conveying a sense of emotional resolution or closure&#x0201d; (Pals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2006</xref>, p. 1082). Although not all stories can have a happy end, giving people a sense of narrative completion may help to diminish the negative emotional impact of the story. This may enhance their individual well-being which, in turn, positively affects societal well-being (McIntyre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>). Applying this to news, a solution-based&#x02014;instead of problem-based&#x02014;way of news reporting can provide narrative completion. By presenting solutions and therewith giving the audience the impression that there is hope for the future, news consumers will feel better (Gyldensted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>; McIntyre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>). In addition, the presented solutions may serve as mobilizing information (c.f., McIntyre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>). By showing what potential solutions are, the audience can become inspired to contribute to these solutions.</p><p id="Par8">Second, the broaden-and-build theory (Fredrickson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2001</xref>) is used to conceptualize constructive news reporting. In the broaden-and-build theory, it is argued that positive emotions are able to broaden an individual&#x02019;s thought-action repertoire, that is the range of potential actions the body and mind are prepared to take. Positive emotions lead to a more positive, broadened mindset and broadened behaviors (e.g., joy may not only cause feelings of happiness, but also spark the urge to play, c.f., Fredrickson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>). Therewith, it can inspire innovative thoughts and actions in individuals (Fredrickson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2001</xref>). This, in turn, may also be beneficial for communities and societies, because individuals with a broadened repertoire of social and intellectual resources may also have advanced skills in interpersonal relationships. In contrast, negative emotions have an opposite effect, because they narrow one&#x02019;s thoughts and actions (Fredrickson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2001</xref>). In the context of news, this suggests that stories should include more positive emotions instead of emphasizing particularly negative emotions (McIntyre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>). News producers can, for example, accomplish this by focusing in the news report on stories of survivors instead of victims.</p><p id="Par9">In all, both solution-based news reporting and the inclusion of positive emotions are expected to improve emotional responses to news and to inspire people to behave in a more prosocial manner (e.g., by offering help). Prior studies among an adult population provide preliminary support for this (Gyldensted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2011</xref>; McIntyre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>). Although the effects of constructive television news reporting are not yet studied among preadolescents, one might expect that constructive stories may also be able to improve emotional responses and prosocial intentions in preadolescents. A study by de Leeuw and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>) provides preliminary support for particularly the latter. They found that prosocial news content, in which preadolescents showed how they offered help (i.e., an example of solution-based news), encouraged preadolescents who watched this news to set up a project for a charity organization and to donate money.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The Additional Effects of Peer Discussion</title><p id="Par10">When studying preadolescents&#x02019; reactions to negative news, it is interesting to take peer discussions after news exposure into account. In the Netherlands, where this study was conducted, a substantial amount of preadolescents watches children&#x02019;s news programs together with their peers in the classroom (c.f., de Leeuw et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>; NOS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>). After watching, it is reasonable that in-class discussions about the news take place. Until now, no research has been conducted on the impact of such discussions on preadolescents&#x02019; reactions to news. There are, however, reasons to expect positive effects of peer discussion after news exposure. According to Wilkinson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2009</xref>), discussions in classrooms are defined as collaborative conversations between teachers and students, or between students only, with the purpose of fostering students&#x02019; thinking, learning, problem solving, comprehension, and appreciation of the materials.</p><p id="Par11">The importance and impact of discussions among peers has already been stressed by several pioneers in the field of psychology, such as Jean Piaget, Lev Vygotsky, and Harry Stack Sullivan (c.f., Damon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1984</xref>). Their theoretical positions provide a conceptual framework for the impact of discussions among peers in the present study. Peer discussions lead to the prevention of misunderstandings, the search for better solutions, discovery learning and creative thinking, and better social competences, such as friendly and fair behavior in interpersonal relationships (Damon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1984</xref>; Slavin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2014</xref>). Peer-related activities predict preadolescents&#x02019; social and academic competences at school, including more frequent displays of prosocial behavior and less antisocial behavior (Wentzel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2009</xref>). In addition, they describe peer discussion itself as a form of prosocial behavior, including, for example, helping behavior, cooperation, and providing emotional support. Therefore, in addition to investigating the influence of constructive news reporting, this study also explores the effects of peer discussion on the responses of preadolescents to negative news.</p><p id="Par12">It can be expected that peer discussion alone has a positive influence on the emotions of preadolescents because it fosters, among other things, a better understanding of the news content and leads to friendly and fair behavior (Damon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1984</xref>; Slavin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2014</xref>). Moreover, based on prior research (Wentzel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2009</xref>), one might expect that peer discussion reinforces preadolescents&#x02019; prosociality. Although studies in this regard specifically show that longer peer interactions have an effect, we will explore whether holding only one discussion with peers may also affect prosociality. A single peer discussion may not be strong enough to affect behavior, which is why we focus on prosocial intentions, a close cognitive antecedent of behavior (c.f., Ajzen and Fishbein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2005</xref>). Because of the assumptions of direct effects of peer discussion on both emotional responses and prosocial intentions, peer discussion is expected to strengthen the effect of constructive news reporting on both the emotional responses of preadolescents and their prosocial intentions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Current Study</title><p id="Par13">Constructive news reporting is hypothesized to improve emotional responses to news and to inspire children to be more prosocial, because the constructive elements (i.e., including solutions and positive emotions) create a sense of emotional resolution (c.f., Pals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2006</xref>), and may broaden one&#x02019;s thought-action repertoire in a more positive, innovative way (c.f., Fredrickson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2001</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that watching constructive news will lead to less negative emotions and a smaller decrease in positive emotions in preadolescents than watching nonconstructive news (Hypothesis 1), and that watching constructive news will lead to more prosocial intentions among preadolescents than watching nonconstructive news (Hypothesis 2).</p><p id="Par14">In addition, we expect that peer discussion about the news moderates the effect of constructive news reporting on both the emotional responses of preadolescents and their prosocial intentions, because peer discussion in itself fosters, among other things, friendly and fair behavior (Damon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1984</xref>; Slavin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2014</xref>) and prosociality (Wentzel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2009</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that discussing news with peers will enhance the expected positive effect of constructive news reporting on preadolescents&#x02019; emotional responses to news (Hypothesis 3), and on preadolescents&#x02019; prosocial intentions (Hypothesis 4).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Method</title><p id="Par15">We conducted a between-subjects experiment in which preadolescents were exposed to either constructive or nonconstructive television news. Both before and after exposure to a television newscast, their emotions were measured. Moreover, after watching the news, preadolescents indicated their prosocial intentions. For half of the preadolescents, the experiment ended here. The other half participated in a peer discussion about the news. After this discussion, we again measured their emotions and prosocial intentions.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par16">The sample size for the current study was based on an a priori power analysis which was conducted in G*Power 3.1 (Faul et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>). Assuming an effect size <italic>F</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.14, a significance level of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05, and four participant groups, a total of at least 274 participants was determined. This would provide a power of 80% in order to detect effects. The actual sample consisted of 336 preadolescents (48.5% female; <italic>M</italic>
<sub>age</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10.60; <italic>SD</italic>
<sub>age</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.17). Participants were between the ages of 9 and 13 years, which is in accordance with the target group of children&#x02019;s TV news (Walma van der Molen and de Vries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Procedure</title><p id="Par17">Preadolescents were recruited from four primary schools across the Netherlands. In addition to obtaining active consent to participate from the head of each school and the preadolescents themselves, a letter with a description of the study as well as the request to give passive consent was distributed among the parents of the preadolescents. In this letter, it was further stressed that all information would be treated anonymously and confidentially. Almost all parents (99%) and preadolescents (98%) gave, respectively, passive and active consent.</p><p id="Par18">The data were collected in classrooms, using paper-and-pencil questionnaires. In the beginning of the experimental session, an entire class was randomly assigned to either the experimental (constructive, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;166) or control (nonconstructive, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;170) condition. In addition, within these conditions, classes were also randomly assigned to the peer discussion condition or the condition in which no peer discussion was included. The amount of children that participated in the discussion was roughly the same in the constructive (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;76) and nonconstructive condition (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;81). In the no peer discussion condition, the number of participants was also comparable between the constructive (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;90) and nonconstructive condition (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;89). The mean age of the preadolescents in the peer discussion condition (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10.59; <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.17) was similar to the mean age of the preadolescents that did not participate in a peer discussion (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10.60; <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.18).</p><p id="Par19">After individually filling out the pre-exposure questionnaire&#x02014;capturing the preadolescents&#x02019; demographic characteristics and their emotional state at that moment&#x02014;preadolescents watched a short news program that either included constructive or nonconstructive news items. Then, preadolescents were asked to, again individually, fill out the second questionnaire (post-exposure) capturing their emotional responses and prosocial intentions after watching the newscast. For approximately half of the classes (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;179 preadolescents), the experiment ended here. These preadolescents were thanked and debriefed.</p><p id="Par20">The other classes (including <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;157 preadolescents) participated in a peer discussion. Within each class, preadolescents were divided in groups of three or four. In order to control the direction of the peer discussions held after watching the news, an educational tool called &#x0201c;the placemat method&#x0201d; was used (Craigen and Green <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1999</xref>; F&#x000f6;rrer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2000</xref>). A large piece of paper (a placemat) was placed on a table. Because a maximum of four preadolescents participated in a peer discussion group, this paper was divided into four equal areas (corners of the paper, one for each child) and an area in the middle of the paper. First, preadolescents were asked to individually write down their opinion concerning the statement: &#x0201c;Thinking back to the broadcast you just have seen, what thoughts, feelings, and ideas come into your mind first?&#x0201d;. After 2&#x02009;min, their task was to discuss with the other two/three members of their discussion group what they just had written down in the corner of the paper they were assigned to. After that, they got another 2&#x02009;min to select the three most important ideas that were discussed and to write them down in the middle of the paper. This was the end of the peer discussion task, after which the participating preadolescents were asked to fill out a last questionnaire (follow up), again capturing their emotional responses and prosocial intentions with regard to the newscast they saw. Afterwards, these preadolescents were also debriefed and thanked for their participation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par21">Together with news producers from&#x000a0;the <italic>NOS</italic>
<italic>Jeugdjournaal</italic>, a popular children&#x02019;s TV news program in the Netherlands, two professionally looking versions of the news program were created. We only used real footage that was broadcast in newscasts of&#x000a0;the <italic>NOS Jeugdjournaal</italic>. Due to findings of several studies suggesting that news about natural disasters is one of the top categories that frightens preadolescents when watching news (c.f., Cantor and Nathanson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1996</xref>; Riddle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012</xref>), participating preadolescents were exposed to news reports about the 2011 tsunami nearby Sendai in Japan. We selected this particular event, because a lot of video material was available. Moreover, the time difference between the moment that the event happened and the data collection played a role. All materials that were used to construct the newscasts were broadcast on television between 12 and 18 March in 2011. The experiment was conducted in the spring of 2016. Therefore, it was unlikely that the preadolescents in our sample saw the original newscasts about the topic or had living memories of the tsunami in Japan that happened 5 years ago.</p><p id="Par22">The structures of the constructive and the nonconstructive newscast were comparable (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). After the tune that marked the beginning of the program, both versions of the newscast consisted of an opening presenting general information about the tsunami, followed by three news items of approximately the same duration, and an ending and end tune. The opening and the ending were kept the same in both the constructive and nonconstructive version. Not only the same audio information&#x02014;presenting the most important information about the 2011 tsunami in Japan&#x02014;but also the same video information was used here.

</p><p id="Par23">The three items in the middle of each broadcast were different based on the application of elements from positive psychology. The constructive version included solution-based elements and positive emotions (c.f., Gyldensted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>; McIntyre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>). Specifically, the first item contained a report about the search for survivors. It showed that several countries sent military aid and tracker dogs to Japan, fostering hope and providing solution-based information. Item 2 showed parts of an interview with two Japanese children who live in the Netherlands. They expressed their happiness about the fact that their grandparents in Japan were fine. Therewith, positive emotions were included in the newscast. Item 3 contained an interview with a Japanese girl describing finding her dog after having him lost for 1 week. Therewith, the focus was on the survivors (instead of victims) and along with this, positive emotions were expressed. The total duration of the constructive newscast was 2&#x02009;min and 49&#x02009;s.</p><p id="Par24">The nonconstructive version also included three news items in the middle of the newscast. The topics of these items were comparable to the stories in the constructive newscast. The first item was also about the search for survivors, but particularly emphasized how difficult the search was. It focused on negative consequences of the disaster rather than providing possible solutions. Item 2 showed parts of the interview with the same two Japanese children as used in the constructive newscast. However, in the nonconstructive newscast they expressed their sorrow and sadness about not being able to visit their grandparents in Japan. Item 3 focused on the victims rather than the survivors. A man, standing in the middle of the havoc, reported that there are a lot of victims and that this is of course very sad news. The nonconstructive newscast had a total duration of 2&#x02009;min and 37&#x02009;s.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Measures<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref></title><p id="Par26">In order to measure the emotional responses of the preadolescents, both before and after exposure to the news program as well as after the peer discussion, preadolescents were asked to indicate how they felt on visual analog scales (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100 (100&#x02009;mm of length). VAS are shown to be a valid, reliable, and sensitive tool for assessing individual subjective feelings (Davey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>; Lara-Mu&#x000f1;oz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2004</xref>; Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2013</xref>). Next to that, the VAS is unaffected by the limited test-taking skills of younger participants. Therefore, VAS is frequently used in medical settings (e.g., to let children indicate pain). It is also used to measure emotional responses to media messages. For example, Branton and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>) used VAS to measure both positive and negative emotions before and after video gaming. In the current study, we use a VAS in which an emoticon representing the lack of the emotion was displayed on the left end point, whereas on the right end point an emoticon representing the emotion was displayed. Based on Keltner et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2014</xref>), the four primary emotions&#x02014;joy, anger, sadness, and fear&#x02014;that children express already very early in life, were used. In each questionnaire, these and a synonym for each emotion (respectively happiness, madness, sorrow, and anxiety) were included in order to measure the preadolescents&#x02019; emotional responses as extensive as possible.</p><p id="Par27">Then, principal component analyses (PCAs) for the two positive emotions and the six negative emotions measured before the newscast, after the newscast, and after peer discussion were conducted separately. Across all testing moments, the PCAs and reliability analyses presented comparable results. The Kaiser&#x02013;Meyer&#x02013;Olkin (KMO) measure was in all cases greater or equal to 0.50. Therefore, it verified sampling adequacy for both the positive emotions and negative emotions. Moreover, Bartlett&#x02019;s test of sphericity was always significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). We therefore assumed that the correlations between the items were large enough to conduct the PCAs. Both the criterion of component loadings greater than 0.60, and the criterion of dimensions with eigenvalues greater than 1 proposed one component for each PCA (c.f., Kline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1994</xref>).

We believe that the items are also useful to measure prosocial intentions, because they reflect prosocial activities that people can perform to offer help.

We experimentally investigated whether these two elements indeed improved preadolescents&#x02019; emotional responses to news and whether their prosocial intentions were encouraged by exposing them to a newscast that reports about a tsunami in either a constructive or nonconstructive way. In addition, we examined the role of peer discussion in this regard, because preadolescents frequently watch the news together with peers in classrooms (c.f., de Leeuw et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>; NOS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>), and because peer discussion in itself may foster friendly and fair behavior (Damon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1984</xref>; Slavin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2014</xref>) as well as prosociality (Wentzel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2009</xref>).</p><p id="Par43">The findings revealed that preadolescents who watched the constructive newscast reported less negative emotional responses compared to preadolescents who watched the nonconstructive newscast. Moreover, because the newscast was about a negative event, preadolescents in both the constructive and the nonconstructive condition reported a decrease in positive emotions. However, this decrease was smaller for preadolescents watching the constructive version of the news. Additionally, preadolescents who watched the nonconstructive newscast and participated in a discussion with their peers displayed more positive and less negative emotions than preadolescents in the same news condition who did not participate in a peer discussion. This beneficial effect of peer discussion was not found in preadolescents who watched the constructive newscast. For the latter group, peer discussions led to more prosocial intentions. In all, this study indicates that constructive reporting of news and peer discussion can function, at least to a certain extent, as tools to make negative news less harmful for preadolescents. Moreover, discussing constructive content of news may increase their prosocial intentions. These results are generally in line with results from studies on constructive journalism among adults, which demonstrated that constructive elements in news stories can increase positive affect in readers and enhance prosocial intentions, such as donating money (Gyldensted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2011</xref>; McIntyre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>). Moreover, the study provides support for Pals&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2006</xref>) notion that narrative completion of a story (in this study via solution-based information) helps to diminish negative emotional responses. Also, in line with the broaden-and-build theory (Fredrickson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2001</xref>), the positive emotions that were included in the constructive newscast may have played a stimulating role in improving emotional and prosocial responses. We need to note that the effect sizes that were found are rather small, which is quite common in this kind of studies on media effects (c.f., Wilson and Sherrell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1993</xref>). Although this implies that better insight into how constructive elements, among other factors that are not incorporated here, can be beneficial for preadolescents&#x02019; responses to news is warranted, introducing positive psychology to news can be seen as a promising development.</p><p id="Par44">With regard to the conclusions, a few nuances should be made. First, in contrast to our expectation, preadolescents&#x02019; prosocial intentions did not differ between constructive and nonconstructive news directly after exposure. This might be explained by the fact that preadolescents in the constructive condition were exposed only once to two items containing prosocial content (item 1 and item 3) embedded within the entire newscast. Prior research suggests that a change in prosociality is more likely when either being exposed to such content repeatedly or for a longer period of time (Mares <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2013</xref>; Mares and Woodard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2012</xref>). The finding that discussing the constructive newscast, which included prosocial content, enhanced prosocial intentions provided preliminary support for this. By talking about it, the prosocial content was reinforced via peers, which may explain the further increase in prosocial intentions.</p><p id="Par45">Second, contrary to the expectation, we found that peer discussions did not improve emotional responses of preadolescents who watched constructive news. It appeared to be beneficial for preadolescents in the nonconstructive condition only to discuss with peers what they saw and experienced. The lack of change in emotions in the constructive condition might be due to the fact that preadolescents in the constructive condition already reported higher levels of positive emotions directly after watching the newscast, compared to preadolescents in the nonconstructive condition. Since it is an important characteristic of constructive journalism to provide the most important information about the event (c.f., Gyldensted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>), the constructive broadcast contained basic information about the disaster reported in a rather negative manner. It is, therefore, unlikely to expect that positive emotional responses to this constructive story can become rather high. It might be that preadolescents reached their optimal level of positive emotions already after watching the constructive broadcast, which makes a further increase in positive emotions after peer discussion unlikely.</p><p id="Par46">With regard to negative emotions, the content of the peer discussion may have hindered a further decrease in negative emotional feelings. We observed during the experiment that preadolescents in all conditions were impressed by the havoc that was shown in the opening of the newscast. Consequently, this was a prominent part of the peer discussions in both the constructive and the nonconstructive condition. To be more specific, each group was asked to write down the three most important ideas regarding the newscast they just saw and discussed. A preliminary analysis of these answers showed that in the constructive condition, 86.55% of the answers had a negative connotation (e.g., words as shocking, sad for Japan, and tsunami were frequently mentioned), whereas only a few constructive words (e.g., helping, future, fund raising) were mentioned. For preadolescents in the constructive condition, this implies that the positive elements that were present in the news were less prominently (or sometimes not) discussed. Thus, the peer discussion particularly may have reinforced the negative emotions that preadolescents already experienced after watching the constructive stories, which may explain why discussing the constructive newscast did not further improve their emotional responses to news. We need to note here that also preadolescents in the nonconstructive condition discussed the negative elements of the newscast about the tsunami in Japan (90% of their answers were negative), but as their negative emotions increased quite substantial due to the exposure to the news (post-exposure measure), a beneficial effect after peer discussion (follow up measure) is easier to reach. This may explain why a positive effect of peer discussion was found in the nonconstructive condition. To get more insight into this, taking a closer look at the entire content of peer discussions may shed more light on the question why and how peer discussions can moderate the effects of news on preadolescents. In line with that, it may be interesting to investigate the influence of qualitative good vs. bad discussions.</p><p id="Par47">There are several limitations that should be mentioned. First, preadolescents were only exposed to one kind of topic, a natural disaster, within the broad spectrum of negative news topics that frighten preadolescents (c.f., Riddle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012</xref>; Walma van der Molen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2002</xref>). It would be interesting to take a closer look at other topics as well, especially to make the findings of the current study more generalizable. It may particularly be interesting to investigate effects of news stories that happened in the closer surrounding of the participants. Vividness theory predicts that vivid information&#x02014;i.e., information that is &#x0201c;emotionally interesting, concrete, and imaginary-provoking, and proximate in a sensory, temporal, or spatial way&#x0201d; (Nisbett and Ross <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1980</xref>, p. 45)&#x02014;has more influence on viewer responses than less vivid information (Zillmann and Brosius <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2000</xref>). As the 2011 tsunami in Japan was less vivid for the Dutch preadolescents in our study, future research could investigate whether more vivid news would have a stronger effect on preadolescents&#x02019; reactions. Moreover, it would be relevant to investigate responses to other topics than natural disasters, because there might be a difference in the possibilities to frame negative events in a more constructive way and in the extent to which such stories can affect particularly prosocial intentions. For example, crime news can inform the audience about recent incidents in which people got injured or killed by an act of an individual. It might be harder to present solutions in such stories, and it may also be difficult to act in a prosocial manner as a response to this news. This supports the necessity to investigate whether and how constructive elements can be included in other negative topics beyond natural disasters and to investigate how this may inspire prosociality.</p><p id="Par48">Second, studies that test how elements from positive psychology in news stories affect (young) audiences are scarce. In particular, this has led to limitations in conceptualizing constructive news reporting. Because the domain of constructive journalism is quite new, the conceptualization of constructive news reporting is still in its infancy. More research is needed to examine potential underlying processes to explain why and how constructive news reporting influences peoples&#x02019; emotional reaction to news. Moreover, it is worth exploring whether there are other elements from positive psychology than solution-based reporting and positive emotions only that are able to reduce negative responses to news and to promote prosocial intentions. Gaining more insight and developing a more detailed conceptualization of constructive journalism may support the promising effects of introducing positive psychology to news.</p><p id="Par49">Third, the influence of peer discussion has been studied in a rather exploratory manner in the current study. Due to the design of the study, we cannot rule out that the effects are at least partly explained by time. To be more specific, the preadolescents in the peer discussion condition answered the final questions (follow up measure) about 10&#x02009;min later than preadolescents who did not participate in a discussion (post-exposure measure). It might be that the longer time frame between exposure to the news and the final questionnaire affected their emotions and intentions. However, because of the differences that were found between constructive and nonconstructive news, it is unlikely that this time difference explains all differences between the peer discussion and no peer discussion group. Thus, the first results regarding peer discussion are promising, but future research should focus on examining this phenomenon more closely.</p><p id="Par50">Fourth, the sample of classes and schools was too small to control whether these factors may have influenced the results. Consequently, we do not know whether class or school factors (e.g., attention for news, classroom culture) may have played a role here. Future research should, therefore, include more classes from a larger number of schools to enable multilevel analysis procedures.</p><p id="Par51">Our last remark concerns the influence of constructive journalism on memory. Although the basic information in the constructive vs. the nonconstructive newscast was comparable, we did not investigate whether preadolescents actually remembered the most important information to the same extent. As it is journalists&#x02019; primary goal to inform citizens about events in society (c.f., McIntyre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>), it would be of great value to investigate memory after having watched either constructive or nonconstructive news, in order to test whether a constructive style of reporting still adhere to the informative function of news.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par52">The findings of the current study revealed that both constructive news reporting and peer discussion could function as tools to make news less harmful for preadolescents. Furthermore, because constructive news is able to enhance positive emotions and to decrease negative emotions in preadolescents, the number of preadolescents suffering from anxiety-related problems, such as nightmares after having watched negative news, could be reduced. We therefore argue that news programs aiming at preadolescents, which are broadcast in several countries across the world (c.f., Alon-Tirosh and Lemish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014</xref>), should consider using elements from positive psychology more often. Moreover, researchers should expand the emerging field of research on constructive news. The study results might also contribute to educational practice. As some beneficial effects of peer discussion were found, schoolteachers could be advised to facilitate peer discussion of frightening topics in the news after their pupils have watched it. The results of the current study could also stimulate parents to let their children watch the news together with peers (e.g., friends or siblings of comparable ages) and to motivate that they talk about it. In all, by combining constructive elements in newscasts and a following peer discussion, preadolescents&#x02019; negative emotions may be reduced and prosocial intentions may be increased. This may encourage the well-being of preadolescents, people in their close environment, and ultimately society.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p id="Par25">For exploratory purposes, we also measured enjoyment (post-exposure and follow up) by asking preadolescents to indicate on a 4-point scale (ranging from 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;<italic>totally disagree</italic> to 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;<italic>totally disagree</italic>) how exciting, delightful, boring, stupid, enjoyable, and dull they experienced the news program. Principal component analyses indicated that only the items &#x0201c;delightful&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;enjoyable&#x0201d; together formed a discernible dimension. Analyses with these two items showed that there were no differences in enjoyment after watching either constructive or nonconstructive news. Moreover, peer discussion did not affect enjoyment. Since this investigation was exploratory, and because of limitations in the measurement of enjoyment, we decided to exclude &#x0201c;enjoyment&#x0201d; as dependent variable in the study.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors want to thank Prof. Dr. Moniek Buijzen and Dr. Rebecca de Leeuw for their valuable feedback that greatly improved the manuscript.
