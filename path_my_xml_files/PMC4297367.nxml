Using data from a pre-exposure trial &#x02013; FEM-PrEP &#x02013;, we determined the cumulative probabilities of grade 1+ ALT, AST and creatinine and grade 2+ phosphorus toxicities; ALT/AST toxicities by baseline hepatitis B status; and change in mean creatinine, phosphorus, ALT and AST levels controlling for TDF-FTC adherence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and findings</title><p>FEM-PrEP was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial of daily TDF-FTC among women in Africa. Enrolled women were in general good health, HIV antibody negative, 18 to 35 years old, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and had normal hepatic and renal function at baseline. AST, ALT, phosphorus and serum creatinine were measured regularly throughout the trial. TDF-FTC concentrations were measured to assess adherence to TDF-FTC. The cumulative probabilities of grade 1+ creatininemia and grade 2+ phosphatemia toxicities were not statistically different between TDF-FTC and placebo arms. The cumulative probabilities of grade 1+ ALT and AST toxicities were higher among participants in the TDF-FTC arm than in the placebo arm (p = 0.03 for both). The proportions of grade 1+ and grade 2+ ALT or AST toxicities were significantly higher in participants who were hepatitis B virus surface antibody (HBsAb) positive than in those who were HBsAb-negative. Women with good adherence had higher mean change from baseline to week 4 in their AST levels (2.90 (0.37, 5.42); p = 0.025) than women with less than good adherence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We did not observe a significant relationship between randomization to TDF-FTC and creatinine or phosphorus toxicities. Women randomized to TDF-FTC had higher rates of mild to moderate ALT/AST toxicities, especially women with prior hepatitis B virus exposure. We also observed a significant increase in AST from baseline to week 4 among women who had higher adherence to TDF-FTC during that interval.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial register</title><p>#<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00625404?term=NCT00625404&#x00026;rank=1">NCT00625404</ext-link>, February 19, 2008.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pre-exposure prophylaxis</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>Safety</kwd><kwd>Women</kwd><kwd>Africa</kwd><kwd>Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</kwd><kwd>Emtricitabine</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Decades into HIV prevention research, there is strong evidence that the use of antiretrovirals (ARV) as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) significantly reduces the risk of acquiring HIV infection in men and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

Details of the verification process will be described in a separate manuscript. Locally verified ranges were used for final grading of all biochemistry toxicities in Kenya and South Africa. In Tanzania, due to the delay in study initiation and early closure of the trial, local LNR were not verified; manufacturer LNRs were used instead.</p><p>The central laboratory provided on-site training in good clinical laboratory practice and technical training for all protocol-required laboratory tests, and conducted quality assurance activities including co-development of site standard operating procedures (SOPs) and analytical plans, assay and equipment validation, external quality assessment (EQA) schemes, and equipment calibration and maintenance. In addition, central lab staff conducted, at a minimum, annual site visits to verify proper conduct of laboratory procedures and review source data.</p><p>TDF-FTC concentration analysis on stored samples was conducted at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

However, the percentage of women with evidence of good adherence in their first four weeks of participation (~40%) was sufficient to assess the impact of short-term drug use. We observed that women with evidence of good adherence had higher mean change from baseline to week 4 in their AST levels (2.90 (0.37, 5.42); p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.025) as compared to women with less than good adherence. However, corresponding changes in ALT (1.54 (-1.44, 4.52); p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.31), creatinine (0.19 (-2.60, 2.98); p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.89) and phosphorus (0.02 (-0.04, 0.08); p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.53) were not statistically significant. We did not observe an association between adherence to TDF-FTC and change in ALT, AST, creatinine or phosphorus levels between the final drug-use interval and four weeks after product withdrawal.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this article we report on change (grade 1+) in renal and hepatic function among African women who were assigned to the active TDF-FTC arm of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. While we did not find significant differences in renal functions, we observed a significant increase in the cumulative probabilities of grade 1+ hepatotoxicity, as measured by ALT and AST, among women assigned TDF-FTC.</p><p>Our safety findings are comparable to other PrEP studies which also did not observe more frequent renal toxicity in the active arm than in the placebo one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>With regard to hepatic toxicity, we observed more frequent elevated ALT or AST in participants with previous exposure to hepatitis B virus; which is consistent with the finding in the Bondo site of significantly more grade 2+ AST toxicities and higher population exposure to hepatitis B virus (39% in Bondo vs. 13%, 10% and 32%, in Bloemfontein, Pretoria, and Arusha, respectively). Additional observations are needed to confirm this preliminary finding, particularly in settings where hepatitis B virus prevalence is high and TDF-FTC will be considered for PrEP. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a possible explanation of our findings. DILI has been described in patients with pre-existing hepatic illness like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatitis C virus related chronic hepatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Our study was not designed to verify association between our observations and any of these specific pre-existing conditions.</p><p>None of the laboratory toxicities observed was accompanied by specific renal or hepatic clinical symptoms. The lack of clinical symptoms is likely due to the relatively moderate level of the toxicities observed, frequent testing and subsequent interruption or withdrawal of the study product.</p><p>Although these data indicate that the use of TDF-FTC as PrEP is safe with regard to kidney and hepatic toxicity, the results must be considered in light of overall low adherence to study product. Further, our study used the serum creatinine level and the Cockcroft-Gault formula to assess glomerular filtration and phosphatemia to assess proximal tubular function. Some studies have suggested that more sophisticated formulas &#x02013; e.g. <italic>four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula</italic> (MRDR equation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] &#x02013; and multifactor algorithms are more accurate in assessing glomerular filtration and proximal tubular function. In a study comparing tenofovir-containing to tenofovir-sparing HAART in patients living with HIV, Horberg et al., using the MDRD equation, found that the tenofovir-exposed group had a statistically greater percentage of patients with glomerular filtration decline but not creatininemia rising to greater than 2.0&#x000a0;mg/dL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. HIV/AIDS patients treated with ARVs can develop kidney and/or liver toxicity for many other reasons than the use of TDF-FTC: HIV infection itself, other ARVs or any other medication to manage their HIV/AIDS condition. In our study, participants were HIV uninfected and healthy at baseline and took limited concomitant medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Our analysis and conclusions are also limited by short overall TDF-FTC exposure (i.e., follow-up was&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;= 52&#x000a0;weeks); studies and expert opinions suggest that kidney toxicities may increase over time with prolonged exposure to TDF-FTC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The main limitation of our study is the limited adherence of participants to the study drug; only about 40% exhibited good adherence during any given test interval, and far fewer exhibited consistently good adherence over the course of their participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Nonetheless, in the TDF-FTC arm we observed higher cumulative probabilities of grade 1+ of ALT/AST and a higher proportion of participants with grade 2+ ALT/AST when previously exposed to HBV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In our study population of healthy young African women, we did not observe a significant relationship between randomization to TDF-FTC and creatinine or phosphorus toxicities although we were limited in our ability to adequately assess these relationships due to overall low adherence to the study product. Women randomized to TDF-FTC had higher rates of mild to moderate ALT/AST toxicities, especially women with prior hepatitis B virus exposure. We also observed a significant increase from baseline to week four in AST values among women who were highly adherent to TDF-FTC during that interval.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>JM contributed to acquisition, analysis and interpretation of data as well as to drafting the manuscript; KN contributed to acquisition and interpretation of data as well as to revising the manuscript; MW contributed to data analysis and revised the manuscript; IdB contributed to laboratory analysis and revised the manuscript; JD contributed to data interpretation and revised the manuscript; JL, FO, MO and RM contributed data acquisition and revised the manuscript; DT contributed data analysis and interpretation as well as to revising the manuscript; LvD conceived the study, contributed to acquisition, analysis and interpretation of data as well as to revising the manuscript.
