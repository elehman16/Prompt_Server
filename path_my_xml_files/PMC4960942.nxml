Patients were excluded if they had a history of relevant drug allergy, inability to use PCA device, contraindication to epidural anesthesia, history of psychiatric illness or substance abuse, and were receiving medical therapies considered to result in tolerance to opiates.</p><p>The study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital after approval of the Institutional Ethics Committee. After fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria, the women were recruited a day prior to the surgery. The women were explained regarding the use of PCA pump (Master PCA pump, Fresenius Kabi Company, Bad Homburg, Germany), visual analog scale (VAS), nausea, and sedation scales a day prior to surgery and on the morning of surgery. The patients had the right to opt out of the study during any stage of the study if they wish to which would not have any influence on their management during the perioperative period and would continue to receive the standard anesthesia care.</p><p>The patients had nothing by mouth overnight and premedicated with alprazolam 0.25 mg and ranitidine 150 mg orally the night before and 2 h prior to surgery. In the operating room, an intravenous (IV) access was secured and 500&#x02013;1000 ml of 0.9% saline was infused. Standard monitoring including electrocardiogram, noninvasive arterial blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring were started. A resident not involved in the study opened the opaque sealed envelope and women were allocated to either of the two groups according to the computer-generated random number.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Anesthesia technique</title><p>In the epidural group, an epidural catheter was placed at L<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;L<sub>3</sub> interspace and 10&#x02013;15 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine was administered to ensure a sensory block up to T<sub>8</sub> dermatome by 30 min, failing which an additional 5 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine was injected.</p><p>In the TAP group, TAP block was performed under ultrasound guidance with a high-frequency (5&#x02013;10 MHz) probe (Sonosite, Inc., Bothell. WA 98021, USA) and an in-plane technique using 23 gauge spinal needle after the institution of GA. Following the placement of the needle, 1.5 mg/kg of 0.75% ropivacaine (maximum dose of 150 mg on each side) was injected between internal oblique and the transversus abdominis muscle. The same procedure was repeated on the other side, and a single investigator performed blocks in all the patients.</p><p>This was followed with the standard anesthetic protocol including IV morphine 0.1 mg/kg, thiopentone sodium 5&#x02013;7 mg/kg, vecuronium bromide 0.1 mg/kg, and tracheal was intubated. Maintenance of anesthesia was provided with N<sub>2</sub>O in 40% oxygen, isoflurane, and vecuronium. IV tramadol 1 mg/kg and ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg were administered 20 min prior to the completion of surgery. Neuromuscular blockade was reversed and the patient was extubated. Following surgery, the patients in both the groups were shifted to Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). Irrespective of the group allocation, patients received PCA tramadol analgesia (bolus 2 ml, tramadol 10 mg/ml, 5 min lockout time) with the upper safe limit of 400 mg tramadol consumption in 24 h.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In the epidural group, continuous epidural infusion 0.2% ropivacaine at 10 ml/h was started in the postoperative period.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Patients were monitored for tramadol consumption, VAS at rest and on coughing, hemodynamics, and any other adverse effects by a nurse in PACU at 0 h, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h.

Epidural analgesia treats both somatic (abdominal wall wound) and visceral (uterus) components of pain, whereas the TAP block covers pain derived from the abdominal wall only.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In a previous study,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] comparison of tramadol, tramadol-metamizol, and tramadol-lornoxicam administered by IV PCA in the management of postoperative pain relief after lower abdominal surgeries resulted in a 24 h tramadol consumption of 267 (91.4) mg which was much higher[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] as compared to the present study. TAP for postoperative pain has been used in cesarean section patients, but the results cannot be compared with women undergoing TAH due to different nociceptive inputs of the two surgeries.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Rao Kadam <italic>et al</italic>. compared epidural versus continuous TAP catheter technique for postoperative analgesia after abdominal surgery but did not find any differences in pain scores.

This could be explained as an analgesic effect of TAP block starts to decrease at 6 h;[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] however, studies have reported an effective postoperative analgesia following a single shot TAP block for up to 24&#x02013;36 h.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] We used GA in the present study instead of spinal anesthesia,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] which possibly prolongs the effect of TAP block. The benefits of single shot TAP block could be of advantage in situations where epidural analgesia is contraindicated or not desired.
