By 2033, older adults are projected to represent 20% of the U.S. population, and this will be the first time in history when older adults outnumber persons younger than age 18 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. By 2040, nearly half of older adults are expected to come from non-white racial/ethnic backgrounds <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Minority older adults are at high risk for poor health outcomes <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Socioeconomic disparities also disproportionately affect non-white older adults. In 2014, 19% of African Americans, 18% of Latinos, and 15% of Asians age 65 and over lived in poverty, more than twice the rate for older non-Latino whites (8%) <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Our current health and social systems are not well prepared for these dramatic changes in demographics. Novel and cost-effective approaches are needed to keep this increasingly diverse older adult population active and engaged. This can include development of interventions delivered in local community settings that promote their health and well-being.</p><p id="p0015">The challenge is to design and evaluate health promotion interventions that are appealing and appropriate for this increasingly diverse older adult population. Engagement in the arts (e.g., singing, acting, dancing) is a promising approach to help keep older adults active and engaged in meaningful ways and that can be culturally tailored. Two reviews found that that participating in the arts may have multiple, positive health benefits for older adults <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The studies reviewed document how engaging in the arts may address critical challenges in aging, such as improving quality of life and cognition and reducing loneliness and falls. In addition, arts interventions are relatively low cost to deliver in community settings and can be culturally tailored to take into account the background of participants. Most arts interventions, such as choir singing, involve multiple engagement components (e.g., social, physical, cognitive). There is evidence that such multi-modal interventions are particularly effective for promoting health <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p id="p0020">To evaluate the effectiveness of such novel interventions for older adults requires the ability to recruit diverse minority and lower-socioeconomic status (SES) older adults into research studies. Recruitment of minority and low-SES older adults has been a persistent challenge, and they continue to be underrepresented in health research <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods are increasingly being used to help design culturally relevant studies and recruit and enroll persons from underserved populations <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. CBPR approaches have been found to help recruit and retain diverse participants in research <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Recruitment of minority individuals into clinical trials using CBPR are typically more successful than studies that do not <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p id="p0025">The Community of Voices study used CBPR methods to recruit older adults from a broad spectrum of racial/ethnic and SES backgrounds into a cluster-randomized controlled trial designed to examine the effects of a community choir program on cognitive, physical, and psychosocial outcomes <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

Briefly, 12 senior centers were randomly assigned to either begin the Community of Voices choir intervention immediately or wait six months. Outcome measures were collected at baseline (prior to starting the intervention), 6 months (end of randomization phase), and 12 months (one year after enrollment). The choir intervention was culturally tailored for each senior center based on the ethnic/racial backgrounds and singing experiences of their clientele. It was designed to promote health and well-being by focusing on three hypothesized engagement components (i.e., physical, cognitive, and psychosocial). Participants in the study attended weekly, 90-min choir sessions (44 weeks) led by professional music directors at senior centers. The trial is registered at U.S. National Institutes of Health (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="intref0010">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>): #<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT01869179" id="intref0015">NCT01869179</ext-link> (registered 9 January 2013).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Study screening and recruitment</title><p id="p0035">The outreach and recruitment approach was developed and implemented in collaboration with the local Administration on Aging (AoA) and a network of AoA-supported community centers (Department of Aging and Adult Services or DAAS of San Francisco County). DAAS supports a large network of senior centers throughout San Francisco and serves older adults from diverse racial/ethnic and SES backgrounds. We recruited adults aged 60 and older from each of the 12 senior centers. The sampling frame included persons already attending each senior center and those within each of the senior center's geographic service area. Similar to our previous work recruiting ethnically diverse, lower-SES adults <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, we used multiple methods (e.g., flyers, presentations, word-of-mouth, and radio) shared with the senior centers and local community organizations, utilized a research team that reflected the diversity of the community (including bilingual and bicultural research associates), and completed all recruitment and screening assessment procedures in the ecommunity at each of the senior centers. The research team spent three months (2&#x02013;3 days per week) on-site at each senior center to answer questions about the study and complete the screening and enrollment process. The research team passed out flyers and answered questions during events at the senior centers (e.g., food tabling, ongoing classes) and shared information with organizations (e.g., senior housing, libraries) in the geographic service area of each senior center. The study protocol, consent forms, and outcome measures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of California, San Francisco.</p><p id="p0040">Through these outreach methods, interested individuals were invited to attend an informational meeting about the study at the senior centers or to provide their name and phone number to be called by a staff person to discuss the study over the phone. The choir intervention content, duration, study procedures, risks, and randomization procedures were explained in English or Spanish, and questions were answered. For those who attended an informational meeting and expressed interest in the study, a screening assessment was done in person. For those reached by phone, screening began on the phone using the identical screening script used for the in-person screening assessments except that the cognitive screen was done in-person during the start of the baseline assessment because it required responses on paper.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p id="p0045">Inclusion criteria were aged 60 and over, self-report (confirmed by research associates) of adequate visual and hearing acuity (with assistive devices), and English or Spanish fluency sufficient to complete study assessments (self-reported fluency in either language) including bilingual and monolingual Spanish speakers. Exclusion criteria included having a self-reported diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer's disease or significant cognitive impairment (score of 0 or 1 on the Mini-Cog) <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>; having a serious medical or mental health condition that would limit participation in the study; and planning to move out of the area within 12 months. Persons who were already regularly singing in a choir (e.g., weekly) during the past six months were also excluded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Demographic and health status variables</title><p id="p0050">For individuals who began the screening interview, we collected five demographic variables: age, sex (male/female), language of screening interview (Spanish/English), ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino or not Hispanic/Latino) and race (American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, black/African American, Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander, white, and other).</p><p id="p0055">All participants signed and were given a copy of the consent form along with a copy of the Bill of Rights for Research Participants before beginning the study. During the baseline assessment and after written consent was obtained, we collected additional demographic variables, including educational level, marital status (four categories), and nativity (yes/no born in a foreign country). Financial hardship was assessed by asking about problems paying for food, monthly bills, medical visits, or prescribed medications in the past 12 months. Hardship was indicated by endorsing difficulty paying for one or more of the items.</p><p id="p0060">Regarding music background, we asked whether they previously sang in a choir as an adult (yes/no). We also asked participants to rate their overall music ability (poor, fair, good, very good, or excellent) and whether or not they could read music notation (yes/no). Music background was not considered for inclusion in the study, and our goal was to enroll participants with a range of musical abilities.</p><p id="p0065">Self-rated health was assessed using a standard scale (five categories ranging from excellent to poor) and asking whether a doctor or other health professional had told them they had any of 11 different chronic conditions, adapted from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Chronic conditions were categorized into seven physical health conditions (diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, stroke, cancer, arthritis, and emphysema/bronchitis/asthma) and one mental health category representing depression or anxiety. A total count of chronic physical health conditions ranged from 0 to 7. We also asked about health insurance (none, public only, or any private). Sleep quality was assessed using a single question about overall sleep quality in the past month (four categories ranging from very good to very bad) <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p id="p0070">Three yes/no questions assessed shortness of breath <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Based on the published scoring algorithm, scores ranged from 3 to 6 with higher scores indicating more shortness of breath. To assess voice quality, seven questions were selected from the Voice Handicap Index-10 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>; we excluded three questions pertaining to voice problems. Participants rated the frequency of specific experiences with their voice on a five-point scale (1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;never to 5&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;always). All item stems were framed negatively (e.g., my voice makes it difficult for people to hear me); therefore, we reversed the score so that a higher score indicates better voice quality. The seven-item scale had an internal consistency reliability of .87. These two surveys, in addition to sleep quality, were administered at baseline and follow-up assessments.</p><p id="p0075">Our primary and secondary outcome measures, including the rationale and item descriptions, are described in detail elsewhere <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

The TMT has two conditions: Part A (connecting 25 numbers in order as quickly as possible) and Part B (connecting 25 numbers and letters, alternating in order as quickly as possible). We limited the time to complete each part to 180&#x000a0;s to reduce testing burden (instead of the traditional 300&#x000a0;s time limit) <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Our final measure is the time (seconds) to complete TMT-B minus the time to complete TMT-A, which is an index of executive function that isolates the executive control component of the TMT <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>; higher scores indicate better executive function. For descriptive purposes, we also report the time in seconds to complete parts A and B and the number of correct lines per minute on the TMB-B to take into account participants who were unable to complete TMT-B in the maximum time <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5.2"><label>2.5.2</label><title>Physical function</title><p id="p0090">The primary physical outcome was a timed test of repeated chair stands, one of several tests on the, a performance-based measure of lower body strength from the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. We recorded the time in seconds to complete five chair stands with a maximum time allowed of 60&#x000a0;s. The possible range is 0&#x02013;60&#x000a0;s, and higher scores indicate worse functioning (slower performance).

Raw scores were used as our primary outcome. The possible range was 0&#x02013;24, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms. The internal-consistency reliability for the entire sample was 0.77. There were some differences by language of interview: Cronbach's alpha was 0.74 for the English speakers and 0.84 for the Spanish speakers.

We selected the Toolbox Computed Score which has a possible range of 0&#x02013;10 with higher scores indicating better function.</p><p id="p0110">We used a modified version of the NIH Toolbox Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test as a measure of episodic memory. Fifteen words were presented orally (via computer) over three consecutive trials. After each trial, participants were asked to recall as many words as possible. The learning variable is the sum of correct words for all three trials (possible range 0&#x02013;45, higher scores indicate better recall). We adapted this test to include two additional components. After completing the three trials, participants listened to 15 new words (distractor list) and asked to recall as many as possible of that list (possible range 0&#x02013;15, higher scores indicate better recall). Immediately after recall of the distractor list, participants were asked to recall as many of the original 15 words as possible (short-term recall, possible score 0&#x02013;15). The distractor and delayed recall conditions modifications were suggested by Dan Mungas (personal communication) to include a short delay condition. For this test, the words are different for the Spanish and English tests; thus scores are reported separately by language in addition to the total sample. The secondary outcome variable of interest is the delayed recall trial (after the distractor list).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6.2"><label>2.6.2</label><title>Physical function</title><p id="p0115">We used the NIH Toolbox Balance Accelerometry Measure that assesses static standing balance <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Participants assume and maintain five poses. Four involve standing with their feet side-by-side (together) with four variations: 1) eyes open on solid surface, 2) eyes closed on solid surface, 3) eyes open on foam surface, and 4) eyes closed on foam surface. Pose 5 is to stand tandem (one foot aligned in front of the other) on a solid surface with eyes open. Participants were asked to hold each position for 50&#x000a0;s; postural sway is recorded for each pose using an accelerometer worn by the participant. Scoring of each position, based on accelerometer data transmitted to the Assessment Center via computer, involves their ability to hold the position for the time specified and the postural sway. A belt with the accelerometer was placed on the hips <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. We planned to use the two scores recommended by the Assessment Center (personal communication): 1) ratio of the score for pose 2 divided by the score for pose 1 (ratio 2/1), which reflects the ability to use input from somatosensory and vestibular systems to maintain balance, and 2) ratio of the score for pose 4 divided by pose 1 (ratio 4/1), which reflects the relative reduction in postural stability when visual and somatosensory inputs are simultaneously disrupted (typically representative of the effectiveness of vestibular function for postural control).</p><p id="p0120">To assess gait speed, we used the NIH Toolbox performance measure of gait speed which is a measure of &#x0201c;walking pace&#x0201d; (time to walk 4&#x000a0;m at their usual pace) <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.

There was an item pool of 22 items that pertained to feeling worthless, helpless, sad, depressed, unhappy, hopeless, had nothing to look forward to, and felt like a failure. Higher scores indicate more sadness.</p><p id="p0135">NIH Toolbox Positive Affect, a CAT measure, assesses the frequency in the past seven days the person experienced positive affect. An item pool of 44 items pertained to feeling cheerful, attentive, delighted, happy, joyful, enthusiastic, interested, peaceful, good natured, useful, understood, content, and liked oneself. Higher scores indicate more positive affect.</p><p id="p0140">NIH Toolbox Fear/Affect is a seven-item short-form measure assessing the frequency in the past seven days the individual felt fearful, anxious, worried, nervous, uneasy, tense, and found it hard to focus. Higher scores indicate more fear/affect. In our own analyses of the seven items, the internal-consistency reliability was 0.91 and was the same for the English and Spanish speakers.</p><p id="p0145">NIH Toolbox Apathy is a six-item short-form measure. Although it is labeled &#x0201c;apathy,&#x0201d; all items pertain to interest in life. Items ask the frequency in the past month the person felt interested in things, got things done, saw a job through, got things started on one's own, did interesting things, and was motivated. In our own analyses of the six items, the internal-consistency reliability was 0.76; it was .78 for the English speakers and .69 for the Spanish speakers. According to the Assessment Center, this score was reversed such that higher scores indicate less apathy (or more interest in things).</p><p id="p0150">NIH Toolbox Loneliness, a five-item short-form measure, assesses the frequency in the past month the person felt alone, apart from others, left out, lonely, and no longer felt close to anyone. Higher scores indicate more loneliness. In our own analyses of the five items, the internal-consistency reliability was 0.88; it was the same for the English and Spanish speakers.</p><p id="p0155">NIH Toolbox Self-Efficacy is a 10-item short-form measure that assesses one's confidence in handling problems. Items pertain to the extent to which the person (e.g., can solve problems, can accomplish goals, feels confident he/she can handle unexpected events, can think of solutions to troubles, and can handle whatever comes his/her way). Higher scores indicate more self-efficacy. In our own analyses the scale had an internal-consistency reliability of 0.88 which was the same in the English and Spanish samples.</p><p id="p0160">Social support.

Three items each were chosen from the Positive Social Interaction Scale and the Emotional/Informational Support scale. Items assessed the extent to which participants had someone to: have a good time with, get together with for relaxation, do something fun with, listen when you need to talk, give you advice if needed, and who understands your problems. Items asked how much of the time each of the kinds of support was available if needed (1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;none of the time, 5&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;all of the time). We averaged all items to create a scale ranging from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating more social support. The scale had an internal-consistency reliability of 0.90 which was similar in English and Spanish samples (0.90 and 0.88 respectively).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Screening and recruitment</title><p id="p0165">The study recruitment period was from February 2012 to August 2015.

A wide range of education was found, with 14% having less than a high school education and 19% having a master's degree or more. Forty-one percent of the sample was foreign born, and 12% of the baseline assessments were completed in Spanish. Financial hardship was reported by 20% of participants. A large number (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;160, 41%) reported having only public or no health insurance. The mean Mini-Cog score was also above the mid-point (4.3 out of 5 points).

Recruitment goals in terms of inclusion of minority individuals and those with low SES were met. The study reached 819 individuals, screened 636, and enrolled 390 older adults. Thus, over half of those screened were enrolled over the 42-month, phased recruitment period. Only 10% of those screened were deemed ineligible, reflecting the study goal of being as inclusive as possible in terms of health status. Importantly, the study met the goal of recruiting minority older adults with 65% of the sample being represented by non-white individuals, which is similar to the proportion of non-whites in San Francisco County and much higher than the national average <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Diversity was also reflected in the range of socioeconomic and educational backgrounds, and almost half of the participants were foreign born. These outreach and recruitment goals were achieved through a successful collaboration with a local area agency on aging and by using CBPR methods tailored for diverse communities <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p id="p0275">Because older adults, and in particular minority older adults, are underrepresented in clinical trials, research studies should consider being as inclusive as possible in terms of eligibility criteria. Increasingly, behavioral interventions, such as physical activity and volunteering, offer promise to promote health and well-being on a community level. However, the potential benefit from these types of interventions is left largely unrealized due to low participation rates of older adults from diverse backgrounds. Because interventions involving the arts may be particularly appealing to diverse older adults, recruitment strategies should facilitate their enrollment. Barriers to participation of minority older adults in research include narrow study eligibility criteria, language, transportation, multiple comorbidities, and lower health literacy rates <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Partnering with community-based organizations may help mitigate these barriers and help academic researchers design recruitment strategies that work best with minority and underserved populations <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p id="p0280">The current study is one of the first to enroll a large sample of minority older adults into a trial using participation in the arts (i.e., community choir) to enhance cognitive, physical, and psychosocial engagement, which is hypothesized to promote health and well-being. Cohen and colleagues were the first to complete a large, non-randomized study of a community choir intervention for older adults, compared to a usual activity comparison group <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, but 93% of the participants were white. Coulter and colleagues recently completed a randomized trial of a 14-week choir intervention for older adults <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, but 98% of their participants were also white. These studies are important given the lack of prior studies focused on the arts and aging. However, arts-based studies may be particularly relevant to some underrepresented groups and may be a promising avenue for engaging them in research and, ultimately if efficacious, maintaining their health.</p><p id="p0285">There are several limitations to the current study. The study was one of the early adopters of the NIH Toolbox in both Spanish and English. As noted, we encountered some technical challenges in collecting data at community center sites. Missing data occurred because of internet connectivity issues at the senior center community sites and for the NIH Toolbox Balance measure, transmission errors between the accelerometer and the computer accessing the Assessment Center. Internet connectivity issues affected a few of the tests. The use of legacy measures as primary outcomes was a good decision, as there were no missing data on the primary outcomes. Advantages of using the NIH Toolbox included more efficient administration of the tasks because of CAT and IRT methods and reduced time for data entry.</p><p id="p0290">In conclusion, the outreach and recruitment methods used in the Community of Voices trial facilitated the recruitment and enrollment of a large sample of diverse racial/ethnic and lower-SES older adults, a population that remains underrepresented in health research. The strategies used included multiple outreach methods, successful collaboration with a local area agency on aging, by using CBPR methods tailored for diverse communities (e.g., broad eligibility criteria, community-based recruitment and assessments in both English and Spanish), and the development of a culturally relevant intervention delivered in the community. Similar recruitment approaches could be used as a model for future studies to help increase enrollment of diverse older adults into research.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>U.S. Census Bureau</surname></name></person-group><chapter-title>Profile America Facts for Features</chapter-title><year>2016</year><publisher-name>U.S. Census Bureau</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Washington, D.C.</publisher-loc></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vincent</surname><given-names>G.K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Velkoff</surname><given-names>V.A.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>The Next Four Decades.
