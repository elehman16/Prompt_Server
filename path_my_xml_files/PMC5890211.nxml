lead to temporomandibular disorder (TMD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate
muscle activity in individuals with a diagnosis of TMD before and after treatment with
low-level laser therapy (LLLT) through the use of electromyography (EMG). [Subjects and
Methods] Male and female individuals aged 14 to 23&#x02005;years were evaluated. TMD was
determined by a clinical examination and the administration of the Research Diagnostic
Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders, followed by the evaluation of sensitivity to
palpation of the masseter and anterior temporal muscles as well as the EMG determination
of muscle activity. The participants were randomly allocated to an active LLLT group (n=9)
and sham group (n=7). Twelve sessions of LLLT were conducted using a wavelength of 780&#x02005;nm,
energy density of 25&#x02005;J/cm<sup>2</sup>, power of 50&#x02005;mW, power density of
1.25&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup> and a 20-second exposure time or sham LLLT. Muscle activity was
determined prior to treatment and after the last session. [Results] During the isometric
evaluation of the masseter and anterior temporal muscles, an increase in the mean EMG
signal was found in the group submitted to active LLLT. When evaluated individually, some
participants in the active LLLT group demonstrated a reduction in muscle activity, but no
significant differences were found in the mean EMG signal between the initial and final
evaluations. [Conclusion] Further studies with a larger sample size are needed to confirm
the present findings.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Electromyography</kwd><kwd>Temporomandibular joint disorder</kwd><kwd>Low-level laser therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a set of clinical signs and symptoms that affect the
masticatory muscles, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and associated structures, such as muscle
sensitivity, pain in one or both TMJs, limited mandibular movements, joint sounds and
headache as well as possible neck pain, vertigo, earache and ringing in the ears. Different
clinical conditions can cause TMD, which may also be associated with psychological
factors<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Due to the multifactor etiology of TMD, techniques have been proposed for the treatment of
signs and symptoms of this disorder, such as bite plate usage, acupuncture, kinesiotherapy,
exercises, manual therapy, massage therapy, postural training, psychotherapy, joint
mobilization, medicinal therapy and laser therapy<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Low-level laser therapy
(LLLT) is a noninvasive, non-pharmacological form of treatment that, according to numerous
studies, has demonstrated beneficial results regarding the treatment of pain stemming from
TMD. Radiance in LLLT is situated between the visible and infrared portions of the
electromagnetic wave spectrum, which have the characteristics of monochromaticity, coherence
and unidirectionality<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The therapeutic effects of LLLT are reported to be modulation of
the inflammatory process and analgesia related to an increase in the production of
&#x003b2;-endorphins, reductions in the secretion of histamine and acetylcholine, a reduction in the
synthesis of bradykinin and an increase in the production of adenosine triphosphate, which
can result in muscle relaxation and an increase in local blood micro-circulation, thereby
accelerating the removal of catabolites from tissues<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Electromyography (EMG) allows the evaluation of muscle function and dysfunction at rest as
well as during occlusion and the chewing process, which helps in the diagnosis and knowledge
of muscle physiology as well as the differential diagnosis and monitoring of TMD during
prescribed therapies<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The aim of the present study was to evaluate muscle
activity in young individuals with a diagnosis of TMD before and after treatment with LLLT
using EMG as the examination technique.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the regulatory norms for research involving
human subjects, was submitted to the Research Ethics Committee of the Universidade Nove de
Julho (process number 40455) and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (n<sup>o</sup>
NCT0184600). All the volunteers/guardians signed a statement of informed consent agreeing to
participate in the study.</p><p>Male and female adolescents and young adults were recruited from the clinics of the
undergraduate and graduate programs of Nove de Julho University (Vergueiro Campus, S&#x000e3;o
Paulo, SP, Brazil). All individuals within the target age range were asked to participate in
an initial evaluation for TMD. The convenience sample was based on the fact that the present
investigation is a preliminary study.</p><p>Individuals aged 14 to 23&#x02005;years with a diagnosis of TMD and a signed statement of informed
consent were included. Individuals with dentofacial anomalies, incomplete permanent
dentition through to the second molars, undergoing orthodontic or orthopedic treatment of
the jaws, undergoing psychological treatment and/or physical therapy using muscle relaxants,
anti-inflammatory agents or bite plates were excluded from the study.</p><p>Sealed, opaque envelopes were used for the random allocation of the volunteers to the
different groups. Prior to the initial evaluation, each volunteer opened an envelope with a
card stipulating to which group he/she would be allocated, but was not allowed to see the
card in order to ensure the blinding of the participants. All individuals were submitted to
an initial EMG evaluation and a second EMG evaluation after the last treatment session.</p><p>The Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC-TMD) were used for
the diagnosis of TMD in eligible volunteers prior to any intervention. A specific clinical
examination was also performed by a single examiner who had undergone training exercises.
The clinical examination consisted of palpation of the trapezius, sternocleidomastoid,
temporal, masseter, digastric and medial pterygoid muscles as well as palpation of the TMJs.
An analysis of mandibular movements was also performed by the same examiner with the aid of
digital calipers to measure vertical and horizontal movements and a stethoscope for the
determination of joint sounds. Frequent headaches, facial pain, fatigue and difficulty
during chewing, bruxism, psychological aspects and parafunctional habits were also
investigated.</p><p>The EMG signals were determined using a four-channel acquisition system (EMGLab, EMG System
do Brasil Ltda, SJC, Brazil) composed of a signal conditioning module, electrodes, an analog
band pass filter (20 to 500&#x02005;Hz) and a common rejection mode ratio of 120 dB. The sampling
frequency was 2 kHz and the signal was digitized using an analog-digital converter with 16
bits of resolution. Active bipolar electrodes with 20-fold pre-amplification were used to
capture the EMG signals. After cleaning the skin with 70% alcohol to diminish impedance, two
disposable, self-adhesive Ag/AgCl electrodes (Noraxon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) were attached to the
belly of each muscle in the region of greatest tone, which was determined during the
performance of moderate intercuspation<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.
An electrode was positioned on the left wrist of each volunteer to impede the interference
of external noise.</p><p>The electrical activity of the masseter and anterior temporal muscles was determined under
three conditions: i) at rest; ii) during chewing (isotonic contraction) and iii) during
maximum intercuspation (MI) (isometric contraction). The signals determined at rest and
during chewing were captured with no material placed between the maxillary and mandibular
arches. Each volunteer remained seated comfortably on a chair with hand resting on the
thighs. Three readings were made under each condition, with a three-minute rest period
between readings. Readings were first performed in the resting position and each reading
lasted 15 seconds. Readings were then performed during the simulation of habitual chewing
(isotonic contraction). Chewing pace was controlled with the use of a metronome set at 60
beats per minute and each reading lasted 15 seconds. The MI readings were then performed.
Three 10-second readings were made with no material between the arches. Next, the volunteer
performed maximum voluntary clenching (MVC) with folded pieces of Parafilm
M<sup>&#x000ae;</sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> measuring 15 &#x000d7; 35 &#x000d7;
3&#x02005;mm between the maxillary and mandibular molars bilaterally for five seconds.</p><p>Electrical activity of the muscles under the three conditions was analyzed based on the
root mean square (RMS) of the amplitude of the EMG signal (expressed in &#x000b5;V). For the resting
and chewing conditions, the RMS was calculated for the entire 15-s reading. The first and
last seconds of the raw EMG signal were discarded and the RMS was calculated using a moving
window of 25&#x02005;ms with no overlap for the three-second signal. The mean of the window values
was used for the analysis. The RMS under each condition was normalized by the largest RMS
obtained from the three readings during MVC (&#x000b5;V / &#x000b5;V &#x000d7; 100: % MVC) and expressed as % of
MVC. The EMG signals were processed using specific routines developed in the Matlab 7.1
program (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, USA).</p><p>A gallium-aluminum-arsenide (GaA1As) device (Twin Flex Evolution<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, MM Optics)
was used for LLLT and sham treatment. Sessions were held in a reserved room with the patient
seated and the head positioned on the Frankfurt plane parallel to the floor. The active tip
of the laser was covered with disposable plastic wrap (PVC) for the purposes of hygiene and
to avoid cross-contamination. The operator wore proper vestments for the session and
cleaning of the sites to be irradiated was performed with 70% alcohol.</p><p>Twelve LLLT sessions were conducted at a frequency of two sessions per week. The device was
calibrated with a wavelength of 780&#x02005;nm, energy density of 25&#x02005;J/cm<sup>2</sup>, power density
of 1.25&#x02005;mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, output power of 50&#x02005;mW and a 20-second exposure time per point,
resulting in a total energy of 1&#x02005;J per point. The point application method with a
conventional tip was used in contact with the skin (beam spot: 0.04&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>),
following the protocol suggested by Venezian et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> and Carvalho et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> Laser was administered to three points over the masseter muscle
(superior, medial and inferior bundles) and one point over the anterior temporal muscle on
each side of the face<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. The same
equipment was used for sham treatment, during which sound was emitted, but no energy was
delivered.</p><p>Due to the fact that the present investigation was a preliminary study for the qualitative
evaluation of the laser protocol suggested for administration to adolescents and young
adults, the decision was made to perform a descriptive analysis of the variables and
qualitative evaluation of the treatment. Qualitative studies have been on the rise in
different health fields, especially in recent decades, as evidenced by the number of such
articles currently accepted by scientific periodicals. As humans are the object of
qualitative research and are subjective, individual, complex beings with an entire universe
of reasons and emotions, such studies are rich sources for descriptions of experiences
associated with the point of view of the subject of a study, that is, his/her emic
aspect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The EMG data were compared between the initial evaluation and the evaluation after 12
sessions of laser therapy in the two groups: Group 1 &#x02212;active LLLT; Group 2 &#x02212;sham LLLT.
Increases in mean electrical activity were found during isometric contraction of the
anterior temporal muscle in Group 1 from 67.1 to 69.6 on the right side and from 68.4 to
69.3 on the left side. Analyzing the volunteers individually, only three subjects in this
group demonstrated a reduction in the activity of this muscle. Reductions in mean electrical
activity were found during the isometric contraction of the anterior temporal muscle in
Group 2 from 76.2 to 73.0 on the right side and from 79.6 to 71.7 on the left side.
Analyzing the volunteers individually, only two subjects in this group demonstrated an

young adults was evaluated as an alternative to other forms of treatment<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. For such, the TwinFlex Evolution<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> GaA1As laser was used
at a wavelength of 786.94&#x02005;nm and output power of 50&#x02005;mW to induce biological effects in the
masticatory muscles and TMJs. Eight points of the masseter and anterior temporal muscles on
each side of the face were chosen, as these muscles are directly involved in the chewing
process.</p><p>Contrary to what was expected, no reduction in mean muscle activity was found in the group
submitted to active LLLT in the present investigation. In a previous study, Venezian et
al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> concluded that, although LLLT did
not promote changes in EMG activity of the muscles evaluated, this form of therapy led to a
reduction in pain symptoms. Although the action of LLLT on muscle hyperactivity is
debatable, the analgesic and inflammatory modulation effects are highlighted. There are
reports that LLLT induces vasodilatation, which has a positive effect on muscle pain,
specifically pain related to hypoxia. Sancakli et al.<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> found that LLLT was beneficial to managing pain caused by TMD and
improving mandibular function due to its analgesic and muscle-relaxing effects. The authors
also state that, despite the large body of literature on LLLT, divergent results are found
due to differences with regard to the protocols employed in clinical studies (randomized and
non-randomized), power intensity, wavelength time and the site of laser application. Such
variations hinder a consensus on the best technique for the treatment of TMD.</p><p>EMG has many uses in general dentistry for observation purposes as well as diagnostic and
therapeutic purposes<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. EMG is employed
to assess and record electrical activity produced by muscles at rest or when functioning.
Researchers have also used this method to assist in the diagnosis of TMD. According to
Celinski et al.<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>, the relationship
between pain and decreased muscle strength is the primary aspect used to identify patients
with TMD and this aspect can be determined based on EMG activity, especially during tooth
clenching. Using EMG analysis, Lauriti et al.<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated that the masticatory muscles of adolescents with TMD
exhibit a higher EMG signal while at rest and during maximum intercuspation, indicating
hyperactivity of these muscles.</p><p>TMD has a multifactor etiology and can be associated with numerous clinical conditions,
such as poor posture, occlusal alterations, parafunctional habits and psychological factors.
Signs and symptoms are found in more than 75% of the population, with a lower prevalence
rate among children and higher rates in adolescents and adults<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. The aim of studies involving young patients with TMD is
the early diagnosis of the disorder to treat signs and symptoms and prevent the aggravation
of the condition<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, further studies with controlled, standardized protocols are
necessary to establish the best method for the diagnosis and treatment of TMD. This
preliminary study encourages the use of low-level laser therapy to reduce pain symptoms in
patients with TMD and the employment of electromyography as a complementary diagnostic
method.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>Camila Haddad Leal de Godoy declares that she has no conflict of interest. Lara Jansiski
