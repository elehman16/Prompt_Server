A multimodal analgesic regimen is often used to treat postoperative pain, facilitating early ambulation after surgery. This typically includes paracetamol, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, steroids, antineuropathic agents, and opioids.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> In addition, regional anesthesia techniques to expedite postoperative recovery have become more targeted, moving from epidural anesthesia to combined femoral&#x02013;sciatic, and now to adductor canal blocks, and/or local infiltration analgesia (LIA).<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup></p><p>Several adjuvants have been proposed to prolong the analgesic effect of peripheral nerve blocks, one of which is buprenorphine.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> The possible mechanism of action by which buprenorphine acts as an analgesic at the peripheral nerve has not been entirely clarified. Fields et al<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> described the presence of multiple opiate receptor sites on primary afferent nerve fibers.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> On the other hand, Leffler et al<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> showed that buprenorphine also has an inhibitory effect on voltage-gated Na(+) channels, thereby acting as a local anesthetic.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Clinically, buprenorphine added to a local anesthetic leads to longer lasting postoperative analgesia in some types of blocks.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> More recently, Kosel et al<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> found lower numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores with buprenorphine added to single-shot bupivacaine femoral nerve blocks in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. However, whether buprenorphine has any clinically relevant benefit when used in the context of both contemporary multimodal analgesic regimens and fast track surgery protocols has not been investigated.</p><p>Therefore, in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty embedded in a fast track surgery protocol, we set out to test whether the addition of buprenorphine 0.3&#x0200a;mg to a single-shot femoral nerve block would prolong postoperative analgesia.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>After approval from the institutional research and ethics committee (M013&#x02013;030 METC Noord-Holland, Nassauplein 10, 1815 GM Alkmaar) and the Dutch Ministry of Health (CCMO NL45134.094.13), the study was registered in the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT number 2013-002449-12). We screened all patients (aged 50&#x02013;80 years) scheduled for primary total knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia for eligibility from December 2013 to April 2014 in Westfries Medical Centrum, Hoorn, the Netherlands. All patients signed informed consent. Patients who were not ambulant preoperatively or able to understand and complete the questionnaires, patients with fever on the day of surgery, known allergy to buprenorphine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or local anesthetics, opioid treatment before surgery, a skin infection at injection site, or renal disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate &#x0003c;50&#x0200a;mL/min) were excluded.</p><p>The treatment group (B) was given a femoral nerve block with ropivacaine 0.2% and 0.3&#x0200a;mg buprenorphine. We choose to use 2 control groups. Group R was given a femoral nerve block with ropivacaine 0.2% only. Group S also received 0.3&#x0200a;mg buprenorphine subcutaneously, as was proposed by Candido et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> In this way, the central antinociceptive effects of buprenorphine becomes more clear as differences can be seen between group B and S.</p><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Randomization</title><p>Patients were electronically randomized (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.org/">www.randomizer.org</ext-link>) to 1 of 3 treatment groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), using a prerandomized list of numbers, which was generated by an independent research assistant.

Under these circumstances, addition of buprenorphine did not prolong analgesia. The time to first rescue analgesic was comparable between groups, as were patients&#x02019; pain perception and functional recovery.</p><p>Although mean NRS pain scores showed a trend toward being lower in the buprenorphine groups, this did not reach statistical or, for that matter, clinical significance (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Furthermore, there was no difference between buprenorphine given perineurally or subcutaneously. Both groups B and S used less opioids postoperatively and sleep quality was better in these groups the first postoperative night compared with patients in group R.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>NRS scores.

NRS = numeric rating scale.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e7393-g007"/></fig><p>The mean time to first rescue analgesic in the perineural buprenorphine group was approximately 24&#x0200a;hours. This shows that pain relief supplied by the femoral nerve block and posterior capsule infiltration, combined with a multimodal analgesic regimen was excellent and there was no difference between groups. Our findings are in agreement with YaDeau et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> who studied 90 patients undergoing foot and ankle surgery under multimodal analgesia. Patients were randomized to a sciatic and adductor canal block using bupivacaine with either i.v. dexamethasone, i.v. dexamethasone, and i.v. buprenorphine or perineural dexamethasone and buprenorphine and found no difference in their primary outcome parameter <italic>dynamic pain with movement</italic> when a multimodal approach to pain was used. This study did, however, find that block duration was longer and worst pain reported and postoperative opioid use was lower in the group receiving perineural buprenorphine and dexamethasone. In the studies of Candido et al<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> and Behr et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> patients were allocated to a brachial plexus block with a local anesthetic or local anesthetic with buprenorphine. They showed an increase in duration of analgesia by the addition of buprenorphine to peripheral nerve blocks. Patients in these studies did not receive any coanalgesics postoperatively until first pain was reported. Kosel et al<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> did not record coanalgesics administered. The effect of buprenorphine in our study therefore was possibly overshadowed by the multimodal analgesic regimen that was used.</p><p>Regarding postoperative opioid use, we found a statistical difference between groups. Both groups receiving buprenorphine had lower consumption of rescue analgesics, but results were comparable whether buprenorphine was given perineurally or subcutaneously. YaDeau et al<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> found that the group receiving only i.v. dexamethasone 60.7% of patients required opioids on the day of surgery. When i.v. and perineural buprenorphine was administered, only 28.6% of patients required opioids.</p><p>We found a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, higher than the studies of Behr et al<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> and YaDeau et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> without difference between treatment groups. Buprenorphine may have caused these side effects in groups B and S. Conversely, the increased use of oxycodone may have been responsible in group R.</p><p>In a fast track surgery protocol, patients are encouraged to walk 4 to 6&#x0200a;hours after surgery. In our study, we did not only find that there is a rather large spread in block duration, but also that the median time to first mobilization, defined as the ability to walk 30 m, was quite long, ranging from 11.7 to 18.9&#x0200a;hours. This might well be the result of motor blockade from the femoral nerve block, which could lead to postoperative falls.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> This should be taken into account while mobilizing these patients.</p><p>To our knowledge, we are the first to report on sleep quality in patients receiving buprenorphine as an adjuvant for peripheral nerve blockade. Sleep is detrimentally disturbed the first 3 nights after knee arthroplasty.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> In our study, buprenorphine seems to have some positive effect, with better sleep quality on the first postoperative night, but no difference thereafter.</p><p>Our study has 1 important limitation. Our patients were studied in a fast track protocol using a multimodal analgesic regimen. As was mentioned earlier, the effect of buprenorphine was most likely overshadowed by the co-analgesics administered. On the other hand, evaluations of treatments are optimally undertaken against the backdrop of contemporary current practice.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, the study was powered to show a difference in time to first rescue analgesic. Regarding our secondary outcome parameters, the study may not have sufficient power to interpret the data.</p><p>Computerized randomization was performed and the patients and caregivers were blinded to the study medication used. There were only 2 anesthesiologists performing the ultrasound-guided nerve blocks, with a 100% block success rate and there was a short period of enrollment, without any changes in medical or physiotherapy protocols. And, most importantly, we studied 3 patient groups, as was suggested by Candido et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Group R, not receiving any buprenorphine, served as the control group, whereas group S, receiving subcutaneous buprenorphine, showed the possible systemic effects of the opioid.</p><p>In conclusion, in the setting of a fast track surgery protocol using a multimodal analgesic regimen, the addition of buprenorphine to a femoral nerve block using 20 mL of ropivacaine 0.2% did not result in clinically relevant benefits. We did find lower opioid use and better sleep quality the first postoperative night in patients receiving buprenorphine either perineurally or subcutaneously. Buprenorphine did not lead to any significant change in pain or functional outcome criteria, and we found a high incidence of nausea and vomiting in all groups.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ASA = American Society of Anesthesiology, BMI = body mass index, eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate, JPH = Jens Peter Hering, LIA = local infiltration analgesia, NRS = numeric rating scale, OBAS = overall benefit of anesthesia score, RvB = Rienk van Beek.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Trial registration: EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number 2013-002449-12.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>RvB: wrote the research protocol, oversaw conduct of the study, and wrote the manuscript.
