The most common form of CVD, ischaemic heart disease (IHD), was estimated to effect 3&#x000a0;% (685,000) of Australians in 2007&#x02013;2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

However evidence from Europe and the US indicates that relatives of patients with PIHD are being overlooked in primary prevention and several studies have highlighted the potential benefits of focusing on high-risk families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the EUROASPIRE II family survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], self-reported family screening occurred in only 11.1&#x000a0;% of siblings and 5.6&#x000a0;% of children of 1289 index patients with PIHD.</p><p>The idea for this study arose from conversations amongst a sub-group of investigators about successful interventions aimed at known risk factors for IHD such as smoking, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and the relative lack of studies concerning PIHD. At the commencement of this study, there were no published Australian guidelines that promoted screening for families experiencing PIHD and at least anecdotally, no system for alerting general practitioners (GPs) about familial risk. Targeting primary prevention at families with a positive family history was seen to be a potentially cost-effective strategy to tackle the burden of IHD in Australia and all developed countries. This study aimed to ascertain if the provision of written and verbal advice, promoting cardiovascular risk assessment to first-degree relatives of patients with PIHD, increased the proportion of relatives undertaking cardiovascular risk assessment in general practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>A prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled trial conducted in Adelaide, South Australia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>The study was ethically approved by the Royal Adelaide Hospital Research Ethics Committee and Flinders Clinical Research Ethics Committee, and approved for conduct at Flinders Private Hospital.

An IHD event was defined as any one of the following: non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), unstable angina or coronary revascularisation (coronary artery bypass grafting, coronary angioplasty with or without coronary stenting).</p><p>First degree relatives (siblings and children) of the patient aged at least 18, without diagnosed IHD and residing in Australia.</p><p>Patients and relatives were excluded if they were: terminally ill, experiencing dementia and/or other significant cognitive impairment, unable to speak English, illiterate, had any condition that their treating doctor believed warranted intensive family follow-up and intervention, or Aboriginal and living in a remote indigenous community.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participant recruitment</title><p>Patients were recruited from tertiary care cardiovascular wards at the two largest tertiary teaching hospitals in South Australia: the Royal Adelaide Hospital, Flinders Medical Centre and Flinders Private Hospital from July 2009 to February 2012, and were approached only after discharge from coronary care units into a ward or were stable after a revascularisation procedure.</p><p>Research nurses at each site approached patients hospitalised with PIHD, discussed the study, provided written information and obtained written, informed consent. Potential participants were advised that the study was about cardiovascular risk assessment in their first degree relatives, and that by agreeing to participate in the study that they would be required to forward study information to their relatives. The nurse constructed a family tree with information provided by the patients. Data collected included: relative status (brother, sister, son, daughter), age, initials, parent&#x02019;s initials and age, and if the relative had a diagnosis of IHD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Treatment allocation</title><p>Following receipt of written consent from each patient, the research nurse selected the next sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed envelope containing a computer generated treatment allocation. Randomisation was conducted for each recruitment site by a statistician not involved in the study analyses. Random number generation, with a 1:1 ratio using SAS (version 9.1 SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].) was based on a sample size of 140 (accommodating up to 80 possible patient recruits at each site). Patients were randomly allocated to provide either the &#x02018;intervention&#x02019; or the &#x02018;control&#x02019; information packs to all of their participating first degree relatives. Packs were given by the research nurse to the patients, who then distributed them to relatives whilst still in hospital or posted them to relatives at a later date. All patients were blinded as to which information pack they were providing to their relatives.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention group</title><p>Intervention group relatives were provided with a consent form, reply paid envelope and information sheet that explained the reason for the study and provided a brief explanation about PIHD, cardiovascular risk factors and the benefits of risk factor assessment. It included a recommendation that the relative make an appointment to attend their general practitioner (GP) for a cardiovascular risk assessment (without cost to them). Completion and return by the GP to the study center of a post-card included in the study pack was taken as evidence of attendance. Using the participant&#x02019;s age, sex, blood pressure (mmHg), diabetes status, smoking status and total cholesterol: HDL ratio as recorded by the GP, a 5-year absolute CVD risk value was calculated and multiplied by 1.5 (e.g. 10&#x000a0;% increased to 15&#x000a0;%) to account for the pre-existing family history of premature heart disease in all study participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The CVD risk factor chart, placed on the reverse side of the postcard, was derived from the New Zealand Guidelines Group, Heart Foundation, Stroke Foundation and NZ Ministry of Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and is based on Framingham Study data. The 5&#x000a0;year CVD risk was calculated by the GP and used in their consultation with the GP, however the risk was recalculated by research staff when the postcard was returned, and this % used for data analysis.</p><p>Additionally, intervention relatives were advised to contact the Heart Foundation for free telephone advice about heart disease, and were given the option to receive further telephone advice from a study doctor or study nurse, according to their preference.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Control (usual care) group</title><p>Control group relatives were provided with a consent form, reply paid envelope and information sheet that explained the reason for the study and provided a brief explanation about PIHD and cardiovascular risk factors only.

The brief telephone conversation ascertained whether in the last 6&#x000a0;months there had been: GP attendance with a cardiovascular risk assessment performed, any cardiovascular risk factors identified, any lifestyle changes made and how these had been managed by their GP. A brief follow-up questionnaire asking the same series of questions was posted to participants unable to be reached by telephone, following two attempts. After follow-up, control group relatives were subsequently provided with the same written information given to the intervention group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome of the study was the proportion of relatives who attended their GP for cardiovascular risk assessment within 6&#x000a0;months of the patients&#x02019; PIHD event.

Although it might be tempting to focus only on siblings of patients, who tended to have a higher absolute CVD risk, we believe that for children this might be an important moment for behavioral change which should be reinforced by visit to a general practitioner.</p><p>The feasibility of implementing family screening in a hospital setting has been examined in a European study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Their results were similar to ours with 63.9&#x000a0;% of relatives in the intervention group undergoing CVD risk assessment compared to 25.4&#x000a0;% in the control group. Whilst their participation rate was higher this may reflect the clustered study design, the role of enthusiastic cardiologists as part of their intervention and potentially how people access care in the Belgian health system.</p><p>Our intervention was successful in getting some moderate and high CVD risk individuals to have a cardiovascular risk assessment. Guidelines and review papers recommend the use of absolute cardiovascular risk to guide management of risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and a reduction in population absolute cardiovascular risk has been demonstrated in an RCT of health checks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Providing information to a first degree family member shortly after a relative&#x02019;s recent heart event could make the most of a window of opportunity, where receptivity to a new health message may promote &#x02018;contemplation&#x02019;, leading to readiness and &#x02018;preparation&#x02019; to take &#x02018;action&#x02019;, as identified in the Transtheoretical Model of Health Behaviour Change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. There is, of course, the potential to do harm by generating anxiety in relatives who are actually at low risk. Given our finding that it was siblings who were found to be moderate or high risk it may be appropriate to limit dissemination of information to this group only.</p><p>It has been estimated that in the UK 1,011 myocardial infarctions (MI) could be prevented over 5&#x000a0;years if the siblings of patients, who had been admitted to hospital with an episode PIHD in one year, could be identified and managed with a &#x02018;polypill&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Using Australian figures for MI and the assumption that PIHD accounts for 20&#x000a0;% of all CVD then the equivalent Australian totals (55,000 MIs/year) would be 712 preventable heart attacks over 5&#x000a0;years. Clearly the first step in preventing these heart attacks is identifying those at risk. Whilst these figures may be optimistic, our intervention appears to be a good investment in &#x02018;best&#x02019; or at least &#x02018;better&#x02019; practice.</p><p>Privacy and confidentiality laws usually limit the ability of hospitals and treating physicians to make direct contact with persons related to their patients. Our indirect method circumvents this issue; however we did find that some patients were estranged from either their siblings or children. This appears to be a common issue and will be difficult to overcome in clinical practice because it is hard to argue for overriding concerns about the future health of relatives when only a proportion are at moderate or high risk.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Limitations</title><p>Because this study was conducted in two major teaching hospitals in Adelaide and the majority of relatives lived in South Australia the generalizability of the findings may be limited. The study did include a mix of public and private patients; however we cannot be sure that the socio economic or educational status of our participants truly reflects the general population. Ideally we would have collected such data on all patients and relatives however this had to be balanced against increasing the burden of paperwork in both groups and therefore lowering the participation rate.</p><p>Ideally we would have used reduction in mortality or at least absolute cardiovascular risk as the primary outcome measure but the additional follow-up and time required were beyond the resources of this study. We were interested in a &#x02018;proof of concept&#x02019; that could be developed further if proven to be feasible.</p><p>Our study potentially incentivised the GP visit by offering to pay for any gap to ensure equity of access for all, however if the intervention was applied in practice any gap payment might reduce the number of relatives seeking GP CVD risk assessment. Considering that approximately 80&#x000a0;% of all GP service are currently bulk billed (at no cost to the patient) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] the impact might be limited and in addition there is mixed evidence that financial incentives improve attendance rates for CVD risk assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>We assessed 347 hospitalised patients for eligibility and randomized 144. Clearly many ineligible patients (137), those living in remote aboriginal communities (28) and their first degree relatives would have a different set of circumstances from those participating in a trial. In addition there were some hospitalised patients who were not approached because they were recruited for other trials or were on the wards at weekends or holidays. As with any other trial we have selected an eligible population for whom the results are applicable and we cannot make any inferences about the impact of the intervention on these other groups who make up a substantial proportion of all PIHD patients and their relatives.</p><p>The participation rate of relatives was low but amongst all relatives who were eligible to participate at least 10&#x000a0;% (14&#x000a0;% versus 3.5&#x000a0;%) more in the intervention group attended for cardiovascular risk assessment. A result, if attendance for risk assessment is seen as beneficial and given the low cost of the intervention, that makes providing information to patients to distribute to their relatives worthwhile. The participation rates may have been low because: it was a research study that required consent, patients may not have forwarded the information on to relatives, or reflects a lack of interest in preventive health care. Equally relatives may have received the information and acted upon it without formally being part of the study. Unfortunately, due to ethical constraints, we could not send reminders or follow up non-responders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Providing simple written and verbal advice to patients hospitalised with PIHD to distribute to their adult children, brothers and sisters leads more people to have a cardiovascular risk assessment by their GP. Given the simplicity of the intervention, and the number of relatives at moderate or high CVD risk who could benefit from primary prevention, it is likely to be a cost effective way of reducing the burden of CVD in Australia and all developed countries around the world. More research is required to evaluate if the content of the information provided improves response rates, what mechanisms improve the distribution of information to first degree relatives and how to encourage more relatives to attend for CVD risk assessment.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Availability of supporting data</title><p>Data will not be available at this stage.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CVD</term><def><p>Cardiovascular disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>General practitioner (Family Physician)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IHD</term><def><p>Ischemic heart disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSTEMI</term><def><p>Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PIHD</term><def><p>Premature ischemic heart disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STEMI</term><def><p>ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>NS, JB, PR, PT, GW designed the study.
