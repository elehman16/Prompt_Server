Surgery for hip fractures frequently requires blood transfusion, despite recent advances in techniques of orthopedic surgery and mechanical improvements of implants. Blood may be transfused before, during or following surgery.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Surgery enhances coagulability and local fibrinolytic activity. Increases the level of coagulation factors and reduction of coagulation inhibitors together with enhanced platelets activity with the release of catecholamines contribute to hemostatis. The fibrionolytic system is activated by the surgical trauma causing the release of tissue plasminogen activators (t-PA). Furthermore, the release of t-PA triggered by thrombin activates fibrinolytic system. t-PA is the major enzyme in controlling the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The use of allogenic blood products increases the rate of transmission of infectious diseases, modulates the immune response and increases the rate of post-operative infection. Numerous methods of controlling bleeding such as thromboplastic agents; topical freezing saline; deliberate hypotension and administration of fibrinolytic inhibitors as aprotinin and tranexamic acid (TXA) have been used.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Meanwhile, the nature of orthopedic illness and diseases, trauma and surgical repair or replacement of hip predisposes patients to the occurrence of venous thromboembolism. These complications are predictable and are the result of alteration of the natural equilibrium mechanisms in various disease states.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Untreated general surgical patients have a post-operative risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of 19-25%. In comparison, DVT rate among high-risk orthopedic patients is substantially greater. Untreated patients following total hip replacement have a DVT rate of 50-60%. In these same series, the risk of fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) ranges 0.4-12.9%.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>TXA is a synthetic hydrophilic inhibitor of fibrinolysis. It blocks lysine binding sites of plasminogen by competitive mechanism. TXA complex are displaced from the surface of fibrin and like plasmin is prevented from binding to fibrinogen or fibrin monomers delaying lysis. With higher concentration, TXA acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of plasmin.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However, it is contraindicated in patients with history of thromboembolic diseases.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Topical use of this agent is reported in coronary artery bypass.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aim of the study</title><p>The primary objective of this study was to test the effectiveness of topical TXA in reducing blood loss in pelvic hemiarthroplasty surgeries as compared with intravenous TXA.</p><p>The secondary objective was to compare both techniques as regards the incidence of thromboembolic complications (DVT, PE and cerebrovascular stroke [CVS]).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was carried out in a tertiary referral teaching hospital in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled prospective study on 60 patients (age ranged from 50 to 60 years) undergoing hemiarthroplasty surgeries for fractured hip joint within 48 h of trauma.
