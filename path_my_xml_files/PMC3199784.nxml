Computerisation of primary care records and explicit national guidance supported by pay for performance (P4P) targets have resulted in a rapid improvement in chronic disease management in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In CKD, guidance prioritises the control of systolic blood pressure in patients with proteinuria and or diabetes and recommends the use of angiotensin modulating drugs for achieving control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>CKD is a new priority for primary care and little was known about how to improve quality in CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Patients with CKD can be readily identified using a simple formula to estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); a diagnosis is generally made when eGFR is under 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 on at least two occasions three months apart. People with CKD have a higher mortality and morbidity principally due to cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Hypertension and diabetes were included in P4P since its inception in 2004. CKD was added in 2006 with performance indicators for: creating a disease register, measuring and controlling BP and proteinuria, and treating high risk patients with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, the prevalence of CKD reported when it was introduced as an indicator in 2006 was only half of that expected from epidemiological studies, suggesting under-ascertainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We carried out a diagnostic analysis to explore the factors limiting the achievement of quality improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This showed that primary care professionals had gaps in their knowledge, highly variable views about this condition and lacked confidence in explaining and managing the condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>We carried out this questionnaire study to assess primary care clinician confidence in the management of CKD and to explore whether confidence may be associated with the quality of care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The subjects of this research are practitioners working in 30 practices drawn from the 127 practices in the Quality Improvement in Chronic Kidney Disease trial (QICKD Clinical Trials Registration: ISRCTN56023731).</p><p>At the time of this study we were conducting a cluster randomised trial (CRT) of quality improvement interventions in CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] which includes conducting a process evaluation to explore the reasons why the trial may, or may not succeed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The CRT has three arms: "Audit based education" (feedback of performance compared with peers in an educational context) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; "Guidelines and prompts" (postal reminders about management of CKD and copies of NICE guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]); and usual practice. The study has 25 practices per arm to provide sufficient power to detect a change in systolic BP, our primary outcome measure, between the arms. The process evaluation involves six practices which participate in an in-depth evaluation involving focus groups, and an additional 10 practices per arm which form a "Questionnaire group" in order to explore the impact of the interventions on confidence in the management of CKD. The evaluation practices are excluded from the final analysis of the CRT to avoid the possibility of contamination.</p></sec><sec><title>Participating practices</title><p>We randomly allocated 10 from each study arm as confidence questionnaire evaluation practices (nested study practices). Although randomly allocated the practices in this nested study differ in age profile from the rest of the QICKD trial and the UK national population. The trial population is very close to the national population in terms of its age-sex distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The nested study practices represented 14.9% of the study sample population (138,774/930,997) and their practice populations were 1.5 years younger than those in the non-questionnaire practices (mean age 37.0 years, SEM 0.046, compared with 38.5 SEM 0.27; t-test p &#x0003c; 0.001). There was no significant difference in male: female ratio between questionnaire and non-questionnaire practices (Pearson Chi square p = 0.660) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The crude prevalence of CKD in these practices was 5.4%. The age-standardised prevalence of CKD was higher than that of non-questionnaire practices (6.3% vs. 5.3%, OR 1.19: 95% CI 1.19-1.22, p &#x0003c; 0.01).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Age-sex profile of non-questionnaire practices (left) with questionnaire practices (right)</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2296-12-83-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Distribution of the questionnaires and reminders</title><p>We sent a survey questionnaire to 30 practices (201 individual clinicians in total) and collected responses in the three rounds (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). After the initial postal distribution three rounds of reminders were conducted. Each round involved a telephone reminder to the participant by a researcher to prompt completion by posting a hard copy or to allow the participant to email a scanned copy to a central administrator. Email reminders were also sent at the same time as the phone calls. The telephone reminder was carried out in as unobtrusive a way as possible.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The scheme of distribution and collection of questionnaires</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2296-12-83-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Response rate</title><p>We sent a survey questionnaire to 30 practices (201 individual clinicians in total) and collected responses in the three rounds (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

We developed objectives based on our study using knowledge gained from our systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and diagnostic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We elected to make comparisons between CKD and other conditions commonly managed in primary care. The objectives of our questionnaire were:</p><p>&#x02022; To compare the confidence of practitioners in controlling systolic BP in patients with CKD with that in patients with hypertension alone. Improved control of systolic BP is the primary outcome measure of the CRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>&#x02022; To compare confidence in managing proteinuria in CKD with diabetes. Patients with CKD and proteinuria are at high risk of adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>&#x02022; To compare confidence levels in General Practitioner (GP) partners, salaried GPs and nurses. Our systematic review indicated that successful initiatives in CKD had often been non-doctor led [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>A draft questionnaire was circulated among the investigators who brainstormed the current issues in CKD management. This draft questionnaire was then piloted on practitioners. This cycle was repeated on three occasions. We conducted three focus groups (n = 7, 6, 8) to refine the questionnaire using groups of general practitioners, practice nurses and medical students to validate the questionnaire. These focus groups were facilitated by the principal author to this paper.</p><p>The validation process involved the practitioners completing the questionnaire and then marking a colleague's questionnaire while discussing the responses and highlighting potential ambiguities. The focus groups were reviewed and evaluated using a field notebook and transcriptions of tape recordings. A smaller group of GPs were contacted via email (n = 3) to ensure adequate validity.</p><p>We elected to include a small number of key competence measures as we felt that we could not interpret confidence entirely isolated from competence. These focussed on knowledge of BP targets for treatment, intervention levels of proteinuria and criteria for referral. The questionnaire consisted of 24 confidence questions rated 1 to 5 (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) and 6 knowledge questions. The confidence questions used a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is <italic>"Not confident at all" </italic>and 5 is <italic>"Very confident."</italic></p></sec><sec><title>Collecting routine clinical data</title><p>We collected anonymised routine clinical data from the computerised medical record systems of the questionnaire practices to enable us to compare confidence with achievement. We extracted the key variables associated with the questionnaire or required to make comparisons: practice identifier, age and gender, BP, significant proteinuria, CKD (strictly applying a standard for chronicity), diabetes (again using strict diagnostic criteria) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] or hypertension. Data were processed using an established method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and analysed in SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences, Version 16).</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis plan</title><p>Our analysis had four stages:</p><p>1. Comparing confidence levels and knowledge for different age, gender and type of practitioner, and comparing confidence in management of CKD with that of hypertension and diabetes. We judge a person who scored 4 or 5 on the questionnaire to be "confident" and one scoring 1, 2 or 3 to be "not-confident".</p><p>2. Establishing BP control and proportion at target for people with CKD, with and without significant proteinuria, diabetes and hypertension.</p><p>3. A comparison of level of confidence and achievement of the blood pressure targets set out in national evidence-based guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and P4P indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To do this we calculated a mean confidence score based on the responses from each practice and compared this with the achievement of P4P indicators by that practice.</p><p>4. Investigating variation in practice response</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We used a range of descriptive and inferential statistical procedures to compare differences in the samples and outcomes. Where appropriate, we report the percentages and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to allow comparison between subgroups. For categorical variables, we used the Pearson Chi square test to detect differences between sub-groups or associations between variables. We performed this analysis in SPSS version 16.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Considerations</title><p>The study has been approved by the Oxford Research Ethics committee and is a registered clinical trial (ISRCTN56023731).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The final response rate was 74%. After three rounds of reminders we received 148 questionnaires from 201 primary care professionals from 93% (28/30) of the practices.</p><p>We found that most participants, 86.5% (n = 128; 95% CI: 80.1% to 91.1%) in our study are confident in managing hypertension whereas only 58.8% (n = 87; CI: 50.7% to 66.4%) are confident in the management of hypertension in patients with CKD, and 60.8% (n = 90; CI: 52.7% to 68.3%) are confident in managing hypertension in patients with CKD and diabetes (DM). Just under half of the respondents, 49.3% (n = 73; CI: 41.4% to 57.3%) are confident in achieving lowered blood pressure in patients with CKD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Confidence in managing hypertension</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2296-12-83-3"/></fig><p>Importantly, confidence is especially low in the management of patients with CKD and significant proteinuria, who are at higher risk of adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes. 42.6% (n = 63; CI: 34.9% to 50.6%) of respondents lack confidence with identifying significant proteinuria in patients with CKD and only 41.9% (n = 62; CI: 34.2% to 49.9%) are familiar with using urine protein results to manage CKD.

There appears to be a lack of confidence in treating these patients and this is reinforced by a low achievement of BP targets, with only 31.3% patients meeting at goal of 130 mmHg as recommended by NICE.</p><p>70% of patients with HT received angiotensin modulating drugs for blood pressure treatment (mean BP achieved 138.6 mmHg). 61.4% of these patients meet NICE targets and 84.2% meet P4P thresholds for BP control.</p><p>79% of CKD patients (mean 136.3) received ACE-I or ARB. However, in the same group, only 48.8% (NICE) and 67.0% (P4P) of patients are at target for BP control. Practitioner confidence is also low so far as treatment of these conditions are concerned.</p><p>Practitioner confidence is lowest in managing the following groups; patient with CKD, with DM and proteinuria, and with CKD and proteinuria (58.1%, 47.3% and 41.9% respectively). CKD combined with DM or HT or both produce higher confidence values than that of CKD alone.</p><p>We compared individual practice responses to see if outliers or practice variation might account for a difference in confidence levels.

There is also a lack of confidence in managing proteinuria, combined with a knowledge gap in interpreting proteinuria test results.</p><p>Within the respondent group, salaried doctors, males, older and younger doctors and GPs compared to nurses were more confident in managing CKD. Clinicians are least confident in managing individuals with CKD who are at highest risk, i.e. those with proteinuria. Confidence is lower in managing patients with proteinuria and CKD than those patients with proteinuria and diabetes.</p><p>The quality of care in CKD, measured by ascertainment of standards in national guidance and for P4P is lower where confidence is low. This is particularly apparent in CKD and in people with CKD and diabetes.</p><p>Nearly all (&#x0003e; 80%) of people with hypertension taking an angiotensin modulating drug achieve national quality targets compared with two-thirds of people with CKD.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for practice</title><p>Low practitioner confidence and knowledge gaps may be reversed by educational interventions. The QICKD study, using information (guidelines and prompts) and education (audit based education) will inform whether these interventions change confidence and ultimately the quality of care. These interventions were chosen as they represented two common initiatives used in primary care to improve care and thought to prompt change in practice.</p><p>Interventions may need to be tailored to meet the needs of different practitioner groups, as there are marked differences between the groups of practitioners. Nurses in particular should have specific training as this clinician group deliver much of the chronic disease management in primary care and increasingly chronic kidney disease management. One consequence of P4P may be that practices improve quality up to the standard required to achieve the indicator. The highest risk patients, who may also be the most difficult to manage, may not be optimally treated. Incentives could be tailored to reward achievement of NICE thresholds for the highest risk patients, for example the use of Local Enhanced Services in Primary Care Trusts in England.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with the literature</title><p>Other studies have shown a knowledge gap in CKD management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] reinforcing the findings of our own diagnostic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. There are some pointers from educational research and from other disease areas that level of knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and confidence is associated with improved practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]; however most of these articles are descriptive rather than conducted in trials.</p><p>It may be premature to presume that the patterns of practitioner confidence described in our study are generaliseable. One study of knowledge of CKD showed it declined with increasing practitioner age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Another, in the field of dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] suggested younger and female GPs had greater knowledge and awareness; whereas the exploration of discussing sexual difficulties showed no gender difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Limitation of the method</title><p>There may be a number of sources of bias in this investigation. Firstly, the practices participating in the QICKD study are volunteer practices who may not be representative of the wider population. Secondly, we have no information about the non-responders.</p><p>We can only look at comparing individual practitioners' responses with practice level outcome data. This is because most practices allow patients to see a number of doctors.</p></sec><sec><title>Call for future research</title><p>We need to determine the cost effectiveness of any educational intervention updating economic modelling based on previous guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Further studies which provide educational or other interventions to people who lack confidence in managing a condition should be conducted to determine whether this improves the quality of care.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Practitioners are less confident in managing CKD than hypertension or diabetes and are less likely to achieve BP targets where confidence is low. Improving knowledge and confidence may provide the key to improving the quality of CKD management in primary care, especially for higher risk patients with diabetes and with proteinuria.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>AT<sup>1,2 </sup>Nil declared</p><p>OD<sup>2 </sup>Nil declared</p><p>SdeL<sup>2 </sup>SdeL is the GP expert advisor for the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF - a pay-for-performance (P4P) scheme) with the role of developing a CKD Indicator.
