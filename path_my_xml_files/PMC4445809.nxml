Instillation of Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) into the urinary bladder after TURBT (adjuvant intravesical administration) reduces the risk of both recurrence and progression, and this is therefore the standard of care for high-risk tumours. However, over 30&#x000a0;% of people still recur or progress despite optimal delivery of BCG. Our meta-analysis suggests that outcomes might be improved further by using an adjuvant intravesical regimen that includes both mitomycin and BCG. These promising findings require corroboration in a definitive, large scale, randomised phase III trial using standard techniques for intravesical administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>The BCG&#x02009;+&#x02009;MMC trial (ANZUP 1301) is an open-label, randomised, stratified, two-arm multi-centre phase III trial comparing the efficacy and safety of standard intravesical therapy (BCG alone) against experimental intravesical therapy (BCG and mitomycin) in the treatment of adults with resected, high-risk NMIBC. Participants in the control group receive standard treatment with induction (weekly BCG for six weeks) followed by maintenance (four-weekly BCG for ten months). Participants in the experimental group receive induction (BCG weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8; mitomycin weeks 3, 6, and 9) followed by four-weekly maintenance (mitomycin weeks 13, 17, 25, 29, 37, and 41; BCG weeks 21, 33, and 45). The trial aims to include 500 participants who will be centrally randomised to one of the two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio stratified by T-stage, presence of CIS, and study site. The primary endpoint is disease-free survival; secondary endpoints are disease activity, time to recurrence, time to progression, safety, health-related quality of life, overall survival, feasibility, and resource use.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?ACTRN=12613000513718">ACTRN12613000513718</ext-link>).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bladder cancer</kwd><kwd>Transitional cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>Intravesical</kwd><kwd>BCG</kwd><kwd>Mitomycin</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Bladder cancer</title><p>Bladder cancer is a major global cause of suffering and mortality. Worldwide, it is among the top 10 cancers in terms of incidence and mortality with an estimated 380,000 cases and 150,000 deaths in 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Contrary to trends for most other cancers, five-year survival from bladder cancer has reduced internationally over the last 20 to 30&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Bladder cancers are classified according to their grade (high or low) and according to their depth of penetration through the bladder wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer includes all tumours that invade into detrusor muscle or beyond (T2-4). Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) includes carcinoma-in-situ (CIS), papillary tumours (Ta), and tumours that invade into lamina propria but not detrusor muscle (T1). Whilst NMIBC is often treated successfully with transurethral resection of the bladder tumour (TURBT), it can be associated with a high risk of recurrence and progression (increase in grade or stage). These risks can be estimated based on the presence, or absence, of certain prognostic indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In people with high-risk NMIBC (high-grade Ta, or any grade T1), the five-year risk of recurrence ranges from 46-78&#x000a0;% and the five-year risk of progression ranges from 6-45&#x000a0;% depending on further risk stratification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Disease progression includes the development of muscle-invasive disease, which is associated with a poorer prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and usually warrants radical treatment with cystectomy (removal of the urinary bladder) or irradiation. Various intravesical therapies (instillation of agents into the urinary bladder) have been used in the treatment of NMIBC in an attempt to reduce the risk of recurrence and progression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG)</title><p>Intravesical BCG is thought to work by stimulating an antigen-mediated immune response against bladder tumour cells. Meta-analyses have demonstrated that intravesical BCG after TURBT (adjuvant BCG) significantly reduces both the risk of recurrence (odds ratio 0.3, 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.21-0.43 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]) and progression (odds ratio 0.73, 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.6-0.89 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]) of NMIBC, as compared with TURBT alone. The reduced risk of progression is only evident if the adjuvant BCG treatment includes both an induction course (usually weekly for four-to-six weeks) and a subsequent maintenance course (less frequent instillations over the following months or years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In view of the significant toxicities that can occur with intravesical BCG, its use is currently not recommended for low-risk NMIBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Despite optimal delivery of adjuvant BCG, long-term failure rates of 30-40&#x000a0;% are encountered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intravesical chemotherapy</title><p>Instillation of chemotherapeutic drugs into the bladder after TURBT (adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy) is another strategy that is employed in the treatment of NMIBC, and several different agents have been shown to be effective. For example, adjuvant intravesical mitomycin including an initial and maintenance instillations has been shown to reduce five-year recurrence rates from 60&#x000a0;% to 37&#x000a0;% (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A meta-analysis of EORTC and MRC randomised clinical trials has demonstrated that adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy is effective in reducing recurrence (hazard ratio 0.8, 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.72-88), but not progression or overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Combination intravesical treatment (BCG and chemotherapy)</title><p>Our recent meta-analysis of all published randomised trials examining the addition of intravesical chemotherapy to BCG suggests that it may well be beneficial in people with Ta or T1 disease, but not in those with CIS alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. When the single trial that included participants with CIS alone was excluded, the addition of chemotherapy to BCG was found to reduce both recurrence (relative risk 0.75; 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.61 - 0.92) and progression (relative risk 0.45; 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.25-0.81), with no apparent increase in treatment toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, the only individual randomised trial included in this meta-analysis that demonstrated significant improvements in recurrence and progression with the addition of chemotherapy to BCG was a randomised phase II trial reported by Di Stasi and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The Di Stasi trial, including 212 participants with resected T1 tumours, followed for a median of 88&#x000a0;months, found that combined treatment with BCG and mitomycin improved recurrence rates (42&#x000a0;% vs. 58&#x000a0;%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001), progression rates (9&#x000a0;% vs. 22&#x000a0;%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.045), disease-free survival (median of 69 vs. 21&#x000a0;months, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001), overall mortality (22&#x000a0;% vs. 32&#x000a0;%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.045), and disease-specific mortality (6&#x000a0;% vs. 16&#x000a0;%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01) compared with BCG alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, this trial did not include people with Ta disease, and mitomycin was administered using &#x02018;electromotive delivery&#x02019; (an electric current passed through the catheter to plates on the skin of the lower abdominal wall) - a technique that has not been widely accepted or adopted. Therefore while these results are encouraging regarding the benefits of combined treatment with intravesical BCG and mitomycin in high-risk NMIBC, it remains unproven whether combination treatment is effective in all subgroups, or when treatment is delivered in a traditional way (without electromotive delivery).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Pilot study</title><p>Our single-centre, non-randomised, pilot study has established the feasibility of adding mitomycin to BCG (without electromotive delivery) as adjuvant intravesical therapy for resected, high-risk NMIBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This pilot study involved 23 participants (11 BCG and mitomycin, 12 BCG alone) and assessed number of missed doses, treatment completion (number having received 75&#x000a0;% or more of planned doses), and participant-rated urinary symptoms. Participant-rated urinary symptoms were assessed using the I-PSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and a cystitis score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] at baseline, three months, six months, nine months, and one year. No induction treatment doses were missed for either group (0/99 BCG and mitomycin, 0/72 BCG alone) and 20&#x000a0;% or fewer maintenance doses were missed for both groups (8/99 BCG and mitomycin 24/120 BCG alone). Treatment completion exceeded 80&#x000a0;% for both groups (10/11 BCG and mitomycin, 10/12 BCG alone). Failure to complete treatment was due to one participant (BCG and mitomycin) progressing during maintenance treatment and requiring cystectomy, and two participants (both BCG alone) declining maintenance treatment. Of additional note, one participant (BCG and mitomycin) developed a reactive arthritis after induction and therefore completed scheduled mitomycin maintenance only. As can be seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, combined treatment with BCG and mitomycin did not result in worse participant-rated urinary symptom scores at any interval during the first year, when compared to scores in those undergoing treatment with BCG alone.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Pilot data on median (<bold>a</bold>) I-PSS and (<bold>b</bold>) cystitis scores</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12885_2015_1431_Fig1_HTML" id="d30e606"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods and design</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Protocol overview</title><p>This is an open-label, randomised, stratified, two-arm multi-centre phase III trial comparing the efficacy and safety of standard intravesical therapy (BCG alone) against experimental intravesical therapy (BCG and mitomycin) in the treatment of adults with resected, high-risk NMIBC.

The study is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Note for Guidance on Good Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95 - annotated with TGA comments), NHMRC National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research, NHMRC Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research, and all applicable laws and regulations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Statistical considerations</title><p>The planned sample size of 500 participants (250 per arm), recruited over four years and followed for another two years, is designed to give 85&#x000a0;% power to detect a 37&#x000a0;% reduction in the hazard for DFS (hazard ratio 0.63, corresponding to a two-year DFS probability of 70&#x000a0;% [BCG alone] vs. 80&#x000a0;% [BCG and mitomycin) at the 5&#x000a0;% level of statistical significance allowing for a non-compliance rate of 10&#x000a0;%. Under these assumptions, 213 DFS events (progression or death) are expected to be observed. The anticipated two-year DFS probability for the control group (BCG alone, 70&#x000a0;%) is based on results with single-agent BCG with maintenance in previous randomised trials and meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Analysis plan</title><p>The primary analysis will be a comparison of treatment groups on DFS using a log-rank test; Kaplan-Meier curves will also be used to estimate DFS at two years. Cox proportional hazards regression and modelling will be used to estimate a hazard ratio for the treatment effect on DFS before and after adjusting for covariates. Similar analysis will be conducted of other time to event endpoints including time to recurrence, time to progression, and overall survival. Comparisons on categorical and continuous outcomes will be undertaken using suitable non-parametric and regression models, and will adjust for covariates. Formal cost-effectiveness analyses will be conducted if the main endpoints warrant consideration of a change in practice.</p><p>Additionally, three interim analyses will be conducted; once the first 130 participants complete treatment, and after a third and two thirds of the required number of DFS events have occurred. The interim analyses will assess feasibility, adverse events, study performance, and preliminary DFS data to determine whether the trial should stop, be modified, or continue unchanged; these analyses will be reviewed by an Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial aims to determine whether the addition of intravesical chemotherapy to adjuvant BCG treatment reduces the risk of recurrence and progression of high-risk NMIBC, over treatment with BCG alone. Our meta-analysis suggests that combination treatment may be more effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], however the only individual study to prove a benefit did not include people with Ta disease and delivered mitomycin via unconventional &#x02018;electromotive delivery&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. If this trial confirms the benefits of combination intravesical therapy with BCG and mitomycin, over BCG alone, in all high-risk NMIBC subgroups when delivered in a standard way then the implications of this on the treatment of NMIBC worldwide would be significant. This trial will assess the comparative efficacy of these two treatments by collecting outcome data including DFS, disease activity, time to recurrence, time to progression, and overall survival. The widespread adoption of combination treatment with BCG and mitomycin will also be affected by its tolerability and side-effects as compared to treatment with BCG alone. The comparative tolerability and side-effects of the two treatments will be assessed in this trial by collecting data on adverse events, health-related quality of life, feasibility, and resource use.</p><p>Additionally, the consent process for this trial invites participants to consent to use of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour tissue that is collected, for use in biological or translational sub-studies. These studies may potentially provide a better understanding of how BCG and mitomycin work in NMIBC, or identify biomarkers that are able to better predict success of intravesical treatment or overall prognosis.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANZUP</term><def><p>Australian and New Zealand Urogenital and Prostate Cancer Trials Group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BCG</term><def><p>Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CFU</term><def><p>Colony forming units</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CIS</term><def><p>Carcinoma-in-situ</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DFS</term><def><p>Disease-free survival</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECOG</term><def><p>Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EORTC</term><def><p>European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GA</term><def><p>General anaesthesia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>I-PSS</term><def><p>International Prostate Symptom Score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LA</term><def><p>Local anaesthesia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRC</term><def><p>Medical Research Council</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NCI CTCAE</term><def><p>National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHMRC</term><def><p>National Health and Medical Research Council</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NMIBC</term><def><p>Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QLQ-BLS24</term><def><p>Quality of life questionnaire for bladder cancer that is superficial (24 items)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QLQ-C30</term><def><p>Quality of life questionnaire core 30</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TURBT</term><def><p>Trans-urethral resection of the bladder tumour</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UTI</term><def><p>Urinary tract infection</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>DH is the study co-ordinator.
