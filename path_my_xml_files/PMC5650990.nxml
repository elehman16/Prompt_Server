However, comparative studies of the two training strategies are relatively few. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of action observation training and motor imagery training on the development of mental representation structure and golf putting performance as well as the relation between the changes in mental representation structure and skill performance during the early learning stage. Forty novices were randomly assigned to one of four groups: action observation training, motor imagery training, physical practice and no practice. The mental representation structure and putting performance were measured before and after 3 days of training, then after a 2-day retention period. The results showed that mental representation structure and the accuracy of the putting performance were improved over time through the two types of cognitive training (i.e., action observation training and motor imagery training). In addition, we found a significant positive correlation between changes in mental representation structure and skill performance for the action observation training group only. Taken together, these results suggest that both cognitive adaptations and skill improvement occur through the training of the two simulation states of action, and that perceptual-cognitive changes are associated with the change of skill performance for action observation training.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>motor learning</kwd><kwd>cognitive training</kwd><kwd>skill acquisition</kwd><kwd>golf putting</kwd><kwd>SDA-M</kwd><kwd>simulation theory</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="10"/><ref-count count="62"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="9661"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Motor learning means a relatively permanent change in the competence of skill performance, resulting from systematic and repeated practice (e.g., Magill, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). The learning of a motor skill is commonly attained via physical repetition of a skill before moving to a different motor skill (e.g., Coker, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). However, research has shown that cognitive training, such as motor imagery and action observation training, can also be applied effectively to facilitate skill learning, either alone, or combined with physical practice (e.g., Hodges and Williams, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Motor imagery refers to a dynamic state during which learners simulate specific motor actions mentally, without actual movement (e.g., Jeannerod, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Decety, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Furthermore, motor imagery training has been used as an effective means to facilitate motor learning and performance (e.g., Driskell et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Murphy, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Schack et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Meta-analyses on this topic have reported that motor imagery training has a positive effect on motor performance, even though the degree of its effectiveness varies with the moderators, such as type of task, experience level of participants, duration of practice, and other factors (e.g., Driskell et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). In addition, motor imagery training was shown to be more effective compared to no practice, but was less effective than physical practice. Moreover, the combination has been proven to be as effective, or even more effective, than either motor imagery or physical practice alone (e.g., Hall et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Liu et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Bajaj et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Thus, these findings show that motor imagery training can be an effective type of cognitive training as a complement to physical practice to enhance motor outcomes.</p><p>Action observation is an effective means of observational practice that has been considered extensively for enhancing motor learning and performance (e.g., Ste-Marie et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), as well as for modifying social behavior (e.g., Bandura, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). Research on action observation showed that action observation training benefits not only performance production variables like movement coordination pattern (e.g., Horn et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), but also performance outcome variables related to motor learning (e.g., Hayes et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). To assess the motor learning effect of action observation training, previous studies compared the effect of action observation training with the effect of physical practice or no practice. From this, action observation training was found to be superior to no practice (e.g., Kohl and Shea, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Hayes et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In addition, it was suggested that the combination of action observation training and physical practice provides more unique opportunities than either action observation or physical practice alone (e.g., Shea et al., <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Weeks and Anderson, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). These findings show that action observation training can be an effective type of cognitive training as a complement to physical practice to facilitate behavior outcomes.</p><p>Jeannerod (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) has proposed that simulation states (S states) such as action observation and motor imagery are functionally equivalent to action execution, assuming that both are based on action representations encoded in the brain. This proposal has been supported by many brain-image studies, which showed that both action observation and motor imagery lead to the activation of motor-related brain areas (e.g., Lotze et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Filimon et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Lorey et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). These studies suggested that, to some extent, they make use of the same neural substrates as those involved during the execution of observed or imagined actions. Furthermore, many studies have reported that the neural representations for action observation and motor imagery are somewhat similar to those for motor execution (e.g., Clark et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Filimon et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Zabicki et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). For action observation, motor-related information, which is available through the visual system, is encoded into a type of mental representation in long-term memory for the organization of a future intended action (e.g., Holmes and Calmels, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Ste-Marie et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Motor imagery is required to consciously retrieve a stored mental representation in long-term memory (e.g., Jeannerod and Decety, <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Bandura, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Soohoo et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Wright et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). These indicate that mental representations, which play a key role in the control and organization of intended actions (e.g., Land et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), are involved during action observation and motor imagery.</p><p>Although motor imagery and action observation rely on a similar action representation, there is a difference between them in aspects of the mechanism of cognitive process. Motor imagery is a knowledge-driven cognitive process that is internally simulated based on information in long-term memory, without an external stimulus (e.g., Murphy, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Soohoo et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Holmes and Calmels, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Helm et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Instead, action observation is a percept-driven cognitive process that is externally guided by an external stimulus, such as a live demonstration or recorded video (e.g., Ram et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Holmes and Calmels, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Vogt et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Therefore, motor imagery completely relies on mental representations stored in long-term memory to generate a motor image (e.g., Farah, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>; Mulder et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Frank et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Schack et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). On the contrary, action observation is not dependent on the mental representation in long-term memory, since it completes a percept-driven process (e.g., Guillot and Collet, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Wright et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>); that is, visual information provided externally is held in working memory, and does not necessarily rely on representations stored in long-term memory. This implies that, despite the functional equivalence between action observation and motor imagery, the two simulation states (S-states) of action may not necessarily lead to the same effect in the improvement of the mental representation and performance.</p><p>The perceptual-cognitive perspective specifies that cognitive representations, which guide motor actions, are formed based on perceptual information (Zentgraf et al., <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In this sense, the perceptual-cognitive perspective on motor control addresses the idea that intended and executed motor actions are based on the mental representation of motor actions stored in long-term memory (e.g., Mechsner et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Schack and Mechsner, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). From the cognitive action architecture approach (CAA-A; Schack, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; for reviews see e.g., Land et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), the organization of motor action for the execution is functionally guided by mental representations encoded in long-term memory. In other words, mental representations function as a cognitive reference for movement control. The framework of mental representation is composed of basic action concepts (BACs), which are identified as major representation units for complex actions (e.g., Schack, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Schack and Mechsner, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Based on the CAA-A, functional changes in the relation of BACs appear over the motor learning process within a conceptual framework in long-term memory (e.g., Bl&#x000e4;sing et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Schack and Ritter, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Frank et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the role of mental representations in long-term memory, Schack and Mechsner (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) compared the difference in mental representation structure according to different skill levels, employing the structural dimensional analysis of mental representation (SDA-M; for more details see Schack, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). According to the results, mental representation structures of high-level experts were not only well organized, but also corresponded to functional demands of the task. In contrast, mental representation structures of low-level players and novices were relatively less organized and less linked to the functional demands of the task. Similar results were also reported in some studies that examined the difference in mental representation structure with skill expertise using the SDA-M for diverse motor tasks (e.g., Schack and Hackfort, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Bl&#x000e4;sing et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Velentzas et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In addition, according to Frank et al. (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), the mental representation structure of golf novices became functionally more organized with physical practice over time, whereas no practice did not cause any changes in mental representation structure. These findings suggest that mental representations serve as a basis for action control, adapting functionally over the course of motor learning.</p><p>Given that most motor skills include both physical and cognitive elements, not only physical practice but also cognitive training may lead to the development of mental representation. Recently, Frank et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) examined the effect of motor imagery training on mental representation structure and performance of novice golf players. The study showed that mental representation structure was functionally well organized particularly following motor imagery training. Moreover, in a recent study by Frank et al. (under review), it was shown that action observation training for golf beginners led to more functional mental representation structures along with performance improvement. These findings suggest that both motor imagery training and action observation training can enhance the functional adaption of task-specific mental representation in the early learning stage.</p><p>Taken together, motor imagery training and action observation training in themselves have a positive effect on the improvement of skill performance of novice learners in the early skill acquisition stage. Some studies have compared the differences in neurophysiologic and behavioral effects between motor imagery training and action observation training. Nevertheless, to date, no studies have compared how motor imagery and action observation training affect the formation process of mental representation in novices. Thus, in this study, we aimed at investigating the differences in the effects of the two types of cognitive training on the development of mental representation structure and the performance of a golf putting task. It was expected that motor imagery training and action observation training, as well as physical practice, would lead to functional changes of mental representation structure, along with performance improvement, compared to no practice (i.e., control group). Furthermore, it was expected that action observation training would be relatively more effective than motor imagery training in the development of mental representation, since it was predicted that novices have available limited representation structure of the golf putt in their long-term memory. Therefore, we expected that the allocation of new and well-structured motor information through action observation would lead to more elaborate representation and better performance than the simulation through motor imagery. In addition, based on the CAA-A, it was expected that the structured change of mental representation would be somewhat linked to performance improvement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty participants from local university (18 males, 22 females; <italic>M<sub>age</sub></italic> = 25.20, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.12) took part in this study.

Participants were instructed to judge whether an anchor concept and a concept were functionally related to each other during the execution of the movement. Each of 16 BACs was presented as an anchor concept, whereas the remaining 15 BACs were provided, one by one in a random order, to be compared with the anchor concept. The anchor concept was not changed to a different concept until it was compared to each of the remaining 15 BACs. Once one process for an anchor concept was finished, another BAC was changed to the role as an anchor. This procedure was performed for each of 16 BACs (for more details see Schack, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>Skill Performance</title><p>All participants were asked to perform a golf putt toward a golf hole (10.8 cm in diameter) projected by a beam at a distance of 3 m from the starting point on a synthetic putting green (length = 9 m, width = 4 m). Specifically, participants were required to putt a golf ball as close as possible to the target. To assess the accuracy of the performance, the two-dimensional position coordinate, of where the ball stopped after each golf putt trial, was recorded with six T10 CCD cameras (Vicon Motion Systems Ltd., Oxford, UK).

For invariance analysis, a critical value was <italic>&#x003bb;</italic> = 0.68. A value equal to or more than 0.68 (i.e., <italic>&#x003bb;</italic> &#x02265; 0.68) indicated that there was no difference (two cluster solutions were invariant), while a value less than 0.68 (i.e., <italic>&#x003bb;</italic> &#x0003c; 0.68) indicated that there was change (two cluster solutions were variant). In addition, the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI; e.g., Santos and Embrechts, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) was calculated to evaluate the degree of similarity between a group dendrogram and a reference dendrogram, reflecting well the four phases of the golf putt (e.g., Frank et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).

Specifically, this study was designed to compare the effects of the two cognitive training interventions for both mental representation structure and skill performance, as well as to examine the relationship between the change of mental representation structure and the change of skill performance. In this respect, the present study is an extension of previous research done by Kim et al. (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), which have studied the effect of action observation training and motor imagery training on skill performance. It was hypothesized that action observation training would be more effective than motor imagery training, both in the development of mental representation structure and in the improvement of skill performance in early stage of skill learning. Furthermore, it was expected that the change in mental representation structure would be connected with the change in skill performance. The results of this study support the established hypothesis partially. To be specific, we could find some meaningful improvement in mental representation structure and skill performance over time through both action observation training and motor imagery training. In addition, it was found that changes in mental representation structure and skill performance were positively correlated for the action observation training group.</p><p>With regard to mental representation structure of golf putting, it was revealed that the mental representation structures of all practice groups (i.e., motor imagery, action observation and physical practice) changed over time, leading to more elaborate and structured representations in the direction of the expert reference dendrogram, reflecting well the four movement phases (i.e., BAC 1&#x02013;4, BAC 5&#x02013;7, BAC 8&#x02013;11 and BAC 12&#x02013;16; Frank et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This result indicates that practice brings about functional changes of task-specific mental representation in long-term memory, which is in line with results of recent studies on perceptual-cognitive changes (Frank et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Related to this, studies focusing on the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying motor imagery and action observation have shown that the two simulation states of action share certain neural representations (Conson et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Holmes et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). For instance, brain regions such as the primary and the premotor cortex, the supplementary motor area, the cerebellum and the basal ganglia tend to be activated not only during motor imagery, but also during action observation in the absence of any overt action (Lorey et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In this respect, the changes in mental representation structure in this study may be associated with changes in brain activation that may in turn be correlated with motor outcome. The extent to which each simulation state contributes to changes in motor learning related brain areas, however, has yet to be determined (Frank and Schack, <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, it was revealed that the initial status of the mental representation structure differed somewhat between the groups. Specifically, (ARI<sub>pre</sub> = 0.05, BAC 1, 2, 6; BAC 8, 13; BAC 9, 12; BAC 10, 11), (ARI<sub>pre</sub> = 0.01, BAC 2, 6, 15; BAC 4, 16; BAC 7, 14; BAC 8, 13), (ARI<sub>pre</sub> = 0.08, BAC 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 15; BAC 10, 13), and (ARI<sub>pre</sub> = 0.02, BAC 1, 2, 3, 6, 15) meaningful clusters (of golf putting) were shown for the pre-test in action observation training, motor imagery training, physical practice, and control groups, in that order. Meaningful clusters represent a group of BACs that are functionally or biomechanically related to movement components and phases for the achievement of action goals (Schack, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Thus, this result indicates that even though participants actually had no previous performance experience with the task, the initial cognitive architecture of the mental representation may have varied depending upon the individual, suggesting that the initial dissimilarity of mental representation structure may lead to different effects for the development of mental representation and performance during the early motor learning phase. However, as Frank et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) indicated in their article, to date, it is not clear whether the slope of representation development is functionally related to the initial status of representation structure. The rate of change in representation is likely to be different because there are various representation structures in novices. Therefore, future studies should be undertaken to investigate differences in the development of mental representation and skill performance according to the degree of novices&#x02019; initial representation structure for a better understating of this issue.</p><p>Contrary to our expectation, the mental representation structure of the control group developed over time as well. Specifically, (BAC 1, 2, 3, 6, 15) at the pre-test (ARI<sub>pre</sub> = 0.02), (BAC 1, 2, 3, 6, 15), (BAC 7, 14), (BAC 9, 10) at the post-test (ARI<sub>post</sub> = 0.03), and (BAC 1, 2, 3, 6, 15), (BAC 8, 9), (BAC 10, 11), (BAC 12, 14, 16) at the retention test (ARI<sub>retention</sub> = 0.07) were found respectively. The possible explanation for this result is that physical test trials executed during test sessions might have influenced the development of the mental representation structure.</p><p>With reference to the cognitive effect of the action observation training and motor imagery training, it was expected that action observation training, associated with a bottom-up mechanism, would be more effective than motor imagery training, associated with a top-down mechanism, in the development of a mental representation structure for novices in the early learning stage (see Holmes and Calmels, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref> for details on potential mechanisms involved in observation and imagery). However, we could not compare the difference in mental representation structure objectively between the two cognitive trainings, due to the difference between the initial representation structures. Nevertheless, the result of this study is meaningful in that task-specific representation structure can be developed through practice, which is especially relevant to the perceptual-cognitive perspective (Mechsner et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), and the cognitive action architecture approach (Schack, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), which emphasize the crucial role of mental representation for the generation and control of voluntary movements.</p><p>Regarding the ease of the use of the two types of cognitive trainings, the present result of the post-experimental questionnaire showed that the use score of action observation was significantly higher than that of motor imagery by the second practice day, out of the 3 days in the practice period. This result indicates that action observation was easier to use than motor imagery for novices who had no previous task experience. For example, Soohoo et al. (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) compared the effect of observation and imagery on the performance of a squat lift skill. In their study, participants were instructed to choose and use their preferred method of the two types of cognitive training (i.e., action observation and motor imagery) for the fifth trial, after they performed the fourth trial of either observation or imagery in each predetermined group. The result of the study demonstrated that many participants preferred to watch the video of an expert model who performed the task. This result shows that novices prefer action observation to motor imagery during the early stage of skill learning. However, there are still individual differences associated with preference. Therefore, in future research, individual preference needs to be considered for the assignment of cognitive training groups.</p><p>With regard to performance outcome, first, before the practice phase, there was no difference in the accuracy among the four groups. After 3 days of training, the three practice groups (i.e., action observation training, motor imagery training, and physical practice group), except for the control group, significantly improved in accuracy at the post-test compared to the pre-test. Moreover, such an improvement was maintained at the retention test. This is in line with the research result of Kim et al. (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) that investigated the difference in learning effect between action observation and motor imagery of golf putting. Thus, this result pattern supports the previous findings that not only physical practice, but also cognitive training such as action observation training or motor imagery training, can enhance motor skill acquisition and learning (Driskell et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Wulf et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Hayes et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Schmidt and Lee, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In addition, as Frank et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) mentioned in their article, which investigated functional links between motor memory and motor imagery, the relative short length of practice may be one reason for the lack of differences among the groups in the performance of golf putting. Therefore, future research on this topic that employs golf putt task needs to consider a longer practice period to prevent possible confounds in statistic result.</p><p>Lastly, regarding the relationship between the change of mental representation structure and the change of skill performance, it was revealed that the change in mental representation structure of the training groups was positively related to the change in skill performance, with more elaborate mental representation being linked to better skill performance. This result indirectly supports the perceptual-cognitive perspective, which emphasizes the role of mental representation as a basis for the control of voluntary motor movements (Mechsner et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Schack and Mechsner, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Additionally, the positive relationship between the two variables by group was found to be significant for only action observation group. This result implies that the mental representation elaborated through action observation training might be more related to the execution of the motor system.</p><p>Taken together, the findings of this study provide insights into perceptual-cognitive and performance changes in the process of motor learning through cognitive training. This study is the first to compare the effect of action observation training and motor imagery training on both the development of mental representation and skill performance. Moreover, it is noteworthy that this study has demonstrated that the two simulation states of action led to both cognitive adaptation and skill improvement, and that action observation training resulted in the positive relationship between cognitive-perceptual and performance changes. However, the generalizability of these findings is subject to certain limitations. For instance, although this study was designed to compare action observation and motor imagery as objectively as possible, it was difficult to control all of the factors that can influence the effect of action observation and motor imagery, such as the possibility of imagery during observation or the initial representation status of participants. Thus, more research is required to confirm the findings of the present study. Regarding future research on action observation and motor imagery, future research might investigate the perceptual-cognitive and behavioral patterns of the combined training (i.e., AO + MI training) over the course of learning or relearning in motor skill learning and motor rehabilitation settings rather than their independent use (Eaves et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>TK, CF and TS: conception and design of study and drafting of manuscript; TK and CF: experiment preparation and data analysis; TK: data collection.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding.</bold> This research/work was supported by the Cluster of Excellence Cognitive Interaction Technology &#x0201c;CITEC&#x0201d; (EXC 277) at Bielefeld University, which is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).
