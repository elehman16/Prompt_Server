New registered nurses are at particular risk. Boamah and Laschinger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and Laschinger et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] found that nearly half of new registered nurses in their Canadian sample experienced severe levels of symptoms of stress-related ill health. In addition, every fifth new registered nurse in a national representative sample in Sweden was found to experience extremely high levels of stress-related ill health at some point during the first 3&#x000a0;years in the profession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Heavy workload, large emotional demands, and limited resources have been acknowledged as important sources of stress for the general nursing population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The same stressors have also been recognized as important for new registered nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, for many new registered nurses, the experience of stress is exacerbated by the perception of oneself as inadequately prepared and unable to live up to role expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. New registered nurses who experience symptoms of stress-related ill health are less satisfied with their job [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and have more thoughts about leaving their current place of employment or the nursing profession than other new registered nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Considering the prevalence and consequences of stress-related ill health among new registered nurses in the transition from education to profession, developing methods for preventing this problem has been recognized as important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This research should be based on a thorough understanding of how stress-related ill health is developed among new registered nurses and how it may be effectively prevented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Behavioral model of development and prevention of stress-related ill health</title><p id="Par9">The purpose of the stress response is to support effective management of challenging or threatening situations through physiological, emotional, and behavioral adaptations. However, if prolonged or repeated, it may have damaging effects on the physiological systems involved leading to symptoms of stress-related ill health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Although behavioral avoidance is essential to the adaptive management of stressors, it has been suggested that excessive engagement in avoidance behaviors contribute to the malevolent prolonged or repeated activation of the stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In line with this suggestion, it has been shown that stress-related ill health among new registered nurses may be modeled as a sequential-developmental process that develops progressively from initial levels of perceived stress and exhaustion as the new registered nurses engage in behaviors such as approaching work tasks in a mechanistic way and talking about work in a detached way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Meta-analyses of stress management interventions have shown that behavior change programs may be effective for reducing stress-related ill health among experienced registered nurses. These interventions typically support the development of behaviors that serve the purpose of effectively managing stressful situations, as opposed to avoiding them and thereby reduce the experience of stress over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. A similar intervention was also shown to reduce stress among nursing students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, a review of interventions for preventing stress-related ill health among new registered nurses revealed that only limited evidence is available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Proactive behaviors</title><p id="Par11">Behaviors such as practicing new skills, seeking information, asking for help, monitoring and imitating the behavior of experienced colleagues, and making contact with peers for relationship building have been recognized as important for the management of challenging situations during the transition into a new profession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Specifically, these behaviors have been positively related to processes such as mastery of occupational tasks, role clarity, and social acceptance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. These processes have been suggested to mediate newcomers&#x02019; acquisition of the knowledge and skills required to adapt to the professional role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In addition, these processes are positively related to performance, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment and negatively related to intention to leave and turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Furthermore, in a longitudinal study conducted in Sweden with a sample of 1210 new registered nurses, higher levels of the processes were found to be related to lower levels of symptoms of stress-related ill health concurrently and over time during the first 3&#x000a0;years in the profession (Fr&#x000f6;g&#x000e9;li, Rudman, L&#x000f6;vgren, Gustavsson; Problems with task mastery, social acceptance, and role clarity explain nurses&#x02019; burnout during the first professional years. Submitted). That is, the higher the perceived task mastery, role clarity, and social acceptance, the lower the risk of stress-related ill health. Proactive behaviors thus constitute a potential target for preventing stress-related ill health among new nurses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study objectives</title><p id="Par12">With the work presented in this paper, we tested the feasibility of conducting a full-scale effect evaluation of an intervention developed for preventing stress-related ill health among new registered nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The intervention was developed based on the hypothesis that stress-related ill health among new registered nurses may be prevented by increasing their engagement in proactive behaviors and that the effect of increased engagement in proactive behaviors on stress would be mediated by increased mastery of occupational tasks, role clarity, and social acceptance. The intended primary outcome of the full-scale evaluation is stress as measured by a stress and energy questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

Recruitment took place at an information meeting at the hospital in September 2015 where all potential participants were scheduled to attend. Information about the study was given verbally and in writing by EF and AR. A signed informed consent was required for participation in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par15">Prior to this feasibility trial, to develop the intervention, we collected data from semi-structured interviews with 12 nurses (10 women; 2 men) working within their first 12&#x000a0;months of the profession (range 2&#x02013;12&#x000a0;months). The interviews were performed individually face-to-face by members of our research group (EF and AR plus others) with experience of conducting interviews. Each interview was approximately 60&#x000a0;min long. The focus of the interviews was to gather information about the challenges experienced by the new registered nurses as they entered the profession, related thoughts and emotions, and how they acted to manage the challenges. To get information-rich material, we sampled new registered nurses from different geographical regions, hospitals, and clinical specialties until saturation of information was achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The interviews were recorded using the Olympus Digital Voice Recorder WS-833 and transcribed verbatim prior to analysis by a third party with previous experience of transcribing interviews.</p><p id="Par16">The analysis of the material was conducted by EF, with ongoing input from AR, BL, and PG. A deductive content analysis approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] was used together with the principles of functional analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], as well as theories from organizational socialization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and stress research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] to analyze new registered nurses&#x02019; engagement in proactive behaviors with the purpose of clarifying how the behaviors were learnt and maintained. We also analyzed nurses&#x02019; avoidance behaviors in situations in which proactive behaviors would have been adaptive but were not present, as previous research has shown that engagement in proactive behaviors is at times inhibited by fear of aversive events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Finally, as exhaustion has been shown to reduce engagement in proactive behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and some leisure activities have been suggested to protect against exhaustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], we also analyzed the participants&#x02019; engagement in energizing leisure activities.</p><p id="Par17">Central to the functional analysis are the antecedents and consequences of behaviors. Antecedents (e.g., thoughts, emotions, or situational factors) function as signals indicating that certain consequences may be expected if a behavior is engaged in. Consequences follow on the behavior and may produce changes in the rate of the behavior over time (i.e., increase or decrease the likelihood of engaging in the behavior in the future) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The term behavior in this context refers to overt behaviors as well as covert behaviors such as cognitive and emotional processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Antecedents for new nurses&#x02019; proactive behaviors (e.g., asking for help and seeking information in documents and on the web) were the experience of uncertainty, the perception of colleagues&#x02019; willingness to help, and the perception of one&#x02019;s personal capability to execute the proactive behaviors. As presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, engagement in proactive behaviors led to increased task mastery, role clarity, and social acceptance, which in turn led to reduced perception of risks and stress, and facilitated future engagement in proactive behaviors.

These avoidance behaviors were maintained as they were followed by the termination of fear and distress. However, although the momentary distress was reduced, engagement in avoidance behaviors led to increased fear and stress over time as skills and knowledge were not developed, relationships were not strengthened, and professional roles were blurred. This negative spiral is illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b. The following are statements made by the respondents about avoidance of proactive behaviors.<disp-quote><p id="Par23">To take on the role as a leader of the team can be a real challenge. Many of the assistant nurses have worked for many years. And then you arrive, straight out of school, and you are supposed to tell people what to do.

And then it feels really stressful to go back to work. You feel as if you are a lousy nurse, and as if, I don&#x02019;t know, you have too much to do. And many times I believe that it is due to the fact that you have not taken a break. You are so concerned about making it all run smoothly. And then I feel that I am not very good at prioritizing my own tasks. I easily end up helping the assistant nurses, even though I should be reading up on information about the patients, or making a phone call to someone&#x02019;s relatives. I try to think, &#x0201c;What could I do differently?&#x0201d;. And I believe that, if I was able to pause for a little while, that would make a difference. But it is difficult to tell someone &#x0201c;You have to do this because I do not have the time right now&#x0201d;. It feels as if I am blocked by the stress that I am experiencing.

(ID 12)</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par28">The new nurses furthermore declared that they had cut down on engaging in social activities, hobbies, and exercise following the start of their new profession. Exhaustion and fear of exhaustion served as antecedents for engaging in passive behaviors such as lying in bed or sitting in the sofa watching television. However, although these passive behaviors reduced the immediate experience and fear of exhaustion, the restricted engagement in leisure activities led to increased exhaustion over time.</p><p id="Par29">In addition, shiftwork further contributed to the restricted engagement in leisure activities. Working day and evening shifts intermittently caused the new registered nurses to lose contact with antecedents and consequences of behaviors that they had previously engaged in, making them less likely to be engaged in further on.

(ID 1)</p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p id="Par33">It&#x02019;s a challenge to engage in leisure activities. For example, enrolling in a class that is planned for a specific night every week is not possible because you do not know if you will be scheduled for work on that night or not. It is a challenge to do something on a set time every week since one&#x02019;s schedule is always changing. (ID 5)</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par34">The development of the intervention was based on these analyses suggesting that, to facilitate new registered nurses&#x02019; proactivity, it is important that their engagement in avoidance behaviors is reduced and that engagement in leisure activities is increased. Behavior change models show that avoidance behaviors may be changed by intentionally approaching feared situations. If an individual approaches a previously avoided situation and notices that the feared consequences are not realized, the learnt avoidance behaviors begin to extinguish as memories of benevolent experiences in previously feared situations are acquired. This behavior change technique is known as systematic exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The challenge in getting this positive spiral in motion is refraining from engaging in avoidance behaviors when in contact with antecedents signaling that those behaviors would be followed by the reduction of fear. An additional behavior change technique referred to as action planning is used to overcome this challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Behavioral activation is a behavior change model that was developed for use in the treatment of clinical depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. According to this model, depression develops when people&#x02019;s actions are more likely to be met by aversive than appetitive consequences and people thus come to restrict their behavioral repertoire. As a consequence, engagement in behaviors that are followed by appetitive consequences is also restricted. By using a behavior change technique referred to as reinforcing approach behaviors together with action planning, people may come to re-engage in behaviors that are followed by appetitive consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The analysis suggested that these behavior change techniques may similarly be useful for supporting new registered nurses&#x02019; engagement in leisure activities.</p><p id="Par36">Involvement of key stakeholders has been shown to improve effects of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Therefore, after the analysis but prior to the feasibility trial, the manual of the intervention was read through by a nurse who had worked for almost 3&#x000a0;years. It was then used in individual contacts with three nurses during their first 3&#x000a0;months of working professionally (in 1-h meetings every other week). Finally, the core concepts of the intervention were used in four separate workshops of 2&#x000a0;h with a total of 65 new registered nurses. The workshops were conducted in a county in Sweden separate from the one included in the feasibility trial.</p><p id="Par37">At each step of this validation process, we investigated the nurses&#x02019; recognition of the antecedents and consequences of proactive and avoidance behaviors, as well as their recognition of the restriction in leisure activities and whether or not they found the proposed techniques for behavior change interesting and feasible. Following these tests, we refined and finalized the manual for the feasibility trial to further increase its acceptance.</p><p id="Par38">For the feasibility trial, the intervention was included in the schedule of a transition-to-practice program for new registered nurses. It consisted of two sessions of 2&#x000a0;h (i.e., in total 4&#x000a0;h per group) and took place at the hospital. The new registered nurses participated in the sessions in groups of approximately ten individuals. EF who is a licensed psychologist led all the sessions using the structured manual. The participants were given pamphlets covering the content of the sessions as well as worksheets for pen-and-paper exercises and homework assignments. No powerpoint presentations or other media were included in the intervention, but a whiteboard was used in both sessions. The full manual of the intervention can be obtained by contacting EF.</p><p id="Par39">The work in session 1 was focused on increasing leisure activities using the behavior change technique action planning and reinforcing approach behaviors. The session started with an overview of the intervention program and a discussion about the stress response, work-related stress, and stress-related ill health. The participating nurses were invited to share their thoughts on the subjects.</p><p id="Par40">Next, increasing leisure activities was presented as one way to reduce the risk of stress-related ill health, and the participating nurses worked individually with a pen-and-paper exercise. Finally, the work in the session was summarized and the new nurses were supported in formulating behavior change goals on the subject of increasing engagement in leisure activities. These behavior change goals constituted the homework assignment from session 1 to session 2.</p><p id="Par41">The work in session 2 was focused on reducing engagement in avoidance behaviors and increasing engagement in proactive behaviors using action planning and systematic exposure. First of all, the work from session 1 was repeated and experiences from the homework assignment were discussed. In addition, the participating nurses were encouraged to formulate new behavior change goals on the subject of increasing engagement in leisure activities building on their experience from the previous week.</p><p id="Par42">Next, avoidance behaviors were discussed in relation to stressful situations, including their short- and long-term consequences. The new nurses were supported in conducting individual analyses of engagement in avoidance behaviors in a pen-and-paper exercise. In addition, they were supported in identifying suitable proactive behaviors to engage in as alternatives to the avoidance behaviors. The challenges of engaging in proactive behaviors in situations where one has previously engaged in avoidance behaviors were discussed, together with the principles of systematic exposure. Finally, the new nurses were encouraged to formulate new behavior change goals with the purpose of reducing engagement in avoidance behaviors and increasing engagement in proactive behaviors. Before the last session was over, the content of the two sessions was revised.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Feasibility criteria</title><p id="Par43">There is not yet a consensus on what should be the focus of study in feasibility trials and what should be the feasibility criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].

According to Craig et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and Tebes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], randomized designs should always be considered when evaluating the effect of interventions because it is the most effective design to prevent the risk of selection bias leading to systematic differences in the samples being compared. However, it has been recognized that randomization is not always feasible. In such cases, evaluating the likelihood of selection bias is important to avoid incorrect interpretations of results. Thus, although this study did not aim to evaluate between-groups effects, we included a random allocation of participants to two groups in the design to investigate the feasibility of this procedure as well as the likelihood of selection bias when using this procedure. Allocation to groups was performed by the hospital as new nurses were registered to the transition-to-practice program (sequential allocation to the two groups, ratio 1:1). We evaluated the likelihood of selection bias using independent sample <italic>t</italic> tests of the differences between the groups on all study measures.</p><p id="Par52">We distributed the self-report measures using electronic surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] at baseline (time 0), just prior to the intervention (time 1), 1&#x000a0;week after the completion of the intervention (time 2), and at 5&#x000a0;weeks after the intervention (time 3). With the exception of the baseline survey, all surveys were distributed electronically using e-mail addresses that the participants reported when entering the study (the participants responded to the baseline survey electronically using a URL that was presented at the recruitment session). The surveys were closed, that is, each respondent received a survey with a specific identification number, and could only be responded to one single time. One reminder per survey was given to participants who had not responded after 1&#x000a0;week. Data on distribution and responses was extracted from the electronic survey tool.</p><p id="Par53">We evaluated the reliability of the self-report measures (perceived stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] [primary outcome], mastery of occupational tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], role clarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], social acceptance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] [process measures], engagement in proactive behaviors [developed based on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]], and avoidance of proactive behaviors [developed for this study] [behavior measures]) using Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha and analysis of mean inter-item correlation with data from time 0. A Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha above 0.70 is indicative of a good reliability in the measure. However, the estimate is sensitive to the number of items included in the analysis. The mean inter-item correlation analysis complements the analysis by providing an estimate for the mean correlation between the items included in the measure. A mean inter-item correlation of 0.20 suggests that there is sufficient homogeneity in the items [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. With the exception of the two behavioral measures that were developed for this trial, all measures were previously validated in Swedish working populations.

This has typically been linked to organizational factors such as high demands and time pressure making individuals too tired or too stressed to engage in proactive behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. However, in the process of developing the intervention, we identified a restriction in leisure behaviors engaged in by the new registered nurses that importantly contributed to the new registered nurses&#x02019; exhaustion. Changes in leisure activities related to exhaustion was similarly found in Duchscher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. We found that exhaustion functioned as an antecedent for engaging in passive behaviors such as excessively watching television and sleeping. The problem was further exasperated by loss of antecedents and consequences of engaging in energizing leisure activities. The results are in line with theories of stress suggesting that engagement in active forms of recovery may protect against exhaustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par76">The value of person-directed interventions to reduce the risk of stress-related ill health among nurses has similarly been recognized elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The high level of acceptability of the intervention in the present paper supports this idea. However, the focus on the behaviors of the new registered nurses in this study is not to be interpreted as implying that a person-directed intervention, although potentially valuable, would be a sufficient solution to the ubiquitous problem of stress-related ill health among new registered nurses. Interventions addressing the organization are clearly also important and may be effective (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]).</p><p id="Par77">Indeed, in the development of the intervention, it was recognized that perceived support from colleagues was one antecedent for engagement in proactive behaviors. This result is in line with previous research identifying co-worker and management support as an important factor affecting the establishment of newcomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. It has been suggested that an important question for future research concerns the interaction of factors supporting new professionals&#x02019; socialization at the individual level and the organizational level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In line with this suggestion, it would be interesting to investigate the effect of this present intervention in combination with a behavior change model that would target the behaviors of the experienced nurses. From a functional analytic point of view, if the experienced nurses were to encourage the new registered nurses to engage in proactive behaviors as well as acknowledge their efforts in doing so, this would be expected to increase the likelihood of engagement in proactive behaviors by the addition of both antecedents and consequences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par79">In sum, this study suggests that it would be feasible to conduct a full-scale evaluation of the effect of the intervention developed for preventing stress-related ill health among new registered nurses. Conducting a full-scale effect evaluation as part of an ongoing program for new professionals clearly presents some important challenges. By first investigating the feasibility of the study design, potential problems may be amended, resources may be conserved, the validity of the results is strengthened, and the risk of conducting a type II error is reduced. Devoting time to the development and feasibility testing of an intervention as opposed to primarily focusing on the effect evaluation is expected to result in stronger interventions that are more easy to evaluate, more likely to be implemented, and more worthwhile to implement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par079">In the development of the intervention, we decided that 12 new registered nurses was a sufficient sample for the analysis when no new information was provided in the interviews. It is possible that we would have gained additional information by including additional participants. However, the validity of the results and model were confirmed by a total of 69 new registered nurses and the new registered nurses in the feasibility trial found the intervention to be both acceptable and valuable. Therefore, it seems unlikely that additional participants in the interview phase would have resulted in a significantly different analysis and model.</p><p id="Par80">The purpose of a feasibility study is to answer the question of whether a full-scale evaluation can be done or not. Some issues of relevance to this question were not addressed in this study. We did not investigate training needs and competence required to lead the intervention. All sessions were led by the same licensed psychologist. This trial was also limited as we did only include one hospital (it is possible that other problem would have been present in other organizations), data on adherence to the manual was only self-reported (future trials should include video or audio recordings of the sessions), and we (EF, AR, BJ, PG) developed and gave the intervention, as well as evaluated the trial. In addition, we did not investigate potential harms of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Generalizability</title><p id="Par81">Conducting the feasibility trial as part of an ongoing transition-to-practice program ensured the ecological validity of the results. The full-scale effect evaluation of the intervention for preventing stress-related ill health among new registered nurses has been initiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The results of that trial will demonstrate if the intervention is effective in preventing stress-related ill health among new registered nurses and if the effect is mediated by increased mastery of task, role clarity, and social acceptance. If the intervention is found to be effective and it is successfully implemented, the work presented in this paper may contribute importantly to reducing the prevalence and consequences of stress-related ill health among new registered nurses in the transition from education to profession. Considering the general nature of avoidance of proactive behaviors when transitioning into a new profession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], it seems likely that the principles of this intervention developed for new nurses could also be useful for other professional groups (e.g., teachers, social workers, doctors).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank all the new registered nurses who have contributed to this work at different stages in the process.
