This study reports long-term follow-up results from our initial trial. All patients had clinical stage III or IVA locally advanced OSCC. In the experimental group, patients received two cycles of TPF induction chemotherapy (75mg/m<sup>2</sup> docetaxel d1, 75mg/m<sup>2</sup> cisplatin d1, and 750mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day 5-fluorouracil d1-5) followed by radical surgery and post-operative radiotherapy; in the control group, patients received upfront radical surgery and post-operative radiotherapy. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Among 256 enrolled patients with a median follow-up of 70 months, estimated 5-year overall survival, disease-free survival, locoregional recurrence-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival rates were 61.1%, 52.7%, 55.2%, and 60.4%, respectively. There were no significant differences in survival rates between experimental and control groups. However, patients with favorable pathologic responses had improved outcomes compared to those with unfavorable pathologic responses and to those in the control group. Although TPF induction chemotherapy did not improve long-term survival compared to surgery upfront in patients with stage III and IVA OSCC, a favorable pathologic response after induction chemotherapy may be used as a major endpoint and prognosticator in future studies. Furthermore, the negative results observed in this trial may be represent type II error from an underpowered study. Future larger scale phase III trials are warranted to investigate whether a significant benefit exists for TPF induction chemotherapy in surgically managed OSCC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>induction chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>oral squamous cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>cisplatin</kwd><kwd>docetaxel</kwd><kwd>5-fluorouracil</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The majority of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) present with locally advanced disease [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

However, patients who received TPF induction and had a favorable pathologic response had a decreased risk for death and tumor recurrence compared to those who did not have a favorable pathologic response and those did not receive TPF induction chemotherapy.</p><p>This trial also underscores the importance of complete resection of the primary tumor including use of frozen sections during surgery to confirm adequate margins for R0 resection. Since our practice changed to include intra-operative margin evaluation in 1990s, there was a significant reduction in the incidence of possible residual tumor cells, using pan-cytokeratin-confirmed positive margins (22.9% in cases operated on from 1985 to 1987, versus 0 in patients operated on after 2000 and in this study). This could explain the increases in the 5-year OS rates in China from approximately 40% in the 1990s to 61% in the present study [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. R0 resection may play a key role in prevention of local tumor recurrence and thus contribute to improved OS. In regards to quality of life after R0 resection, immediate reconstructive surgery following tumor resection utilizing free flaps or pedicle flaps provides acceptable appearance and adequate oral function for OSCC patients at an otherwise late clinical stage.</p><p>Although OSCC patients treated with TPF induction chemotherapy did not have a significant increase in OS rates as a whole compared to those unexposed to induction chemotherapy, a trend towards improved survival was noted for those patients receiving induction chemotherapy. Previous meta-analyses have demonstrated that induction chemotherapy could reduce distant metastasis formation in patients with locally advanced HNSCC [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In our study, patients receiving TPF induction chemotherapy had a 9%-higher 5-year DMFS than those not receiving TPF induction chemotherapy; this difference, however, was not statistically significant. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that cN2 patients receiving TPF induction chemotherapy had a better outcome than those not receiving TPF induction chemotherapy, especially in OS and DMFS. Therefore, induction chemotherapy could play a role in improving outcomes in patients at the highest risk of distant failure. As a result, a prospective trial of TPF induction chemotherapy in cN2 patients has been designed to confirm the subgroup analysis findings from this study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> registered number of NCT02290145).</p><p>Patients with a favorable pathologic response to TPF induction chemotherapy had a more than 80% 5-year survival rate. In contrast, patients without a favorable pathologic response had similar outcomes compared to those patients who did not receive TPF induction chemotherapy. This may be very important in developing future personalized treatment strategies for OSCC. Along these lines, we have identified several proteins that could serve as predictive biomarkers in tissue specimens from patients who received TPF in this study, including Cyclin D1 and GDF15. cN2 patients with high Cyclin D1 expression exhibited significantly prolonged OS and DMFS after TPF induction chemotherapy, as did T3-4cN0 patients with high GDF15 expression [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These two biomarkers have been selected as predictive biomarkers for response to TPF induction chemotherapy and are being prospectively evaluated in two ongoing induction chemotherapy clinical trials in OSCC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> registered numbers of NCT02285543 and NCT02285530).</p><p>In conclusion, our long-term results do not support the use of TPF induction chemotherapy for all patients with locally advanced OSCC, receiving radical surgery followed by radiotherapy. However, specific patient populations defined by clinical and/or molecular criteria may benefit from induction TPF, and this selection strategy is currently being evaluated in prospective clinical trials with the ultimate goal of realizing personalized treatment protocols for this disease. In addition, the apparent lack of benefit for TPF induction chemotherapy, observed in this study may or may not be type II error secondary to an underpowered study. In the future, larger scale phase III trials are needed to determine whether there truly exists a role for TPF induction chemotherapy in the treatment of surgically managed OSCC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>The methodology of the original study has been previously published [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].
