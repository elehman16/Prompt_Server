<bold><italic>Introduction:</italic></bold> Team-based learning is one of the active
learning approaches in which independent learning is combined with small group discussion
in the class. This study aimed to determine the impact of team-based learning in nervous
system examination knowledge of nursing students.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Methods:</italic></bold> This quasi-experimental study was conducted on
3<sup>rd</sup> grade nursing students, including 5th semester (intervention group) and
6<sup>th</sup> semester (control group). The traditional lecture method and the
team-based learning method were used for educating the examination of the nervous system
for intervention and control groups, respectively. The data were collected by a test
covering 40-questions (multiple choice, matching, gap-filling and descriptive questions)
before and after intervention in both groups. Individual Readiness Assurance Test (RAT)
and Group Readiness Assurance Test (GRAT) used to collect data in the intervention group.
In the end, the collected data were analyzed by SPSS ver. 13 using descriptive and
inferential statistical tests.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Results:</italic></bold> In team-based learning group, mean and standard
deviation was 13.39 (4.52) before the intervention, which had been increased to 31.07
(3.20) after the intervention and this increase was statistically significant. Also, there
was a statistically significant difference between the scores of RAT and GRAT in
team-based learning group.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Conclusion:</italic></bold> Using team-based learning approach resulted in
much better improvement and stability in the nervous system examination knowledge of
nursing students compared to traditional lecture method; therefore, this method could be
efficiently used as an effective educational approach in nursing education.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Team-based learning</kwd><kwd>Learning</kwd><kwd>Physical examination</kwd><kwd>Neurologic examination</kwd><kwd>Knowledge</kwd><kwd>Nursing students</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="3"/><ref-count count="39"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta><notes><p> Please cite this paper as: Hemmati Maslakpak M, Parizad N, Zareie F.

the health status of the patients to achieve a professional clinical judgment. The nursing
assessments are the determinants of the nursing interventions which have direct and indirect
influence on the health status of the patients.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>This process increases the ability of the nurses in monitoring and
determining the changes in the patients' condition and allows nurses to use their
theoretical knowledge in different clinical situations.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>Developing health assessment
skills can help the nurses to make more accurate diagnosis.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>Many nursing faculties in the U.S believe that health assessment
training is an important and essential part of nursing students' education<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and according to professional nursing
performance standards, it is critical.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>Therefore, choosing the right method to achieve successful learning is
crucial for the students.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p> The lecture is the most common educational method in medical groups.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>But, this method is not suitable for all
educational purposes.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>Limiting the
capabilities of the students in participating and answering the questions,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>loss of concentration of the students over
time,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>reduction of absorption,
stability and remembering the subjects,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> inactive role of students,<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and boringlecture<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> are the some reasons which have made lecture among the least
effective teaching methods.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>The search
for some solutions for these deficits resulted in development of new methods for active
learning<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>that different approaches
are proposed in their application.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p> Team-based learning (TBL) is an active learning approach which has been designed in order
to help the students achieve the goals of a training course and the manner of working in a
team.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>This accelerates the change in
the teaching method and can be considered as a replacement for the traditional lecture
method.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In this new approach,
students are first given the educational information and then, they are divided into smaller
groups in classes, each group is given a problem-based learning (PBL) scenario to stimulate
the discussion among the students. This help students to exchange the information about the
topic and use previously given information to solve the problem through practical
way.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>According to the approach developed by Hunt et al., the primary goal of
a team-based learning is to build student self-confidence by giving them a chance to
practice using the concepts that they have learned during the previous courses. This
approach results in spending the majority of the class time on team working by using the
practical assignments.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p> Team-based learning in nursing results in decreasing tension and study time and increasing
preparation time for the class among nursing students, which make it possible to allocate
more time for discussion about complicated nursing topics.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Other advantages of this method includes increasing class
dynamics,<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> students involvement in
class discussions,<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> increasing
differential diagnosis skills in students and clinical experiences, decreasing the economic
costs,<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> enhancing
self-learning,<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and stimulating
higher levels of knowledge based on performance.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Moreover, team-based learning improves student performances in some
healthcare educational courses.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>Therefore, this approach is recognized as an effective educational method
due to its high applicability.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p> Different studies have shown that using this new method could lead to improving students
learning and increases students&#x02019; scores.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>Pileggi and O&#x02019;Neill's showed that the
performance of the students has been improved following team-based learning method. In this
study, the mean score of the final exam in the team based education course had also been
increased as compared with the traditional lecture based courses.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>Vasan etal.,<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and Letassy etal.,<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> in
the different studies showed the same results. It has also been found through investigation
of the students' attitude toward this method that all students were satisfied with
team-based learning and they had positive feedback about it.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p> There are, however, conflicting data on whether TBL improves knowledge outcomes compared
to other educational techniques. Haidet et al.,<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>did not find a significant difference in knowledge outcomes between TBL
and lectures. But, some found improved examination scores in the TBL group while using the
historical controls has made its interpretation difficult.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>Others found improvement in some aspects. <sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p> Based on the aforementioned literature review, learning is basically a social activity,
and considering the significance of health assessment in developing of clinical skills and
professional capabilities of nursing students and according to the promising results of
team-based learning, our aim in this study was to determine the effectiveness of using this
active educational method on nervous system examination knowledge in nursing students of
Urmia nursing and midwifery faculty.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p> This is a quasi-experimental study conducted with the aim of determining the impact of
team-based learning in nervous system examination knowledge in nursing students at the
Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) course from Urmia nursing and midwifery faculty, a big
urban city in the northwest of Iran in 2013.</p><p> All nursing students at 5th and 6th semester were invited to participate in this study and
were selected through a census. Fifth semester students (n=32) were assigned as the
intervention group and sixth semester students (n=30) were considered as the control group.
Researchers obtained ethics approval from the ethics committee of the Uremia Medical
University and nursing students filled out the informed consent form. Based on the
principles mentioned in previous researches<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>and obeying 3S proposed by
Michelson (same problem, specific case and simultaneously report), an adjusted TBL design
was used in the intervention group and the traditional lecture method was used for the
control group to provide educational content. To collect data a 40-question test in the
format of multiple choice, matching, gap-filling, and descriptive questions with several
modifications in writing questions as scenarios. The maximum score was 40 for pre-test and
post-test sections. Students had 20 minutes to answer all 40 questions. In this test, the
demographic characterizations of the students including age, sex, score in health status
assessment course which were passed in the 2<sup>nd</sup> semester and grade point average
(GPA) was also collected. The content validity method was used to determine the validity of
the test. Thus, the data gathering instrument was prepared by using literature review and
referring to related books and articles. Then its content was given to 10 faculty members at
Urmia University of Medical Sciences for critical review. For investigating the reliability
pilot study (10 nursing students in 7<sup>th</sup>semester) was conducted and the Cronbach
alpha was 0.88.</p><p> Before starting the study, a pre-test was taken from all nursing students to determine
their knowledge in the nervous system examination. After the pretest, at the "First Phase",
the educational materials in the form of booklets and educational slides as a module about
nervous system examination skills were given to all students. The students in the
intervention group were given one week to study these materials. At the Second Phase,
intervention was performed as an 8-hour workshop with TBL group. As soon as starting the
workshop, the students answered individual Readiness Assurance Test (RAT) to assess their
perception of the learned knowledge and concepts in the first Phase. RAT consisted of 40
questions in various formats from the educational module. Giving correct answers to these
questions required using topics that the students should have learned in the first phase.
Immediately, after finishing the RAT and collecting the papers, the students were randomly
assigned to 6 groups of 5 or 6 numbers and the same test was taken from the teams in a
different format. This step called Group Readiness Assurance test (GRAT), each team should
come to an agreement by all team members to choose one answer to each question. After
answering by all groups and collecting the GRAT papers, each group discussed and justified
its own answers with other groups.</p><p> The teacher, as a facilitator, discussed about all questions and answers with the students
and clarified any concepts that the students might have problems with, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="JCS-4-331-g001"/><statement><p>The conduction pattern of the research in intervention group</p></statement></fig><p> The students in the control group received the educational content through traditional
lecture method. Finally, five weeks after performing the research, a post-test was taken
individually and with the changes in writing of questions from the intervention and control
groups. Post-tests consisted of the same scenarios as the pre-test, but the order of
scenarios and questions randomly scrambled. Data we reanalyzed by SPSS software ver. 13
using descriptive and inferential statistical tests (Chi square, paired-sample t-test and
Independent t-test).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p> In this study, 40% and 50% of the subjects in control group and intervention group were

the scores in nursing students in individual Readiness Assurance Test (RAT) was 25.05
(3.36), while it increased to 31.68 (1.33) in Group Readiness Assurance Test (GRAT). Paired
t-test showed a statistically significant difference between the mean scores in the RAT and
GRAT in the intervention group (P&#x0003c;0.001).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p> The present study results showed that using the team- based learning in comparing with
traditional lecture-based learning leaded to significant improvement in knowledge of nursing
students as the primary outcome of the study. Arisen a significant difference between two
groups in the post-test that was held 5 weeks following TBL performance, showed a
significant improvement in students learning with the TBL method in comparison with the
traditional lecture method. Consistent with the results of this study, the majority of the
previous studies which have dealt with the comparison of the knowledge scores of students
using TBL and lecture based methods, show that the scores in the team-based learning course
are higher.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p> The obtained improvement in students' performance in this project is consistent with the
results achieved by Koles et al.,<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>and
Wiener et al.,<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> in which the students
showed greater dominance on the contents in the TBL group compared with other traditional
approaches and non-TBL methods. Increased the examination scores with TBL was found in other
studies which had compared it with other approaches such as self-studying.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The
results of another crossover study with the aim of comparing active learning through TBL
with inactive learning by self-studying showed that the post-test mean scores in the
intervention group was significantly higher than control group.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> This finding is supported through numerous other studies in
which the score improvement has been reported by TBL.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p> Based on the results of the previous researches, there are few contradictory data about
the further improvement of learning outcomes with TBL compared with the other educational
techniques which are contrary to our findings. Haidet et al., compared the TBL-like active
learning method with inactive lecture method and there was no significant difference was
found in scores between the two groups.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>
The reason for this can be attributed to the difference in the way TBL was performed or the
heterogeneity of participants (as mentioned in Tan's et al., study).<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>What is more apparent in the previous studies
about disadvantages of the TBL related to its effectivness to various topics presented in
the research, using TBL led to improve some of the topics, not all of them.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p> In this study, the post-test score in TBL compared with pre-test had been surprisingly
increased; such that the mean score in the class had reached from 13 to 31 point from total
40 point. This difference is more important to know that the post-test was taken 5 weeks
after performing TBL while students were unaware of the post-test and most likely resulted
in their lack of study; therefore, it could be concluded that this high mean score in class
and remembering the contents by students can be a net effect of TBL method. The results of a
study with the aim of evaluating effectiveness and efficiency of TBL showed that the
students in the pre-test was in the least knowledge level (the mean score of 36.9%) but this
reached to 63.4% in GRAT which had been considered as a post-test that showed a significant
improvement in the students' performance with TBL.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> However, considering GRAT as a post-test cannot be a proper criteria to
be compared with pretest in this study, because it is clear that the Group Readiness
Assurance test score which is obtained from individuals in the group will be higher compared
to the individual scores. In general, reason for increasing TBL scores can be related to
factors such as reinforcing and utilizing the concepts, increasing students' involvement in
class discussions, and creating meaningful learning.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p><p> Although, we didn&#x02019;t intend to assess retaining the contents with TBL but performing
post-test 5 weeks after conducting the research in the intervention group retained the
contents much more than control group. From this viewpoint, our study finding is consistent
with other studies that show that the knowledge can be retained better following
TBL.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> On the other hand, the student
in the control group hadn&#x02019;t been able to achieve significant improvement in retaining the
contents which shows that the presented topics through lecture are forgotten
faster.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p> Our findings in this research showed that the mean score of the students in the
intervention group in GRAT was significantly higher than RAT. Our result was similar to
these<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> In the Pileggi et al., and O'Neal et al., studies, the mean of missed
questions (unanswered) in RAT and GRAT was 8.29 and 2.98 respectively, which this had led to
a higher score of GRAT compared with an individual RAT score.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> In the Persky et al., study, the score of RAT and GRAT was 86%
and 97%, respectively.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p><p> In the present study, there was no significant correlation between students' total GPA and
the amount of progress in scores by TBL. This means that the weak and strong students were
benefited to the same amount from the TBL education. This finding is inconsistent with other
study results that indicate TBL has more effect on weaker students.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p><p> The strength of the current study is the delayed post-test that had measured retaining the
contents in mind addition to the effect of TBL on knowledge improvement. Also not using true
or false questions on the taken tests, is another advantage of this study. Because this type
of question has inherent limitations.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><p> Adjusting the performance of TBL is the main limitation in this study. Full performance of
TBL consists of three major phases (preparation before the class, individual and Group
Readiness Assurance tests and finally using the obtained knowledge from first and second
phases in clinical problems)<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> that it had
been focused on the first two phases in this study. The main reason for expressing this
limitation is that the lack of full performance of TBL may lead to negative results
regarding the efficiency of this approach.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Although, this hadn&#x02019;t happened in this study, it was possible that if
fully performed, more positive results could be achieved and caused no change in the main
aspects and the nature of the findings; a point that other researchers have also
mentioned.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Moreover, this is TBL
features that in some parts because of its flexibility allows teachers to choose one or more
phases depend on the concept and the course's demand. Also, several other studies have been
used adjusted TBL design because of their research conditions.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Small sample size of
research groups was another limitation in this study. So, it is recommended that
experimental studies to be conducted with a higher sample size to support the positive
results about the efficiency of the TBL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p> Using TBL method compared to the traditional lecture approach resulted in more improvement
and stability in the knowledge of nursing students in the nervous system examination skills.
Therefore, using TBL can result in higher preparation of nursing students for the class and
allocating more time for class discussions about complicated nursing topics. Thus, according
to the findings of the current study, it might be concluded that using TBL in nursing
education could be used to promote the learning quality of nursing students.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p> The cooperation of all professors and students in this project is highly appreciated. This
