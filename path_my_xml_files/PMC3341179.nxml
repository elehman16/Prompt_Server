Tampering with a formulation of morphine sulfate and sequestered naltrexone hydrochloride extended release capsules (MS-sNT) releases both the opioid morphine and the antagonist naltrexone. A study in recreational opioid-users indicated that morphine and naltrexone injected in the 25:1 ratio (duplicating the ratio of the formulation) found MS-sNT reduced morphine-induced euphoric effects vs intravenous (IV) morphine alone. In the same study, the effects of morphine + naltrexone on end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>), a measure of respiratory-depression, were evaluated and these data are reported here.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Single-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study.

Since 1999, poisoning deaths in the United States involving opioid analgesics have more than tripled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]; deaths from opioid analgesics have surpassed those from heroin and cocaine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Although prescription opioids may be formulated for oral use, they are often taken intravenously or intranasally when abused [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. As tolerance to opioid psychoactive effects increases with use over time, the user often progresses from the oral route to the intranasal or intravenous (IV) route to attain greater opioid effects and more rapid onset of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Respiratory depression is the leading cause of death following opioid overdose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Opioids interact with &#x003bc;-opioid receptors, reducing the central nervous system responsiveness to hypercapnia and hypoxia, and the peripheral chemoreceptor response to hypercarbia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Respiratory depression involves inadequate response to hypercapnia or hypoxia, resulting in a decrease in respiratory rate and/or decrease in minute ventilation below normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Respiratory depression can be defined as a deviation of respiratory rate, pulse oximetry value, or carbon dioxide tension from an arbitrary threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Opioid-induced respiratory depression can occur within minutes of IV injection and typically can result in death in &#x0003c; 1 to 3 hours following opioid exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Respiratory depression can be reversed by timely administration of an opioid antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, as respiratory depression can develop within minutes, the interval for successful intervention can be short [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, timely intervention is not always possible because overdose often occurs in a non-hospital setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In a review of medical examiner data, more than half of the individuals who died from accidental drug overdoses had already expired before they reached the emergency department [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Naltrexone, a competitive, selective &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonist, is available in oral and injectable formulations for treatment of alcohol dependence and blockade of opioid effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Although it is not currently indicated for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression, naltrexone may provide an early intervention option to reduce deaths from opioid-induced respiratory depression.</p><p>Naltrexone is a component of morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride extended release capsules (MS-sNT, EMBEDA<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>), indicated for moderate-to-severe pain when a continuous, around-the-clock opioid analgesic is needed for an extended period of time. The formulation contains pellets of extended release morphine, each with a sequestered core of naltrexone hydrochloride at a fixed 25:1 ratio of morphine sulfate:naltrexone hydrochloride (4% naltrexone) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Taken as directed, morphine provides analgesia while the naltrexone remains sequestered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The product is designed so that tampering by crushing will rapidly release morphine and naltrexone. The released naltrexone is available to reduce morphine-induced effects, such as euphoria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The quantity of naltrexone sequestered in MS-sNT (e.g., 4% of the morphine dose or 1.2 mg of naltrexone in a capsule containing 30 mg of morphine) is substantially lower than that used clinically (50 mg once daily oral dose) for blockade of opioid effects or alcohol dependence or that which yields 90% occupancy of human opiate receptors (32-48 mg total daily oral dose) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Results of an earlier study in non-dependent opioid-experienced volunteers have shown that the naltrexone in crushed MS-sNT taken orally was successful in mitigating morphine-induced subjective effects, such as drug liking and euphoria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Similarly, this study in non-dependent recreational opioid users was designed to simulate IV injection of tampered MS-sNT and was conducted by injecting morphine sulfate (30 mg) and naltrexone hydrochloride (1.2 mg) in the same 25:1 ratio in the MS-sNT formulation. When both morphine and naltrexone were administered intravenously, naltrexone reduced morphine-induced euphoric effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This study also included measurements of end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations using noninvasive capnography as an exploratory end point. As EtCO<sub>2 </sub>monitoring in the operating room is standard practice for evaluating ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], it may be considered a surrogate end point of respiratory depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The EtCO<sub>2 </sub>measurements from this IV morphine and naltrexone study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] are presented here to consider whether the naltrexone within MS-sNT could attenuate respiratory depression in opioid overdose if MS-sNT were crushed and taken intravenously.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a single-center, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, 3-way crossover study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

These data were published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Evaluation of effects on respiratory depression as measured by EtCO<sub>2 </sub>was a secondary, exploratory objective of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and these data are reported here.

The naltrexone contained in MS-sNT was designed for release if there is tampering, to mitigate the psychogenic effects of morphine, such as drug liking, high, and euphoria. The current analysis reports results of an exploratory outcome (which was part of the Webster et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]), which assessed the impact of naltrexone on EtCO<sub>2</sub>, a surrogate measure of respiratory depression, when naltrexone was coadministered intravenously with morphine in the ratio (4%) present in the MS-sNT formulation.

A rising EtCO<sub>2 </sub>can reflect hypoventilation, which may precede other signs of respiratory depression such as hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Although there is no consensus on measures that define clinically relevant respiratory depression, an EtCO<sub>2 </sub>&#x0003e; 50 mm Hg has been used as a criterion for respiratory depression in clinical trials during procedural sedation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In the current trial, the highest individual levels measured with the morphine + naltrexone and the placebo treatments were 49 mm Hg. A retrospective review of the data indicates that there were 4 subjects who had values &#x0003e; 50 mm Hg, all with the morphine treatment. The highest individual level with the morphine treatment was 61 mm Hg. A change in EtCO<sub>2 </sub>of &#x02265; 10 mm Hg had been suggested as an additional indicator of respiratory depression in patients under sedation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Three subjects in the placebo arm, 6 in the morphine + naltrexone arm, and 13 in the morphine arm (including 3 of the 4 subjects with EtCO<sub>2 </sub>&#x02265; 50 mm Hg), had changes &#x02265; 10 mm Hg. As subjects in this study were awake rather than sedated, the clinical relevance of these changes is unknown, although the changes of increasing EtCO<sub>2 </sub>may indicate early respiratory suppression.</p><p>Results of the study reported here for EtCO<sub>2 </sub>are similar to those reported by Stoops et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], in which physiological measures for morphine (arterial oxygen saturation and pupil diameter) were apparent within 5 minutes of IV drug administration (5, 10, and 20 mg morphine doses) and were maintained for approximately 6 hours following opioid dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The subjective psychodynamic effects of IV administration of opioids are also apparent early, within 10 minutes, of opioid dosing, but begin to decrease within 30 minutes after dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The observation that the physiological effects (EtCO<sub>2</sub>, oxygen saturation and pupil diameter) last much longer than the subjective effects has clinical relevance. Individuals who abuse opioids may be unaware of the continuing physiological effects of the first opioid dose and the potential for compounding effects on respiratory depression by injecting additional opioid, and may re-inject opioid once subjective effects have begun to subside [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This also illustrates that &#x003bc;-opioid receptor PD effects have different rates of onset, duration of effects, and slopes of dissipation. The effect of naltrexone coadministered with morphine on reduction of EtCO<sub>2 </sub>values vs morphine alone was evident as early as 5 minutes and continued through 8 hours when the difference diminished (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The prolonged action of morphine was longer than the effect of the naltrexone blockage, as the mean EtCO<sub>2 </sub>values were similar between morphine + naltrexone compared with morphine alone at 12 hours (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This suggests that additional dosing of antagonist may be needed if a patient were to have clinically significant morphine-induced respiratory depression.</p><p>Results of this exploratory outcome are limited to 1 surrogate measure of respiratory function, using a set dose of morphine/naltrexone, at designated time frames, in a small, male population in a specific setting. The effects of naltrexone alone were also not evaluated in this study. Clinical significance was not assessed in this study, although no subjects were reported by the investigator to show signs of clinically relevant respiratory depression. In addition, this study was a clinical simulation of IV administration of tampered (fully crushed) MS-sNT, rather than administration of actual tampered product, due to concern about potential injury to the cardiopulmonary system from injection of excipients such as talc and particulate matter that may be present in crushed MS-sNT. This further limits the extrapolation to effects on EtCO<sub>2 </sub>of abuse by injection of actual crushed MS-sNT. Future studies using an array of validated and sensitive measures of respiratory depression, at opioid doses relevant for respiratory depression, would be needed to demonstrate consistent changes in these parameters and to document effects on clearly defined respiratory function. Assessments to accurately measure the early onset of opioid-induced respiratory depression and withdrawal would provide valuable clinically meaningful information. However, while these assessments can be performed under research conditions in a clinical setting, it is important to recognize that overdoses often occur in the community setting with many confounding factors and without access to measurement tools.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Results of this exploratory analysis demonstrate significant reduction in EtCO<sub>2 </sub>after IV morphine + naltrexone vs morphine alone. Further, EtCO<sub>2 </sub>levels were not significantly different between morphine + naltrexone and placebo, emphasizing the PD effect of naltrexone displacement of morphine from the &#x003bc;-opioid receptor. This is the first indication that abuse of MS-sNT by crushing and injection may not only abate morphine-induced drug liking and euphoria but may also attenuate morphine-induced effects on EtCO<sub>2</sub>. Further studies using an array of sensitive measures of respiratory depression to determine the impact of coadministration of morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride in the 25:1 ratio present in MS-sNT on measures of respiratory depression may increase understanding of the harm reduction potential of MS-sNT.</p></sec><sec><title>Disclosures</title><p>LRW has received consultant and advisory board honoraria and research funding from Adolor Corp.; Alkermes, Inc.; Allergan, Inc.; American Board of Pain Medicine; Astellas Pharma US, Inc.; AstraZeneca; Bayer HealthCare; BioDelivery Systems International; Boston Scientific, Corp.; Cephalon, Inc.; Collegium Pharmaceuticals; Covidien; Covidien Mallinckrodt; Eisai Co., Ltd.; Elan Pharmaceuticals; Gilead Sciences; GlaxoSmithKline; Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Meagan Medical; Medtronic; Nektar Therapeutics; NeurogesX, Inc; Nevro Corporation; PharmacoFore, Inc.; Purdue Pharma; Shionogi USA, Inc; St Renatus; SuCampo Pharma Americas, USA; TEVA Pharmaceuticals (Sub-I); Theravance, Inc.; Vertex Pharmaceuticals; Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and King Pharmaceuticals<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, LLC which was acquired by Pfizer in March 2011.
