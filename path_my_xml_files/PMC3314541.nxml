More than thirty years of war have left the lives of two generations of Afghans disrupted. Afghanistan is among the least developed countries in the world, ranking 181 (out of 182) nations in the Human Development Index 2009 of the United Nations.</p><p>Studies investigating the mental health status of the Afghan population report extraordinarily high levels of mental health related problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Lopes Cardozo and colleagues conducted a national mental health survey in 2002 and reported that 73% of the Afghans suffer from symptoms of depression, 84% from symptoms of anxiety and 59% were diagnosed with PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Continuous stressors, such as the loss of beloved ones, homes and jobs, poverty-related suffering, child labour, traumatising events and drug abuse affect the functioning of families and whole communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. They are likely to exert their toll on the mental health of the Afghan population at large [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the recovery of mental health and the improvement of quality of life standards constitute preconditions for building civil society and promoting peace and stability within Afghanistan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>However, until a few years ago, mental health facilities were practically nonexistent in Afghanistan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A report by the World Health Organization that focused on the Afghan mental health system stated that in 2005 there were only eight psychiatrists, 18 psychiatric nurses, and 20 mental health professionals for a population of 27 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>At the same time, many studies indicated that even under resource-poor and ongoing unsafe conditions with limited financial and professional resources, such as in Afghanistan, an effective treatment of mental health problems can be provided, especially through a psychotherapeutic approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Accordingly, Neuner and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] showed that effective psychotherapy can be provided by persons having received no more than a short-term training of 6 weeks. The study showed that mental health of Ugandan refugees living under unstable and unsafe conditions were greatly improved. Schaal and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], investigating counselling treatment in a war-affected sample of Rwandan genocide orphans, showed that even a small number of counselling sessions can significantly improve the mental health status of participants. These studies, showing the effectiveness of short-time interventions and the ability of counsellors with limited training to successfully conduct therapy are consistent with the findings of Rahman and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], who trained community health workers in treating mothers with depression in rural Pakistan within four sessions. The mentioned studies indicate that counselling is feasible even with limited resources and that it is effective for populations living in conflict settings. The need of the Afghan population for mental health services was recognised by the Ministry of Public Health of Afghanistan. In a revised version of the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS), the Mental Health Component was changed from a purely medical treatment approach (edition 2005) to a bio-psychosocial treatment approach (2010) within the BPHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As a result, psychosocial counselling services were integrated as a treatment method into the Primary Health Care System of the country. Supporting this effort and approach of the Ministry of Public Health, the Caritas Germany/EU Project provided counselling services in selected health centres affiliated with health facilities of the BPHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] in three provinces of Afghanistan, one being located in Mazar-e-Sharif.</p><p>To our knowledge, there have been no studies to date, which have systematically investigated the effectiveness of a psychotherapeutic intervention in Afghanistan. The present investigation was designed to fill this gap. We aimed at examining the mental health status of help seeking Afghans suffering from mental health problems. For this purpose, we assessed the severity of symptoms of depression and anxiety and the extent of psychosocial stressors. The study hypothesised that individuals who were diagnosed by local physicians with symptoms of depression and anxiety would benefit from psychosocial counselling in terms of an improvement in the primary outcome (symptom reduction). Additionally, we expected an enhancement of coping strategies and a reduction of psychosocial stressors in the counselling group. Eventually, we assumed that the change in the severity of mental health symptoms, associated with depression and anxiety, would be related (positively correlated with) to the change in the amount of social stressors reported by the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Settings and local team</title><p>The present investigation was conducted in the Balkh province of Afghanistan, in its capital Mazar-e-Sharif, for the purpose of a scientific evaluation of the implementation of psychosocial counselling into the Afghan health system. The implementation process had been initialized in three provinces of the country. As the trial site, we chose Mazar-e-Sharif, 320 km northwest of Kabul, as it provided relative security and stability at the time of the study. The counselling centre was located in a suburban district.</p><p>Diagnostic interviews were conducted by two experienced local counsellors (male and female) and two international experts (both female), one fluent in the local language (Dari). A third local experienced counsellor served as a translator to one of the international experts. The international experts had received training in clinical diagnosis using structured interviews. The two experienced local counsellors had also assisted in a previous epidemiological survey in Kabul, conducted by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Subsequent therapies were carried out at the counselling centre by newly trained local counsellors.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>In September and October 2009, a sample of 66 mental health patients (63 female, 3 male) seeking help at a Primary Health Care Centre in Mazar-e-Sharif were recruited by our team. Since the aim of our study was to assess the common treatment for mental health patients in Afghanistan, the participants were enrolled into the study solely upon the autonomous examination and subsequent referral by independent local physicians. According to their medical records none of them met our exclusion criteria (neurological disorder, mental retardation, dementia, or schizophrenia). To allow randomisation, our team allocated the participants to one of the treatment conditions based on a daily alternation routine, meaning that alternately, one day patients were allocated to the medication group, and the next day to the counselling group.</p><p>A written informed consent, explaining the procedure and the nature of the particular treatment was read out to each patient. As the illiteracy of the sample was high (73,9%), patients willing to participate gave written or oral consent. The study was approved by the Ethical Review Board of the University of Konstanz.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>All instruments were translated by local experienced counsellors into Dari using blind back translation. Discrepancies were checked by experts and a final version was derived through extensive consultation with local counsellors from the Balkh province. Due to the high illiteracy rate, all instruments were used in the form of structured interviews in which questions were read aloud to the patients.</p><sec><title>Sociodemographic characteristics</title><p>Questions related to sociodemography assessed information on sex, age, ethnicity, religion, marital status, educational level, living arrangements and conditions. Additionally, we inquired into the use of medication in order to control unsupervised self-medication in both treatment groups.</p><sec><title>Primary outcome measures</title><sec><title>HSCL-25</title><p>The Hopkins Symptom Checklist 25 was used to screen for symptoms of depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This screening tool is composed of a 15-item subscale for depression and a 10-item subscale for anxiety, with answer choices ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). It has been used widely in studies of refugees and other war-affected populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], including four studies in Afghanistan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], providing outcomes at symptom, but not at diagnosis level. This screening instrument has proven to be a reliable and valid instrument for measuring symptoms of depression and anxiety in various countries and cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moreover, the HSCL depression scale has been found to have high reliability and validity in multiple studies with medical patients, and being sensitive to change in depressed primary care patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>M.I.N.I</title><p>To assess whether the patients suffered from a current Major Depression, the depression section from the "Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] was included. The M.I.N.I. is a short structured diagnostic interview for DSM-IV and ICD-10 psychiatric disorders. Patients were asked to indicate which of the depression symptoms they had experienced within the two weeks preceding the interview. Validation studies have shown good validity and reliability in making diagnoses in less time than conventional structured interviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Screening for Depression</title><p>A culturally grounded assessment measure was developed in close collaboration with the "Mental Health Working Group Afghanistan", consisting of international and Afghan mental health professionals and practitioners (SAMHSA), which supports the Ministry of Public Health of Afghanistan in establishing and implementing mental health services in the country. This screening instrument explored current depressive symptoms on a 4-point-Likert-scale between 0 (never) and 3 (always). The cumulated sum of responses to the 8 items gives an image of the severity of depressive symptoms on a continuum between 0 and 24. This interview screened for culture-specific indicators of depressive symptoms and was developed to provide a first screening tool for the Primary Health Care sector in the particular Afghan context. Items concern the somatic domain (<italic>How often do you have pain anywhere in your body that comes and goes, such as headache, stomach pain, heart racing or high blood pressure?)</italic>, for feeling change (<italic>How often do you experience the feeling of not caring about your family/children anymore?)</italic>, social isolation <italic>(How often do you feel lonely?)</italic>, behavioural changes <italic>(Has there been any change in your participation in everyday life?)</italic>, harm to self or others <italic>(How often are you so desperate or out of control, that against your will, you want to hit yourself or others?)</italic>, suicidality <italic>(Have you ever tried to end your life? If yes: Do you now want to end your life?) </italic>and ability to act on one's behalf <italic>(Have you tried out things to feel better or solve these problems?)</italic>. Two additional questions checked for a psychosocial origin of the symptoms and drug abuse.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><sec><title>Psychosocial stressors &#x00026; coping mechanisms</title><p>Interviews were conducted, according to the manual "Professional Package for Psychosocial Counsellors working in the BPHS in Afghanistan" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], identifying psychosocial stressors and coping mechanisms among the patients. For the assessment of psychosocial stressors, a checklist of 11 different types of stressors was provided. The following psychosocial stressors, describing common problems in the Afghan society, were checked: <italic>Family conflicts - interpersonal conflicts - difficult life transition - grief and loss - personal difficulties - sexual problems - traumatic experience - domestic violence - migration - poverty - changing gender roles and values</italic>. Subsequently, the interviewer documented the stressors scoring each psychosocial stressor as being currently present or not present in the patient's daily life.</p><p>In order to estimate the quantity and intensity of coping strategies to stressful circumstances, an additional checklist was used. Coping mechanisms that had been reported by the patients were scored for each of the 5 items on a 4-point-Likert-skale between 0 (not at all) and 3 (fully). By this means, we explored the patients understanding <italic>(referring to the relationship of symptoms and stressors (1)) </italic>and manageability <italic>(referring to the ability of creating, improving, maintaining relationships (2); solving conflicts (3) and recognizing and using own resources (4)) </italic>of the situation as well as the value of life to them (5).</p><p>Both indicators were determined during the interview by a local psychosocial counsellor of our team.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><sec><title>Psychosocial counselling</title><p>Experienced local physicians, who had been trained as psychosocial counsellors in an extensive, 2-year training programme for psychosocial counselling in 2005/2006 (developed and led by IM, supported with a training on trauma treatment by TE) and gathered considerable experience in counselling there after, were educated to train Afghan women and men as psychosocial counsellors on basis of the manual "Professional Package for Psychosocial Counsellors working in the BPHS in Afghanistan" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] approved by the Afghan Ministry of Public Health.</p><p>The 3.5-month intensive training of the 30 selected participants took place in Kabul between April and August 2009 and ended with a final examination, ensuring the required quality standard of the counsellors being set by the Ministry of Public Health. Subsequently, the newly trained psychosocial counsellors took up employment at local health care centres in three provinces in North Afghanistan, 3 of them were deployed in a counselling centre in Mazar-e-Sharif.</p><p>The counselling treatment followed the treatment guidelines of the manual "Professional Package for Psychosocial Counsellors working in the BPHS in Afghanistan" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], which has become the official standard treatment protocol of psychosocial counsellors working in the Afghan basic healthcare system in 2009. The counselling approach has been developed and adapted to the socio-cultural background of Afghanistan by one of the authors (IM) on basis of her longstanding in-field experience. Between 2005 and 2008, approximately 11,000 patients were treated by IM and her Afghan team, consisting of experienced physicians and counsellors, in Kabul. The experiences and insights of the work with the patients were integrated into the present approach and adjusted to the specific cultural conditions. Watzlawick's short term therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and Antonowsky's salutogenetic approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] lie at the core of this psychosocial intervention. Additionally, selected intervention modules of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy have been included. This manual represents a resource-/and problem-solving orientated counselling approach which aims at restoring self-efficacy and developing resources, hereby enabling the Afghan patients to re-participate in their daily life in a responsible and satisfying way. Additionally, the approach is geared towards improving the patient's general physical, mental, social and spiritual health. Emphasis was put on a sense of coherence, covering comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness.</p><p>The first five clearly structured counselling sessions aimed at gaining a deep understanding of the relationship between the patient's symptoms and their connection to psychosocial stressors. Following Watzlawick's ideas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], special focus lay on the most pressing problem (main complaint) of the patient and on the identification of connections between the main complaint, current symptoms and underlying social stressors. Then, the counsellor and the patient explore possible coping mechanisms on the basis of the patient's values and resources, in order to improve the pressing psychosocial situation (self-efficacy). In case of a clinical necessity to provide the patient with further counselling, up to 8 additional counselling sessions could be added, following selected intervention modules of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (further information is available from the authors upon request and the complete manual can be download from the official website of the Afghan Ministry of Public Health under <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://moph.gov.af/en">http://moph.gov.af/en</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Routine medical treatment</title><p>The usual medical treatment was carried out by four local physicians, who regularly examined the patients of the control group and prescribed medication. We agreed with them on a weekly appointment and a precise documentation on the prescribed medication. This intervention can be described as the usual treatment within the Basic Public Health Care System for patients reporting mental suffering and psychosocial problems.

After being randomly assigned to one of the treatment conditions, i.e. counselling or medical treatment, each patient received two initial interviews. The first one was conducted by the local experienced counsellors of our team (patients were interviewed by a counsellor of the same sex) and explored psychosocial stressors and coping mechanism. The second one was carried out by the experts from the University of Konstanz and checked for symptoms of depression and anxiety (HSCL-25; M.I.N.I.; Screening for Depression).</p><p>The routine medical treatment by the local physicians started immediately after the initial expert interview. Patients receiving medical care were treated at the local health care centre for the following 3 months. With regard to the counselling treatment group, the subsequent five manual based counselling sessions were scheduled for the following 5 weeks and carried out by the three newly trained counsellors in the counselling centre in Mazar-e-Sharif. Taking into account the specific cultural and religious setting, female participants were only counselled by female counsellors and male participants by our male counsellor. The duration of a counselling session was 45 minutes but could extend up to 60 minutes. If the newly trained counsellor had determined a respective clinical necessity, up to 8 additional counselling sessions could be added in agreement with the supervising team from Kabul In the present trial, four patients received more than 5 sessions of counselling (M = 5.16, SD = .45, ranging between 5 and 7 sessions) Three months after the first interviews, our team of experienced local counsellors from Kabul and experts from the University of Konstanz carried out a follow-up examination consisting of the previously used battery.</p><p>The interviewers who carried out the follow-up test were not fully blind to the treatment condition as the two types of intervention (psycho- vs. pharmacotherapy) were very different and thus sometimes revealed through unsolicited information given by the patient. Moreover, although the knowledge about the treatment condition was not updated before follow-up, we cannot rule out that the expert-interviewer still remembered the treatment condition of some patients.</p><p>Initial interviews took place either at the counselling centre or at the local health care centre being located next door.

Still, as the treatment also accounts for the reduction in psychosocial stressors (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>treatment </sub>= .-84, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; .001), the treatment outcome in the HSCL depression score changes is therefore mediated via this indirect treatment effect.

We assessed depression and anxiety symptoms, psychosocial stressors and coping abilities at pre-treatment and at 3-month follow-up to measure the stability of the treatment effects.</p><p>We found high rates of symptoms of depression and anxiety in the help-seeking patients prior to treatment. These findings are in line with surveys assessing prevalence rates of mental health symptoms among the Afghan population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. According to the interviews with the patients, factors that may have contributed to the high rates of depression and anxiety include daily stressors, such as loss of family members, ongoing war and poverty as well as continuous feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. These results are in line with findings of Miller and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] in Afghanistan.</p><p>The assumption that the counselling treatment would be superior to the routine medical treatment in terms of reducing symptoms and psychosocial stressors at follow-up was supported. Counselled patients reported fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression and less psychosocial stressors after the therapy, whereas these symptoms and stressors remained stable in the pharmacological treatment group. Actually, patients who had received routine medical treatment but no counselling, reported an increase of social stressors at the follow-up interview, indicating that prescription of medication had neither improved daily living conditions and nor coping strategies. This lack of significant effects in the medication condition could relate to the suboptimal pharmacological treatment. However, we would like to emphasize that, in line with Fournier's findings, the magnitude of benefit of antidepressant medication compared with placebo may be minimal or nonexistent, on average, in patients with mild to moderate depression symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Thus, the current effects may not necessarily be much improved with an optimised psychopharmacological treatment in this group of help-seeking patients.</p><p>Measures assessing symptom-reduction included the M.I.N.I., which revealed significant correlations with the depression scale of the HSCL 25. However, interferences from the HSCL 25 pertaining to depression and anxiety as psychiatric disorders have to be drawn with caution because of cultural specifics as already pointed out by Ventevogel and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] in an earlier study in Afghanistan.</p><p>Arguably, the possibility to address ongoing stressful living conditions in the counselling sessions, taken by itself, considerably contributed to the massive treatment effects. Nevertheless, the counselling treatment enabled patients to gain a variety of coping abilities to successfully face the ongoing stressful living conditions in Afghanistan and to regain influence over their lives, thereby reducing the extent of social stress which is known to aggravate or even cause mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The improvement in mental health status following counselling found in the present investigation is consistent with the results of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In line with this work, the present study showed that local men and women can be trained in a reasonable time period to effectively treat patients suffering from mental health problems. Additionally, the present findings indicate that a mere five counselling sessions can already improve the patient's mental health status significantly, corresponding with findings of Rahman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and Schaal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>This indicates that psychosocial care can be an effective treatment even in low-resource settings of a war-affected country like Afghanistan.</p><p>Limitations of the study include that the number of counsellors and doctors involved was limited and the assessment was restricted to only one site. Security issues made it difficult to include more sites. Therefore, any generalization must be considered with care. A further methological limitation is that the interviewers were not fully blind as to the treatment condition. For logistical and security reasons, our team was only able to send one Dari-speaking expert to Mazar-e-Sharif. This expert was commissioned to supervise the execution of the study, but was also involved in the conduction of interviews.</p><p>Finally, long-term effects should be investigated in order to potentially improve therapeutic techniques of the counselling treatment. As the counselling approach is a combination of different modules, hence a dismantling would be useful in further studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>To our knowledge, we have conducted the first randomised controlled trial of a counselling treatment in a sample of mental health patients in Afghanistan. In sum, we demonstrated that culturally sensitive counselling which draws on the personal resources of the patients and targets present psychosocial stressors can be an effective treatment in this war-affected society and under unsafe living conditions. The limited need of resources suggests that counselling service in countries comparable with Afghanistan may have the potential to support the re-establishment of well-functioning families and whole communities.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SA designed and carried out the treatment studies, analysed the results and prepared the manuscript.
