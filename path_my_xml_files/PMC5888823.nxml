We recently conducted a randomised control trial (RCT) demonstrating the effectiveness of a new computer based therapy, conducted with little therapist support. This study aims to assess the subjective experience of the participants in this trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty people with psychosis conducted a post-RCT questionnaire facilitated interview, which assessed their satisfaction with CR. Thematic analysis was then employed to identify common themes.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Three broad themes were identified, with participants reporting a predominantly positive experience of taking part in the therapy. In particular, participants reported improved cognition, improved positive self-regard, a development of life skills and a transfer of benefits to everyday life. Whilst there were reports of the therapy being difficult and tiring, patients expressed a positive attitude towards their therapist and a reluctance to see the therapy come to a close.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is acceptable and beneficial for patients with psychosis to undertake independent CR therapy with reduced therapist contact.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
