The mechanisms whereby neonatal nutrition may modulate such risk are poorly understood. We studied the effects of nutrition (breast-feeding [BRF] vs. formula-feeding [FOF]) on weight partitioning and endocrine state (as judged by high-molecular-weight [HMW] adiponectin and IGF-I) of infants born small for gestational age (SGA). Body composition (by absorptiometry), HMW adiponectin, and IGF-I were assessed at birth and 4 months in BRF infants born appropriate for gestational age (AGA; <italic>n</italic> = 72) and SGA infants receiving BRF (<italic>n</italic> = 46) or FOF (<italic>n</italic> = 56), the latter being randomized to receive a standard (FOF1) or protein-rich formula (FOF2). Compared with AGA-BRF infants, the catchup growth of SGA infants was confined to lean mass, independently of nutrition. Compared with AGA-BRF infants, SGA-BRF infants had normal HMW adiponectin and IGF-I levels at 4 months, whereas SGA-FOF infants had elevated levels of HMW adiponectin (particularly SGA-FOF1) and IGF-I (particularly SGA-FOF2). In conclusion, neonatal nutrition seems to influence endocrinology more readily than body composition of SGA infants. Follow-up will disclose whether the endocrine abnormalities in SGA-FOF infants can serve as early markers of an unfavorable metabolic course and whether they may contribute to design early interventions that prevent subsequent disease, including diabetes.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Yearly, millions of human infants are born small for gestational age (SGA), and these infants are at higher risk for later diseases such as diabetes and hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), particularly if their weight gain is excessive in early infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and if they receive protein-enriched formula-feeding (FOF) instead of breast-feeding (BRF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The mechanisms underpinning this risk are poorly understood, but evidence starts to indicate that fetal-neonatal anomalies in adipogenesis and circulating adipokines and hormones are among the contributors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>In 2005 to 2006, we designed a study that aimed to yield evidence that could point toward mechanisms whereby nutrition in early infancy may modulate the long-term course of SGA children. Between birth and 4 months, we studied how SGA-BRF and SGA-FOF infants distribute their weight gain as compared with BRF controls born appropriate for gestational age (AGA). SGA-FOF infants were randomized to receive a standard formula or a protein-enriched formula that is still recommended for low-birth-weight infants. In parallel, we assessed circulating IGF-I, a prime endocrine marker for which levels are known to be lower in AGA infants receiving BRF than in those receiving FOF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Finally, we measured the circulating levels of high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin, an adipokine that is abundantly present in the fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) and is a sensitive marker of SGA-related features from early childhood onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study population.</title><p>The study cohort consists of 174 infants (88 girls and 86 boys) recruited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) into a longitudinal study that assesses the body composition and endocrine-metabolic state of SGA infants, as compared with AGA-BRF controls, in the first years after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).

This prioritization does not appear to be readily influenced by nutrition in early infancy. In contrast, circulating HMW adiponectin and IGF-I seem sensitive to nutritional influences in SGA infants, because FOF was associated with higher HMW adiponectin and IGF-I levels than BRF, and protein enrichment of FOF had opposite effects on HMW adiponectin and IGF-I levels. Therefore, the swift recovery of lean mass in SGA infants is unlikely to be mediated by circulating HMW adiponectin or IGF-I.</p><p>In the first 4 months after birth, AGA and SGA infants gain more fat than lean mass, and both groups thus increase their body fat fraction. However, the surplus in fat increment is more than twice higher in AGA than in SGA infants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, bottom row). If it is correct that less energy is required to gain 1 kg of lean mass than to gain 1 kg of fat mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), then SGA infants need fewer calories than AGA infants to gain the same amount of body weight. One of the implications of this reasoning is that there may be no strict need to give a calorie-enriched formula to SGA infants.</p><p>At age 4 months, the circulating levels of HMW adiponectin and IGF-I in SGA-BRF infants compared with those in AGA-BRF controls, but they were elevated in SGA-FOF infants, with the highest levels of HMW adiponectin and IGF-I being observed, respectively, in SGA-FOF1 and SGA-FOF2 infants. Our longitudinal results of HMW adiponectin confirm that the circulating levels of this adipokine are essentially stable in AGA-BRF infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), and they seem to be the first indication that HMW adiponectinemia may rise markedly in SGA-FOF infants. Our IGF-I results align well with the reports that AGA-FOF infants have higher IGF-I levels than AGA-BRF infants, particularly when receiving protein-enriched FOF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>The weaknesses of our study include that neither visceral fat nor hepatic lipid content was assessed; the strengths include the presence of two parallel and longitudinal control groups for SGA-FOF infants, namely the AGA-BRF (golden standard) and SGA-BRF infants.</p><p>In conclusion, SGA infants receiving protein-enriched FOF are known to be at higher risk for later cardiovascular and metabolic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and are in this study shown to have elevated serum concentrations of HMW adiponectin and IGF-I in early infancy. Breastfeeding is known to attenuate the risk of SGA infants for subsequent disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and is shown to be accompanied by normal serum concentrations of HMW adiponectin and IGF-I in SGA infants. Follow-up will disclose whether endocrine anomalies in SGA-FOF infants can serve as early markers of an unfavorable metabolic course and whether they may thus contribute to design fetal-neonatal interventions that prevent adult disease. Such interventions would be of particular relevance for public health in countries like India, where the sequence from fetal growth restraint to adult diabetes is highly prevalent.</p></sec>
