Because postdischarge care continuity is often interrupted after hospitalist care, close follow-up may decrease patient readmission. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of a quality improvement program, integrated postdischarge transitional care (PDTC), in Taiwan's hospitalist system.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>From December 2009 to May 2010, patients admitted to the hospitalist ward of a medical center in Taiwan and later discharged alive to home care were included. Efforts to improve the quality of interventions in the PDTC program, including a disease-specific care plan, telephone monitoring, hotline counseling and referral to a hospitalist-run clinic, were implemented in the latter four months in the intervention group, while the control group was recruited during the first two months of the study period. The primary end point was unplanned readmission or death within 30 days after discharge.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 94 and 219 patients in the control and intervention groups, respectively. Both groups had similar characteristics at the time of admission and at discharge. In the intervention group, 18 patients with worsening disease-specific indicators recorded during telephone monitoring and 21 patients with new or worsening symptoms recorded during hotline counseling had higher rates of unplanned readmission than those without worsening disease-specific indicators (<italic>P </italic>= 0.031) and worsening symptoms (<italic>P </italic>= 0.019), respectively. Patients who received PDTC had lower rates of readmission and death than the control group within 30 days after discharge (15% vs. 25%; <italic>P </italic>= 0.021). Nonuse of a hospitalist-run clinic and presence of underlying malignancy were other independent risk factors for readmission and death within 30 days after discharge.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Integrated PDTC using disease-specific care, telephone monitoring, hotline counseling and a hospitalist-run clinic can reduce rates of postdischarge readmission and death.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The hospitalist system has grown worldwide in recent decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], even though its pros and cons are still a matter of debate. While the hospitalist system may lessen hospitalization costs, interruption of patient care provided by the primary care physician is a major concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In fact, short-term postdischarge readmission rates are very high in the elderly, approaching 20% within one month after discharge in a US analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The reasons for high readmission rates include poor compliance, instability of chronic disease and insufficient communication between inpatient and outpatient physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Home visits and telemedicine have been studied in postdischarge care, but the reported effectiveness is limited to those with congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as well as patients who have undergone surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In our referral center in Taiwan, the one-month readmission rate after discharge from the hospitalist ward is 22% (unpublished data, C.C.S. and W.J.K.). Based on the concept of Care Transitions Intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], postdischarge transitional care (PDTC) is important in extending the continuity of care after discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Close follow-up and communication may prevent adverse events and decrease readmission rates before the primary care physician takes over care continuity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Although experience with PDTC has been studied extensively, the effectiveness of an integrated model using telephone service in a hospitalist system has not been well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Given the success of Care Transitions Intervention in decreasing postdischarge adverse events and reducing readmission rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], in this study we aimed to investigate whether a quality improvement program for PDTC consisting of a disease-specific care plan established at discharge, a patient hotline, scheduled follow-up calls and a hospitalist-run clinic could reduce readmission rates and postdischarge mortality in a hospitalist care system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study subjects</title><p>This prospective experimental study was conducted at the National Taiwan University Hospital, a tertiary care referral center in northern Taiwan. The hospital's Institutional Review Board approved the study (200900012023R). From December 2009 to May 2010, we consecutively screened all patients older than 18 years of age who had been admitted to the hospitalist care ward from the emergency department (ED). Those who were discharged alive to home were enrolled and grouped according to the designated general medical diseases (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

In the latter four months of the study period, the patients received integrated PDTC for 30 days after discharge (intervention group).</p><p>For every patient, the hospital's doctors created a postdischarge care plan. The ward staff educated the patients and their caregivers regarding this postdischarge care plan, which usually included chest care, inhaler use, tube management and wound care skills, diet and drug compliance, and other disease-specific elements. Patients were interviewed before discharge to screen them for their language ability and cognition. A patient was considered to have a cognition deficit if orientation, attention and recall ability were not intact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Caregivers were given the postdischarge instructions if the patient had a language proficiency limitation, cognitive deficits or a Barthel Index score &#x0003c; 35.</p><p>The patients were referred back to the clinic of their primary care physician for continuity of care. A physician was considered to be the patient's primary care physician if the patient had visited the same doctor three times or more within one year prior to admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Patients who had no primary care physician were followed up at the hospitalist-run clinic.</p></sec><sec><title>Integrated PDTC protocol</title><p>For the intervention group in the quality improvement program, the study nurses and hospital physicians gave patients a PDTC plan that consisted of a disease-specific care plan, scheduled follow-up calls and a hotline to monitor their disease status and their disease-specific indicators (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The PDTC plan was added onto the usual discharge care plan. The disease-specific indicators were initially chosen and then modified by the hospital physician according to the patient's condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The study nurses and physicians educated the patients and their caregivers regarding measuring and reporting the disease-specific indicators and adhering to the postdischarge care plan and medication use.</p><p>After discharge, the study nurse contacted the patients regularly by telephone on postdischarge days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 30. Using a standardized case report form, the content of telephone calls included (1) monitoring disease-specific indicators, (2) enhancing drug compliance and (3) confirming adherence to the postdischarge care plan, including diet and lifestyle modification as well as tube management and wound care skills. A designated telephone line was also opened from 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM daily for call-in counseling for the intervention group.</p><p>Once disease worsening was noted (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), the study nurses reported this to the patient's hospitalist and discussed further management, including counseling and referral to the clinic or the ED. The hospitalist-run clinic was open from 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM daily and was managed by a hospitalist.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical characteristics</title><p>The study patients' clinical characteristics, laboratory data and hospital course were collected by board-certified nurses who were blinded to the study. We used a unified case report form which contained a default option for selection to avoid ambiguous data coding. The &#x003ba; agreement was excellent in testing. The Charlson Index and Barthel Index scores were calculated as outlined in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Patients were followed up for 30 days after discharge or until they died, were readmitted or were lost to follow-up. A patient was considered lost to follow-up if the patient or caregiver could not be contacted two consecutive times. The study team had weekly meetings to confirm patients' status codes and monitor PDTC implementation, including screening, enrollment, follow-up and termination of patient care.</p><p>The primary end point was unplanned readmission or unexpected death within 30 days after discharge. Secondary end points included visits to the ED or the hospitalist-run clinic. An urgent or unplanned clinic visit was defined as one that occurred &#x0003c; 24 hours from an appointment to the clinic visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Intergroup differences were compared by performing an independent <italic>t</italic>-test for numerical variables and a &#x003c7;<sup>2 </sup>test for categorical variables. Curves representing the probability of readmission and death were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by using the log rank test.

This PDTC program implemented in a hospitalist ward in a Taiwan referral center significantly reduced readmission and mortality rates within 30 days after discharge. Aside from receiving integrated PDTC, the absence of underlying malignancy as well as visits to the hospitalist-run clinic were also associated with better outcomes.</p><p>The best method for transitional care after discharge is not well established, although several models have been studied, including telephone call follow-up, telehealth communication and monitoring and home visits by nursing staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. An integrated PDTC program using telephone call follow-up is not difficult to implement and has minimal equipment requisites, though infrastructure and personnel are needed for proper and sustainable follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The telephone service in the current study includes active regular contact to detect disease worsening as soon as possible after discharge, as well as a standby counseling service. In addition, the service monitors patient medication compliance and lifestyle modifications. The standby counseling service is helpful, especially for care-related questions and unexpected events. However, the number of ED visits has not been significantly reduced, probably because the service is only available from 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM and some aspects of the ED are irreplaceable.</p><p>The findings of the current study suggest that outpatient clinics run by hospitalists may play an important role in improving postdischarge outcomes. Outpatient follow-up by a hospitalist who is familiar with patients' disease status can provide continuous care for discharged patients, and it complements PDTC. With the use of integrated PDTC, patients and physicians may have more confidence in the care provided, and the need for scheduled hospitalist-run clinic visits may thus be decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. PDTC can effectively reduce unplanned visits to the hospitalist-run clinic. For instance, because the control group in our study lacked a hotline or telephone contact service, the frequency of hospitalist-run clinic visits increased in those patients not receiving PDTC. In contrast, the frequency of such visits decreased in the intervention group.</p><p>However, the higher percentage of primary care physician postdischarge clinic follow-up in the intervention group compared to the control group might be another cause of the reduced visits to the hospitalist-run clinic. Nonetheless, hospitalist care after discharge is very important because approximately 20% to 30% of patients do not have primary care physicians. Transitional care indeed plays an important role in reducing readmission after discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Increased communication with outpatient physicians who routinely cared for the patient before admission reportedly decreases the risk of urgent readmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Therefore, the continuity of postdischarge patient care can be achieved by integrated PDTC and hospitalist-run clinics.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has several limitations. First, we used a quality improvement initiative design without randomization. This may not be a serious concern because of the similarities of the clinical characteristics between the two study groups and the readmission rate of patients discharged from the general wards. Second, telephone monitoring may be biased by patients' or caregivers' incorrect statements. Third, the number of patients excluded was considerable and might also have biased the results. However, we made an effort to enroll a homogeneous cohort of patients from a general medical population admitted from the ED. More care should be exercised regarding excluding patient populations in the future. Last, because this study was performed in a tertiary care referral center and the patients had multiple comorbidities, the results cannot easily be generalized to regional or district hospitals.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The hospitalist system has become widely accepted in recent decades, with advances developed to cope with any discontinuity between inpatient and outpatient care. However, hospitalist PDTC guidelines are still lacking. Apart from the discharge summary and postdischarge care planning, the current study shows that integrated PDTC is effective in providing transitional care and may be applied to general medical patient populations who require an ever-increasing amount of resources in an aging society.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>WJK designed the study.
