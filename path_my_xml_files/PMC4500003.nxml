exercises of ankle joint muscles on lower extremity muscle activity and balance control.
[Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 30 healthy adults (15 males) in their 20s who
were randomly assigned to three different exercise method groups of 10 people each. The
isokinetic exercise group performed three sets at an angular velocity of 60&#x000b0;/sec,
including a single rest period after every set of 10 repetitions. The isometric exercise
group performed three sets consisting of three 15 repetitions of a 15-second exercise
followed by a 5-second rest. [Results] Multivariate analysis of variance revealed that
depending on the exercise method, the non-dominant tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius
muscle, and peroneus longus showed significant differences in muscle activity for
weight-bearing non-dominant sides; when the dominant side was weight-bearing, the dominant
gastrocnemius and peroneus longus showed significant differences in muscle activity; and
the non-dominant and dominant sides showed significant differences in balance control
depending on the duration of support in the area. [Conclusion] Muscle fatigue from the
three exercise methods produced a decline in muscle activity and balance control; due to
the fatigue before exercise, the side that did not perform the exercises was affected.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Isotonic</kwd><kwd>Isokinetic</kwd><kwd>Isometric</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Human posture is determined and maintained by muscle coordination, proprioception,
equilibrioception, and the position and function of the joints<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ankle strategy that is applied to the ankle joints is an
important<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> component of maintaining
postural adjustment and includes the proper use of hip joint muscles attached to the ankle
joints and appropriate stepping strategies<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In terms of mechanics, the ankle joint is important in gait and
functional activity<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The maintenance of a
sufficient range of motion, strength, and proprioception is crucial in providing shock
absorption and balance control of movements in the lower extremities while walking, which
are the primary functions of the ankle joints<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Functional balance is the ability to maintain a position and adjust
posture while moving from one postural position to a different position or a functional
motion, such as movement from a certain position to another position<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ankle joints are adjusted by the ground reaction force
generated by the contractions of the gastrocnemius, peroneus longus, and tibialis anterior
muscles<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Small changes to adjustments
in balance are accomplished by the action of the muscles associated with the ankle joints;
the body movement around the ankle, acting like an inverted pendulum, corrects the position
of the center of gravity<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Isometric, isotonic, and isokinetic exercises are used in resistance training for
increasing muscle strength. Isotonic exercises are auxotonic contractions in which, despite
changes in muscle length, tension in the muscles remains constant and improves muscle
strength<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Isokinetic exercises allow
muscles to exert maximum strength within the range of all joint movements at a constant
speed; various exercise methods can be used to improve muscle strength<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Isometric exercises are popular and have been performed
successfully by physiotherapists for rehabilitation. In particular, they can be adjusted for
patients whose range of joint movements is limited, and they are useful when performed in a
safe training environment<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscle
fatigue, which is a hindrance factor during exercise, is defined as a condition that brings
about a reduction in maximum voluntary force or power generated by a muscle or muscle group;
the muscle fatigue mechanism is a complex phenomenon in which the central and peripheral
nervous systems generally work together<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to evaluate the mechanisms of muscular strength production,
muscle activities were studied using a direct measurement technique. Muscle movement begins
with an electrical activity, and this signal is recorded by electromyography (EMG)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Determining the level of muscle activity is
a non-invasive method of studying the electrical and mechanical events of a single muscle
excitation-contraction combination; recording the electrical activity of muscles has been
widely used in studies on muscle coordination, muscle contraction characteristics, motor
unit recruitment, and the muscle firing rate<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In previous studies of patients with knee osteoarthritis that compared isometric and
isokinetic exercises, it was found that isokinetic exercises were much more effective than
isometric exercises for improving muscle strength<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Yang and Hwang<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a six-week treatment of neurological physical therapy
with afferent knee joint isokinetic exercises in patients with acute stroke and hemiplegia
improved balance control and muscle strength in the lower extremities. In addition, an
analysis of the muscle activities of volleyball players who received isometric training for
six weeks found that there were significant differences in the improvement of muscle
strength<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. After isokinetic exercises
were performed for four weeks on the ankle joints of adults in their 20s, the subjects were
asked to complete a one-leg stance on the same leg, and it was reported that the ankle
muscle training helped to improve balance control<sup>6)</sup>.</p><p>The plantar flexor of the ankle joint is considered to be the key regulator in
standing<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it plays an important
role<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> in walking efficiency<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the current study, isotonic,
isokinetic, and isometric exercises were performed on ankle joints to assess their effects
on the muscle activity and balance control of the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and
gastrocnemius muscles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The 30 participants in this study were students at a university in Cheonan, Republic of
Korea. The procedures of the experiment were explained to the students, who did not have any
problems with the experiment and voluntarily agreed to participate. Exclusion criteria
included musculoskeletal or neurological diseases; muscle strength training during the past
six months<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>; joint or bone disorders or
ankle sprains; and tendon, fascia, or ligament inflammation<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exercises were divided into isotonic, isokinetic, and
isometric exercises, and 10 students were randomly assigned to each of the three types of
exercise groups.</p><p>A body composition analyzer (InBody720, Biospace O. Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea) was
used to determine the general characteristics of the subjects. A Functional Rehab System
(PRIMUS RS, BTE Tech., Hanover, MD, USA) was employed to carry out the isotonic, isokinetic,
and isometric exercises. A Free EMG system (Free EMG, BTS Inc., Milan, Italy) measure the
muscle activity of the subjects, and a computerized balance platform (BT4, HUR Labs Oy.,
Tampere, Finland) was used to determine balance control.</p><p>After being informed about the study and understanding the purpose and content of the
experiment, each of the 30 participants signed a consent form. After measuring their
physical characteristics, ten students were randomly assigned to each of the three exercise
groups: isotonic, isokinetic, and isometric. Before conducting the experiment, the dominant
limb was identified by having the subjects kick a ball that had been placed in front of
them. The limb that was used to kick the ball was identified as the dominant side<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> in order to apply the exercise to the
non-dominant side; surface electrodes were then attached to the tibialis anterior, peroneus
longus, and gastrocnemius muscles.</p><p>The subjects were positioned in the physical rehabilitation equipment with their knees
fully extended<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, and both sides of the
hip joints and the knee joints were fixed into a neutral position using a strap. The
exercises were performed after fitting the rotational axis of the equipment along the inner
elongation of the anklebone with the foot secured in the isokinetic equipment<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The equipment was calibrated before every
exercise was performed<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The isometric
exercises were performed three times to induce muscle fatigue in the subjects for maximal
voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC)<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.
There was a one-minute rest period between each attempt<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Of the three MVICs, the one with the highest peak torque was
selected as the MVIC<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Then the subjects
were given verbal reinforcement to encourage them to exert maximum force during the
isometric contractions<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. To familiarize
the subjects with the experiment before performing the isotonic, isometric, or isokinetic
exercises, submaximal contractions were performed five times as a pre-exercise that involved
isokinetic exercises<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. There was a
five-minute rest period after the pre-exercise to prevent the fatigue effect<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. The isotonic exercise group performed
self-paced exercises<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> at 50% resistance
of MVIC<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ten repetitions were performed
per set, followed by a rest; three sets were performed, with a one-minute rest period
between the sets to prevent fatigue<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
the isokinetic exercise group, changes in the increase of muscle strength occurred according
to isokinetic strength exercise implementation, which depends on the dynamic form of
exercise, speed, and muscle contraction. In particular, low-velocity exercises generally
increase muscle strength, while high-velocity exercises are mainly used for the recovery of
muscle endurance. Among the most frequently implemented angular velocities of 60, 180, and
300 degrees/sec in isokinetic exercises, the angular velocity of 60 degrees/sec was
selected; this velocity is mainly used for improving muscle strength in adults or
athletes<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ankle was put in a
neutral position<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the exercise
intensity was set within the range of pain tolerance. Three sets of ten repetitions of
plantar flexion and dorsiflexion were performed, followed by a rest<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. There was a one-minute rest period between sets to
prevent the fatigue effect<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
isometric strength training group used MVIC resistance to perform plantar flexion;
dorsiflexion was performed at 70% of MVIC resistance<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of the ankle were sustained for
15 seconds<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup> per repetition for a total
of three repetitions per set, and each set was followed by a five-second rest period<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>; three total sets were performed. There
was a one-minute rest period between each set to prevent fatigue<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to enable maximum performance, strong verbal
reinforcement was provided during all tests, along with auditory and visual feedback<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To generate the EMG data, electrodes were attached to the surface at the state of standard
maximum contraction to avoid technical errors that might affect the tests. To minimize
errors caused by skin impedance and to keep the impedance below 5 k&#x003a9;, the skin was prepared
first by exfoliation with sandpaper to remove dead skin cells and debris and then
disinfection with sterile alcohol<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. All
active electrodes (Carbon electrode; 3M,) were attached parallel to the direction of the
muscle fiber at 2-cm intervals<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. A 1-kHz
sampling rate, 500-Hz low-pass filter, and 20-Hz high-pass filter were used to measure EMG.
The EMG signals of each muscle measured were treated with the value of root mean square.
Data for the EMG measurements were obtained by eliminating the beginning and end of the EMG
interval.</p><p>To test the subjects&#x02019; balance ability, a one-leg stance with eyes open was performed using
a computerized balance platform. While standing barefoot with both arms comfortably at their
sides<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>, the subjects were asked to
bend one leg along the anterior-posterior axis of the balance platform at 30&#x000b0; and stand on
the opposite leg, to maintain as stable a stance as possible<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup> with their eyes open for 30 seconds<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>, and to gaze at a point on a monitor 65&#x02005;cm away<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. An oral countdown from 4 seconds to 1
second was given to start, and the word &#x0201c;stop&#x0201d; was presented after the measurement was
complete. These tests took place in a quiet environment<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. Data were obtained by taking the mean value of the measurements,
which were repeated twice.</p><p>The data measured in this study were analyzed using SPSS ver. 18.0. General characteristics
were expressed as mean and standard deviation. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to
demonstrate a normal distribution, and the Levene F-test was used to verify the homogeneity
of the subjects. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to compare the
difference in muscle activity and balance control in the tibialis anterior, medial
gastrocnemius, and peroneus longus, depending on the group (isotonic, isokinetic, or
isometric exercise group) and time (pre- or post-exercise). When there was a significant
difference, the Scheff&#x000e9; test was used for post-hoc analysis. The statistical significance
level was set at &#x003b1; = 0.05. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
Namseoul University (Cheonan, Korea, NSU-140528-1).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Thirty healthy adult subjects participated in this study. Fifteen of the subjects were

maintain balance. If the range of movement of the ankle joints becomes constrained, the
postural adjustment provided by the ankle joints becomes constrained as well<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Postural adjustments require integration of
body segment movement navigation and the information sent through the central nervous system
through the proprioception, tactile, visual, and afferent systems; muscle fatigue influences
one or more regulatory systems, such as postural adjustment, and it is typically associated
with changes in movement and sensory systems<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the subjects were young, healthy adults who performed isotonic, isokinetic,
and isometric exercises of the ankle joints; this study analyzed the effects these exercise
methods have on the muscle activity and balance control of the tibialis anterior,
gastrocnemius, and peroneus longus muscles. In the case of muscular activity, there were
significant differences in the non-dominant tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and peroneus
muscles when the non-dominant side was weight bearing; when the dominant-side was weight
bearing, there were significant differences in the dominant gastrocnemius and peroneus
longus muscles. In the case of balance, there were significant differences in surface area,
depending on time when both the non-dominant side and the dominant side were weight bearing;
however, no significant difference in velocity was observed.</p><p>Significant differences were noted in the EMG of the non-dominant tibialis anterior when
the non-dominant limb was weight bearing. These results are consistent with previous
research on the bilateral effects of muscle fatigue of one leg and muscle EMG, where it was
found that the tibialis anterior muscle of the limb on which the exercise was performed
experienced a decline in EMG. It was reported that this decline was related to resistance to
stretching of the fatigued muscles, as fatigued muscle activity is usually associated with
increased passive tension<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>. Onambele et
al. <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup> analyzed the muscular activity of
the plantar flexor and dorsiflexor muscles in elderly and young adult patients by having
them perform a one-leg stance with their eyes closed, and they found that the EMG of the
tibialis anterior was higher than that of the gastrocnemius in both groups. When a one-leg
stance with eyes open was performed, EMG was higher in the tibialis anterior of the elderly
group and higher in the gastrocnemius of the young adult group. The findings were similar in
the current study, in which adults in their 20s were the subjects; in addition, the EMG of
the non-dominant gastrocnemius was higher than the non-dominant EMG of the tibialis anterior
when the non-dominant limb was weight bearing. These results indicate that due to the muscle
fatigue induced by the three exercises, the EMG activity of the tibialis anterior declined
in relation to the resistance to muscle activity by the muscle that had been fatigued by the
one-leg stance with eyes open.</p><p>In a study regarding the effects of fatigue during isometric contractions of both the
dominant and non-dominant quadriceps muscles, it was found that initial recovery from the
combined effect of the fatigue mechanisms that contribute to the maximum decline in power
due to sustained isometric contraction was in the dominant leg. This result occurred even
though the combined effect of the peripheral and central fatigue mechanisms that induce the
development of muscle fatigue during continuous isometric contraction of one side was not
related to the dominant leg<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, in a study on postural adjustment disturbance of the opposite leg in a one-leg
stance brought on by fatigue induced by stimulation and voluntary contraction of the same
limb (the exercised lower extremities), it was reported that the cross-over fatigue effect
after stimulation and voluntary contraction could interfere with postural adjustment. The
training of one weight-bearing side could also be transferred to the untrained side due to
the cross-education effect<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, in
this study, the unexercised, dominant side showed significant differences in the
gastrocnemius and peroneus longus when the dominant leg was weight-bearing due to this
effect, while the unexercised dominant gastrocnemius and peroneus longus developed tiredness
before muscle fatigue. Moreover, the lack of significant differences in the dominant
tibialis anterior muscle when the dominant side was weight-bearing might be due to the
morphological characteristics of the muscles: the plantar flexor, which is composed of
cooperative muscles, has a high compensation potential, but the muscle fatigue recovery rate
is slow, while the dorsiflexor has relatively low compensation potential but a fast fatigue
recovery rate.</p><p>In this study, the results of balance ability both before and after exercise in the
respective exercise groups showed that there were significant differences in the dominant
and non-dominant weight-bearing sides in terms of area. In a previous study, in which young
adults performed a 30-second one-leg stance on their dominant leg after inducing isokinetic
fatigue in the ankle and hip joints, there was no significant difference in the area of the
ankle joint, even though the area tended to increase after the fatigue rather than before
the fatigue<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study on changes in
balance orientation of healthy elderly women after knee and ankle fatigue, it was found that
acute muscle fatigue reduced balance adjustment<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><sup>)</sup> and localized dorsiflexor fatigue from the midsagittal plane was a
leading factor in precipitating postural adjustment disturbance; this was found to produce a
higher average disturbance threshold during posture correction than the plantar flexor in a
non-fatigued state<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><sup>)</sup>. The analysis of the
effects of ankle muscle fatigue on one-leg stance posture control and recovery in adult male
and female subjects showed that there were no gender differences; the fatigue effect
appeared in the right and left factors both before and after fatigue in both the male and
female groups<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study in which
young adults performed a one-leg stance with their eyes open after isokinetic fatigue had
been induced in the ankle, knee, and hip joints, it was found that from the coronal plane,
knee and hip joint fatigue brought about disturbances to posture adjustment; however,
midsagittally, the fatigue of the three joints produced posture adjustment disturbances<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, as in previous studies, the
lower extremity fatigue induced by the three exercise methods implemented in this study
affected the posture adjusting mechanisms. The sway area also increased significantly before
and after the exercises. Even the non-dominant side, which did not perform the exercises,
was affected before the fatigue; thus, the transferred fatigue caused postural sway to
increase significantly. This outcome shows the direct effect of plantar flexor and
dorsiflexor fatigue of the ankle joints.</p><p>In this study, there were no significant differences in velocity before or after the
exercises depending upon the group. According to a study on the effects of ankle and hip
joint muscle fatigue on postural sway in a one-leg stance, muscle fatigue of the plantar
flexor and dorsiflexor of the ankle joints did not increase the sway velocity compared with
the muscle fatigue in the flexion and extensor muscles of the hip joints; muscles that are
proximal (hip and knee) exert a greater influence on posture adjustment than muscles that
are distal (ankle). The use of the hip joint strategy increases according to the difficulty
of the tasks&#x02014;however, the ankle strategy is primarily used when standing. Thus, the one-leg
stance is adjusted by a combination of hip and ankle joints. When the ankle joints are
fatigued, decreased ankle joint control (due to a damaged ankle proprioceptive sense) can be
compensated for by increased dependency on the hip strategy<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study analyzing the effects of vision on postural control and
muscle fatigue in triceps surae muscles<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that vision can bring about postural deficiency related to fatigue in the plantar
flexor. In addition, in a study of postural sway during one-leg stance, lower body angle and
postural strategy, and the effects of plantar flexor and dorsiflexor fatigue, it was found
that visual senses compensated for compromised postural adjustment. A proprioceptive sensory
deficit strengthened the role of vision and subsequently reduced the amount of
proprioceptive sensory information necessary to stand on one leg, particularly when the
support surface decreased<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study
of healthy athletes and athletes with functional ankle instability that investigated the
effects of fatigue due to treadmill running and sensorimotor control, it was found that
fatigue due to treadmill running had negative effects on static and dynamic posture control
assessment in all groups. That finding indicates that damage has occurred to muscle
activation patterns and reflex activity; in the state of fatigue, postural adjustment is
affected by complex mechanisms of the sensory, neural-muscular, and central nervous systems;
the central nervous system receives more disturbances than the peripheral mechanisms of
proprioception<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Moreover, in a study on posture sway and the effects of incremental difficulties in a
standing balance task with visual feedback, as the difficulty of the task increased, the
amplitude of the postural sway increased, and the fuzzy entropy of postural sway also
increased from the anteroposterior axis in the most unstable condition<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to a study on visual compensation in accordance
with muscle fatigue and postural adjustment, different sensory systems exist in a complex
relationship related to postural control. Under the condition of muscle fatigue, vision can
compensate for the muscle fatigue generated by the triceps surae muscle by increasing the
contributions of the various sensory systems for adjusting posture. Concurrently, in the
state of muscle fatigue, the effectiveness of the visual presentation is important for
proper adjustment of support<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, the reason there was no significant difference in velocity/speed was because the
balance was measured in a one-leg stance with eyes open without constraining the subject&#x02019;s
vision. Due to the muscle fatigue, compensation from visual information regarding postural
adjustment and dependence on the hip strategy were amplified; the impairment of the
sensorimotor system and proprioception of the ankle joints for maintaining balance were not
sufficient to make a significant impact on velocity.</p><p>This study analyzed the effects of muscle fatigue on muscle activity and balance control in
the lower extremities using three exercise methods. The ankle joint in which this was
implemented was limited; balance was measured with visual information, and the subjects were
confined to healthy students. For further research, studies regarding the relationship and
compensation potential of various joints, such as hip, knee, and ankle joints; studies on
postural and balance control both with and without visual information, as vision and
proprioception are closely related<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref><sup>)</sup>; and
research focusing on specialized groups, such as patients and athletes with pain or disease
in the ankle joint, are needed to expand the scope and variety of the research.</p><p>In conclusion, in this study, isotonic, isokinetic, and isometric exercises were applied to
the ankle joints of healthy adults in their 20s to investigate the effects of these exercise
methods on the muscle activity and balance control of the tibialis anterior, inner
gastrocnemius, and peroneus longus muscles. Our results indicated that 1) there were no
significant differences due to the changes of muscle activity before, during, or after the
exercise between the interaction of group and time; however, there were significant
differences according to group in the non-dominant tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and
peroneus longus muscles when the non-dominant side was weight-bearing, as well as in the
dominant gastrocnemius and peroneus longus when the dominant side was supported; 2) there
were no significant differences before or after exercise in the interaction of group and
time due to the change in balance control; depending on time, there were significant
differences in the surface area depending upon whether the non-dominant side or the dominant
side was weight-bearing, but there was a significant difference in speed. Accordingly, the
muscle fatigue generated by the three exercise methods affected the decline in muscle
activity and balance control; it also influenced the side that did not perform the exercise
before fatigue due to this effect. The finding that visual compensation occurs to maintain
postural balance will further aid future treatment and research regarding muscle activity
and balance control in the lower extremities.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>SY</given-names></name><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effect of the mandibular orthopedic repositioning
