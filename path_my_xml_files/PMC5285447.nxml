We aimed to assess the medium-term effects and costs of psychological therapies on maintenance of reduced depression symptoms 12 months after treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We did this multicentre, pragmatic, observer-blind, randomised controlled superiority trial (IMPACT) at 15 National Health Service child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) clinics in three regions in England. Adolescent patients (aged 11&#x02013;17 years) with a diagnosis of DSM IV major depressive disorder were randomly assigned (1:1:1), via a web-based randomisation service, to receive cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or short-term psychoanalytical therapy versus a reference brief psychological intervention. Randomisation was stochastically minimised by age, sex, self-reported depression sum score, and region. Patients and clinicians were aware of group allocation, but allocation was concealed from outcome assessors. Patients were followed up and reassessed at weeks 6, 12, 36, 52, and 86 post-randomisation. The primary outcome was self-reported depression symptoms at weeks 36, 52, and 86, as measured with the self-reported Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ). Because our aim was to compare the two psychological therapies with the brief psychosocial intervention, we first established whether CBT was inferior to short-term psychoanalytical psychotherapy for the same outcome. Primary analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN83033550.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between June 29, 2010, and Jan 17, 2013, we randomly assigned 470 patients to receive the brief psychosocial intervention (n=158), CBT (n=155), or short-term psychoanalytical therapy (n=157); 465 patients comprised the intention-to-treat population. 392 (84%) patients had available data for primary analysis by the end of follow-up. Treatment fidelity and differentiation were established between the three interventions. The median number of treatment sessions differed significantly between patients in the brief psychosocial intervention group (n=6 [IQR 4&#x02013;11]), CBT group (n=9 [5&#x02013;14]), and short-term psychoanalytical therapy group (n=11 [5&#x02013;23]; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001), but there was no difference between groups in the average duration of treatment (27&#x000b7;5 [SD 21&#x000b7;5], 24&#x000b7;9 [17&#x000b7;7], 27&#x000b7;9 [16&#x000b7;8] weeks, respectively; Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis p=0&#x000b7;238). Self-reported depression symptoms did not differ significantly between patients given CBT and those given short-term psychoanalytical therapy at weeks 36 (treatment effect 0&#x000b7;179, 95% CI &#x02212;3&#x000b7;731 to 4&#x000b7;088; p=0&#x000b7;929), 52 (0&#x000b7;307, &#x02212;3&#x000b7;161 to 3&#x000b7;774; p=0&#x000b7;862), or 86 (0&#x000b7;578, &#x02212;2&#x000b7;948 to 4&#x000b7;104; p=0&#x000b7;748). These two psychological treatments had no superiority effect compared with brief psychosocial intervention at weeks 36 (treatment effect &#x02212;3&#x000b7;234, 95% CI &#x02212;6&#x000b7;611 to 0&#x000b7;143; p=0&#x000b7;061), 52 (&#x02212;2&#x000b7;806, &#x02212;5&#x000b7;790 to 0&#x000b7;177; p=0&#x000b7;065), or 86 (&#x02212;1&#x000b7;898, &#x02212;4&#x000b7;922 to 1&#x000b7;126; p=0&#x000b7;219). Physical adverse events (self-reported breathing problems, sleep disturbances, drowsiness or tiredness, nausea, sweating, and being restless or overactive) did not differ between the groups. Total costs of the trial interventions did not differ significantly between treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>We found no evidence for the superiority of CBT or short-term psychoanalytical therapy compared with a brief psychosocial intervention in maintenance of reduced depression symptoms 12 months after treatment.

Good evidence exists for psychological treatments being associated with clinical remission in about 70% of cases. By contrast, data are scarce for whether one or more of the available therapies is associated with maintenance of reduced depressive symptoms 1 year after the end of treatment. This issue is not trivial, because maintenance of depressive symptoms below a clinical threshold 12 months after the end of treatment is associated with reduced risk for diagnostic relapse into the adult years. We searched PubMed between Aug 1, 1990, and Aug 31, 2016, with the search terms &#x0201c;adolescence&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;depression&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;psychological treatments&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;randomised controlled trials&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;remission&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;relapse&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;relapse prevention&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;adverse effects&#x0201d;. This search identified three trials of school population-based interventions, a small (n=43) feasibility study of a social media intervention for relapse prevention in patients recovered from depression, and a Cochrane database review of relapse prevention in children and adolescents with depression. No identified psychological treatments are currently recommended as effective in maintaining reduced depressive symptoms in the year after successful treatment.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>Our findings show that short-term psychoanalytical psychotherapy and CBT, delivered by highly trained therapists over 28 weeks and 20 weeks, respectively, were not superior to a reference brief psychosocial intervention delivered over 12 weeks by child and adolescent psychiatrists and mental health nurses. All three psychological treatments were associated with an average 49&#x02013;52% reduction in depression symptoms 1 year after treatment. Prescribing of an SSRI during therapy or follow-up, as per National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, did not differ between the treatment groups and so did not mediate the outcome. Suicide and self-harm attempts over the follow-up period were lower than at baseline, as were physical side-effects. Furthermore, total costs and quality-of-life scores did not differ between treatment groups by the end of the study.</p><p><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p>To our knowledge, this is the only high-quality, fully powered, superiority and cost-effectiveness study assessing the medium-term effects and costs of psychological treatments on maintenance of reduced depression symptoms 12 months after treatment. Short-term psychoanalytical psychotherapy is as effective as CBT and, together with brief psychosocial intervention, offers an additional patient choice for psychological therapy, alongside CBT, for adolescents with moderate to severe depression who are attending routine specialist child and adolescent mental health service clinics.</p></boxed-text></p><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p>Unipolar major depression is a clinically significant mental illness affecting a substantial proportion of adolescents worldwide.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Although evidence exists for the effectiveness of treatments in the short term, data are scarce for whether one or more of the available psychological treatments is also able to maintain reduced depressive symptoms a year after the end of therapy.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This issue is not trivial, because maintenance of depressive symptoms below a clinical threshold level reduces the risk for diagnostic relapse into the adult years.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) offers plausible long-term benefits for adolescents with depression, and is recommended as such by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Short-term psychoanalytical psychotherapy also shows preliminary promise as a treatment for adolescents with depression.

Short-term psychoanalytical psychotherapy comprised a planned programme of 28 sessions over 30 weeks, with parents or carers offered up to seven additional sessions by a separate parent worker. The techniques of this intervention are based on close and detailed observation of the relationship the child or young person makes with their therapist. The therapist introduces the therapeutic task to the young person as one of understanding feelings and difficulties in their life. The therapist is non-judgmental and enquiring, and conveys the value of self-understanding. Therapists were CAMHS clinicians with child and adolescent psychoanalytical psychotherapy training. Short-term psychoanalytical psychotherapy has been shown to be reliably and effectively delivered.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p><p>CBT was based on the classic form originally developed for adults with depression.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> We adapted the intervention to include parental involvement, focused on engagement in therapy, and emphasised the use of behavioural techniques. The focus of CBT is to identify the behaviours and information processing biases that maintain depression and low mood, and to amend these through a process of collaborative empiricism between the therapist and patient. CBT comprised a planned programme of up to 20 sessions over 30 weeks. CBT therapists were routine CAMHS clinicians and were either clinical psychologists or other clinicians who had received post-qualification training in CBT.</p><p>The brief psychosocial intervention was derived from the routine specialist clinical care delivered in the ADAPT trial, and reformulated on the basis of findings suggesting this intervention might be clinically effective.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Emphasis in the brief psychosocial intervention programme is on the importance of psychoeducation about depression, in addition to action-oriented, goal-focused, and interpersonal activities as therapeutic strategies. Neither self-understanding nor cognition change are components of the programme. The programme consists of 12 individual sessions, including up to four family or marital sessions delivered over 20 weeks. Therapists were drawn from routine CAMHS clinics.</p><p>For all three groups, liaison with external agencies and personnel (eg, teachers, social care) and peer group was commonly done. All therapy sessions were audiotaped. A computerised randomisation procedure was used to select tapes stratified by age, treatment, and whether obtained early (two to four sessions) or later (after four sessions) in the therapy.

Five patients withdrew before starting treatment and requested data be deleted; the remaining 465 participants comprised the intention-to-treat population (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure</xref>). The patient recruitment rate was 40% in East Anglia, 33% in the North West, and 27% in North London (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). 63 therapists delivered the brief psychosocial intervention, 44 therapists delivered CBT, and 38 therapists delivered short-term psychoanalytical therapy. Most (n=53) brief psychosocial intervention therapists were either psychiatrists who had passed postgraduate general training (ie, obtained membership of the Royal College of Psychiatrists) and subsequently entered specialist CAMHS psychiatry training or consultants. The primary analysis population comprised 392 (84%) patients who provided one or more self-reported depression symptom scores at weeks 36, 52, and 86 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure</xref>). 39 (10%) patients had one MFQ score, 90 (23%) had two MFQ scores, and 263 (67%) had three MFQ scores. The number of patients with follow-up data for secondary outcomes was similar between treatment groups. The data available were within the margins suggested by the power calculation. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).</p><p>The <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref> shows the full profile of depression symptoms at baseline (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). The mean number of symptoms was 8&#x000b7;4 (SD 2&#x000b7;5) in patients undergoing brief psychosocial intervention, 8&#x000b7;7 (2&#x000b7;3) in patients undergoing CBT, and 8&#x000b7;3 (2&#x000b7;5) in patients undergoing short-term psychoanalytical therapy (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). The most prevalent symptom was sleep disturbance (n=427 [92%]) followed by depressed mood (n=390 [84%]; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Psychotic symptoms were uncommon (n=48 [10%]), but a notable number of patients had current suicidal ideas (n=284 [61%]) and lifetime suicide attempts (n=177 [38%]; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Symptom prevalence rates were similar between treatment groups (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). 225 (48%) patients had concurrent comorbid psychiatric disorders: 71 (46%) in the brief psychosocial intervention group, 80 (52%) in the CBT group, and 74 (47%) in the short-term psychoanalytical therapy group (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Overall, 134 (29%) patients had one comorbidity, 60 (13%) patients had two comorbidities, and 31 (7%) patients had three or more comorbidities, with no marked differences between groups. Non-suicidal self-injury in the previous 2 weeks was reported in 85 (18%) patients: 26 (17%) assigned to the brief psychosocial intervention, 25 (16%) assigned to CBT, and 34 (22%) assigned to short-term psychoanalytical therapy; lifetime non-suicidal self-injury was reported in 246 (53%) participants: 87 (56%), 75 (49%), and 84 (54%), respectively.</p><p>The number of patients starting therapy was 147 (93%) in the brief psychosocial intervention group, 142 (92%) in the CBT group, and 136 (87%) in the short-term psychoanalytical therapy group, with no differences in proportions between groups (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> p=0&#x000b7;203). The number of individual treatment sessions given per group was less than planned (median six [IQR four to 11] in the brief psychosocial intervention group, nine [five to 14] in the CBT group, and 11 [five to 23] in the short-term psychoanalytical therapy group), but differed significantly between groups (Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Of patients assigned to receive the brief psychosocial intervention, 24 (17%) had more sessions than the manual specified, compared with five (3%) assigned to receive CBT and three (2%) assigned to receive short-term psychoanalytical therapy. Mean duration of therapy did not differ significantly between treatment groups (27&#x000b7;5 weeks [SD 21&#x000b7;5] in the brief psychosocial intervention group, 24&#x000b7;9 weeks (SD 17&#x000b7;7) in the CBT group, 27&#x000b7;9 weeks [16&#x000b7;8] in the short-term psychoanalytical therapy group; Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis p=0&#x000b7;238).</p><p>Raters assessed treatment fidelity by use of 232 audio tapes: 75 tapes for brief psychosocial intervention sessions, 76 tapes for CBT sessions, and 81 tapes for short-term psychoanalytical therapy sessions. Overall, 60 (81%) brief psychosocial intervention sessions, 61 (80%) short-term psychoanalytical therapy sessions, and 60 (74%) CBT sessions met treatment fidelity criteria (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Treatment differentiation was good: the mean cognitive behavioural subscale score on the Comparative Psychotherapy Process Scale was 1&#x000b7;91 (95% CI 1&#x000b7;73&#x02013;2&#x000b7;09) higher for CBT sessions than for short-term psychoanalytical therapy sessions (p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001), whereas the mean psychodynamic interpersonal subscale score was 1&#x000b7;18 (1&#x000b7;01&#x02013;1&#x000b7;30) higher for short-term psychoanalytical therapy sessions than for CBT sessions (p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001). Patients attending brief psychosocial intervention sessions had a significantly lower mean score on the cognitive behavioural subscale than did those attending CBT sessions (mean difference &#x02212;0&#x000b7;93, 95% CI &#x02212;1&#x000b7;12 to &#x02212;0&#x000b7;75; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001) and a significantly lower mean score on the psychodynamic interpersonal subscale than did those attending short-term psychoanalytical therapy sessions (&#x02212;1&#x000b7;30, &#x02212;1&#x000b7;48 to &#x02212;1&#x000b7;11; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001).</p><p>The number of patients receiving an SSRI before randomisation was 29 (19%) in the brief psychosocial intervention group, 32 (21%) in the CBT group, and 28 (18%) in the short-term psychoanalytical therapy group; by the end of study, the number of patients who reported having received an SSRI at any time over the course of the trial (randomisation up to 86 weeks) was 56 (41%), 55 (40%), and 50 (36%), respectively (p=0&#x000b7;729; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p><p>Behavioural disorder at baseline was found to predict non-response. Because this was not a prespecified baseline covariate, it was added to all models of outcome to support the missing-at-random assumption. The <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref> provides data for time from randomisation to assessment and estimates of the main effect and time with treatment interaction.</p><p>The primary outcome of self-reported depression symptoms (MFQ) at weeks 36, 52, and 86 did not differ significantly between patients in the CBT group and those in the short-term psychoanalytical therapy group, nor between those in the CBT or short-term psychoanalytical therapy groups combined versus the brief psychological intervention group (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). With a lower score representing improved outcome, we recorded a larger difference in favour of combined established treatments at weeks 36 and 52 (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>), but these reductions were not statistically significant, less than the five unit difference prespecified as clinically meaningful, and not accompanied by differences in psychosocial impairment. The secondary outcomes of anxiety and obsessional symptoms were significantly reduced after the psychological treatments combined versus brief psychosocial therapy at week 36 only (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). The therapist intracluster correlation coefficient for therapy outcomes was calculated as the proportion of the random intercept variance, and was negligible (&#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>) for all the models (data not shown). Study power was therefore at the upper end of the range, because the sample size calculation included a range of values of the intracluster correlation coefficient, from 0 to 0&#x000b7;05.</p><p><xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows findings for the secondary binary outcomes of patients who self-reported no or one or more antisocial behaviour symptoms and patients who met clinical diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. Compared with brief psychosocial intervention, CBT and short-term psychoanalytical therapy led to significantly lower self-reported ABQ scores at week 36, but this difference was not maintained at week 52.</p><p>Over the follow-up period, recent suicide attempts were reported in three (3%) of 279 patients at 36 weeks (n=1 per group), two (6%) of 201 patients at 52 weeks (n=1 in the brief psychosocial intervention group, n=1 in the short-term psychoanalytical therapy group), and no patients at 86 weeks, compared with 12 (3%) of 465 patients at baseline (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Similarly, non-suicidal self-injury attempts were reported in 19 (7%) of 268 patients at 36 weeks (n=10 in the brief psychosocial intervention group, n=6 in the CBT group, n=3 in the short-term psychoanalytical therapy group), 14 (4%) of 234 patients at 52 weeks (n=6, n= 2, n=6, respectively), and 16 (5%) of 257 at 86 weeks (n=7, n=5, n=4, respectively), which compares favourably with self-harm attempts reported at baseline (n=85 [18%]; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). On the basis of our physical adversities score, we recorded a decline in the self-reporting of adverse physical events over the course of the study, with no observable differences between treatment groups (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>).</p><p>The proportion of patients in diagnostic remission by 36, 52, or 86 weeks did not differ significantly between groups (data not shown). Because the present study is pragmatic, with no control group, we did a comparison of the 12 week remission rate with the rate in the TADS study,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> which included a pill placebo control group (n=111): 145 (48%) of 305 patients were in remission at 12 weeks in our study compared with 37 (34%) placebo patients in the TADS study. Additionally, in the treatment trial of resistant depression in adolescents,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> 203 (61%) of 334 patients were in diagnostic remission by week 72 compared with 221 (77%) of 286 by week 86 in this study. Finally, 15 (11%) of the 140 patients in remission at week 36 had relapsed by week 86 (n=5/48 [10%] in the brief psychosocial intervention group, n=4/49 [8%] in the CBT group, n=2/48 [4%] in the short-term psychoanalytical therapy group; p=0&#x000b7;149).</p><p>The cost of the trial interventions was lowest for CBT (mean &#x000a3;904&#x000b7;57 [SD 607&#x000b7;25]) and highest for short-term psychoanalytical therapy (&#x000a3;1396&#x000b7;72 [1133&#x000b7;41]), with the brief psychosocial intervention costing a mean of &#x000a3;1292&#x000b7;91 (851&#x000b7;29; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). The costs of use of all other services (health, social care, and education) differed little between patients in the brief psychosocial intervention group (mean &#x000a3;1385&#x000b7;4 [SD 2807&#x000b7;7]), the CBT group (&#x000a3;1459&#x000b7;26 [3481&#x000b7;02]), and the short-term psychoanalytical therapy group (&#x000a3;1668&#x000b7;51 [3425&#x000b7;68]) over 86 weeks (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). The total combined cost of trial interventions and use of other services was &#x000a3;2678&#x000b7;39 (SD 2678&#x000b7;39) for the brief psychosocial intervention, &#x000a3;2379&#x000b7;01 (3643&#x000b7;85) for CBT, and &#x000a3;3081&#x000b7;70 (3573&#x000b7;17) for short-term psychoanalytical therapy; neither these costs, nor QALYs (mean 1&#x000b7;241 [SD 0&#x000b7;270], 1&#x000b7;228 [0&#x000b7;304], and 1&#x000b7;246 [0&#x000b7;293] QALYs, respectively), differed significantly between groups over 86 weeks (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). No evidence supported the superior cost-effectiveness of short-term psychoanalytical therapy compared with brief psychosocial intervention or CBT, or CBT compared with brief psychosocial intervention (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="cesec100"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found no evidence for the superiority of CBT or short-term psychoanalytical therapy compared with a brief psychosocial intervention for maintenance of reduced depression symptoms 12 months after treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first trial to show that short-term psychoanalytical therapy and brief psychosocial intervention are as clinically effective as CBT for the treatment of adolescents with depression. We note the continuing decline of symptoms and further increase in remission, which are not explained by any marked differences in post-treatment service use, costs between therapies, or reported SSRI use. However, caution is required with the findings for remission because the study was not powered for treatment group comparisons, interview data were missing at each timepoint, and the control comparison could only be achieved at 12 weeks. We also note the small reduction in symptoms in favour of established treatments at the end (36 weeks) of treatment, but not by end of study, which is consistent with previous reports of psychological treatment effects on reducing anxiety in patients with depression.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> No participants reported increases in suicidal ideation, non-suicidal self-injury, or adverse physical side-effects during the study.</p><p>Three previous randomised controlled trials similar in design to the present study have reported follow-up data beyond end of treatment. Birmaher and colleagues<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> reassessed 107 adolescents with major depressive disorder 2 years after treatment with CBT, systematic behavioural family therapy, or non-directive supportive therapy. There were no differences in outcome by original treatment group. A naturalistic follow-up study<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> of 196 adolescents with depression (45% of the original sample) recruited to a treatment trial reported that 5 year post-trial recurrence was more likely in participants with higher depressive symptom scores at the end of treatment, but was not associated with treatment type. Most recently, a 6 year follow-up study<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> of a cognitive behaviour programme aimed at prevention of depressive episodes showed that the strongest effect was early and better maintained with additional booster sessions and treatment of parental depression. Overall these findings are consistent in their suggestion that early response to treatment can be followed by continued improvement across different treatment modalities. The absence of difference between the three treatments assessed in the present study might be due to a putative shared common effect, but could also be a result of alternative explanations, including three unique effects leading to the same outcome or even to no effect, with the decline in symptoms being due to change over time.</p><p>Reports of non-response to treatment in 21&#x02013;25% of trial patients are also consistent with these results.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Such non-response might be due to issues of selection of the right treatment for the right patient, noting the likelihood of resistance to a given treatment early in therapy, or to prediction of the likelihood of non-compliance. One challenge for further research is to improve the precision of the ability to select the best treatment for a given patient with depression. Despite the planned differences in treatment intensity, in practice, young people attended a median of six to 11 sessions over 25&#x02013;28 weeks across all three treatment groups. A first course of therapy for adolescents with depression could be brief (six to 11 sessions) and at no difference in cost between the available treatment options assessed in this trial. The reasons for non-attendance deserve further investigation.</p><p>Our study had various strengths, including that participants were representative of the population with moderate to severe depression, with self-harm, suicidality, and non-depressive comorbid disorders at the point of referral; CAMHS referral across diverse regions of the UK; meeting of research diagnostic criteria for DSM IV major depressive disorder; and randomisation done remotely from the research team. There was a loss to follow-up, but data for the primary outcome measure (MFQ) were available in 84% of participants. The overall sample size was greater than in previous studies, and this is the first time a trial of adolescents with depression has been designed to follow up participants for 52 weeks after the end of treatment. Each of the three treatments was manualised, interventions were delivered as expected, and clear differences in approach were maintained between therapies. Some patients in all three groups received antidepressant medication. This characteristic strengthens generalisability, but restricts the interpretation of the findings. Methods of prescribing did not differ between groups over the course of the study, and fluoxetine was prescribed both during and after the end of treatment. Neither the reasons for prescribing nor medication compliance were controlled for over the study course; therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that SSRIs might have contributed to the improvements over time. Furthermore, the declines in symptoms and improvements in wellbeing could be a function of time. The absence of a no-treatment control group restricts the assertion that any therapy was causally effective. The economic results were limited by missing data, which was higher than for the primary clinical outcome measure (40%). Multiple imputation of missing data did not, however, change the economic results of the analysis. Future research should focus on psychological mechanisms associated with treatment response, the maintenance of positive effects, non-response, and whether or not brief psychotherapies are of use in community and primary care settings.</p><p>In summary, brief psychosocial intervention, CBT, and short-term psychoanalytical therapy are all associated with maintenance of reduced depression symptoms 1 year after the end of treatment. Short-term psychoanalytical therapy and brief psychosocial interventions offer additional patient choice, alongside CBT, for depressed adolescents attending routine specialist CAMHS clinics.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Whiteford</surname><given-names>HA</given-names></name><name><surname>Degenhardt</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Rehm</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Global burden of disease attributable to mental and substance use disorders: findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>382</volume><year>2013</year><fpage>1575</fpage><lpage>1586</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23993280</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cox</surname><given-names>GR1</given-names></name><name><surname>Fisher</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>De Silva</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Interventions for preventing relapse and recurrence of a depressive disorder in children and adolescents</article-title><source>Cochrane Database Syst Rev</source><volume>11</volume><year>2012</year><comment>CD007504</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref30"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>March</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Silva</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Petrycki</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Fluoxetine, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and their combination for adolescents with depression: Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study (TADS) randomized controlled trial</article-title><source>JAMA</source><volume>292</volume><year>2004</year><fpage>807</fpage><lpage>820</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15315995</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref40"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rush</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Wisniewski</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name><name><surname>Zisook</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Is prior course of illness relevant to acute or longer-term outcomes in depressed out-patients?

IMG as chief investigator had overall responsibility for the management of the study. SR, RK, and IMG had responsibility for the East Anglia site; JH and BD for the North West site; and RS, NM, MT, and PF for the North London site. RK, BD, PW, and IMG were responsible for the development of the brief psychosocial intervention manual and provided training and supervision for the therapists in East Anglia. Medical leadership and supervision for the brief psychosocial intervention was provided by RK in East Anglia, RS in North London, and BD and JH in the North West. NM, MT, and PF developed the short-term psychoanalytical therapy manual and ensured and coordinated short-term psychoanalytical therapists for the study, together with JH in the North West. SR developed the CBT manual and coordinated the therapists' election, training, and supervision for the study; BD and JH coordinated CBT therapy in the North West. BW was project manager throughout the trial, developed and coordinated the randomisation and minimisation protocol with IMG and CR. BW set up and coordinated the database, with all data held in a single repository on the Cambridge site. NM, SR, RK, and BD coordinated and supervised the treatment fidelity project and analysed the data with CR. FH, CR, BB, and SB wrote the statistical analysis plan and did the analyses. BW and FH were responsible for data cleaning. IMG wrote the initial draft of the manuscript.
