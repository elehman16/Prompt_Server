a growing health concern where a large percentage of these patients develop full type 2 diabetes. Effective interventions on pre-diabetes can prevent or delay the occurrence or development of diabetes. Pharmaco-dynamics and pre-clinical of JinQi-Jiangtang tablets (JQJT) suggest that it could be benefit for pre-diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Randomized controlled trial (RCT) is implemented in this study. The study term is 24 months (12 months for intervention and 12 months for follow up). Participants are recruited from four cities of China: Beijing, Tianjin, Xi'an and Nanning. Four hundred participants are randomized to treatment group (JQJT tablets) and control group (Placebo); two hundred participants each. People being included in this study must have been diagnosed as pre-diabetes via western medicine criteria and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) criteria. The end-point indexes include: incidence of diabetes mellitus and reversion rate. Primary outcome indexes include: oral glucose tolerance test; insulin releasing test; glycosylated hemoglobin (HA1c). Secondary outcome indexes include: score of the Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36); score of TCM symptoms; blood lipid test. Indexes of safety include: general medical examination; blood and urine regular test; electrocardiogram (ECG), liver function (ALT) and renal function (BUN, Creatinine) test; record of adverse event, such as headache, faint, etc. Qualitative control will be implemented and a number of standard operating processes (SOPs) will be formed throughout the study: laboratory quality control measures; compliance control for researchers and participants; researcher training before study; supervision; investigational drug management and others.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of JinQi JiangTang (JQJT) tablets for the treatment of patients with pre-diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Chinese clinical trials register ChiCTR-TRC-00000401</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>An increasing number of people experience complications from symptoms of pre-diabetes. Some studies have discovered that about 5%-10% of pre-diabetes will develop into diabetes within one year and the occurrence of cardiovascular events in patients with pre-diabetes are higher than in healthy individual. According to Hoorn[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], the rates of development of diabetes after 5.8-6.5 years follow-up from patients with normal glucose tolerance, single impaired fasting glucose (IFG), single Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT), both IGT and IFG people are 4.5%, 33.0%, 33.8% and 64.5%, respectively. Therefore, the prevention of type 2 diabetes in pre-diabetic patients is a topic of importance in diabetes research.</p><sec><title>Progress of pre-diabetes</title><p>Effective interventions on pre-diabetes can prevent or delay the occurrence or development of diabetes; it can also reduce micro-vascular and macro-vascular complications. The result of the Daqing study from 1986-1994 concluded that lifestyle interventions could reduce the incidence of diabetes by 30%-50%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, another study confirmed that lifestyle interventions were not completely effective to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes for high-risk groups[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Another study showed a high trend of body weight rebound and blood glucose increase after 1-2 years of lifestyle interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. STOP-NIDDM discovered that IGT intervention was able to reduce the occurrence of diabetes by 36% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. DPP discovered that metformin and troglitazone can significantly reduce the risk of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In the TRIPOD study, troglitazone reduced the risk of diabetes by 55% in gestational diabetes patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The latest DREAM trial showed that the intervention of pre-diabetes can delay the disease process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These studies give us hope to prevent diabetes effectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Prevention and treatment on pre-diabetes in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)</title><p>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can treat pre-diabetes effectively[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A systematic evaluation of pre-diabetes intervention, including 19 randomized controlled trials, showed that the combination of Chinese medicine and lifestyle intervention can decrease fasting blood glucose in 1471 cases. Meanwhile, the 2 hours postprandial blood glucose and 2 hours postprandial insulin levels were lower than a simple lifestyle intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Zhou Zhuoning[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]considered that diabetes can be explained by three TCM Syndrome from IGT to diabetes as: yin deficiency with heat, dual deficiency of yin and qi, dual deficiency of yin and yang in development.</p></sec><sec><title>Constituents of JQJT tablets</title><p>Alkaloid is the major constituent of Coptis, including Berberine, palmatine, methyl and coptisine. Berberine is the most content among them (accounting for 6.88%~13.64%). The main chemical constituents of Astragalus is flavonoids, saponins and polysaccharides. The main chemical composition of Honeysuckle is volatile oils, flavonoids, organic acids and other substances, chlorogenic acids compound is the main active ingredient among them. Berberine, flavonoids can lower blood sugar significantly and chlorogenic acids compounds can strengthen the immune system.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmaco-dynamics of JinQi-Jiangtang(JQJT) tablets</title><p>&#x02022; JinQi-Jiangtang (JQJT) tablets is composed by Coptis, Astragalus, and Honeysuckle.</p><p>&#x02022; Influence on glycometabolism: Studies before proved that JQJT tablets can improve mice glucose tolerance obviously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Honeysuckle can decrease blood sugar[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Berberine, as a natural plant alkaloid isolated from the Coptis chinens, has been noted for its potential glucose lowering effect[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>&#x02022; Influence on insulin resistance(IR) and serum insulin: JQJT tablets can improve the insulin resistance caused by Hydrocortisone and decrease the serum insulin in mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>&#x02022; Influence on immune function: JQJT tablets can improve immune function and protect thymus gland atrophy of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Pre-clinical of JQJT tablets</title><p>Sheng zhufang proved that JQJT tablets can improve insulin resistance in humans[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Gu wenyuan indicated that combination of JQJT tablets and Gliclazide can improve fasting blood-glucose (FBG) of 2 type diabetes patients[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Zhang rongrong discovered that JQJT tablets can not only prevent the progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes but also delay development of diabetic nephropathy (DN)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Study design</title><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of JQJT tablets for pre-diabetes in China by comparison with placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Research type</title><p>Randomized controlled trial (RCT).</p></sec><sec><title>Screening of participants</title><p>400 pre-diabetes patients will be divided into the treatment group and the control group (1:1). Participants should be included according to diagnosis criteria and inclusion criteria (reference to the next section).</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>&#x02022; Arrangement for intervention: All researchers in this study will be trained before their participation. Some measures will be implemented in order to ensure compliance, such as compensation and prize. Patient handouts will be delivered to every participants to instruct their medication and cooperation.</p><p>&#x02022; Lifestyle intervention: Researchers will develop an individual diet program for each participant, including reasonable match of calories, protein and carbohydrates, low-salt and low-sugar diet, advise them to give up some bad diet habits. Risk factors, such as smoking and alcoholics, will be controlled strictly. Individual's exercise program will be formulated for all participants according to their age, gender, etc.</p><p>&#x02022; Drug intervention: The period of drug intervention is 12 months. All participants have to visit researchers every month. The interventions are as follows: JQJT tablet for treatment group, taking seven tablets each dose and twice daily, all the drugs are taken before meal; Placebo of JQJT for control group, the method and time of taking drugs is the same as treatment group.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>The randomization of the trial will be completed by the independent data center named Interact Voice Responding System (IVRS). According to a random sequence table (generated by SAS8.2), participants who satisfied the inclusion criteria will be allocated randomly into one of the two groups with a ratio of 1:1. The identification code and random number, which is unique for each participants, will be generated by the IVRS.</p></sec><sec><title>Allocation concealment</title><p>All researchers will receive training of allocation concealment at the central randomization office. The randomization sequence schedule is held and controlled by the appointed one who is not involved in this trials. The schedule is secret for researchers, participants and other research personnel before study, so allocation sequence is implemented in a secure manner to prevent foreknowledge by either of them.</p></sec><sec><title>Blindness</title><p>Double-blinding method is adopted in this study. Simulated agents of JQJT tablet have the same appearance, shape, color and packaging with JQJT tablets, so researchers and participants can not know the kind of medication and group.</p><p>Twice unblinding method is adopted in this study. Firstly, after close of data-base, the one who keep the blind code will deliver a allocation schedule only signed with group A and B to statistics department. Secondly, after the handing of statistical outcome and final report, the one keeping the blind code will declare real meaning of group A and B. In case of emergency during this trials, the blinding will be broken after obtaining the consent of principle investigator.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>According to the results of the "JQJT tablets intervene IGT study" by Professional Committee of Diabetes, Association of Integrative Medicine in Tianjin, annual average tyoe 2 diabetes conversion rate of test group is 4.05%, control group is 12.69%.
