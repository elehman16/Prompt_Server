cancer may reduce or cause DNA damage in colon tissue; however, no one has
assessed this hypothesis directly in humans. Thus, we enrolled 16 healthy
volunteers in a 4-week controlled feeding study where 8 subjects were
randomly assigned to dietary regimens containing meat cooked at either low
(100&#x000b0;C) or high temperature (250&#x000b0;C), each for 2 weeks in a crossover
design. The other 8 subjects were randomly assigned to dietary regimens
containing the high-temperature meat diet alone or in combination with 3
putative mutagen inhibitors: cruciferous vegetables, yogurt, and
chlorophyllin tablets, also in a crossover design. Subjects were nonsmokers,
at least 18 years old, and not currently taking prescription drugs or
antibiotics. We used the <italic>Salmonella</italic> assay to analyze the
meat, urine, and feces for mutagenicity, and the comet assay to analyze
rectal biopsies and peripheral blood lymphocytes for DNA damage.
Low-temperature meat had undetectable levels of heterocyclic amines (HCAs)
and was not mutagenic, whereas high-temperature meat had high HCA levels and
was highly mutagenic. The high-temperature meat diet increased the
mutagenicity of hydrolyzed urine and feces compared to the low-temperature
meat diet. The mutagenicity of hydrolyzed urine was increased nearly twofold
by the inhibitor diet, indicating that the inhibitors enhanced conjugation.
Inhibitors decreased significantly the mutagenicity of un-hydrolyzed and
hydrolyzed feces. The diets did not alter the levels of DNA damage in
non-target white blood cells, but the inhibitor diet decreased nearly
twofold the DNA damage in target colorectal cells. To our knowledge, this is
the first demonstration that dietary factors can reduce DNA damage in the
target tissue of fried-meat associated carcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00340743">NCT00340743</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer worldwide <xref rid="pone.0018707-Boyle1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, and consumption of red and

consumption of red meat and meat cooked at high temperature containing elevated

<xref rid="pone.0018707-Knize1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Numerous studies <italic>in vitro</italic>, in animals, and in humans indicate that
various dietary components, such as cruciferous vegetables, chlorophyllin (CHL), and

of cruciferous vegetables against fried-meat-induced genotoxicity, epidemiologic
studies <xref rid="pone.0018707-Higdon1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> did
not. Glucosinolates and isothiocyanates in cruciferous vegetables inhibit
HCA-induced genotoxicity by several mechanisms, including inhibition of phase I

genotoxicity by binding mutagens to the bacterial cell wall or by altered metabolism
of HCAs through changes in intestinal microflora <xref rid="pone.0018707-Fuchs1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Previous controlled feeding studies in humans focused on changes in urinary
mutagenicity after consumption of fried meat or inhibitors of fried meat-induced
mutagenesis <xref rid="pone.0018707-Peters1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.
Although urine mutagenicity can reflect systemic exposure to dietary mutagens and
antimutagens, it does not measure the ability of fried meat to induce DNA damage in
relevant cancer-target tissues, such as in colon epithelial cells, or the ability of
putative dietary antimutagens and anticarcinogens to reduce such damage.</p><p>To explore these issues, we used a crossover design and fed subjects diets containing
meat fried at low or high temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018707-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) cooked as described by Sinha et al. <xref rid="pone.0018707-Sinha3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Subjects were also fed diets
prepared with meat fried at high temperature alone or in combination with three
putative inhibitors of HCA-induced damage (cruciferous vegetables, chlorophyllin
tablets, and yogurt), again in a crossover design. Based on the protocol of Peters
et al. <xref rid="pone.0018707-Peters1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, we
evaluated the effects of the cooking methods and diets on meat and urinary
mutagenicity using the <italic>Salmonella</italic> (Ames) mutagenicity assay, and we
also extended this to fecal mutagenicity. To assess the effects of the diets on
target and non-target tissue, we used the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet)
assay to measure DNA damage in epithelial cells isolated from rectal biopsies and
from lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood. To our knowledge this is the first
study in humans to combine measurements of fecal and urinary mutagenicity with
assessment of DNA damage in the target tissue, colon epithelium, to evaluate the
genotoxic effects of HCAs and inhibition of that genotoxicity by dietary factors,
<italic>i.e.</italic>, cruciferous vegetables, CHL, and yogurt.</p><fig id="pone-0018707-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0018707.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Study Design.</title><p>Subjects were assigned randomly to arms and to treatment sequences with the

mutagenicity and was 4.5 and 7 times more mutagenic in YG1041 and YG1024,
respectively, than in TA98. Although the extract of beef was similarly mutagenic
in YG1024 and YG1041, the presence of nitroreductase in YG1041 clearly reduced
the mutagenicity of extracts from sausage and bacon, which likely contained
nitrites that helped to form nitroarenes that were converted to aromatic amines
by nitroreductase in YG1041. The potentially high nitrite levels in bacon may
account for the extremely high levels of mutagenicity of bacon extracts in all
three strains. Because of the potential contribution of nitrites along with HCAs
with the bacon, we decided not to include bacon in the feeding study so that we
were examining the effect of primarily HCAs.</p><p>Mean levels of HCAs and mutagenicity of extracts from 4 batches of

meat-derived HCAs may have been bound to dietary fiber and normal gut flora, and
their mutagenicity was revealed only when they were released by acid hydrolysis.
Because the total dietary fiber content was approximately 38&#x00025; greater
with inhibitors than without them, we cannot rule out a protective role for
fiber in the inhibitor diet.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Effect of inhibitors on urinary and fecal mutagenicity</title><p>Although the diet containing inhibitors produced a non-significant decrease in

about the relative importance of the three inhibitors and about their mechanism
of DNA-damage inhibition. For example, we could not evaluate the possible
interaction between the putative inhibitors, assessing whether their protective
mechanisms may have been synergistic or antagonistic with each other. Future
studies are warranted to study the protective mechanisms of each dietary
inhibitor, cruciferous vegetables, chlorophyllin, and yogurt alone against
HCA-induced genotoxicity. Although our study was not designed to examine
differences between women and men in the responses that we measured, a study
designed to confirm whether or not such differences exist is needed. Given the
few subjects and short-term dietary regimens, our results must be interpreted
with caution. Nevertheless, they indicate that meat cooked at high temperature
increased mutagenicity in urine and feces and that consumption of yogurt,
cruciferous vegetables, and CHL altered urinary and fecal mutagenicity and
reduced colorectal cell DNA damage. Although increased urinary mutagenicity
following consumption of highly fried meat is well established, our study is the
first to concurrently measure both fecal mutagenicity and DNA damage in colon
epithelium and to demonstrate that dietary antimutagens can alter these
characteristics.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Study population and design</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as

S1</xref>. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving 16 healthy
volunteers (8 men and 8 women) recruited by local advertisement from the Chapel
Hill, NC area. Subjects were non-smokers, aged 18&#x02013;45 (mean 29.5 y), had a
body mass index &#x0003c;30, and were not currently taking prescription medications
or antibiotics. Individuals were excluded if they consumed &#x0003e;2 alcoholic
drinks/day, were vegetarians, or had a history of diabetes, goiter, colitis, a
diagnosed thyroid condition, or occult bleeding.</p><p>Following a telephone interview to determine eligibility, we invited individuals
for a second interview. At this time, we described the study, asked about
dietary preferences, and administered a brief questionnaire on medical and diet
history (including meat intake). Initial screening measurements for each subject
included blood pressure, body temperature, and respiration rate. We recorded
height and weight for diet calculations, instructed subjects to eat only the
food provided by the CTRC, and prohibited use of aspirin, vitamins, and herbal
supplements during the study.</p><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the School of
Medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and by human studies approving
officials at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. All subjects provided
written informed consent.</p><p>This study had two arms, each a cross-over design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018707-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) that used 8 subjects (4 men and 4
women). For each arm, 2 men and 2 women were assigned randomly to a dietary
sequence consisting of 2 weeks on one defined diet followed by two weeks on
another; the remaining 4 subjects were assigned the same two diets in reverse
order. In arm 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018707-g001">Fig. 1</xref>),
one diet included beef and sausage cooked at low temperature (100&#x000b0;C); the
other diet included the same meat cooked at high temperature (250&#x000b0;C). Both
contained non-cruciferous vegetables. In arm 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018707-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), one diet included meat cooked at
high-temperature along with non-cruciferous vegetables; the other diet included
high-temperature meat along with the putative inhibitors (cruciferous
vegetables, chlorophyllin tablets, and yogurt). Because of limited capacity at
the Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC) at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, subjects were enrolled in groups of 4 for the 4-week
protocols. At the beginning of each study period, subjects were chosen by the
study coordinator for each arm and dietary sequence by random blind selection of
lots containing subject names from the pool of subjects available to participate
in that time period. Males and females were selected in separate random blind
lots so that assignment to dietary regimes was balanced by gender for all arms

&#x0223c;3.8&#x02013;4.2 g of cooked meat/kg body weight/day. For dietary sequences
containing putative HCA inhibitors, subjects consumed meals containing 500 g of
cruciferous vegetables/day (50&#x00025; cooked and 50&#x00025; raw), including
green and red cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower; two or three
3.3-oz containers/day based on body weight of DanActive&#x02122;, a probiotic

NC) and sausage (Wampler's Farm Sausage, Inc. Lenoir City, TN) locally. For
high-temperature meat diets, ground beef was cooked in 100-g patties at
250&#x000b0;C (482&#x000b0;F) on a commercial grill (Garland, New Port Richey, FL) for
11 min on each side for a total of 22 min then crumbled in an industrial mixer
(Univex, Salem, NH), weighed and frozen. Sausage patties (85 g) were cooked as
for ground beef and stored frozen as patties or crumbled meat. In a pilot study,
we tested the mutagenicity of bacon (Hormel Griddlemaster, purchased locally)
cooked at 250&#x000b0;C (482&#x000b0;F) for 11 min on a side. Because the mutagenicity
and HCA levels for high-temperature bacon varied significantly from those of the
high-temperature beef and sausage, we decided to use only beef and sausage
cooked at low and high temperature for the main study. For low-temperature meat
diets, beef and sausage were cooked at 100&#x000b0;C (212&#x000b0;F) for 10 min on each
side and held in a 90&#x000b0;C oven for 20 min to reduce moisture <xref rid="pone.0018707-Sinha3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Subjects
consumed different amounts of meat, depending on body weight, ranging from 211
g/day for the lightest subject (50 kg) to 343 g/day for the heaviest subject (90
kg). The amount of high-temperature meat consumed by each subject was calculated
to approximate the intake of HCAs/kg body weight in the previous NCI study <xref rid="pone.0018707-Sinha3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>We estimated amounts of inhibitors from previous studies; but these amounts were
designed for an overall effect and not as a means of finding the optimal amounts

previous studies that showed effective reduction in urine mutagenicity and
induction of GST isoforms <xref rid="pone.0018707-DeMarini2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The amount of CHL (300 mg/day) was a safe and
effective dose based on a previous human-intervention study <xref rid="pone.0018707-Egner1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. These
inhibitors were consumed together with high-temperature beef and sausage.
Without prior information on levels of lactobacilli needed for inhibition of
HCAs, we arbitrarily gave subjects 2 or 3 3-oz. containers of DanActive based on
body weight; subjects weighing over 65 kg received 3 containers/day.</p><p>Body weight was measured every weekday. To minimize weight changes, we adjusted
calories for weight changes of more than 1 kg from baseline weight recorded at
the start of the study. We designed three versions of the menu for each 2-week
period to provide variety to the diet and administered them on a 3-day cycle in
both phases of the study. Nutrient values of the foods used were based on the
USDA Standard Reference nutrient database (Number 16) and calculated using

colonies from one or more plates at each in a series of increasing
concentrations (doses) of the extract under test. The underlying theory
holds that the mutagenic potency of the extract is the slope of the linear
portion of the resulting dose-response relationship. Consequently, because
toxicity may cause the dose-response trajectory to flatten or turn down at
high doses, we followed toxicologic practice in allowing only doses deemed
within the linear range to contribute to estimation <xref rid="pone.0018707-Maron1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In the Supporting
Information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018707.s001">File S1</xref>), we provide dose-specific average counts for every
assay that we conducted.</p><p>Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0018707.e001.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> denote the expected (mean) number of mutant colonies
at dose <italic>d</italic>. For estimating mutagenic potency based on a
single assay, we modeled the expected counts as a linear function of dose,
namely, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0018707.e002.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0018707.e003.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, the expected
count at dose 0, reflects the background mutant yield in the
<italic>Salmonella</italic> strain used in the assay and
<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0018707.e004.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, the slope, is the mutagenic potency. We regarded
plate counts as Poisson distributed but allowed for over-dispersion among
plates within an assay. This model is a generalized linear model (GLM) with
a Poisson error distribution, the identity link function, and
over-dispersion parameter <xref rid="pone.0018707-McCullagh1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. We fit such GLMs
using PROC GENMOD in SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p><p>For estimating mutagenic potency when multiple specimens or multiple assays
per specimen contributed to a common average mutagenic potency, we used
closely related but more elaborate models that reflected sources of
variation in the data and assumptions about assay properties. If we assayed
multiple specimens (from the same or different treatments) on the same day,
their assays all shared the same dose 0 plate(s), reflecting that the
background mutant yield is regarded as the same for all specimens on a given
day; however, separate dose 0 plates were run on different days, reflecting
that uncontrolled day-to- day fluctuations in the laboratory environment
could induce minor day-to-day disturbances in the background mutant yield.
Similarly, we expected mutagenic potency to vary slightly from assay to
assay if, for example, a given specimen was assayed on multiple days or if
different specimens representing a given treatment were assayed on the same
day. To reflect such sources of extra-Poisson variation, we used generalized
linear mixed models (GLMMs) <xref rid="pone.0018707-McCulloch1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. As a simple
example, consider that we assayed a separate preparation of beef cooked at
high temperature on each of 3 days in strain YG1024. Our statistical
analysis was based on the following model:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0018707.e005.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>Here, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0018707.e006.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and

disturbances on day <italic>i</italic> to the intercept and to the mutagenic
potency, respectively, attributable to random day-to-day variation among
assays, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0018707.e011.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> represents the
expected number of mutant colonies at dose <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0018707.e012.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> on day
<italic>i</italic> conditional on the values of the disturbances. As
before, we regarded plate counts as Poisson distributed; in addition, the
disturbances <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0018707.e013.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and
<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0018707.e014.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (termed &#x02018;random effects&#x02019;) were modeled
as independent mean-zero Gaussian random variables, each with its own
variance. We modeled over-dispersion through a residual error variance. We
fit such GLMMs using the SAS GLIMMIX macro <xref rid="pone.0018707-SAS1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p><p>We applied GLMMs more elaborate than model (1) as the experiment's
design required. If an analysis involved estimation of mutagenic potencies
for more than one treatment, model (1) was extended to include additional
slopes (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0018707.e015.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>-terms) to estimate mutagenic potency for each
treatment. In addition, analyses for more complicated designs, like our
crossover designs, involved additional possible random disturbances to each
slope, that is, additional terms analogous to
<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0018707.e016.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> in model (1). For crossover designs, we also
considered carryover <xref rid="pone.0018707-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> from the diet given in one period onto the diet
given in the following period to influence slopes. Because
specimen-to-specimen or assay-to-assay variation in mutagenic potency tends
to be larger for treatments with higher mutagenic potency, our models
incorporated heterogeneity of variances across treatments for certain random
effects. To choose a parsimonious specification for modeling the random
effects in a GLMM, we used BIC <xref rid="pone.0018707-Schwarz1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, a widely used
model-selection criterion. Also, we checked that the estimated random
effects obeyed the Gaussian distribution assumption. In the following
subsections, we indicate when we used additional slopes, what random effects
were modeled for slopes, and whether the models involved heterogeneous
variances. All our GLMMs, like model (1), modeled only day as having a
random effect on the intercept.</p></sec><sec id="s4g3"><title>Estimation of mutagenic potency: meat extracts</title><p>Our pilot study assayed three types of meat (bacon, beef, sausage) cooked at

Treatment combinations that involved a single meat preparation assayed once

potency of two types of meat (beef, sausage) cooked at high temperature,
each type represented by 4 independent preparations. Assays were conducted
on three separate days (one beef and one sausage preparation each on two
days; two beef and two sausage preparations on the third). Each assay used
one plate per dose level. On each day, we used a single zero-dose plate for
both types of meat and, therefore, analyzed both types in a single
statistical analysis with a GLMM. We modeled expected plate counts as two

included random effects on mutagenic potencies (meat-type-specific slopes)
for days and for preparations within days.</p></sec><sec id="s4g4"><title>Estimation of mutagenic potency: urine</title><p>We collected urine specimens from every subject in every period of the
crossover design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018707-g001">Fig.
1</xref>) (though one specimen had sufficient volume for only an
unhydrolyzed sub-sample) and conducted assays on 4 days for arm-1 samples
and 4 days for arm-2 samples. On each day, one set of 3 or 6 zero dose
plates was used for all assays. Each specimen, including both the hydrolyzed
and unhydrolyzed sub-samples, was assayed on only one day. Each assay
involved 4&#x02013;5 non-zero doses (&#x000b5;mole creatinine) with one plate
per dose. We analyzed data from each arm separately with the same method of
analysis. We estimated mutagenic potencies and their standard errors for
each diet with both hydrolyzed and unhydrolyzed extracts (4 potency
estimates per arm); we also tested for differences in mutagenic potency
between diets separately for hydrolyzed and for unhydrolyzed extracts.</p><p>For each arm, we analyzed data on diet and acid hydrolysis treatment together
using a GLMM. We modeled the expected plate counts as 4 lines with a common
intercept and 4 separate slopes, one for each combination of diet and
hydrolysis treatment; we also allowed for possible carryover effects on
slopes. The GLMM included random effects of subjects, periods, specimens,
sub-samples on the slopes as well as residual variation. We accommodated
variance heterogeneity by allowing the variances of random effects for
specimens, sub-samples, and residual variation to depend on treatment
combination. The estimated mutagenic potencies that we report are adjusted
for carryover effects through the fitted model.</p></sec><sec id="s4g5"><title>Estimation of mutagenic potency: feces</title><p>The crossover design for fecal specimens involved two periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018707-g001">Fig. 1</xref>); we collected a
specimen from every subject in each period. Each specimen was represented by
a hydrolyzed and an un-hydrolyzed sub-sample. Plate-incorporation assays
were conducted on 7 days for arm-1 and 3 days for arm-2 specimens. On each
day, all specimens were represented by 2 or 3 zero-dose plates. Each
specimen, including both sub-samples, was assayed on three distinct days
(replicate assays). Each replicate assay involved 4&#x02013;5 non-zero doses
(mg lyophilized feces) with 1 or 2 plates per dose, depending on available
specimen volume.</p><p>We analyzed each arm of the study separately using the same GLMM. As with
urine, we modeled the expected plate counts as 4 lines with a common
intercept and 4 separate slopes, one for each combination of diet and
hydrolysis treatment; we also allowed for possible carryover effects on
slopes. The GLMM for feces differed from that for urine in accommodating
replicate assays of the same sub-samples. It included random effects of
subjects, periods, specimens, and replicate assays on the slopes as well
residual variation and allowed the variances of random effects for
specimens, assays, and residual variation to depend on treatment
combination. The estimated mutagenic potencies that we report are adjusted
for carryover effects through the fitted model.</p></sec><sec id="s4g6"><title>Estimation of DNA damage in leukocytes and colon epithelium cells</title><p>We had both leukocyte (WBC) samples and rectal epithelium biopsy specimens
from every subject each week during each arm of our crossover study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018707-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). All specimens
(WBCs and rectal cells) were evaluated by the comet assay on the day that
they were collected. For each specimen, we computed median TM values from
the comet assay across 50 cells per slide and averaged these medians across
4 slides; thus, our DNA-damage measure represented a typical value among 200
cells per specimen. We analyzed DNA damage in each arm and in leukocytes and
rectal epithelium separately, four analyses in all. We employed mixed-model
analysis-of-variance techniques appropriate for our crossover design <xref rid="pone.0018707-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> using
PROC MIXED&#x02122; in SAS 9.1. In each arm, after verifying that carryover
effects were unimportant (p&#x0003e;0.25), we estimated the mean response for
each diet using a model that included random effects of subject, period, and
residual error. We report model-based estimates and confidence limits for
mean TM for each diet.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0018707.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p>Data from mutagenicity and comet assay experiments.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0018707.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0018707.s002"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0018707.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0018707.s003"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0018707.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Larry D.
