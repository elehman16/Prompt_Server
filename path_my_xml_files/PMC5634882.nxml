Carpal tunnel release surgery is the only known long-term effective treatment. However, surgery is invasive and up to 30% of patients report recurrence or persistence of symptoms or suffer from post-surgical complications. A promising non-surgical treatment for CTS is mechanical wrist traction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical outcomes following mechanical traction in patients with CTS compared to care as usual.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Adult patients (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;181, mean age 58.1 (13.0) years, 67% women) with electrodiagnostically confirmed CTS were recruited from an outpatient neurology clinic in the Netherlands between October 2013 and April 2015. After baseline assessments, patients were randomized to either the intervention group (12 treatments with mechanical traction, twice a week for a period of 6&#x000a0;weeks) or &#x0201c;care as usual&#x0201d;. The main clinical outcome measure was surgery during 6&#x000a0;months&#x02019; follow-up. In addition, symptom severity was measured using the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) at baseline, 3, and 6&#x000a0;months&#x02019; follow-up.

In some cases, initial conservative treatment may be more cost-effective and preferred by the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This especially applies to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is a compressive nerve disorder in which the median nerve is compressed in the carpal tunnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is very common; the prevalence of CTS in the general population in the United States and the Netherlands is 4&#x02013;5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The compression leads to numbness, paresthesia, and pain, especially in the first three digits and the radial side of the ring finger, areas which are innervated by the median nerve. Symptoms are typically worse at night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. CTS can be diagnosed using electrodiagnostic testing to detect slowing of conduction velocity that results from median nerve compression-related damage and dysfunction of the myelin sheath [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Treatment options to relieve symptoms are either surgical or non-surgical. Non-surgical, less-invasive treatment options include oral non-steroidal drugs, corticosteroids (injections), splinting, exercise, and mobilization interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There is only short-term or limited evidence of benefit for these interventions. Many (non-steroidal) drugs are not significantly superior to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Local corticosteroid injections provide considerable symptom relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but seem to primarily suppress CTS symptoms and the treatment effect diminishes over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There is only limited evidence for the effectiveness of splinting, exercise, and mobilization interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Carpal tunnel release surgery is the only known treatment option with long-term positive effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Evidence suggests that surgery is a more effective treatment for CTS than conservative treatment (splinting or steroid injections) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, surgery is associated with several disadvantages: some patients suffer from sustained surgery-related pain, hand weakness or complications from surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Patient satisfaction rates of carpal tunnel release surgery vary between 70 and 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The remaining 20&#x02013;30% report persistence or recurrence of CTS symptoms or suffer from complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The reported frequency of re-operation rate is between 3 and 12% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Therefore, there is a clear need for an alternative, preferably non-invasive, therapy for CTS.</p><p id="Par15">A promising non-surgical treatment for CTS is mechanical wrist traction. This intervention involves repeated traction movements to the wrist in different positions using gravitational force. Brunarski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] described four case studies using mechanical traction that showed promising results. In an observational study among 78 CTS patients, treatment with mechanical traction resulted in a success rate of 70% immediately post treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and 60% after 2-year follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been performed to show clinical evidence for the effectiveness of mechanical traction as compared to &#x0201c;care as usual&#x0201d; (surgical and non-surgical interventions).</p><p id="Par16">The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of mechanical traction in patients with CTS compared to care as usual using an RCT. The main clinical outcome of the study was surgery for carpal tunnel release during 6&#x000a0;months&#x02019; follow-up. We also examined differences between mechanical traction vs. usual care on the decrease in symptom severity and hand function problems at follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par17">Patients diagnosed with CTS were recruited from the outpatient neurology clinic of VieCuri Medical Center in Venlo and Venray, the Netherlands between October 2013 and April 2015. Adult men and women (aged 18&#x02013;80 years) who were diagnosed with CTS by means of electrodiagnostic testing were invited to participate in the study. Electrodiagnostic values were considered abnormal if there was a difference greater than 0.5&#x000a0;ms on distal sensory latency (DSL) between the ulnar and median nerves in digit IV or between the radial and median nerves in digit I, a distal motor latency (DML) greater than 3.7&#x000a0;ms across the wrist to digit I of the median nerve (measured in the abductor pollicis brevis), or a difference greater than 0.4&#x000a0;ms in the median nerve across the wrist compared to the palmar branch of the median nerve to digit III. The criteria used for diagnosis were at least two abnormal measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Patients with a previous history of CTS surgery were excluded as well as those with insufficient understanding of the Dutch language. In addition, patients who were diagnosed with another known (rare) cause of neuropathy, or who suffered from a severe psychiatric disorder, such as personality disorder, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, were also excluded. During the visit to the outpatient clinic, the neurologist provided eligible patients with oral and written information about the study. In total, 500 eligible patients were invited of whom 181 patients agreed to participate and were randomized to mechanical traction intervention or care as usual. The main objections to participation were lack of time and transport. The eligibility of included patients was double-checked and full written informed consent was obtained, including access to patient medical record forms.

Self-reported functional status and symptom severity were measured using the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The BCTQ is a disease-specific questionnaire referring to a typical 24-h period in the past 2&#x000a0;weeks. It consists of two scales: the Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) and the Functional Status Scale (FSS). The SSS consists of 11 questions about symptom severity, while the FSS consists of eight daily activities which are rated based on degree of difficulty. The SSS and the FSS are rated on a five-point scale. Both scales result in mean scores between 1 and 5, where greater impairment is represented by higher scores. The total BCTQ score is calculated as the mean of all the items. The BCTQ is responsive to clinically relevant change and is, therefore, an appropriate measure for treatment outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

Moreover, the symptom severity had decreased significantly from baseline to follow-up in both groups, suggesting that not having received surgery did not result in a persistence of CTS-related symptoms.</p><p id="Par30">To date, this is the only RCT evaluating the effectiveness of mechanical traction. In 2004, Brunarski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] published a series of four case studies in which patients with CTS received mechanical traction. In all four cases, symptoms improved both subjectively and objectively (measured using electrodiagnostic studies). In an observational study among 78 patients, symptoms reduced significantly after mechanical traction immediately post treatment (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. After 2&#x000a0;years&#x02019; follow-up, 60% reported a reduction on the SSS subscale of the BCTQ compared to baseline and only 18% had had surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A few studies have compared other non-surgical treatments with surgery. Two RCTs comparing steroid injections to surgery reported conflicting results; one in favor of steroid injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and the other in favor of surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Jarvik et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] compared surgery to non-surgical treatment (anti-inflammatory drugs, hand therapy, and ultrasound therapy) in 116 patients. At 6&#x000a0;months&#x02019; follow-up, patients in the surgery group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;57) had significantly lower scores on the subscales SSS (&#x02212;0.42) and the FSS (&#x02212;&#x02009;0.46) of the BCTQ compared to patients in the non-surgical treatment group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;59), but the clinical relevance of the difference was only modest. In a study by Gerritsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], surgery was more effective than splinting. However, they did not include patients with very mild or very severe symptoms. Altogether, evidence regarding the effectiveness of non-surgical compared to surgical treatment is limited and has provided conflicting results.</p><p id="Par31">In line with the current study, Baker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] reported that an orthosis and stretch intervention was inversely related to progression to surgery at 6&#x000a0;months. In the current study, over 35% fewer patients underwent surgery compared to the care-as-usual group. Many patients do not prefer surgery when there is another non-invasive treatment available. There are several reasons for patients, or physicians, to choose conservative treatment, including symptom severity, age, patients&#x02019; perception of the efficacy of a certain treatment, insurance, patients&#x02019; educational level, pregnancy status (during which CTS is highly prevalent) and the presence of comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">The median time to surgery was longer in the intervention group compared to the care-as-usual group, meaning that surgery was delayed for approximately the duration of the intervention. Therefore, it is not likely that a substantial number of patients will have had surgery after 6&#x000a0;months in the intervention group compared to the care-as-usual group. Moreover, both survival curves in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> regress to a horizontal line, which also suggests not many people receive surgery after 6&#x000a0;months in both groups.</p><p id="Par33">The characteristics of CTS patients in the present investigation are comparable to the CTS patient sample at an outpatient neurology clinic (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;116) in the study by Jarvik et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], based on age, gender, percentage of patients with bilateral symptoms and mean SSS score (2.86 vs. 2.98, respectively). Compared to the population of patients with electrodiagnostically confirmed CTS in the study by Gerritsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], our study population is slightly older (58 vs. 49&#x000a0;years), we included less women (67% vs. 76%) and patients with more severe symptoms (mean SSS 2.9 vs. 2.5). Gerritsen et al., however, applied more specific exclusion criteria, excluding patients with diabetes, which could explain the difference.</p><p id="Par34">Patients included in the study did not differ from eligible patients at the outpatient neurology clinic based on the distribution of gender and affected hand; however, they were slightly older. The main objections to participation were long traveling distance to the clinic and lack of time. Older people often have more time, because they are less likely to have young children or a full-time job. In the care-as-usual group, there was a significantly higher dropout rate compared to the intervention group, which is a common limitation of randomized controlled trials: participants may be disappointed to be randomized to the control group and feel less motivated to continue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">A limitation of the study is the lack of discrimination between hands in bilaterally affected patients. Other studies only included the most severely affected hand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] or assessed both hands separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, it is often difficult for patients to discriminate between hands when assessing symptom severity, and only including one hand in bilaterally affected patients was not preferable for ethical and practical reasons. Another limitation is that the response to intervention was based on the patients&#x02019; symptoms perception, not by an objective measure, such as electrodiagnostic testing. However, electrodiagnostic testing is not sensitive enough to clinical change following treatment: after surgery, nerve conduction improves, but only moderately correlates to patient-reported improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Patient-reported outcomes are considered superior in evaluating treatment effect and are used in most studies evaluating treatment effectiveness and the BCTQ is a highly validated self-reporting symptom questionnaire which is commonly used in clinical practice to evaluate changes of symptoms after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Lastly, complete data on other forms of treatment received by patients (other than mechanical traction or surgery) was not available. Of the 82 participants who completed in the intervention group, three patients had received a corticosteroid injection and 14 patients used a wrist splint at follow-up. Of the 56 participants who completed in the care-as-usual group, three patients had received a corticosteroid injection and 11 used a wrist splint. A strength of this study is the selection of the control group. Patients in the control group received care as usual, and hence we compared the intervention to standard care and not to a specific control treatment. This design leads to more generalizable results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par36">Treatment of CTS by means of mechanical traction can possibly prevent progression of symptoms requiring surgery within 6&#x000a0;months in CTS patients. Because up to 30% of patients who received surgery report (new) CTS symptoms at longer follow-up (1 to 2&#x000a0;years), a longer period of observation is needed to compare the long-term effect of mechanical traction to care as usual (including surgery). The mechanism for the effectiveness of mechanical traction is still unclear. We expect that traction improves blood microcirculation, reduces edema in the synovial tissue and, therefore, reduces pressure in the carpal tunnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Future studies should focus on what the possible working mechanism is of mechanical traction. The clinical relevance of the current study is that by introducing a new non-invasive treatment of CTS, different subgroups of CTS patients might be identified who will benefit from mechanical traction. This approach may result in a substantial reduction in the number of surgeries with similar patient-reported symptoms. Mechanical traction may prove to be a more cost-effective intervention for CTS than surgery. Moreover, the current study contributes to the current discussion regarding the critical evaluation of the actual benefit of invasive interventions in general in comparison to more conservative approaches.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BCTQ</term><def><p id="Par6">Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTS</term><def><p id="Par7">Carpal tunnel syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DML</term><def><p id="Par8">Distal motor latency</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSL</term><def><p id="Par9">Distal sensory latency</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FSS</term><def><p id="Par10">Functional Status Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par11">Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SSS</term><def><p id="Par12">Symptom Severity Scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank Rob Oostenrijk for sharing his experience with the Phystrac traction device and for his advice on the trial design; Contex bv for providing the Phystrac traction devices; and all the neurologists at VieCuri Medical Center for patient recruitment.
