At week 16, patients with inadequate response early escaped with blinded dose adjustments (placebo to 50&#x02005;mg, 50&#x02005;mg to 100&#x02005;mg). At week 24, all patients receiving placebo crossed over to 50&#x02005;mg. Blinded active therapy continued through week 104; from week 104 to week 252, the golimumab dose could be adjusted.

Observed response rates among the 255 (72%) patients who continued golimumab through week 252 were consistent, albeit somewhat higher. Among patients who increased golimumab from 50 to 100&#x02005;mg, 60.6% (20/33) and 44.7% (17/38) achieved ASAS20/ASAS40 responses, respectively, following &#x02265;2 consecutive doses of golimumab 100&#x02005;mg.

treated with golimumab (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2014205862TB1">table 1</xref>), most commonly osteoarthritis requiring hospitalisation (2.0%), pneumonia (1.1%), worsening of AS (1.1%), and depression (1.1%). No increases in serious AEs were observed in successive years of golimumab treatment (see online supplementary table S2).</p><p>One (0.3%) patient, randomised to receive golimumab 50&#x02005;mg, died from pancreatic cancer. This patient had also developed lymphoma after 3&#x02005;years in the study and was receiving chemotherapy when the pancreatic cancer was discovered. The overall incidence of death for patients treated with golimumab was 0.07/100&#x02005;patient-years (95% CI 0.00 to 0.38), with no difference observed between doses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2014205862TB1">table 1</xref>). In addition to the malignancies in one patient described above, two patients treated with golimumab had non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) through week 268, including one (1.3%) patient each receiving golimumab 50&#x02005;mg and 100&#x02005;mg and golimumab 100&#x02005;mg only. For lymphoma, NMSC, other malignancies and all malignancies, the incidences per 100&#x02005;patient-years did not appear to be dose-related (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2014205862TB1">table 1</xref>). Similarly, the incidences of malignancies other than NMSC (excluded from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database) were not elevated relative to those expected in the USA population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2014205862TB1">table 1</xref>). No overall increase in the incidence of malignancies was observed in successive years of golimumab treatment (see online supplementary table S2).</p><p>Serious infections were reported for 5.9% (21/353) of patients treated with golimumab through week 268. Pneumonia (four (1.1%) patients) was the only serious infection reported by more than one patient. The incidence of serious infections among patients receiving golimumab 100&#x02005;mg appeared higher than for patients receiving only golimumab 50&#x02005;mg (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2014205862TB1">table 1</xref>). No increase in serious infections was observed, however, in successive years of golimumab treatment (see online supplementary table S2).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Improvements in signs/symptoms, physical function, range of motion and HRQoL achieved at week 24<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and sustained through week 104<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> of GO-RAISE were also sustained with up to 5&#x02005;years of golimumab treatment of patients with AS. While findings were generally similar between the golimumab doses, this is the first report to assess the effects of a dose increase in patients with AS who had inadequate response to golimumab 50&#x02005;mg. When investigators were allowed to increase the dose in consultation with their patients for lack of efficacy, 61% of patients gained ASAS20 response. While the golimumab dose approved for the treatment of active AS is 50&#x02005;mg, this is an important finding that reflects a scenario likely to be encountered in clinical practice. Results of the recently published certolizumab trial in axial spondyloarthritis, which compared the same cumulative dose given at two different dosing intervals (200&#x02005;mg every 2&#x02005;weeks and 400&#x02005;mg every 4&#x02005;weeks), indicated very similar efficacy.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Thus, to our knowledge, GO-RAISE is the only large prospective trial of a TNF-inhibitor in AS comparing two different doses and showing a dose response in patients who have inadequate response to the lower dose. Similar findings have been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Approximately a fifth of the 255 patients who participated in the long-term extension did not achieve an ASAS20 response at 5&#x02005;years, yet they continued to receive golimumab and completed the trial, which is consistent with results observed through &#x0003e;3&#x02005;years of etanercept<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and 5&#x02005;years of adalimumab<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> in patients with AS. Thus, while ASAS20 response is a validated composite measure of patient outcome, it may not include all aspects of improvement important to patients. Also, while 20% improvement in symptoms is the lowest level acceptable to a clinician to indicate efficacy, an individual patient may consider a different level of improvement acceptable to continue that therapy. Indeed, we determined that even though these patients were deriving &#x0003c;20% relief in their night-time pain, overall back pain, and sleep improvement, their cumulative improvement was enough for them to elect study continuation. Since treatment with TNF-inhibitors can be costly, recommendations on the expected minimal therapeutic response for such agents have been published by independent organisations such as ASAS. These recommendations include assessment of response based on one outcome measure, plus expert opinion, for continuation of treatment. Our results, as well as those observed with other agents, suggest that there is apparent benefit, including improved performance-based physical function in ASAS20 non-responders, experienced by patients that is not captured by a single measure.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref> Hence, other tertiary end points or patient-reported outcomes should be considered in future research of treatment persistence.</p><p>The golimumab safety profile through week 268 was consistent with those previously reported.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Importantly, no increases in serious AEs, malignancies, serious infection or injection-site reactions were observed in successive years of golimumab treatment.</p><p>While efficacy analyses were performed using a conservative ITT approach, and consistency was observed between the ITT and observed data analyses, the findings reported here remain limited by several factors. It is important to note that no patients received placebo, and thus there is no control group, after week 24. Also, the study was blinded through the week 100 database lock, but open label from that point forward. Changes to the golimumab dose from 50&#x02005;mg to 100&#x02005;mg or from 100&#x02005;mg to 50&#x02005;mg during the study extension were at the discretion of the investigator. Thus, since dose escalation was uncontrolled, conclusions related to dose change are limited. Additionally, while long-term efficacy and safety have been observed over 5&#x02005;years, long-term effectiveness in the context of cost-effectiveness requires evaluation using real-world data in patients with AS treated with golimumab.</p><p>Taken together, results reported here indicate that clinical improvements observed in patients with AS treated with golimumab through week 24 were sustained through up to 5&#x02005;years of treatment. Importantly, no new safety signals were detected, and the golimumab benefit-risk profile remains positive.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2014-205862-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e848" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the patients, the investigators and the study personnel who made this trial possible.
