PPH can be prevented by active management of the third stage of labor (AMTSL), a series of steps recommended by the World Health Organization to be performed by skilled birth attendants (SBAs). Task shifting in the AMTSL step of uterotonic drugs administration to community health workers, traditional birth attendants and self-administration has been investigated as a strategy to increase access to quality obstetric care considering persistent SBA and facility-based delivery shortages. The aim of this study is to assess task shifting in the final step of AMTSL and compare uterine tonus assessment by a SBA to self-assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Design</title><p>The study is an individual-level two-arm non-inferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT). A total of 800 women will be recruited in Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Ghana. Adult women in labor at term with an expected vaginal delivery who received antenatal instructions for self-assessment of uterine tonus will be eligible for inclusion. Women with an increased risk for PPH will be excluded. Women will be randomized to uterine tone assessment by a skilled birth attendant (midwife) or uterine tone self-assessment (with the safety back-up of a midwife present in case of PPH or uterine atony). Postpartum blood loss will be measured through weighing of disposable mats. The main study endpoints are PPH (&#x02265;500&#x000a0;ml blood loss), severe PPH (&#x02265;1000&#x000a0;ml blood loss), mean blood loss, and routine maternal and neonatal outcomes. Participants and caregivers will not be blinded given the nature of the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>A reduction of PPH-related maternal mortality requires full implementation of AMTSL. Task shifting of uterine tone assessment may contribute to increased AMTSL implementation in (clinical) settings where SBAs capacity is constrained.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02223806">NCT02223806</ext-link>, registration August 2014.

Almost all (99&#x000a0;%) of these deaths occur in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC), with the largest burden in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The most common cause of maternal death is postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), defined as blood loss equal to or greater than 500&#x000a0;ml within 24&#x000a0;h after birth of the infant. PPH occurs in around 10.5&#x000a0;% of all deliveries and is responsible for more than 130,000 deaths annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In sub-Saharan Africa, 33.9&#x000a0;% of maternal deaths are due to PPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The maternal mortality ratio of Ghana in 2013 was 380 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The leading cause of maternal deaths was obstetric hemorrhage, with estimates ranging between 27 and 32&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Causes of PPH include uterine atony, uterine rupture, incisions, lacerations and coagulopathy, with uterine atony being the most common cause of PPH. Risk factors for atony include multiparity (five or more deliveries), polyhydramnios, fetal macrosomia, abnormal placentation, placental abruption, induced or prolonged labor and retained placental tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>AMTSL can prevent PPH</title><p>Whether a woman dies from PPH depends largely on access to timely and competent obstetric care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. PPH mostly occurs during the third and fourth stages of labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and active management of the third stage of labor (AMTSL) can prevent its occurrence. AMTSL is recommended as a series of steps performed by skilled birth attendants (SBAs) by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the international professional organizations of gynecologists and midwives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The steps include the provision of uterotonic drugs (oxytocin or misoprostol) immediately upon fetal delivery, controlled cord traction, massage of the fundus of the uterus immediately after placental delivery in the absence of uterotonics, and routine assessment of the uterine tonus every 15&#x000a0;min for the first 2&#x000a0;h postpartum.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Task shifting in AMTSL</title><p>AMTSL when performed by SBAs is the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; for prevention of PPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and can reduce excessive blood loss by 50&#x02013;70&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This provides a challenge in many LMIC where the majority of women live in rural areas and deliver at home without SBAs available, often assisted by traditional birth attendants or family members who are not educated in obstetric care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Task shifting of AMTSL to community health workers, traditional birth attendants, or self-administration has been explored as a strategy to increase access to quality obstetric care in response to the obstacles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Of all AMTSL interventions, uterotonic drugs are the most effective in preventing PPH, although the relative contribution of each of the AMTSL components has not been well-studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Oxytocin is the preferred uterotonic drug. However, as oxytocin is thermo-unstable, requires refrigeration and should be injected by SBAs, misoprostol is considered a safe, cheap and only slightly less effective alternative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The WHO recommends the provision of misoprostol by community health workers for PPH prevention in rural areas and homebirths in absence of SBAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The community distribution of misoprostol for self-administration by women is also widely explored as an option, but currently not recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Controlled cord traction is contraindicated without assistance of a SBA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no research or recommendation about the relative contribution of uterine tonus assessment for the prevention of PPH available, or the effect of task shifting of uterine tonus assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, the aim of this non-inferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to determine whether there is a difference in outcomes following routine uterine tone assessment every 15&#x000a0;min in the first 2&#x000a0;h postpartum performed by a SBA (midwife) compared to self-assessment by a patient.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study design</title><p>This study will be a pragmatic non-inferiority individual-level two-arm RCT comparing two strategies of AMTSL.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participants</title><p>The population base for the current study is pregnant women admitted in labor at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH).

Because visual estimation has been established to be inaccurate, especially with larger amounts of blood loss, other more objective methods to diagnose PPH have been developed. These methods are direct measurement, gravimetry and photometry. With direct measurement, blood is directly collected in a pan or collector bag. With photometry, the amount of blood loss can be determined by a process to convert blood pigment to alkaline hematine and subsequently analyzed. This method is referred to as the &#x0201c;gold standard.&#x0201d; However, in low resource settings the availability of this photometric method will be low and the time needed to extract all blood from linen and pads will take too long to diagnose PPH. A method commonly used in clinical practice as an alternative is gravimetry in which standard-sized pads (e.g. &#x0201c;INCOpads,&#x0201d; 90 x 60&#x000a0;cm) soaked with blood are weighed after delivery of the placenta, and grams converted to milliliters of blood loss. Although this method is accurate in diagnosing PPH, it can overestimate the incidence of PPH, because it is difficult to discriminate blood from other fluids like urine or amniotic fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In this study, the gravimetric method for diagnosing PPH will be applied.</p><p>We acknowledge that this study&#x02019;s sample size and (clinical) setting may not allow for immediate generalizability to other settings. Instead, larger studies which include other clinical settings and non-clinical settings will be necessary to externally validate the findings before implementation. Future research could also include the relative contribution of tonus assessment to the prevention of PPH, the optimal training program and timing of training.
