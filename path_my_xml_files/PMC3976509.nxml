Affected individuals usually appear normal at birth, but intracellular GAG accumulation leads to progressive development of multisystemic clinical manifestations, including short stature, skeletal abnormalities, respiratory complications, cardiac disease, corneal clouding, hearing loss, spinal cord compression and reduced physical endurance (Giugliani et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2007</xref>; Valayannopoulos et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>). Patients typically present with the radiographic changes of dysostosis multiplex, which comprise malformations of the skull, thorax, spine, pelvis, long bones and hands (Lachman et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010</xref>). There is wide variability in phenotypic presentation. Rapidly progressing patients usually begin to show symptoms shortly after birth and are typically diagnosed between 2 and 4&#x000a0;years of age (unless they have a family history). Most do not live to adulthood. Individuals with a slower disease course typically develop similar symptoms later in life (Thumler et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2012</xref>). Urinary GAG levels &#x0003e;&#x02009;200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mg creatinine are generally associated with rapidly progressive disease while urinary GAG levels &#x0003c;&#x02009;100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mg creatinine are associated with a slowly progressing clinical course and longer survival (Swiedler et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>).</p><p>Galsulfase (Naglazyme&#x000ae;), a recombinant human <italic>N</italic>&#x02013;acetylgalactosamine 4&#x02013;sulfatase (rh-arylsulfatase B; rhASB), is currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and regulatory agencies in several other countries as first-line therapy for MPS VI at an intravenous (IV) infusion dose of 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg/week. Treatment with this dose of galsulfase has been shown to improve walking and stair-climbing capacity (Harmatz et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2005</xref>). Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with galsulfase has also resulted in improvements in pulmonary function (Harmatz et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>), growth rate (Decker et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>), and pubertal development (Decker et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>). Approval of galsulfase as treatment for MPS VI was based on improvement in endurance in patients older than 5&#x000a0;years of age. Studies of two MPS VI sibling pairs, one from Australia (McGill et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>) and one from Japan (Furujo et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>), as well as a recent report from Brazil of 34 MPS VI children younger than 5&#x000a0;years (Horovitz et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2013</xref>), suggest that initiation of ERT at an earlier age facilitates better outcomes, underscoring the need to evaluate the use of galsulfase in infants and very young children in controlled trials. Moreover, early intervention may have the potential to normalize bone growth and reduce the significant morbidity caused by skeletal involvement. Although results from both sibling studies suggest that early ERT at the 1&#x000a0;mg/kg/week dose does not prevent the progression of skeletal pathology in MPS VI infants and children under 5&#x000a0;years of age (Furujo et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>; McGill et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>), the effect of a higher dose of galsulfase has not been investigated. In MPS VI-affected cats, improvements in bone development as well as other MPS VI disease symptoms were associated with higher enzyme doses when ERT was initiated from birth (Byers et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1997</xref>; Crawley et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1997</xref>). Administration of a weekly 2&#x000a0;mg/kg dose would represent a significant increase in drug exposure as well as enable evaluation of safety of a higher dose.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of two dose levels (1.0 and 2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg/week) of galsulfase on the progression of skeletal dysplasia (as reflected by changes in radiographs, physical appearance, and growth) in infants with MPS VI. The secondary objective was to evaluate efficacy based on urinary GAG levels and assessments of gross and fine motor function, cardiac function, vision, hearing, and health resource utilization. In addition, the safety of ERT in infants was evaluated at these two dose levels. We describe the efficacy and safety results of galsulfase therapy administered in four infants for a minimum of 52&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a multicenter, multinational, open-label, randomized, two-dose level study conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. An institutional review board (IRB) or independent ethics committee (IEC) at each study center approved the study protocol, the subject informed consent form (ICF) and all subject recruitment materials. Parents or legal guardian signed an ICF prior to study enrollment and performance of any study-specific procedures and assessments.</p><p>Subjects who met eligibility criteria or received protocol exemptions at screening underwent baseline assessments over a 2-week period and were randomized 1:1 to weekly, open-label treatment with either 1.0 or 2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg of galsulfase administered by IV infusion for a minimum of 52&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Subject selection</title><p>Subjects were initially required to be less than 1&#x000a0;year of age, to be diagnosed with MPS VI (through documented prenatal diagnosis or fibroblast or leukocyte ASB enzyme activity level &#x0003c;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;% of the lower limit of the normal range) and to have no evidence of skeletal dysplasia based on physical examination. Protocol exemptions were granted by the sponsor to the investigative sites for two infants based on age greater than 1&#x000a0;year (53 and 55&#x000a0;weeks) and for all subjects based on presence of skeletal dysplasia. Due to the rarity of MPS VI and difficulty in diagnosis before 2 to 3&#x000a0;years of age, recruitment was challenging. After significant effort (&#x0003e;2&#x000a0;years) to recruit patients, it was deemed that inclusion of patients slightly over 1&#x000a0;year of age and with radiographic evidence of skeletal dysplasia was sufficient and necessary to complete the study. Two subjects (subjects 1 and 2) were identified and evaluated for MPS VI based on known family history (older sibling with diagnosed MPS). The other two subjects (subjects 3 and 4) were tested for MPS VI based on clinical symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study drug administration</title><p>Subjects received weekly IV infusions of galsulfase. Two subjects (subjects 1 and 4) received pre-medication with antihistamine from the time of initiation of study drug infusions. Galsulfase doses were recalculated at monthly intervals based on the most recent weight obtained. Galsulfase solution was diluted with sterile 0.9&#x000a0;% sodium chloride solution to 50&#x000a0;mL for subjects weighing less than 5&#x000a0;kg, 100&#x000a0;mL for subjects between 5 and 10&#x000a0;kg and 250&#x000a0;mL for subjects weighing at least 10&#x000a0;kg. Infusion rates were adjusted so that approximately 2.5&#x000a0;% of the total solution was infused during the first hour and the remaining volume (approximately 97.5&#x000a0;%) over a minimum of an additional 3&#x000a0;h.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Primary efficacy assessments</title><p>Primary efficacy was assessed by changes in dysmorphic features in physical examinations, radiographic changes, and anthropometric growth measurements. Physical examinations were performed by individual site investigators at screening and follow-up visits, noting presence or absence of dysmorphic changes characteristic of MPS VI including, but not limited to, coarse facies, joint contractures, bony abnormalities of the spine and thorax, and claw hand deformity. Skeletal surveys were performed at baseline and at 52&#x000a0;weeks after initiation of study treatment. Radiographs were reviewed by a pediatric radiologist (R.S. Lachman) with extensive experience evaluating radiographs for MPS pathologies. Growth assessments, consisting of length, weight and head circumference measurements (Kuczmarski et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2002</xref>), were conducted at baseline and throughout the duration of treatment for each patient. Because subjects were enrolled over a period of &#x0003e;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;years, growth data ranged from 52&#x000a0;weeks for the last subject enrolled to 152&#x000a0;weeks for the first subject enrolled.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Secondary efficacy assessments</title><p>Urinary GAG levels were evaluated at baseline and throughout the duration of treatment for each subject prior to infusions using the Automated Quantitation of Total Sulfated Glycosaminoglycans in Urine procedure with the GAGBotI Analyzer (Whitley et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1989</xref>). Gross and fine motor skills were evaluated using the DENVER II Development Test (Frankenburg et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1992</xref>) in three subjects (subjects 1, 2 and 4) and by the Griffiths Scales (Ivens and Martin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2002</xref>) in one subject (subject 3) at baseline and weeks 26 and 52.</p><p>Cardiac data were extracted from reports submitted by participating sites. At each site, cardiac function was assessed at baseline and at week 52 by transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography including color and Doppler interrogation of cardiac valves. Measurements included left ventricular chamber dimensions in systole and diastole, diastolic septal and posterior wall thicknesses, and interrogation of cardiac valves for the presence or absence of stenosis or regurgitation. Body surface area-based Z-scores were calculated for chamber dimensions and wall thicknesses to allow comparison within the same subject over time and between subjects of different body surface areas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://parameterz.blogspot.com/">http://parameterz.blogspot.com/</ext-link>).</p><p>Complete ophthalmologic evaluations were conducted at baseline and at week 52, and included intraocular pressure (IOP) for glaucoma, examination of the retina and optic nerve, and documentation of corneal clouding. Audiological testing by audiometry was conducted at baseline and at week 52. Health resource utilization at baseline and throughout the study was queried through a questionnaire which documented the occurrence of physical therapy, hospitalizations, procedures performed, outpatient visits, and emergency room (ER) visits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Safety was assessed throughout each infusion and for a minimum of 1&#x000a0;h post-infusion, by physical examinations, medical history, vital signs, concomitant medications (prescription and over the counter), changes in laboratory parameters, anti-rhASB antibody testing and adverse events (AEs). Total anti-rhASB antibody analysis was conducted using a validated bridged immunoassay format based on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection (BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Novato, CA, USA) and was performed throughout the duration of treatment for each subject.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data in this small number of subjects.

No subject withdrew from the study. All subjects were male with a mean age at the time of enrollment of 9.2&#x000a0;months (40&#x000a0;weeks). At baseline, subjects 1, 2, 3, and 4 were aged 8.8, 3.3, 12.1 and 12.7&#x000a0;months, respectively. The two oldest subjects were randomized to 2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg/week galsulfase. The diagnosis of MPS VI disease was confirmed upon enrollment (ASB enzyme activity in fibroblasts for 1 subject and leukocyte ASB enzyme activity in whole blood for 3 subjects). Serum TSH and free T4 levels were assessed as normal for all subjects. Urinary GAG levels at baseline were high for all subjects, with an overall mean of 870 &#x003bc;g/mg creatinine. Subjects 3 and 4 in the 2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg/week dose group were administered all doses of scheduled galsulfase infusions. Subjects 1 and 2 in the 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg/week dose group each missed at least one galsulfase infusion (a total of four missed infusions) within the first 52&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, resulting in a compliance rate of 98&#x000a0;% over this time period. In total, subjects received 392 of 396 scheduled doses over the course of the study for an overall treatment compliance rate of 99&#x000a0;%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Primary efficacy</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Physical appearance</title><p>All subjects presented with some characteristic clinical features of MPS VI at baseline and throughout the study period, as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Kyphosis (subjects 1, 3 and 4), and chest wall deformities (pectus carinatum in subjects 1 and 3, and pectus excavatum in subject 4) were the most commonly reported findings at baseline. Facial dysmorphism improved in subject 3 and did not worsen in subject 2 after 52&#x000a0;weeks of ERT. Pectus carinatum in subject 3 was reportedly less pronounced after 52&#x000a0;weeks of therapy. Clinical kyphosis was absent at baseline but developed in subject 2 by week 26. Macrocephaly &#x0003e;&#x02009;97th percentile was noted in subject 3 at baseline and through week 52. Mild joint contractures, reported at baseline for subjects 1 and 2, did not appear to change in severity during the study period. Hepatosplenomegaly, which was present at baseline in subjects 1 and 4, had normalized after 52&#x000a0;weeks in subject 1 and did not worsen in subject 4.

The phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials did not include subjects younger than 5&#x000a0;years of age. Two recent sibling study reports suggest that galsulfase administered at the 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg/week dose level in infants is safe and provides clinical benefit (Furujo et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>; McGill et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>). Although the limited number of subjects, short period of treatment, and absence of a control group or matched sibling population in our study do not allow for definitive conclusions regarding efficacy of galsulfase in this age group, results from this study do provide further insight into the potential benefits and limitations of early initiation of therapy.</p><p>The primary goal of this study was to investigate the effect of two dose levels of galsulfase on the progression of MPS VI skeletal dysplasia as determined by dysmorphic changes, radiographic changes, and growth. Our results suggest that galsulfase therapy improves or prevents progression of facial dysmorphism in infants, a finding that is consistent with the two MPS VI sibling studies (Furujo et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>; McGill et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>). However, galsulfase treatment did not prevent the progression of dysostosis multiplex in the four subjects in this study, although radiographic improvement of kyphosis was observed in one subject. Similarly, dysostosis multiplex changes continued to develop in the galsulfase-treated infants in the MPS VI sibling studies. Despite initiation of ERT at 8&#x000a0;weeks and 182&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, the skeletal survey of the younger Australian MPS VI sibling was reported to reveal similar radiographic abnormalities at 3.6&#x000a0;years as those of her older sibling at the same age, who was untreated at the time (McGill et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>). Prevention of scoliosis in the younger sibling was associated with galsulfase treatment, however. Pre- and post-ERT spine and hand radiographs of the younger sibling of the Japanese MPS VI sibling pair revealed progression of manifestations of dysostosis multiplex despite commencement of therapy at 6&#x000a0;weeks and 36&#x000a0;months of treatment; however, these radiographic changes were comparatively milder than those of her older sibling at the same age, suggesting that galsulfase may have slowed the progression of the characteristic radiographic changes (Furujo et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>). In our study, randomization allocated the lower dose level to the two youngest subjects, subjects 1 and 2, who at baseline showed fewer radiographic abnormalities compared to the older subjects. The impact of a higher dose or an increased dosing frequency on bone pathology warrants further investigation. The impact of neonatal intervention should also be investigated. A newborn without radiological evidence of dysostosis multiplex was reported to have initiated galsulfase treatment at 5&#x000a0;days of age (Horovitz et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2013</xref>); radiological follow-up of this patient would be insightful, particularly as our youngest subject (subject 2) already had radiographic abnormalities at onset of therapy at age 3.3&#x000a0;months. Elucidation of the mechanisms that cause the various bone pathologies of MPS disease may provide additional insight into the optimal mode of therapy.</p><p>All four subjects were able to maintain or achieve normal growth for the duration of the study. However, it is difficult to determine if treatment with galsulfase contributed to normal growth (length) maintenance since MPS VI patients may demonstrate growth acceleration with advanced bone maturation during the first years of life (Heron et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2004</xref>); a similar growth pattern has also been reported in young children with Morquio A syndrome (Montano et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2008</xref>). Longer follow-up over 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;years will be necessary to assess the long-term effects of galsulfase on height. Increased height and rate of growth in response to long-term galsulfase therapy has been demonstrated in MPS VI patients aged 5&#x000a0;years and older, with those under 16&#x000a0;years of age showing the greatest improvements (Decker et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with results from previous clinical studies (Harmatz et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>), reductions of approximately 70&#x000a0;% in urinary GAG levels from baseline were observed for all subjects (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These levels approached age-normalized upper limits of normal (Gallegos-Arreola et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2000</xref>; Iwata et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2000</xref>; Wood et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>). While urinary GAG levels decreased throughout the study, anti-rhASB antibodies increased to levels as high as &#x02265;&#x02009;1,770,000 DF (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). A recent study of MPS VI patients followed for 5&#x000a0;years showed no correlation between antibody titers and urinary GAG levels, including in patients who developed titers &#x02265;&#x02009;1,770,000 DF (Hendriksz et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>). Similar stability of urinary GAG levels in the presence of antibody was also observed for most patients in the phase 3 clinical trial (Harmatz et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>).</p><p>No declines in gross or fine motor function were observed in any of the infants, including subject 1 with suspected motor delay. Motor development and speech delay have been reported in MPS VI children under 5&#x000a0;years of age (Horovitz et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2013</xref>). It will require longer follow-up of the study cohort to determine the significance of the delay in subject 1 and the continued normality in the other subjects. It is notable that subject 1 had to relocate with one parent to the study site and this disruption may have contributed to the developmental delay.</p><p>Cardiac dimensions were within one standard deviation of normal and cardiac function was normal at both baseline and after 52&#x000a0;weeks of treatment in these infants. Although mitral regurgitation was identified in three subjects at baseline, it was observed in only two infants after 52&#x000a0;weeks. None of the subjects had aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis or mitral stenosis. Our findings suggest that early initiation of treatment with galsulfase may prevent the development of ventricular hypertrophy and the progression of even mild valve regurgitation, findings that are hallmarks of MPS VI in older children (Braunlin et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>). Preservation of cardiac function was associated with early initiation of ERT in the MPS VI sibling studies (Furujo et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>; McGill et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>). Long-term ERT has been shown to prevent the progression of cardiac valve abnormalities when administered before the age of 12&#x000a0;years (Braunlin et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>).</p><p>Improvements in hearing were noted in three of our subjects, including bilateral improvement in subject 4 who had baseline bilateral deafness and was dosed at 2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg/week. Early initiation of galsulfase treatment was associated with improvement and prevention of hearing loss in the Japanese sibling study (Furujo et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>). However, early initiation of ERT was not found to be effective in preventing the progression of corneal clouding in our subjects, a finding that is consistent with the MPS VI sibling studies (Furujo et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>; McGill et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>). The avascular nature of the cornea likely reduces exposure of the cornea to circulating galsulfase.</p><p>Our results suggest that early initiation of galsulfase treatment may improve or prevent progression of hepatosplenomegaly, which is in line with findings from the two sibling studies (Furujo et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>; McGill et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>). Reductions in liver and spleen size following ERT have been observed in older MPS VI patients (Harmatz et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2005</xref>; Hendriksz et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>). However, based on our study, early ERT does not appear to prevent the development of hernias.</p><p>All four subjects required the use of health resources during the study. Generally, health resources were used to address MPS VI disease manifestations and to treat illnesses common to children of the same age range of the subjects. The number of subjects is small and the absence of a control group makes it difficult to draw any conclusions about changes in health utilization with galsulfase.</p><p>Galsulfase was safe and well tolerated in the four subjects who participated in this study. Clinical changes were primarily indicative of MPS VI disease and were also similar between the two dose groups. In addition, there were no clinically relevant abnormal changes in laboratory test results over time for subjects in either group. One subject (subject 4) had clinically significant changes in vital signs which consisted of events of pyrexia that occurred during infusion and were considered possibly related to drug; however these reactions were not consistent with anaphylactoid&#x02013;type reactions, resolved after three infusions and did not require any change in rate or any pre-infusion medication. The safety profile of the 2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg/week dose was not different in a clinically meaningful manner to that of the 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg/week dose. The overall safety profile is consistent with that of previous galsulfase clinical trials involving subjects older than 5&#x000a0;years of age (Harmatz et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>).</p><p>No significant difference was observed in the clinical or safety outcomes of the two dose groups, although it is important to recognize that the groups are small. Since the two older subjects were randomized to the high dose group, it is possible that we did not observe a difference in efficacy because these subjects started therapy at a significantly later age. Furthermore, the subjects in the high dose group were diagnosed with MPS VI based on clinical symptoms, suggesting that they could have more rapidly progressing disease compared to the two subjects in the low dose group who were diagnosed based on known family history. It is unlikely that the lack of difference in efficacy between the two doses is related to high antibody levels since one subject in the high dose group (subject 4) had very low antibody titers while the other subject in the high dose group (subject 3) had similar antibody titers to those observed for the subjects receiving the lower dose (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><p>Further investigation of galsulfase therapy initiated early in subjects with MPS VI, including long-term follow-up of growth outcomes, is warranted to provide more complete information on the potential benefits of early treatment. The four subjects in this study are being followed to further elucidate long-term effects of early initiation of ERT. A Clinical Surveillance Program sponsored by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. is currently underway to document the long-term effects of galsulfase treatment on clinical outcomes and safety in patients with MPS VI (Hendriksz et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec24"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="10545_2013_9654_MOESM1_ESM.doc"><label>ESM 1</label><caption><p>(DOC 304 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2"><media xlink:href="10545_2013_9654_MOESM2_ESM.doc"><label>ESM 2</label><caption><p>(DOC 32 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the participation of study patients and their families and the expert assistance of all study site coordinators (Jo Ann Johnson and Jacqueline Madden, Oakland, CA USA; Nathalie Reynes, Lyon, France; Hesham Mahmoud, Los Angeles, CA, US) and study site personnel.</p><p>The clinical study was sponsored by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc (BioMarin).
