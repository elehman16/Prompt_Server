However, the prevalence of FA as diagnosed by double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) is estimated to be around 2% to 4% for adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A study from a regional allergy center in the UK, serving a population of 1.6 million, reported a population prevalence of 0.03%, being a factor of 100 less than in population-based studies. This suggests that a minority of FA patients present to their GP and are subsequently referred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Most studies investigating the clinical aspects of FA involve patients from a (tertiary) allergy clinic. Since only a fraction of food allergic individuals from the general population visit a doctor, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] it is not clear how representative results from such studies are for the general population. However, studies comparing FA between the community and outpatients are lacking.</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent FA in a random sample of the Dutch community is comparable to FA in outpatients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was part of the EuroPrevall-project, a multidisciplinary European project investigating several aspects of FA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It consisted, among many different, of an epidemiological element investigating the prevalence of FA in the community and an outpatient clinical element. This study was approved by the local medical ethical committee (METC) of the University Medical Center Utrecht.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Community</title><p>The epidemiological study consisted of three stages and is described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In short, the study took place from October 2006 until March 2009. The 1st stage was a population-based study in which a short questionnaire to screen for FA was sent out to a random sample of 6600 adults aged 20&#x02013;54 years living in the city of Utrecht, The Netherlands.</p><p>In the 2nd stage, all those who in the screening questionnaire reported to have experienced adverse reactions to one of the 24 preselected priority foods (hen&#x02019;s egg, cow&#x02019;s milk, peanut, soy, hazelnut, walnut, celery, kiwi, apple, peach, sesame, mustard, wheat, fish and shrimp, buckwheat, corn, carrot, tomato, melon, banana, lentils, sunflower, poppy seeds) were invited to come to the hospital for a detailed questionnaire and serum IgE testing .</p><p>In the 3rd stage, participants with self-reported symptoms and sIgE to at least one of the priority foods were called in for DBPCFC and a full clinical evaluation, identical to that of the outpatients (see below).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Outpatients</title><p>The outpatient study took place from January 2006 until June 2009. All adult patients (age 18&#x000a0;years and older) who were referred to our tertiary allergy centre with a suspected FA, were asked to participate in the EuroPrevall outpatient clinic study. Inclusion criteria were symptoms developing within 2&#x000a0;hours after ingestion of a food. Participating outpatients underwent a clinical evaluation comprising a thorough medical history using a standardized questionnaire, sIgE testing and DBPCFC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Clinical evaluation</title><p>All clinical information was collected following a standardized questionnaire which was specifically developed for the Europrevall-study. Symptoms were classified into mild (symptoms of the oral cavity), moderate (gastro-intestinal symptoms and symptoms of the skin and mucous membranes) and severe (respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms).</p><p>A probable FA was defined as symptoms within 2&#x000a0;hours and sIgE &#x02265;0.35 kU<sub>A</sub>/L to a priority food. Although DBPCFC is the gold standard for diagnosis of FA, diagnosis of FA in majority of patients in clinical practice is based on medical history and sIgE. Therefore, in this study we chose a pragmatical approach using a suggestive history (i.e. symptoms &#x0003c;2&#x000a0;hours of ingestion) together with IgE sensitization to define a probable FA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>In vitro diagnosis</title><p>sIgE testing for all priority foods were performed in a single laboratory using the ImmunoCAP system and reagents from Phadia (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden). sIgE values of &#x02265;0.35 kU<sub>A</sub>/L were regarded as positive.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>DBPCFC</title><p>All participants with symptoms to hen&#x02019;s egg, cow&#x02019;s milk, peanut, hazelnut, celery, apple, peach, fish or shrimp were asked to participate in DBPCFC. A detailed protocol of the EuroPrevall DBFCFC is described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Briefly, active and placebo provocations were randomly performed on two different days with eight increasing doses. The single doses were administered at an interval of at least 20&#x000a0;minutes up to the top dose. The interval could be extended at the request of the patient, according to the case history of the patient, or in case of severe persisting subjective symptoms. Challenges were discontinued after the dose leading to the first objective allergic symptoms or ingestion of the whole meal. Objective symptoms considered for discontinuation of the provocation were blisters of the oral mucosa, skin symptoms such as flush, urticaria, angioedema, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, drop of blood pressure of at least 20&#x000a0;mmHg, drop of FEV1&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;12% or PEF&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;20%, laryngeal oedema, diarrhoea, emesis or in case of severe persistent subjective symptoms lasting for more than 45&#x000a0;minutes such as severe itching of palms, soles, head or severe gastric/abdominal pain. If all DBPCFC doses were negative, patients underwent an open food challenge. Patients that had a reaction of any type and any duration on the active day and no reaction on the placebo were classified as reactors, patients that did not react on the active nor the placebo day were tolerant and patients that reacted on the placebo day were placebo responders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistics</title><p>Chi-square tests and, where appropriate, Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests were used to test the differences in several clinical characteristics (i.e. gender, severity of symptoms, causative foods, atopic diseases, sensitization and DBPCFC outcome) between the community and outpatients. Differences in age and the number of causative foods between the two groups were calculated using Student&#x02019;s T-test and, where appropriate, Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test.

These participants were considered to have a probable FA. When comparing the community participants and outpatients, using symptoms and sIgE to priority food as selection in both groups (i.e. probable FA), the differences in causative foods as seen in the 2nd stage disappeared largely. Only hazelnut and apple were significantly more frequently reported as a causative food in the community, whereas peanut was more commonly reported in outpatients (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In contrast to the 2nd stage, no differences were seen in the severity of symptoms between the community and outpatients (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Whereas in the 2nd stage major differences were observed between the two groups in sensitization to most priority foods, these differences disappeared largely when selecting on FA (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

In this study we found that, when focusing on self-reported symptoms to priority foods, there are large differences in causative foods, severity and relevant food sensitization between community and outpatients. However, when selecting those with a probable FA, as defined by reported symptoms to priority food together with a positive sIgE to the respective food, it became evident that the differences in the community and outpatients disappeared. This indicates that patients with a probable FA seen in a tertiary outpatient allergy center are not different from those with a probable FA in the community.</p><p>Previous population based studies showed that the prevalence of self-reported FA to any food varied from 3% to as high as 35%, whereas the prevalence of true FA is estimated to be 2-4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In our study we confirmed for the Dutch population the discrepancy between the prevalence of self-reported adverse food reactions (10.8%), a FA as defined by a suggestive history and supported by sIgE (4.1%) and a FA confirmed by DBPCFC (3.2%).</p><p>Since non-response bias could play a role in the community survey, we performed a non-response analysis. The response rate in the 1st stage of the community survey was 61%. We calculated the cumulative prevalence of adverse food reaction at the time of response to extrapolate the prevalence to non-responders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This showed that the cumulative prevalence of adverse food reaction stabilized after a response rate of 40%, indicating that non-response bias does not play a major role in the 1st stage of the study. For the 2nd stage, we compared age, gender, doctor-diagnosed FA and the symptoms between responders and non-responders. Only the frequency of oral allergy symptoms differed, being higher in the responders (61% <italic>vs</italic> 49%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02<italic>)</italic>, which could indicate that responders from the 2nd stage of the study were more likely to have a probable food allergy compared to non-responders. This would mean that the differences found between community and outpatients in the 2nd stage would even be larger. For the 3rd stage, no differences were seen between responders and non-responders with regard to age, sex and symptoms (data not shown). Although the response rate was low, the profile of responders and non-responders were largely similar, and therefore it is thought that a possible non-response bias would not play a major role. Low response rates are not unusual in population based studies investigating the prevalence of food allergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The gold standard for the diagnosis of FA is DBPCFC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, DBPCFC is time-consuming, expensive, subjects patients to potential severe allergic reactions, requires the need for well equipped facilities and may not be able to reproduce the conditions that occurred when the reported allergic reaction took place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Due to these practical problems, in normal clinical settings FA is often diagnosed by a thorough medical history and a test for sensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In our study, medical history and sIgE was used to define a probable FA since this could be performed in all participants and outpatients. Certain participants in the community and outpatient studies agreed to undergo DBPCFC and, whilst a relatively small sample, no differences were seen in the rates of either positive DBPCFC (78% and 64%, respectively) or the objective signs between the two groups. These data indicate that the clinical characteristics of individuals with a probable FA in this population were similar between the two populations and that the estimates of prevalence relying only on clinical history and sIgE will over-estimate rates of confirmed food allergy by around 22-37%. A low participation rate in DBPCFC is also reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The main reason for refusal to participate in DBPCFC in our patients was the lack of time.</p><p>In general, it might be expected that the frequency of severe FA in outpatients referred to a tertiary allergy center is higher compared to the community. In this study we observed no significant difference in the frequency of severe symptoms between both groups. Of the participants with a probable FA in the community, 40.4% had never sought medical care for their symptoms to food and of these, 46.4% had severe symptoms upon ingestion of the causative food (data not shown). Thus, severe symptoms are not always a trigger for FA-patients to seek medical care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the Netherlands, there are large differences in self-reported FA between community and outpatients.
