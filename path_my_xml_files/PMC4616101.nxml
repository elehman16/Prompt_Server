rotation speeds influence standing postural stability or frontal and temporal cortical
activity during rotation in healthy young adults. [Subjects and Methods] Twelve healthy
volunteers participated in this study. A custom turn-table operated by one of the
experimenters was placed on a platform to assess postural perturbation. Subjects were
asked to stand barefoot on the turn-table in an upright position with their feet together,
and measurements were obtained during high- and low-speed rotations. Postural stability
was tested using a force platform and a head sensor. Cerebral cortex activity was measured
using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Brain activity, center of pressure, and head
perturbation were measured simultaneously for each subject. [Results] Significant
differences were found in the center of pressure and the head angular velocity between
high- and low-speed rotations. However, compared to baseline, oxygenated hemoglobin levels
were not significantly different during high- or low-speed rotations. [Conclusion]
Automatic postural responses to neck and trunk rotation while standing did not
significantly activate the cerebral cortex. Therefore, the response to stimuli from the
feet may be controlled by the spinal reflex rather than the cerebral cortex.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Rotation speed</kwd><kwd>Brain activity</kwd><kwd>Postural stability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The sensory strategy for postural control involves the visual, vestibular, and
somatosensory systems. In particular, the vestibular system provides information regarding
head position and movement with respect to gravity and inertial forces<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. This sensory system contributes to postural stability
during directional changes. More specifically, the vestibulo-ocular and vestibulospinal
reflexes are significantly associated with postural control, eye movement, and neck and
trunk rotation<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study reported
that stroke patients and healthy elderly adults exhibit increased postural instability
during head rotations in the standing position compared to that during static standing<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. With regard to vestibular information
related to cortical activation, areas of the superior temporal gyrus related to postural
control are activated in subjects who primarily receive vestibular sensory input in the
standing position<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Increased brain
activity has also been observed in the supplementary motor area during adjustment for
postural perturbation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it is
unknown whether neck and trunk rotation speeds influence postural perturbation and cortical
activation. Thus, measuring changes in cortical activation and postural stability
simultaneously would provide valuable information regarding vestibular function in
activities of daily living.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to determine if different neck and trunk rotation speeds
influence standing postural stability or frontal and temporal cortical activity during
rotation in healthy young adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twelve healthy volunteers (mean age, 25.8 &#x000b1; 2.1&#x02005;years) participated in this study.
Self-reported history of vestibular, balance, and mobility impairment was obtained from all
subjects. Written informed consent was taken from all volunteers prior to study
participation, and the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of University of
Saga, Japan.</p><p>The following three parameters were measured simultaneously for each subject: brain
activity, center of pressure (COP), and head perturbation. Evaluations were performed with a
block design comprising an initial resting during standing condition (15 seconds), a task
condition (30 seconds), and a second resting during standing condition (15 seconds). This
procedure was repeated five times for each subject.</p><p>Evaluation of cortical activity during postural stability requires an accurate definition
of rotation stimulation. Postural stability was evaluated using a force platform (GS-31;
Anima, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and head sensor (TSND121; ATR-Promotions, Kyoto, Japan). A custom
turn-table operated by one of the experimenters was placed on the platform to assess
postural perturbation. Subjects were asked to stand barefoot on the turn-table with their
feet together; the platform rotated at an angle of up to 180&#x000b0;. Subjects were randomly
assigned to either the high- or low-rotation speed condition (180&#x000b0;/s or 90&#x000b0;/s peak angular
velocity, respectively). To avoid excessive eye movement during testing, subjects were asked
to keep their head as still as possible while focusing on a target placed at a distance of
5&#x02005;m in front of them. Subjects were permitted to familiarize themselves with the platform&#x02019;s
movement prior to the measurement. To evaluate postural stability, we measured COP for both,
area of body sway and total body length. A sensor was placed on the top of each subject&#x02019;s
head to detect perturbations. The following two head movements were evaluated: head velocity
was measured in the anterior&#x02013;posterior, left-right, and up-down directions, and angular
velocity was measured in the roll, pitch, and yaw planes. COP positions and head
perturbations were recorded at a sampling rate of 50&#x02005;Hz.</p><p>Cerebral cortex activity was evaluated using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy
(fNIRS) system (OMM-3000; Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) equipped with 16 light sources and
16 detectors. This system captured changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb) level through 51
channels. We adopted an interoptode distance of 3.0&#x02005;cm from the near-infrared light source
to ensure propagation to the gray matter underlying the optodes. The light source at the
center of the third row was set in a position that corresponded to Cz, T3, T4, F3, and F4 of
the 10&#x02013;20 International system. We defined each fNIRS channel by the midpoint of the
corresponding light source-detector pair. Regarding anatomical information, the location of
each optode on the plastic cap was marked using a 3D digitizer (FASTRAK; Polhemus, Inc.,
Colchester, VT, USA). The estimated locations of the fNIRS channels on the cortex were
transformed using the affine transformation matrix in the Fusion software program (Shimadzu
Corp). Data were analyzed with NIRS-SPM using MATLAB 2014a software (The MathWorks, Inc.,
Natick, MA, USA)<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 21 software (IBM Corp., Armonk,
NY, USA), with the significance level set at p &#x0003c; 0.05. Data collected by the head sensor
were used to calculate the absolute value at each plane during platform rotation. Each
subject&#x02019;s COP and head movement are expressed as the mean of values measured at five time
points. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess differences in postural stability
between high and low rotation speeds. Using the data obtained from fNIRS, task-related
cortical activity during each condition was estimated using a general linear model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Significant differences were found between the high- and low-speed rotations with regard to

speeds influence standing postural stability or frontal and temporal cortical activity
during rotation. There was an increase in the subjects&#x02019; COP and head perturbation in the
roll, pitch, and yaw planes during high-speed rotation. With regard to movement strategies,
ankle and hip strategies are critical for fine motor coordination and dynamic motor
coordination, respectively<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The high
rotation speed in this study increased body perturbation in order to control postural
stability; this would affect both ankle and hip strategies. Moreover, a previous study
showed that the obliquus capitis inferior, rectus capitis posterior major, and splenius
muscle responses are affected during body rotation when the head position is fixed<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. These muscles have a high spindle density,
and a high rotation speed could be one factor that allows for highly sensitive postural
control.</p><p>The fNIRS results in this study showed that oxyHb levels did not increase significantly
during high- or low-speed rotation compared to those in the resting condition. Regarding the
effect of rotation during standing, automatic postural responses suggest that the
spinocerebellum and basal ganglia play complementary roles in adapting postural responses to
changing conditions<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The cerebral cortex
exerts more control over anticipatory postural adjustments than automatic postural
responses<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>; therefore, neck and trunk
rotation during standing may not significantly activate the cerebral cortex. Thus,
regardless of rotation speed, rehabilitative neck and trunk actions might be able to
activate automatic postural responses. On the other hand, the vestibular system senses head
position during tilting and acceleration<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
One reason for the lack of significant differences between speed conditions could be that
subjects were asked to keep their head as still as possible during platform rotation.</p><p>There are a few limitations in the current study. First, although spinal reflexes are
associated with postural stability, they were not evaluated here. It is important to assess
spinal reflexes in future studies. Second, in experimental conditions, the distance between
a subject and a visual target is usually set at 2 m, but we chose 5&#x02005;m due to space
restrictions. In addition, the scalp and the skull could have interfered with fNIRS signal
measurement, and fNIRS fiber movement during neck and trunk rotation could have introduced
an artificial noise source. Future studies should employ other neuroimaging methods to
clarify the neural mechanisms of postural control.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Shumway-Cook</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Woollacott</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name></person-group>: Motor Control: translating research into clinical practice, 4th ed.
