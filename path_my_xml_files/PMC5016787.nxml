</p><p>One of the first extended online alcohol interventions freely available over the Internet was the Down Your Drink website (DYD <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.downyourdrink.org.uk">www.downyourdrink.org.uk</ext-link>), which offers help and advice on reducing alcohol intake and is&#x000a0;based on the principles of motivational interviewing, behavioural self&#x02010;control, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and relapse prevention.<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> DYD was accessible as part of a randomized trial<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> from February 2007 until the end of May 2009, where people identified the website by searching the Internet for help to reduce their drinking. The trial found no difference in past week drinking between participants accessing DYD and a basic information website on the harms associated with consuming alcohol above&#x02010;recommended limits. Both groups of participants, however, reduced their drinking by 20 UK units per week (equivalent to two bottles of wine), which may have been due to reactivity of assessment, regression to the mean or natural recovery.<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> On completion of the trial, qualitative interviews were conducted with trial participants to explore people's experience of using the websites and taking part in the trial. These interviews found that a variety of services and resources were accessed for help in addition to the trial websites which provides another explaination for the equivalent reduction in alcohol consumption in both groups.<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> These interviews also provided an insight into the experiences of online help seeking among this previously unstudied group of drinkers.</p><p>The DYD trial attracted a novel sample of &#x02018;e&#x02010;help seekers&#x02019;, who differed from conventional in person help seekers and non&#x02010;help seekers in a number of ways. Unlike non&#x02010;help seekers, DYD participants could be seen as demonstrating some motivation to change their drinking by virtue of the fact they self&#x02010;recruited to the trial (i.e. to access help or information on reducing their drinking). Yet, despite seeking help with their drinking, DYD participants also differed from conventional help or treatment seekers by exhibiting low levels of dependence [Leeds Dependence Questionnaire mean 9 (SD 6)<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>] and fewer alcohol&#x02010;related problems [Alcohol Problems Questionnaire mean 7 (SD 4)<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>]. Most people drinking at hazardous and harmful levels do not seek help with their drinking,<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> which makes these e&#x02010;help seekers a novel group whose needs are not well understood.

Initial codes were generated for as much of the data as possible and applied systematically to the corresponding text in the transcripts using Atlas.ti 6. The codes were then organized into broader themes and subthemes. A proportion of transcripts were read and coded by two experienced researchers (EM and FS), both with backgrounds in health services research, e&#x02010;health and qualitative research. Discussion helped refine the coding framework and resulted in additional themes.

Most interviewees had come to the realization that their drinking was a problem and that they wanted to try and cut down. In some cases, people indicated their search was driven by the public health message of sensible drinking. A few interviewees, however, were uncertain whether they had a problem with alcohol and wanted to know what constituted normal social drinking. Factors cited in relation to this uncertainty included peers drinking similar amounts without apparent concern, or doctors advocating the health benefits of &#x02018;a couple of glasses of red wine a day&#x02019;.

For many, their drinking behaviour was seen as a very personal problem and they did not want to involve other people when looking for help to cut down. Difficulties talking about their drinking face&#x02010;to&#x02010;face, the embarrassment, admission of weakness/not coping and the fear of people finding out how much they drank meant a reluctance to seek help in person from a doctor or alcohol worker. The quotation below is from an interviewee who had seen an advertisement in their doctor's surgery and local community centre for people concerned about their drinking and explains why they would not have attended.<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="hex12351-blkfxd-0008"><p>I think I'm not the only type of person that would sort of be like, I might bang into other people and be a bit embarrassed. I actually wouldn't acknowledge I was [seeking help], or what is it you say, you know, airing your dirty washing in public. <named-content content-type="attribution">(Ppt. 9 Female 40, 47 units/week)</named-content>

<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="hex12351-blkfxd-0009"><p>It's all about being impersonal, frankly&#x02026; [searching for help online] cause this is very, very difficult to come here and discuss this. Umm&#x02026; &#x02018;cause basically what it comes down to is like admitting that you've got a kind of alcohol problem. <named-content content-type="attribution">(Ppt. 3 Male 44, 92 units/week)</named-content>
</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>Another barrier to accessing formal alcohol services was the perceived gap in service provision for people wanting to moderate rather than abstain from drinking. The first treatment option that came to mind after recognizing the need for help was Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). It also appeared to be the only option available or known to many interviewees. This added to the stigma of help seeking as AA was perceived as catering for &#x02018;alcoholics&#x02019;. Only one interviewee had actually attended the meetings. The others felt the programme was not appropriate for them, that their problem was not severe enough and that they did not identify with the types of people AA targeted.<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="hex12351-blkfxd-0010"><p>I mean first thing is this kind of&#x02026; almost &#x0201c;grey&#x0201d; area between normal social drinking and being a smelly tramp in the street&#x02026; You know, if you've got a problem with drinking then it doesn't really occur to me that there's a spectrum of stuff along there. <named-content content-type="attribution">(Ppt. 3 Male 44, 92 units/week)</named-content>
</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="hex12351-blkfxd-0011"><p>When I looked at things like Alcoholics Anonymous and I thought, well, I don't have that problem, I haven't had that problem, I haven't had that problem, and actually I don't want to give up completely and I don't want to go to a group. <named-content content-type="attribution">(Ppt. 8 Female 46, 72 units/week)</named-content>
</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>Interviewees wanted help suited to their level of need, that did not interfere with their everyday lives, and that was personal to them. There was also a concern that by attending a service geared towards the more dependent drinker that this would trivialize their problem.<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="hex12351-blkfxd-0012"><p>The reason, [I didn't go to AA], I think probably the stigma that's attached to it. And it's not because I think I'm any better than anybody else, but I think I was probably concerned that they would do the same that that doctor had done to me, and say that I was actually okay, because there was alcoholics there. So in comparison with them I might have been drinking hardly anything, although to me, I know that it is too much&#x02026; I didn't want them to tell me not to drink, because I did want to drink, that's not what this is all about. So it just didn't seem to be the right thing. But it was the only place I knew where to go and get help. <named-content content-type="attribution">(Ppt. 9 Female 40, 47 units/week)</named-content>

As this is a previously unstudied population, the findings will be discussed in light of the large qualitative literature on barriers and facilitators to conventional help seeking among dependent drinkers.</p><p>Most of the interviewees in this study were searching for help online, having recognized a problem that they wanted to address. Problem recognition, an awareness of the perceived severity of the problem, is an established antecedent to seeking or entering treatment in studies of dependent drinkers<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="hex12351-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="hex12351-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>, <xref rid="hex12351-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>, <xref rid="hex12351-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> and constitutes the first or central stage in several models of professional help seeking for alcohol problems.<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>, <xref rid="hex12351-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>, <xref rid="hex12351-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> This study shows how a similar process of help seeking also occurs in hazardous and harmful drinkers. The types of problems that led to problem recognition were not fully explored in this study, however, would form an interesting area of investigation for future research with e&#x02010;help seeking populations. Whilst problem recognition was a precursor for searching for help online by the majority of interviewees in this study, there were a few interviewees who were unsure whether their drinking was a problem, with peers drinking similar amounts without concern, and confusion around the advocated benefits of drinking and the sensible drinking message. Interviewees in this study were consuming between 28 and 103 UK units a week, which may explain the heterogeneity in their motives for e&#x02010;help seeking. Around 50&#x000a0;000 people accessed the DYD website during the 8&#x02010;month pilot trial period (of which 7% consented to take part in the trial to gain access to the site),<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> thus demonstrating the high demand for information and help to reduce alcohol intake. A spectrum of resources, from information on sensible drinking through to extensive behaviour change programmes, such as DYD, should be widely available online to meet the varied need and allow people to access help at a much earlier stage with their drinking.</p><p>Participants indicated that the stigma associated with seeking help to reduce drinking was one of the reasons why they searched for help over the Internet. Stigmatization is a well&#x02010;documented barrier to formal help seeking in dependent drinkers,<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="hex12351-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="hex12351-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="hex12351-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="hex12351-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>, <xref rid="hex12351-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>, <xref rid="hex12351-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> where &#x02018;people fear being labelled alcoholics and subsequently experiencing loss of status and discrimination&#x02019; p. 105.<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> Interviewees in this study experienced stigma to self, such as embarrassment, perceived stigma from others, for example not wanting to &#x02018;air dirty laundry&#x02019;, or reported stigma related to treatment, for example viewing AA as catering for &#x02018;alcoholics&#x02019;. Cunningham <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. found that stigma associated with the label of &#x02018;alcoholic&#x02019;, in addition to embarrassment and pride, presented a substantial barrier to accessing treatment in dependent drinkers who changed their drinking without treatment or maintained their level of drinking.<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> One of the key advantages of the Internet as a platform for accessing help is that it provides a private setting that mitigates some of the barriers to help seeking, allowing people to seek help at an earlier stage of their drinking, as evidenced by interviewees who were unsure whether their drinking was a problem and wanted further information on the recommended limits.</p><p>The perceived lack of services for help to moderate, as opposed to abstain from drinking, was almost unanimous. Alcoholics Anonymous was often the first and only service that came to mind when considering help with drinking, which added to the stigma surrounding help seeking as AA was viewed as catering for &#x02018;alcoholics&#x02019; and focussed on achieving abstinence. This finding is in line with research on dependent drinkers, where negative stereotypes surrounding treatment services<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>, <xref rid="hex12351-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref> and their focus on achieving abstinence<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> prevent people from accessing help. Interventions for reducing alcohol intake in people drinking at hazardous and harmful levels were not known to the interviewees in this study. In England and Wales, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advocates brief advice for hazardous and harmful drinkers, followed by extended motivational brief interventions as part of a stepped care approach.<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>, <xref rid="hex12351-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> Brief advice and extended brief interventions can be delivered online,<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="hex12351-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="hex12351-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="hex12351-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, <xref rid="hex12351-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref> which not only benefits the individual who can access help appropriate for their level of need, without the stigma of accessing help in person, but also benefits the service provider by providing potentially effective and cost&#x02010;effective interventions when resources are scarce and practitioner time is limited. This approach is already successfully implemented in UK health&#x02010;care settings with online CBT provided to patients with mild and moderate depression (Beating the Blues) and panic or phobia (FearFighter), as advocated by NICE since 2008.<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> Efforts are needed to develop extended online interventions for people drinking at hazardous and harmful levels, such as DYD, and to evaluate their effectiveness in a range of pragmatic settings.</p><sec id="hex12351-sec-0017"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>The findings from these interviews provide an insight into the experience of people searching the Internet for help to reduce their drinking. The topic guide served as a prompt rather than a ridged guide, which allowed participants to talk about issues that were important to them and led to the themes presented in this study. The inductive approach to analysis meant that data were not analysed according to a pre&#x02010;conceived&#x000a0;framework; rather, themes were identified by the researchers and codes developed from these. Further research could focus on informing a model of e&#x02010;help seeking for alcohol intake; as this was not the aim of this study the data could not reliably inform such a model. This study intended to recruit a purposive sample of interviewees who varied by gender, education and level of alcohol consumption; however, this was not possible due to the small number of participants who volunteered to take part. Nevertheless, the characteristics of the interviewees in this study mirrored those of the wider DYD participant population<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> and as we appeared to reach saturation, the findings are likely to transfer to a slightly broader population of people seeking help online to reduce their drinking. Some participants chose to be interviewed by telephone for geographical reasons when unable to access either of the chosen locations. Greater transferability was achieved by having a wider geographical spread of interviewees. Telephone interviews have been criticized for the absence of visual cues, resulting in a lack of informal communication, rapport, contextual information and the possibility of misinterpretation. However, evidence to support these criticisms is limited and their impact on the quality of data is unknown.<xref rid="hex12351-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> Finally, it is important to remember that the interviewees in this study were self&#x02010;selected, in that they responded to an advertised opportunity to provide feedback on their experience of using the DYD website and participating in the trial. It is likely that many potential interviewees did not want to jeopardize their anonymity by talking to a member of the research team. The discussion of alcohol problems is a sensitive topic, which clearly emerged during the interviews, with one interviewee admitting it was extremely hard for them to attend as nobody knew they were seeking help. Some interviewees reported participating out of gratitude to the DYD team, a motivation which is likely to lead to bias in favour of the DYD website; however, these data are not the focus of this study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="hex12351-sec-0018"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The interviewees in this study reported a perceived lack of services both online and offline for help with moderating their drinking. Freely available, evidenced&#x02010;based online interventions for people drinking at hazardous and harmful levels, from screening and brief advice through to CBT and relapse prevention, would help widen the availability of services and provide a private setting for accessing help, thereby avoiding the stigma associated with help seeking.</p></sec><sec id="hex12351-sec-0020"><title>Conflict of interests</title><p>No conflict of interests have been declared.</p></sec><sec id="hex12351-sec-0021"><title>Funding</title><p>Zarnie Khadjesari is funded by a 3&#x02010;year National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) School for Primary Care Research (SPCR) fellowship.
