Methods] In all, 16 subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental group and 17 to a
control group. All subjects walked barefoot on a treadmill (HM50EX, Daeho, Korea) for
20&#x02005;min, five times per week, for a total of 4 weeks. The average gait velocity of the
subjects was 3&#x02005;km/h on a 10% slope. The experimental group walked backwards and the
control group walked forwards. [Results] The experimental group showed significant
increments in both medial-lateral and anterior-posterior balance, step length, and
velocity compared with the pre-intervention results. In addition, the control group showed
significant increments in anterior-posterior balance and velocity compared to the
pre-intervention results. Significant differences in post-training gains in
anterior-posterior balance, step length, and velocity were observed between the
experimental and control groups. [Conclusion] Backward walking positively affected gait
and balance ability after intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Backward walking</kwd><kwd>Adult</kwd><kwd>Slope</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Independent functioning is at the core of successful aging, and independent mobility is
critical to independent function. Exercise is recommended for older adults because it
promotes physical and mental health, may improve mobility, and prevents walking
difficulties<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Walking places demands on
the musculoskeletal (the muscles, bones, and joints), cardiopulmonary (the heart and lungs),
and nervous (the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves) systems<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Such persistent walking exercises not only prevents lifestyle diseases such as
hypertension, arteriosclerosis and diabetes, but also aids their treatment while also
improving the potential positive effects such as improved pulmonary function, stronger
immunity, enhanced muscle strength, higher bone density, stress reduction, and better
emotional stability.</p><p>Balance has been defined as the ability to maintain one&#x02019;s equilibrium as the center of
gravity shifts (dynamic balance e.g. walking and running), and while the center of gravity
remains stationary (static balance e.g. standing or sitting)<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance can be largely divided into static balance and dynamic balance. Static balance
refers to the ability to maintain the center of gravity within the base of support during
the stationary phase, while dynamic balance refers to the ability to maintain the center of
gravity within the base of support during movement. Dynamic balance ability is closely
associated with walking; hence, its loss weakens a person&#x02019;s ability to appropriately respond
to different environments and tasks<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
According to previous studies that compared forward and backward walking, backward walking
was reported to stimulate muscles in the lower limbs more than forward walking<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, it contributed to improved
gait ability as it increased the strength of knee joints and activities of the quadriceps.
Recently, such effects have been manifested through the application of various approaches
such as walking exercises on treadmill and flat land, backward walking exercises, and
robot-assisted walking exercises in stroke patients with hemiplegia to improve gait and
balance ability<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, a variety of
studies on forward walking have been conducted to improve gait and balance ability. However,
little research has been carried out to determine the therapeutic effects of backward
walking. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the effects of forward and backward
walking on gait and balance ability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In all, 33 healthy subjects without a history of orthopedic surgery were selected, and the
study was conducted after consent for participation was obtained for this study. All
procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Eulji
University Hospital. In all, 16 subjects were randomly assigned to the experimental group
and 17 subjects to the control group. Subject&#x02019;s average age, height, and weight in the
experimental and control groups were 21.45 &#x000b1; 2.12 and 20.15 &#x000b1; 1.07&#x02005;years; 176.54 &#x000b1; 11.05 and
174.12 &#x000b1; 7.38&#x02005;cm; and 77.05 &#x000b1; 6.21 and 72.11 &#x000b1; 7.62&#x02005;kg, respectively. Sufficient explanation
of this study&#x02019;s intent and the overall purpose was given, and voluntary consent for
participation in this study was obtained from all subjects.</p><p>Subjects walked for 1&#x02005;min to determine their natural gait velocity before the experiment,
and all subjects walked barefoot on a treadmill (HM50EX, Daeho, Korea), for 20&#x02005;min, five
times per week, for a total of 4 weeks. The average gait velocity was 3&#x02005;km/h on a 10% slope.
The experimental group walked backward and the control group walked forward.</p><p>After the intervention, equipment to measure balance (Good Balance, Metitur, Finland) was
used to quantitatively measure balance ability. To measure balance functions, the subject
was instructed to stand on a triangular platform and maintain a symmetric standing posture
with the legs shoulder-width apart. A fixed visual point was marked in front to minimize
head movements. The arms were placed comfortably by the sides of the hip joint and the
center of pressure (COP) was measured for 30&#x02005;s in this posture with the eyes open. The COP
was measured three times and the average value was calculated.</p><p>A pedometer (Gait Rite, K634-DB, Epson Inc., USA) was used to collect data for
temporo-spatial gait characteristics such as velocity, step length, stride length, single
support, double support and cadence of the experimental and control groups. For precise
analysis of gait, the subjects were asked to walk along a 2 m-long walkway for three
sessions, and the average values were used. The subjects, with heads lifted and looking
straight ahead, walked barefoot while lightly shaking their upper arms<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Mean and
standard deviation (SD) were calculated for each variable. Before the intervention,
differences in the general characteristics of the experimental and control groups were
compared using independent t-tests. Comparisons of variables before and after training
within each group were made using paired sample t-tests. Comparisons of pre- and post-test
differences in variables between the experimental and control groups were performed using
the independent t-test. Intergroup effect sizes were calculated using Cohen&#x02019;s d
coefficient<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. An effect size &#x0003c;0.2
reflects a negligible mean difference; 0.2&#x02212;0.5, a small difference; 0.5&#x02212;0.8, a moderate mean
difference; and &#x0003e;0.8, a large difference. Statistical analysis was performed at a 95%
confidence level, and p values&#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>No significant differences in the baseline characteristics were observed between the two

Furthermore, this exercise can minimize the
burden on joints and increase muscle strength in the lower limbs. In addition, this exercise
does not cause adverse effects on the body through the stimulation of the major muscle in a
rhythmic and dynamic fashion. This exercise does not require any special tools or equipment,
which makes it effective and safe to reduce health risks.</p><p>The present study investigated the effects of forward and backward walking on gait and
balance ability of healthy subjects. According to the research findings, backward walking
has positive effects on gait and balance ability. Previous studies have reported that
backward walking reduced step length and improved gait speed, indicating that it was an
effective to increase the endurance of lower limbs<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The findings of the present study are in line with previous research findings. According to
another comparison study, backward walking stimulated muscles in the lower limbs and showed
higher energy consumption in the lower limbs when combined with knee flexion and hip
extension<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, greater
activity of the quadriceps during backward walking as well as increased stability in the
stance phase of walking was reported with this intervention<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As for the mechanism of walking, backward walking has less impact on the kneecaps and
patello-femoral joints as the metatarsal joints come in contact with the surface first.
However, forward walking has a relatively greater impact on the ankle and knee joints since
walking is only possible with flexion of the knee or hips because ankles show minor
movement. Even though backward walking is not practiced in day-to-day life, it is effective
in stimulating muscles of the knee joints and quadriceps in a more balanced manner<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it appears that people who
complain of pain in the knees may note some positive therapeutic effects with backward
walking exercise.</p><p>The present study has limitations, as the intervention period was too short to generalize
the effect of backward walking. In addition, there has been no post-study follow-up of the
participants; moreover, there were a small number of participants. Therefore, more
significant results will be noted in future studies if the intervention period is extended
and environmental factors are accounted for more thoroughly. In addition, in order to
prevent monotony while performing backward walking alone, a walking exercise program that
combines forward and side walking would be necessary.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Brach</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Studenski</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Perera</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Stance time and step width variability have unique
