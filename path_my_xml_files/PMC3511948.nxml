We designed a study to compare the efficacy and safety of postoperative analgesia provided by a mixture of sufentanil-morphine with extradural injection of each drug used alone after cesarean section.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>60 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I-II patients aged between 21 - 35 years scheduled for elective lower segment cesarean section were enrolled in a prospective randomized double blind study after approval by the ethics committee. Patients were familiarized with visual analog scale (VAS), and their informed written consent obtained. Patients with a history of alcohol or opioid abuse, severe pregnancy induced hypertension, neurological disorder, coagulopathy, history of allergy to study drug or local anesthetics were excluded from the study. No anesthetic medication was administered to the parturient during the study, other than the two opioids investigated and local anesthetics by epidural route. Preoperatively, all the patients were hydrated with lactated Ringer's solution 10 ml/kg. An epidural catheter was introduced through the L2-3 or L3-4 interspace and advanced 5 cm cephalad. A T4 sensory level to pinprick was achieved using mixture of equal volumes of 0.5% bupivacaine and 2% lignocaine, and injected in incremental doses into the extradural space. The urinary bladder was catheterized. No fluid bolus was administered; however, ephedrine 15 mg was administered intravenously (IV) when there was a decrease in mean arterial pressure (&#x0003e; 25% of baseline).</p><p>After surgery, the patient was transferred to the post anesthesia care unit (PACU). She was asked to indicate her level of pain intensity on a 10 cm VAS anchored with 0 representing &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and 10 cm as &#x0201c;worst pain&#x0201d;. Baseline vital parameters like heart rate (HR), noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were noted. On the first request for pain relief by the patient (VAS &#x02265;3), an anesthetist, blinded to the drug, administered a 10 ml epidural bolus containing either 50 mcg sufentanil (Group S) or 4 mg morphine sulfate (Group M) or 25 mcg sufentanil plus 2 mg morphine sulfate (Group SM) as per the group allocated. These study solutions were prepared and delivered in unlabeled syringes by another anesthetist who took no further part in the study. After the extradural injection of opioid, the vitals, pain intensity by VAS and level of sedation were recorded initially every 5 minutes for 1 hour, and every 2 hourly till 24 hours. Side effects such as nausea, vomiting, itching, sedation or drowsiness and respiratory depression were recorded. Patients having pain after 20 minutes of receiving study drug were given a bolus of fentanyl 50 mcg IV as a rescue analgesic. When patient again complained of pain (VAS &#x02265; 3) the same drug, in the same dose, was repeated. The same data were collected thereafter.</p><p>The total number of doses administered in 24 hours was noted. Serial VAS was estimated to determine the following: (a) Onset of analgesia constituted the time until a reduction in VAS &#x0003c; 1 on two consecutive evaluations (b) Duration of analgesia was taken as time interval between onset of analgesia to VAS &#x0003e;3. (c) The level of sedation was assessed using a 5 point ordinal scale where 0 = alert; 1 = drowsy; 2 = frequently drowsy; 3 = very drowsy and disoriented; and 4 = stuporous and difficult to arouse.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Side effects like respiratory depression (RR &#x0003c; 10/minute), pruritus or nausea and vomiting were recorded. Severity of pruritus was graded as absent; mild &#x02013; restricted to one area, not troubling the patient and reported only after prompting; moderate &#x02013; affecting a large area, not disturbing the patient and not requiring treatment; severe &#x02013; generalized, often disturbing the patient and needing treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Side-effects were treated with promethazine 25 mg IV (pruritus), ondansetron 8 mg IV (nausea and vomiting) or naloxone 0.2 mg IV (respiratory depression). After 24 hours, the epidural catheter was removed and patient was sent to the ward.</p><p>All patients recruited were included for statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was done by using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 12 software. For calculating sample size of the study, standard deviation for VAS reduction was taken as 1.7 based on an earlier study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] and a reduction of two points in the mean VAS score (50% of the baseline value in the study), for 0.05 level of significance, the calculated sample size was around 13 patients per group. Demographic variables and adverse effects within the three treatment groups were compared simultaneously via analysis of variance (continuous variable) and the chi square test (categorical variables). Baseline pain intensity was compared via one &#x02013;way analysis of variance. <italic>P</italic> value &#x02264; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>All the 60 enrolled patients completed the study were without any significant complications [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

This can be attributed to differences in physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of both the drugs. Sufentanil, a highly lipophilic opioid has a high affinity for spinal cord mu opioid receptors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] This results in a rapid and highly effective pain relief which was advantageous in the study, as patients experienced good pain relief before their local anesthetic level wore off. The disadvantage is its short duration (3-4 hours) and repeated boluses are required to achieve adequate pain relief,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] unless continuous infusion is used. In contrast, onset of effective analgesia with morphine alone took 80-90 minutes; however, was associated with longer duration of analgesia (18 hours) due to hydrophilicity and its property to remain sequestrated in cerebro-spinal fluid.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Combining the two drugs provided rapid onset of action with identical analgesic efficacy like morphine alone, with mean duration of effective analgesia of 22.7 &#x000b1;1.6 hours.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Onset of analgesia with epidural sufentanil is four times faster than morphine, however the analgesia of morphine lasts for 18 &#x02013; 23 hours.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>2 to 5 mg of single epidural bolus dose of morphine, irrespective of bodyweight of the patients, are commonly used for postoperative analgesia after cesarean section.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] A retrospective review of the use of epidural morphine found that 3 mg is an adequate dose for postoperative analgesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] A study with three doses of epidural morphine (2, 5, and 7.5 mg) unfortunately focused only on the duration of analgesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] A study comparing the effectiveness and duration of analgesia of epidural morphine 4 mg and 5 mg concluded that though 5 mg provided adequate and longer duration of analgesia, it was associated with a higher frequency of pruritus and vomiting.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Palmer <italic>et al</italic>. in a dose response study found that quality of analgesia increases as the dose of epidural morphine is increased up to 3.75 mg; however, increasing the dose further to 5 mg did not improve analgesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] We used 4 mg morphine as patients undergoing cesarean section are young and anxious, although the Indian population is more prone to morphine induced respiratory depression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] In the combination group, at least 2 mg morphine was needed to keep the patient pain free for longer duration.</p><p>It is not clear whether combination of lipophilic opioid with small amount of hydrophilic opioid provides effective and long duration of analgesia due to sequential or additive action. One study has indicated sequential effect,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] whereas other studies using combination of sufentanil,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] fentanyl[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] or alfentanil[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] with morphine observed rapid onset and same or longer duration of analgesia than larger doses of morphine alone. Cohen <italic>et al</italic>. have reported shortened analgesic duration and increased requirement of supplemental systemic opioids when patients were given the combination of epidural morphine and fentanyl compared to morphine alone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] We did not observe an additive effect on using a combination of the two drugs; however, they supplemented each other as it offered the benefit of immediate onset as compared to morphine alone, and lesser requirement of the total number of additional doses needed in 24 hours.</p><p>The incidence and severity of side-effects were not statistically significant between the three groups in present study; however, they were higher in the S and M group compared to the combination group which is in agreement with previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] This seems to be related to 50% reduction in the dose of each opioid, thus reducing the incidence of side effects caused by excess of either drug used alone. Drowsiness has been reported with repeated epidural bolus or continuous infusion of sufentanil,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] limiting its acceptability for routine use in obstetric patients, whereas repeated IV doses cause increased sleepiness, difficulty in breast feeding, breathing difficulties or limpness in neonates.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] We did not observe these side effects in the sufentanil group possibly because a 25 mcg dose was only administered, and our study was limited to 24 hours. Hemodynamic and respiratory variables were comparable in the three groups except one patient in morphine group who developed RR &#x0003c; 10/minute. Our study could not totally exclude respiratory depression as the number of patients in our study was insufficient to evaluate this worrisome complication. It is likely that the risk of respiratory depression was attenuated with this mode of combined opioid administration. Although we did not aim to compare cost of therapy, we found that the cost was lower in the morphine group (INR 12-15) compared to sufentanil alone (INR 225-300) and the combination group (INR 156).</p><p>Limitation of this study was that we evaluated fixed doses of epidural sufentanil and morphine alone or in combination. The use of different doses to extend the duration of pain relief with acceptable side effects needs to be evaluated, and a large study needs to be conducted to evaluate the occurrence of respiratory depression and sedation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the combination of sufentanil and morphine administered epidurally, for
