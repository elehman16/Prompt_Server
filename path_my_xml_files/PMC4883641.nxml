When a soft contact lens is placed on the cornea, the amount of oxygen reaching the corneal surface is reduced. If this reduction in oxygen affects corneal metabolism, then corneal swelling may occur because of water retention from increased osmotic pressure in the corneal stroma caused by accumulation of lactic acid from anaerobic metabolism.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Corneal swelling is often used as a method of determining if the cornea is receiving sufficient oxygen through the contact lens.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In contact lens&#x02013;induced hypoxic corneal swelling, lactic acid accumulation and excessive carbon dioxide retention will lower the stromal pH.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The resultant corneal acidosis may result in swelling of localized areas of the corneal endothelium.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Under high magnification, the swollen corneal endothelial cells appear as nonreflecting dark areas, simulating localized areas of missing endothelial mosaic. This phenomenon is known as the &#x0201c;corneal endothelial bleb response&#x0201d;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and peaks about 20 min after lens insertion.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Previous studies have shown that Asian eyes were more susceptible to this phenomenon than non-Asian eyes.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This response has also been used to determine whether sufficient oxygen transport through the lens is being met.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>The amount of oxygen that passes through a soft lens is termed the <italic>oxygen transmissibility</italic> (Dk/t; unit = [cm ml O<sub>2</sub>]/[ml s mmHg]) and is the product of lens oxygen permeability (Dk; unit = [cm<sup>2</sup>/s] [ml O<sub>2</sub>/ml mmHg]) divided by its local thickness (<italic>t</italic>). The degree of corneal swelling measured in response to oxygen deprivation by hydrogel contact lens wear is inversely related to this Dk/t.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> More recent work has also shown that this inverse relation holds true for measurable limbal hyperemia and peripheral lens Dk/t.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Although highly oxygen-permeable lenses made from various siloxane polymers (termed <italic>silicone hydrogels</italic>) have shown tremendous growth during the past decade,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> hydrogel materials, in which the Dk increases with increasing water content,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> continue to be prescribed in large numbers, accounting for 50% of fits in many countries.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Daily disposable (DD) contact lenses, in which the lenses are inserted, worn during the day, and then removed and discarded, offer many advantages to the wearer, including convenience and a low rate of adverse events.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Silicone hydrogel DD lenses have only recently been commercialized,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and thus, the majority of DD lenses are only available in hydrogel materials.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>The first DD hydrogel lens to be commercialized globally was the 1-DAY ACUVUE lens, which was introduced in 1995<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and made from etafilcon A.

Randomly permuted block randomization was used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment sequences and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. Subjects and investigators were not aware of the identity of the two pigmented lenses (1-DAY ACUVUE DEFINE lenses with and without Lacreon). Masking subjects and investigators was not possible with NLW and the clear control lens (1-DAY ACUVUE MOIST). Only the study research assistants had access to the study randomization code, and they were responsible for the assignment of the study test article for each subject.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects and Sample Size Justification</title><p>Assuming a within-subject/eye variation of 5 and an intraclass correlation of 0.5, the sample size of 24 subjects in a 4 by 4 crossover trial had a power of 98% to detect 3% change in corneal swelling difference, with an overall type I error controlled at 5%. The power was only 70% to detect a difference of 2%.

In each study phase, one of four randomly assigned study treatments (one of three contact lens types or spectacle wear) was used bilaterally; contact lenses were worn on a daily disposable basis. Subjects were dispensed the study treatment during a baseline visit in the morning (a.m.) and returned to the Centre for Contact Lens Research after 8 &#x000b1; 1 h of lens wear (p.m.). Prior to attending any of the four study phases, each participant was required to cease contact lens wear for a minimum washout period of 24 hours. In addition, each participant was instructed to wake up at least 3 hours before attending each baseline visit to ensure that any residual corneal swelling from overnight eye closure had dissipated.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>Central corneal thickness at baseline (am) and immediately after lens removal (pm) was measured for one eye (determined randomly) with a modified optical pachymeter (OP) on a Zeiss biomicroscope, interfaced to a desktop computer. The pachymetry measurement included seven readings; the computer was programmed by custom software to remove the highest and lowest readings and to calculate the average of the remaining five readings to provide a measure of the central corneal thickness. The OP was calibrated at the beginning of the study using a calibration method described elsewhere<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and its calibration was verified before taking the measurements on each study day throughout the study period. Corneal thickness of the contralateral eye was measured using the Visante optical coherence tomographer (OCT) (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany) pachymetry map for corneal thickness data along the horizontal meridian, within a range from -5 to +5 mm around the center of the cornea (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Example of OCT pachymetry map.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="opx-93-619-g003"/></fig><p>These measurements comprised the average data for the central 0- to 2-mm cornea and both temporal and nasal 2- to 5-mm pericentral, 5- to 7-mm transitional/midperipheral and 7- to 10-mm peripheral zones along the horizontal meridian. The mean corneal thickness at each corneal zone (except central) was derived from averaging the temporal and nasal OCT measurements for that zone.

Images of the central corneal endothelial specular reflection of approximately 0.25 &#x000d7; 0.5 mm were captured. The instrument features an auto-alignment function that operates over an area of 8 mm<sup>2</sup>, thereby facilitating repeatable image capture of &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;excellent&#x0201d; quality. Immediate inspection of images allowed the observer to grade the image quality and recapture where the quality was considered to be substandard. Images suitable for analysis were obtained before lens insertion and at 20 min after lens wear (repeated accordingly on the day of NLW). No contact with the ocular surface was required. The Topcon SP-3000P has a self-calibrating function that automatically verifies the calibration on turning on the instrument each day. Endothelial cell images were analyzed with ImageNet software (Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Although this software determines cell density and coefficient of cell size automatically, endothelial bleb analysis required the bleb areas to be manually identified. A masked observer (who was not one of the clinicians assigned to the study) performed the analysis by subjectively selecting a region in a given image that provided an optimal balance of maximum area and clarity of cell outlines. When blebs are observed with this technique, they are outlined manually, enabling the software to calculate the area of the blebs. This was then compared with the total area of the region selected for analysis to yield the dependent variable of interest, which is the percentage bleb area. Typically, the area of endothelium used to obtain each datum was about 0.03 mm<sup>2</sup> and comprised up to 100 cells.</p><p>The percentage change in endothelial blebs was calculated from baseline at 20 min after fitting.</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="opx-93-619-i002.jpg"/></p><p>In addition to corneal swelling, the ocular physiological impact of the lenses was also assessed by determining the degree of bulbar and limbal hyperemia and corneal staining before lens insertion and after 8 &#x000b1; 1 h of lens wear.

A more recent study in 2009 by Morgan et al.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> using the Pentacam Scheimpflug imaging system found maximum central swelling of 4.8% and maximum peripheral swelling of 3.3% with open-eye wear of a low oxygen&#x02013;transmissible hydrogel lens. In this current study, we were unable to detect any clinically significant amount of corneal swelling either centrally or across a horizontal 10-mm diameter (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) with the 1-DAY ACUVUE MOIST lens. This finding is expected because the manufacturer&#x02019;s published central Dk/t of 25.5 for the study lenses is slightly higher than the Holden and Mertz<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> criterion to avoid central corneal swelling in daily wear of 24 Dk/t units. However, the novel finding in this study is that we did not find any statistically or clinically significant differences in central corneal swelling between this clear lens and the two pigmented variants with or without added PVP. This is the first report that the added pigments and PVP have no impact on corneal swelling <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In a study with soft lens open-eye wear in 2009, Morgan et al.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> suggested a threshold of 32.6 Dk/t for peripheral lens transmissibility compared with 19.8 central lens Dk/t to avoid corneal swelling with daily soft lens wear. They showed a transmissibility range of 6 to 11 Dk/t units in the periphery for &#x02212;3.00D conventional hydrogel lenses with a central Dk/t in the range of 17 to 30 units, respectively. Therefore, none of the minus-powered conventional hydrogel lenses in their study met the peripheral Dk/t criterion of 32.6 to avoid peripheral corneal swelling. This is in line with findings from Bruce<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> who compared local Dk/t measurements of spherical hydrogel and silicone hydrogel lenses of various powers and found a maximum peripheral Dk/t of 16 in only a few hydrogel lenses in low minus powers. In the current study, using a range of minus lens powers from &#x02212;1.00 to &#x02212;6.00D, we found an average corneal swelling in the range of 0.76 to 1% approximately 5 mm from the corneal center, which was not statistically or clinically different between the three study contact lenses. Based on the Morgan et al.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> central and peripheral lens transmissibility criteria for conventional hydrogel lenses, we estimate an oxygen transmissibility of about 10.5 peripheral Dk/t for a 1-DAY ACUVUE of &#x02212;3.00D power. For a 10.5 peripheral Dk/t, using the graph from the same article,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> a peripheral swelling of approximately 1% is estimated, which is consistent with the peripheral corneal swelling findings from this current study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). We found that the cornea in no lens wearing control eyes became thinner by about &#x02212;0.6% in all locations at the end of the day (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The slight corneal thinning with NLW in this study was expected based on diurnal variation in corneal thickness.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Also, the same graphs by Morgan et al.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> predict slight amounts of corneal thinning for oxygen transmissibility values in excess of their suggested central and peripheral criterion of 19.8 and 32.6 Dk/t, respectively.</p><p>Previous work has shown that the endothelial bleb response can be used as an indicator of oxygen performance.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Holden et al.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> showed that the endothelial bleb response in open-eye lens wear can be prevented by using a high oxygen&#x02013;transmissible lens. We were unable to record any endothelial blebs with open-eye contact lens wear of any of the study lenses in this study. This is consistent with a result of another study by Rivera and Polse<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> who suggested a minimum Dk/t of 17.2 to minimize or avoid corneal acidosis in soft lens open-eye wear. We used Asian subjects for this study because they were previously shown to develop greater extents of corneal endothelial blebs than non-Asians.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> After 20 min of lens wear and eye closure using soft contact lenses (Dk/t range of 24 to 175 units), Hamano et al.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> found trace amounts of the bleb response in more than one-third of Asian subjects compared with no bleb response in the non-Asian group. In addition, the magnitude of the bleb response in their study was inversely related to the lens oxygen transmissibility in the Asian group. Brennan et al.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> later found a similar association between the endothelial bleb response and soft lens oxygen transmissibility (Dk/t range of 4 to 175 units) in another study on Asian subjects.</p><p>Limbal hyperemia is regarded as a sign of peripheral corneal oxygen deprivation with open-eye contact lens wear.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> It was shown that limbal hyperemia can be eliminated by using highly oxygen&#x02013;transmissible silicone hydrogel lenses.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> In a recent study, Brennan and Osborn<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> found statistically significantly greater corneal swelling and limbal hyperemia with daily wear of a low Dk hydrogel lens compared with silicone hydrogel lenses. However, the differences were not clinically significant. In a previous study with normal conjunctival hyperemia, Murphy et al.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> concluded that a change of 0.40 grade or higher in bulbar redness may be considered clinically significant. Although they used a different subjective grading system (CCLRU), the grading scale limits (i.e., grading from 0 to 4) were the same as the Efron scale in the present study. We found no clinical difference in either limbal or bulbar hyperemia among the study contact lenses (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Also, the maximum increase in average graded limbal or bulbar hyperemia for the study lenses compared with NLW was 0.20 grade or less, which we considered clinically insignificant. This closely follows the absence of any reported change in ocular redness by the study subjects during the course of the 8-h wearing period. Finally, the amount of corneal staining recorded (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) were also clinically irrelevant.</p><p>In summary, we found minimal impact on corneal physiology with open-eye contact lens wear in this study. This was determined by clinically insignificant levels of corneal swelling, measured by both OCT and OP methods, which could not be statistically differentiated after 8 &#x000b1; 1 h of lens wear at each corneal location among the study lenses or in comparison with NLW using a 5% difference in swelling as the clinical margin. The minimal impact of the study lenses on corneal physiology is further supported by the complete absence of any endothelial blebs at 20 min after lens wear and the presence of clinically insignificant levels of corneal staining<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> and minimal difference in limbal or bulbar hyperemia<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> between either 1-DAY ACUVUE DEFINE lenses and their clear equivalent lens control or between the three study contact lenses compared with NLW. These study results confirm that the addition of PVP or the limbal ring pigment to etafilcon A lenses has no clinically meaningful effect on the corneal swelling response to open-eye daily wear. All three study lenses can therefore be interchangeably used for open-eye daily disposable wear, with the anticipation of minimal physiological difference from no lens wear.</p></sec><sig-block><sig><bold>Amir M.
