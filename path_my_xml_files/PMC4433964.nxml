chewing and swallowing food. The condition can cause very serious complications such as
aspiration pneumonia, dehydration, and malnutrition, and may occasionally lead to death<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Enabling dysphagia patients to eat by
rehabilitating their swallowing function is important not just to ensure the medical safety
and functional activities of those patients, but also to maintain their quality of life<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The treatment of dysphagia involves the suppression of parareflexia and the facilitation of
the swallowing reflex, as well as sensory stimulation of the oral cavity and the face.
Dysphagia can also be addressed with facial, oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal muscle
strengthening exercises<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, particularly
tongue muscle strengthening exercises, vocal cord adduction, and the Shaker exercise, all of
which are used extensively to treat the condition<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Shaker exercise requires patients to keep their shoulders off the floor in a lying
position and look at the ends of their feet by raising their heads. This forces the hyoid
bone and the larynx to move forward and upward by contracting the thyrohyoid, mylohyoid,
geniohyoid, and the anterior belly of the diagastric muscles. The Shaker exercise is
effectively rehabilitaties the swallowing function by helping to strengthen the suprahyoid
and infrahyoid muscles and facilitating the opening action of the upper esophageal
sphincter<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) increases or facilitates the nerve-root
mechanism&#x02019;s responses through proprioceptive stimulation. PNF exercises are used to enhance
functional exercises by activating, strengthening, and relaxing muscle groups<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and include short neck flexion exercises,
which are known to effectively strengthen the suprahyoid, infrahyoid, longus capitis, and
rectus capitis lateralis muscles<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, the performance of neck exercises using PNF is considered an effective swallowing
rehabilitation method.</p><p>While a number of studies have reported that the Shaker exercise is effective at treating
swallowing disorders, no study has dealt with the effects of neck exercises using PNF on
swallowing disorders. In light of this, the present study investigated PNF-based short neck
flexion exercises in stroke patients with dysphagia to identify the effects of those
exercises on swallowing disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were stroke patients diagnosed with dysphagia, who visited F
Hospital in Daegu between May and July, 2014. The selection criteria were as follows:
symptoms of dysphagia for over six months prior to treatment; 24 points or higher on the
Korean version of the mini<bold>-</bold>mental state examination (MMSE-K); at least fair
grade in manual muscle testing of the neck flexors; and voluntary agreement to participation
in this study. Patients with any kind of heart disease, internal disease, or musculoskeletal
disease, who would have had difficulty performing our training, were excluded from the
study. This study was conducted following an evaluation by the institutional review board of
Daegu Fatima Hospital, and after receiving written consent from the selected patients and
their guardians.</p><p>Twenty-six subjects were selected, using the above criteria. They were randomly divided
into an experimental group comprising 13 subjects who received an intervention of PNF-based
short neck flexion exercises, and a control group comprising 13 subjects who received an
intervention of the Shaker exercise. Two experienced physical therapists conducted the
exercise programs.</p><p>The experimental group performed PNF-based short neck flexion exercises three days a week
for 30 minutes each time over a period of six weeks. The exercise method is described
below.</p><p>Patients started by lying on a bed with their head and neck positioned off the bed. A
tester was positioned on the left side behind the patient&#x02019;s head. The tester supported the
patient&#x02019;s left laryngeal region with his right hand and placed his left fingertips below the
patient&#x02019;s jaw. To complete the short neck flexion exercises properly, the tester told the
patient to look at a target object in a direction 15&#x000b0; diagonally to the right-hand side. The
tester then initiated the given exercises by moving the patient&#x02019;s neck in a diagonal
direction opposite to the direction already specified. He then issued the verbal instruction
&#x0201c;draw your jaw inward&#x0201d;, and applied a proper level of resistance to the patient&#x02019;s jaw to
fully activate the neck flexor below the jaw, which caused the patient to perform cervical
flexion, in other words, external flexion on the right side or rotation to the right. When
the patient found it difficult to continue the process due to the influence of gravity, the
tester provided a minor level of support rather than resistance in order to help the patient
complete the exercises. The same exercises were then performed in the opposite
direction.</p><p>The control group performed both isometric and isotonic Shaker exercises three days a week
for 30 minutes each time over a period of six weeks. The exercise method is described
below.</p><p>For the isometric Shaker exercise, patients lay on the bed and raised their heads without
moving their shoulders off the bed, looked at the ends of their feet for 60 seconds, and
then lowered their heads back on the bed and rested for 60 seconds. When any patient had
difficulty raising his or her head and keeping it off the bed for 60 seconds, the patient
was instructed to perform the same exercise three times for as long as it could be
maintained. The isotonic Shaker exercise had the patients raise their heads in the same
posture and look at the ends of their feet 30 consecutive times. If a patient could not do
30 repetitions of the exercise, they were allowed to do fewer repetitions.</p><p>This study also included a videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS), which is known to be
the most accurate and effective test for evaluating the swallowing function of stroke
patients objectively<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. As the swallowing
function is performed quickly within one to two seconds, the VFSS is essential for accurate
measurement<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, it is safe
because it does not exceed the permitted radiation limits and actually has a lower radiation
dose (mA) than computed tomography<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
With a fluoroscopic machine erected, each patient was instructed to sit on the footrest of
the machine&#x02019;s camera table facing to the side. The patient was then given an oral
examination diet made up of a contrast medium, and its passage through the pharynx and
larynx was observed and recorded via a monitor system<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. This test was performed by a rehabilitation medicine
specialist.</p><p>Based on the VFSS, the new VFSS scale and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association
National Outcomes Measurement System (ASHA NOMS) scale are currently used to analyze changes
in the swallowing function and the degree of diet. The new VFSS scale is known as the most
accurate and effective test of all swallowing function evaluation tests<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. It consists of 14 items on a scale of 0 to 100 points, and
a score on the high side indicates a high level of swallowing disorders. The scale has seven
items for the oral stage and seven items for the pharyngeal stage. The ASHA NOMS scale is
divided into seven stages ranging from one to seven. A score on the low side indicates a
higher level of swallowing disorders<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>PASW 18.0 for Windows was used to analyze the study results. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test
was performed to compare the new VFSS scale and the ASHA NOMS scale before and after the
interventions. The Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare the experimental and control
groups at pre- and post- intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no significant differences between groups in the baseline characteristics (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table

aspiration. Unlike the control group, the experimental group also showed a statistically
significant improvement in coating of the pharyngeal wall after swallowing.</p><p>Easterling et al. conducted the Shaker exercise with 26 elderly people, but only 12
completed the intervention. Those who dropped out of the training complained of difficulties
and discomfort when performing the exercise<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study had no dropouts, but many patients in the
control group complained of difficulties with raising their heads and keeping that position
for 60 seconds. Unlike the Shaker exercise, which can be performed only when the neck flexor
has at least fair grade, PNF-based short neck flexion exercises can be performed regardless
of the neck flexor&#x02019;s muscular strength. Therefore, it may be a more comfortable and less
difficult exercise for patients.</p><p>This study confirmed that PNF-based short neck flexion exercises are a treatment method
that can improve dietary stages and the swallowing function, and that they are as effective
as the Shaker exercise. The study results suggest the effectiveness of PNF-based short neck
flexion exercises as a treatment for swallowing disorders in stroke patients. Its limitation
was the small number of subjects who complied with our selection criteria, making it
problematic to generalize the study&#x02019;s results. Therefore, futures studies should examine the
effects of PNF-based short neck exercises on patients with swallowing disorders caused by
various diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Paciaroni</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Mazzotta</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Corea</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Dysphagia following stroke</article-title>. <source>Eur
