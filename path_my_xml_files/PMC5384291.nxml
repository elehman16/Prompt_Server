Important aspects of programmes targeted at older people are: to reach those at risk, effective screening, optimising advice, and referral to local interventions. We examined the effect of a preventive health consultation (PRIMUS), a multi-behavioural screening programme for persons aged 55&#x02013;74&#x000a0;years in primary care. In a multi-centre randomised controlled trial, the effects of participating in the PRIMUS intervention were compared to a comparison group receiving personalised summaries and advice by postal mail, both preceded by a health risk assessment via a questionnaire. The intervention consisted of a baseline health risk assessment, followed by a preventive health consultation (after 4&#x000a0;weeks), and a follow-up visit (2&#x000a0;weeks later) in the primary care centre. A newly developed web-based computer-tailored programme supported the nurse practitioner during the consultation. Main outcomes measures were awareness of, and compliance with referral advice for changing unhealthy lifestyles. The PRIMUS preventive health consultation was successful in older people at risk for cardio metabolic diseases compared to the comparison group (compliance: RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.12&#x02013;1.79; p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). The intervention was less successful in older people at risk for mental health problems. This preventive health consultation for older people resulted in positive changes in unhealthy behaviours by optimising reach, raising awareness, motivating and assisting individuals to change, and referring to local interventions.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Aged</kwd><kwd>Primary health care</kwd><kwd>Lifestyle risk reduction</kwd><kwd>Health services for the aged</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Awareness</kwd><kwd>Preventive health service</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>In the Netherlands with its ageing population, compared to 2005 a 58% increase in the prevalence of diabetes, a 40% increase of cardiovascular diseases and a 10% increase in depression is expected by 2025 (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">van Duin, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Lucht van der and Polder, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Luijben and Kommer, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Blokstra et al., 2007</xref>). These trends are similar in all Western countries (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Shetty, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Large differences in healthy life expectancy exist between people with a low and high socioeconomic status (SES) (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Mackenbach et al., 2008</xref>). In the Netherlands, high income 65-year-old men live 5.7&#x000a0;years longer in good health compared to low-income men; for women this is 5.3 more healthy years (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Knoops and van den Brakel, 2010</xref>). Prevention of health problems by identifying risks and changing unhealthy behaviours is likely to decrease morbidity, prolong life and improve quality-of-life (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Mackenbach et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Oers van, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Whitlock et al., 2002</xref>). Healthy life styles (non-smoking, limited alcohol use, physical activity and maintenance of a normal weight) are associated with lower risk rates of cardiovascular disease, lower diabetes type 2 and reduction in cancers (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Spring et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Various lifestyle interventions are available to help diminish health risks in the elderly. However, many older people at-risk are not reached by these interventions (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Schippers et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, the most challenging goals are to increase reach to those at-risk, promote screening on unhealthy lifestyles, and optimise advice and referral to (local) interventions. Clinicians can play a vital role in reaching those at-risk and in promoting healthier life styles (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Spring et al., 2013</xref>). Few studies have evaluated the effects of population-based screening programmes (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Deutekom et al., 2011</xref>). The ones that have evaluated health behaviour suggest a positive effect. Nevertheless, more research on the effect on population based screening programs is needed, especially in groups difficult to reach.</p><p>To optimise reach and increase compliance with lifestyle advice, we developed the Prevention: Intervention Mapping Used for Seniors (PRIMUS) - Preventive Health Consultations (PHC) intervention. A formal literature search followed by a RAND appropriateness method on effectiveness of screening in older people was done as part of the assessment procedure to conduct the PRIMUS-PHC (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Drewes et al., 2012</xref>). We involved older people, relevant professionals and key figures to identify potential barriers and facilitators that needed to be tackled by means of the PRIMUS-PHC (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">van Dijk et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">van Dijk et al., 2009</xref>). We took into account the criteria of Wilson and Jungner (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Wilson and Jungner, 1968</xref>), for example that screening has to lead to an early warning, raising awareness, without creating false senses of security. Based on the assessments, we concluded that screening in the general population of elderly aged 55&#x02013;74&#x000a0;years was only appropriate for cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking, insufficient physical activity, and increased body mass index (BMI) (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">van Dijk et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Drewes et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Wilson and Jungner, 1968</xref>). There was inconclusive evidence for subclinical depression and loneliness, and for alcohol abuse. However, given their high prevalence among older people and the availability of effective interventions, these health risks were also included (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">van Dijk et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Weingart, 2009</xref>).</p><p>To increase uptake the PRIMUS-PHCs took place in primary care settings, because older people prefer this to other settings, such as a homecare organisation (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">van Dijk et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, because older people with a lower SES have a lower healthy life expectancy, the PHCs were conducted in primary care centres located in underprivileged areas. The invitation was sent to clusters of people living in the same street, thus increasing a favourable social norm of participation by inviting neighbours (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">van Dijk et al., 2009</xref>). To facilitate uptake among people from a non-Dutch cultural background, educators with a similar cultural origin conducted home visits to ensure their understanding of the PHC goal and content.</p><p>The intervention content was guided by the Health Belief Model and Stages of Change Model (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Strecher et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Rollnick and Miller, 1995</xref>). As the main behavioural technique, Motivational Interviewing was used to optimise awareness of and compliance with advice (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Prochaska and Diclemente, 1983</xref>). This way the best available tools and most recent insights were used to optimise motivation. As part of the invitation, individuals received an initial health risk assessment (HRA) form. At the first step of the PHC each person was informed about their results via this HRA, i.e. their individual health risks. Prior to consultation, counsellors were also provided with the results of the HRA as a reminder to discuss barriers and lifestyle changes with the participant (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Strecher et al., 1997</xref>). The choice of topic of conversation was based on the HRA and the motivation of the participants to engage in specific lifestyle changes.</p><p>The present study evaluated the effect of the PRIMUS-PHCs on awareness of and compliance with referral advice for changing unhealthy lifestyles among older people, compared to general advice on lifestyle changes received by postal mail.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Design and participants</title><p>This multi-centre randomised controlled study (RCT) (conducted in 2010&#x02013;2011) used the street where the participants lived as the unit of randomisation.

The number of participants invited per primary care centre depended on the availability of working hours of the nurse practitioners (NPs). Criteria for study exclusion were: 1) cerebrovascular or cardiac events within 6&#x000a0;months prior to the intervention, 2) participating in diabetes mellitus II or other lifestyle programmes, and/or 3) physically/emotionally/cognitively unable to comply with a lifestyle programme.</p><p>The primary care physicians (PCPs) checked the patient's eligibility prior to inviting them to participate. <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows the selection and enrolment of the PRIMUS participants.</p><p>All eligible participants (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1147; 67.5%) received a written invitation, a brochure explaining the purpose of the study, a baseline questionnaire, and an informed consent form from their PCP; those returning the questionnaire were included in the study.

Participants with multiple unhealthy behaviours could choose the order in which they preferred behaviour(s) to be discussed. NPs used motivational interviewing techniques to move participants through the various behaviour change processes and to enhance participant's intention, self-efficacy, and attitude (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Rollnick and Miller, 1995</xref>). To support NPs in discussing and advising about unhealthy behaviours, we developed computerised Minimal Intervention Strategies (MIS), grounded on the Stages of Change theory (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Prochaska and Diclemente, 1983</xref>), making use of the available MIS programmes for smoking, overweight and drinking behaviour (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Pieterse et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Fransen, 2011</xref>). We developed MIS for physical activity, subclinical depression and loneliness. All MIS were based on the 5A's behaviour change model: 1) &#x02018;Assess&#x02019; motivation to change, and existing beliefs and knowledge regarding the health behaviour, 2) &#x02018;Advise&#x02019; on health risks and provide information, 3) &#x02018;Agree&#x02019; or collaborate by discussing benefits and ambiguities, and by setting goals tailored to the participant's interest, 4) &#x02018;Assist&#x02019; by thinking of strategies, setting quitting or starting dates, and offering support, 5) &#x02018;Arrange&#x02019; referral and follow-up appointments. NPs referred participants to evidence-based interventions in the neighbourhood (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Haringsma et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Grandes et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Dekker et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>During the consultation, the patient's weight and height were measured, and blood pressure was measured twice.

Meanwhile, the absolute 10-year cardiovascular risk score (SCORE) on morbidity and mortality was calculated, based upon age, gender, smoking behaviour, systolic blood pressure and TC/HDL ratio (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Dekker et al., 2011</xref>). Since the SCORE function stops at age 65&#x000a0;years, we used the same 65-year data for persons aged 66&#x02013;74&#x000a0;years. NPs discussed perceived barriers in achieving the health goals set in the former consultation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>2.3</label><title>Comparison group</title><p>The comparison group received the same HRA as the intervention group. Four weeks after the HRA, they received personalised summaries of the results of the screening forms, with relevant healthy lifestyle advice and written referrals. Participants received information based on the Dutch public health guidelines to identify risk behaviours, and similar local interventions for referral, as those offered to the intervention group.</p></sec><sec id="s0045"><label>2.4</label><title>Questionnaires</title><p>Both groups received a baseline questionnaire together with the HRA. All participants that completed the baseline received a follow-up questionnaire 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;weeks after the PHC, or the advice received by mail. Turkish, Moroccan and Hindustan interviewers visited participants from according origin, to assist them in filling out the HRA and questionnaires, and to emphasise the importance of participation.</p><p>In the final questionnaire, responses were assessed separately for each risk factor. Awareness of having received an advice was measured by questions like: &#x0201c;Did you get any advice to quit smoking?&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Did you get any advice concerning your depressed feelings?&#x0201d; (Awareness: yes/no). Responses were categorised into two outcomes: 1) being aware of having had at least one advice concerning cardiometabolic risk factors (smoking, BMI, physical activity, and alcohol use), and 2) being aware of having had at least one advice concerning mental health risk factors (depression and loneliness).</p><p>Compliance with received advice was defined as self-reported follow-up of referral advice and was measured as follows: &#x0201c;Did you make an appointment with the dietician since the PHC or since we sent you this advice?&#x0201d; (Compliance: yes/no). Compliance was categorised into two outcomes 1) compliance with at least one advice concerning cardiometabolic risk factors, 2) compliance with at least one advice concerning mental health risk factors.</p><p>Secondary outcomes were measured by reported positive changes in lifestyle behaviour, BMI, and scores on subclinical depression and loneliness. These were measured based on the percentage of participants not exceeding the norms at the final measurement of all participants exceeding them at baseline.</p><p>Participants were asked for their age, gender, level of income, level of education, household composition, and ethnicity (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Health characteristics included the number of chronic disorders and perceived health status.</p><p>Motivation to change was assessed at baseline for people not meeting the healthy guidelines, using a 5-point Likert-type scale. Intention to change unhealthy behaviours was measured by questions like &#x0201c;Suppose you decide to increase physical activity, when do you intend to start?

A distinction was made between cardiometabolic risk and mental health risk.</p><p>Two-thirds of the participants with an increased cardiometabolic risk were aware of having received at least one advice regarding a behaviour related to that risk. They were most aware of advice regarding alcohol use, which could be explained by their unfamiliarity with the Dutch public health guideline on drinking alcohol among older people (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Adams et al., 1996</xref>). Overall, there were no marked differences in advice awareness between the intervention group (advice during PRIMUS-PHC) and the comparison group (advice by post). However, there was a higher awareness of the advice to increase physical activity among the overweight PHC group. This could be because several overweight patients had reported being sufficiently active on the HRA: consequently, they did not receive advice about physical activity when in the comparison group. In the PHC group, the NPs observed and interviewed the participants, which could have resulted in a changed risk assessment regarding physical activity; an advantage of actual interaction with the patient. Nonetheless, in both groups, one-third of the patients at increased cardiometabolic risk were not aware of having received some advice. Interestingly, the awareness among individuals with a higher risk of depression or loneliness of having received advice was much lower than that for cardiometabolic risk. Maybe questions regarding advice for subclinical depression and loneliness were not recognized as such by the participants, because the advice was related to a specific symptom, such as insomnia or lack of contacts. Therefore, the question &#x0201c;Did you get any advice concerning your depressed feelings?&#x0201d; might have been wrongly answered positively, when being advised about e.g. insomnia. Nevertheless, it could be that this lack of awareness is because patients do not identify themselves as being at increased risk of depression. In a study among older patients (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;74&#x000a0;years) with depressive symptoms, only a small percentage of the depressive patients (19%) started a course, and the main reason for their not participating was not feeling depressed (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">van der Weele et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">van der Weele et al., 2012b</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, awareness did not necessarily mean that persons complied with the cardiometabolic or mental health advice. Although both groups were equally aware of having received some advice, the PHC group more often stated to comply with at least one of the cardiometabolic advices; they more often followed-up the advice to lose weight, increase physical activity when overweight, and reduce alcohol consumption. Largely in line with this compliance with cardiometabolic advice, the PHC group also more often stated to be successful in losing weight and decreasing alcohol use. Motivational interviewing interventions can motivate adults or older persons to change specific behaviours (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">van Keulen et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Burke et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Dunn et al., 2001</xref>). In the present study, although the effects on compliance and success were relatively small, the relative risks are in line with those found in a meta-analysis (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Lundahl et al., 2013</xref>). The PRIMUS intervention did not induce awareness of depressive feelings. However the compliance for those aware of advices on depressive feelings is comparable to those aware of advices on other health risks. About half of the older persons that were aware complied.</p><p>In a clinical setting, interventions for behaviour change mainly focus on one specific behaviour and less on multiple behaviours (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Prochaska and Prochaska, 2011</xref>). A study by Butler et al. focusing on multiple behaviours found no significant effects on behaviour change 3&#x000a0;months after adult patients visited a clinician trained in behaviour change counselling (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Butler et al., 2013</xref>); however, a significantly larger percentage of patients in the intervention group than in the comparison group, reported that their physician had initiated discussion about a change in health behaviour. This increased awareness of being engaged is reflected in our findings of the patients being relatively highly aware of being advised. In the present study, this increased awareness was found both in the intervention and comparison group, suggesting that it is not only the physician's training that is responsible for the awareness of receiving advice. An explanation for this difference between studies can be attributed to the recruitment strategy and information provided to the comparison group. Whereas Butler et al. recruited patients when visiting the PCP for a wide range of acute and chronic concerns and the comparison group received usual care, our PRIMUS patients were recruited via a screening approach and the comparison group received advice about their unhealthy behaviours by post (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Butler et al., 2013</xref>). Using a screening strategy for recruitment, with those returning the screening questionnaire being included in the study, probably leads to a specific selection of patients, i.e. the more motivated and health-conscious patients are more likely to respond (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">van Dijk et al., 2009</xref>). Also, the health-conscious participants are more likely to recall being advised about their health behaviours. Nevertheless, the percentages of successfully changing any behaviour reported by our PHC group was comparable to the percentages found by Butler et al. (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Butler et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the percentages in our comparison group were much lower than found by Butler et al., suggesting that awareness alone is not sufficient for changing behaviour and additional personal counselling is required to increase the intention to change.</p><sec id="s0090"><label>4.1</label><title>Limitations and considerations</title><p>Although an RCT is a suitable method for assessing awareness and compliance with advice, some bias cannot be excluded, e.g. inviting people to participate may have resulted in a more health-conscious study population, although even in this group a large majority had one or more health risks for cardiovascular diseases. Present study gives an indication of the results that can be expected when inviting and counselling elderly patients via a screening approach. Even in this health-conscious group, because a large majority had cardiometabolic risk factors, lifestyle changes are still recommended. Nevertheless efforts should be developed to also reach individuals less likely to participate in a HRA, at least to support them in making an informed decision regarding participation or not.</p><p>Although the PHC group more often stated to comply with the advice to increase physical activity and quit smoking these differences were not significant: the number of smokers and participants with limited physical activity was too small to demonstrate a possible underlying success.</p><p>Characteristics of the NPs providing the counselling might have led to variations in the effect between the general practices. Some NPs were probably more skilled in motivational interviewing than others; future studies should take these types of characteristics into account.</p><p>The use of self-reported data may have led to socially desirable answers; however, since the same questionnaire was sent to both groups, their answers are likely to be equally affected by such bias.</p></sec><sec id="s0095"><label>4.2</label><title>Implications</title><p>Inviting elderly persons for a health risk assessment followed by a PHC with motivational interviewing led to increased compliance with advice and to some small changes in behaviour, at least on the short term. In particular, the advice on weight loss and reducing alcohol use were followed-up. Although the changes were relatively small they are relevant, especially because only about two-thirds of our population were aware of their risk. Improvement might be achieved by continuing to increase awareness among those at risk. A periodical screening approach together with counselling in the usual care of elderly patients may help achieve this. This partly fits the recommendation that counselling should focus on persons at higher risk for cardiovascular diseases (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Moyer, 2012</xref>).</p><p>With regard to screening and counselling for depressive symptoms, a different instrument is needed to assess awareness and compliance with advice related to the specific symptoms of depression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0100"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare there is no conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adams</surname><given-names>W.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Barry</surname><given-names>K.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Fleming</surname><given-names>M.F.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Screening for problem drinking in older primary care patients</article-title><source>JAMA</source><volume>276</volume><issue>24</issue><year>1996</year><fpage>1964</fpage><lpage>1967</lpage><comment>(Dec 25)</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8971065</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0010"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="rf0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Altman</surname><given-names>D.G.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>Practical Statistics for Medical Research</chapter-title><year>1991</year><publisher-name>Chapman &#x00026; Hall</publisher-name><publisher-loc>London</publisher-loc><fpage>456</fpage><comment>(ISBN 0-412-27630-5)</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0015"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="rf0015"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bevolkingsgegevens gemeente Den Haag</surname></name></person-group><chapter-title>Bevroren bestand Burgerzaken, Leeftijd (5-jr klassen) [personen]</chapter-title><year>2013</year><publisher-name>Dienst Publiekszaken (DPZ)</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Gemeente: Den Haag</publisher-loc></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0020"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="rf0020"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Blokstra</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Verschuren</surname><given-names>W.M.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Baan</surname><given-names>C.A.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>Impact of the ageing population on burden of disease.
