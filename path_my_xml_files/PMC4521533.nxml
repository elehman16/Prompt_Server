As yet, health behaviour interventions designed to maintain or improve nutrition in patients with HNC have not been evaluated. The proposed trial builds on promising pilot data, and evaluates the effectiveness of a dietitian-delivered health behaviour intervention to reduce malnutrition in patients with HNC undergoing radiotherapy: Eating As Treatment (EAT).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A stepped-wedge cluster randomised design will be used. All recruitment hospitals begin in the control condition providing treatment as usual. In a randomly generated order, oncology staff at each hospital will receive 2&#x02005;days of training in EAT before switching to the intervention condition. Training will be supplemented by ongoing supervision, coaching and a 2-month booster training provided by the research team. EAT is based on established behaviour change counselling methods, including motivational interviewing, cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy, and incorporates clinical practice change theory. It is designed to improve motivation to eat despite a range of barriers (pain, mucositis, nausea, reduced or no saliva, taste changes and appetite loss), and to provide patients with practical behaviour change strategies. EAT will be delivered by dietitians during their usual consultations. 400 patients with HNC (nasopharynx, hypopharynx, oropharynx, oral cavity or larynx), aged 18+, undergoing radiotherapy (&#x0003e;60&#x02005;Gy) with curative intent, will be recruited from radiotherapy departments at 5 Australian sites. Assessments will be conducted at 4 time points (first and final week of radiotherapy, 4 and 12&#x02005;weeks postradiotherapy). The primary outcome will be a nutritional status assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval from all relevant bodies has been granted.

A systematic review of nutrition advice in patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy found that dietetic intervention throughout treatment maintained or improved patients' nutritional status.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Furthermore, nutritional advice has been found to improve a range of patient outcomes during<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and after treatment,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> including treatment completion rates, unplanned hospital visits, length of stay and weight loss.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> However, patients with HNC are often non-compliant with dietary advice. For some, having to return to the hospital for dietetic appointments in addition to their radiotherapy can be an impediment; particularly if the appointments are not viewed as a core component of their cancer treatment. In response, dietitians often lack the specific confidence, skills and time to change the dietary behaviours of patients with HNC, especially if those patients have mental health and/or substance use problems and may not see dietetic care as important.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Eating as treatment</title><p>This trial attempts to address the inherent difficulties in intervening with the HNC population including their premorbid mental health, non-engagement and non-compliance with dietary advice. It does this by providing dietitians with training, skills and knowledge to deal with this difficult and often overlooked group. The study builds on previous findings by employing motivational interviewing (MI<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), a counselling style shown to be effective among other non-compliant patient groups<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and simple cognitive and behavioural strategies. Dietitians will be trained, supervised and coached in the provision of the intervention known as Eating As Treatment (EAT), guided by an intervention manual (available on request). Dietitians will also receive training in the administration of a brief screening tool for symptoms of depression. In accordance with best practice recommendations, dietitians will be supported to identify patients at risk of psychosocial distress and to work with the HNC team to mobilise appropriate support. A raft of evidence-based practice-change strategies will also be adopted to overcome systemic and other barriers to clinician compliance, thereby maximising the clinical implementation of EAT.</p></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>This trial aims to test the effectiveness of the EAT intervention. EAT is a dietitian-delivered intervention to prevent malnutrition in patients with HNC undergoing radiotherapy at five Australian hospital sites. The primary objective of the trial is to maintain nutrition in patients with HNC undergoing radiotherapy.</p><p>It is hypothesised that patients with HNC receiving the EAT intervention will have lower malnutrition scores, as measured by the Patient-Generated&#x02014;Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), at post-treatment and follow-up, compared with patients in the control condition (receiving usual care).</p><p>Secondary hypotheses are that, relative to control patients, intervention patients will have higher rates of treatment completion, fewer unplanned hospital visits, shorter lengths of stay, lower depression, higher quality of life and more quality adjusted life years.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>The present study utilises a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised controlled design. In a stepped-wedge design, all recruitment sites (hospitals) begin in the control condition and then move to the intervention condition in a randomised order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008921F1">figure 1</xref>). This design was chosen because the intervention involves training dietitians and changing their practice, a simple, randomised trial would require the dietitians to ignore the intervention principles and skills they have learned when treating control patients, making the likelihood for contamination very high. Therefore, a cluster-randomised design was necessary. A standard, parallel, cluster-randomised trial would require a large number of hospitals that treat high numbers of patients with HNC. The low number of radiotherapy departments in Australia treating high numbers of patients with HNC meant that this option was also not possible. A stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised, controlled trial provides the same level of evidence as a standard, parallel, cluster-randomised controlled trial<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> using fewer sites, while reducing the potential for contamination.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015008921F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Progression of intervention roll-out in a stepped-wedge model.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015008921f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Sites were recruited through the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) who invited members from large radiotherapy departments within Australian hospitals to put their sites forward as potential clusters. Participants will be recruited from six of these large radiotherapy departments located in Adelaide, South Australia; Melbourne, Victoria; Sydney, New South Wales; Perth, Western Australia; and Brisbane, Queensland. There are two hospitals in Brisbane that share a dietetic department. So, although patients are recruited from two different hospitals, they will be treated as one progression step in the stepped wedge, and move to the intervention period at the same time. This equates to a total of five wedge steps.</p><p>Prior to study commencement, the order in which hospitals receive training (thereby the duration of control and intervention periods) was randomised by an independent statistician using a uniform random number generator in STATA.

The researchers will return 2&#x02005;months later to refresh EAT intervention skills, problem-solve clinical concerns, and troubleshoot any practice change issues that may have arisen. During the intervention phase, dietitians will participate in regular supervision with one of the researchers (clinical psychologist, AKB). Where possible, individual supervision via telephone will occur fortnightly for the first 2&#x02005;months post-training, and regular written feedback will be provided. Group supervision will be introduced during the 2-month &#x02018;booster&#x02019; visit. Group supervision will then occur monthly, thereafter, via skype/teleconference/videoconference. Supervision will be used to discuss clinical issues, problem-solve, and provide skills-based feedback. Common themes, barriers and solutions discussed during supervision will be distributed (eg, email/discussion board) to participating dietitians across all hospitals.</p></sec><sec id="s2e2b"><title>Eating as treatment</title><p>The intervention is named EAT, to emphasise that maintaining adequate nutrition during radiotherapy is an integral part of cancer treatment and not merely an adjunct to survival. In order for patients with HNC to eat, they must overcome significant barriers of pain, oral disfigurement, mucositis, nausea, reduced or no saliva, taste changes and severe loss of appetite, in addition to the premorbid complications of high rates of smoking, alcohol misuse, mental health problems and poor levels of self-care.</p><p>The content of the intervention is a distillation of behaviour change strategies of MI and cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy (CBT), developed specifically for patients with HNC undergoing radiotherapy, and targeting behaviours around nutrition. The intervention was successfully piloted by a clinical psychologist,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and has been refined for delivery by dietitians in the clinical setting, alongside their standard dietetic consultations with patients with HNC. The refined training was piloted with dietitians at the Calvary Mater Newcastle, who found the training acceptable, feasible and useful.</p><p>Although the training is standardised, the intervention itself is not highly structured, as it has been demonstrated that MI studies that do not have a structured manual produce almost double the effect size of those that are highly manualised.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Instead, training in EAT uses simply worded principles to guide the dietitian (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008921F2">figure 2</xref>), reminding them to integrate the skills they have learned in training into their normal clinical practice.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015008921F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Principles prompt and conversation guide for Eating as Treatment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015008921f02"/></fig><p>The first principle refers to the MI interactional style in which clinicians are empathic, collaborative and elicit motivation for change from the patients themselves.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This principle refers both to the importance of allowing the patient reinforce their own reasons for change (change talk), as well as avoiding pushing the patient into creating arguments not to change (sustain talk). These skills will be used to elicit motivation to change eating behaviour and to help generate concrete behavioural goals.</p><p>There are no specific &#x02018;scripts' in EAT. However, there is one specific conversation that dietitians will be trained to hold with patients, referred to as Eat To Live. Using MI skills, dietitians will elicit patients' reasons for having radiotherapy. Although patients&#x02019; reasons will be many and varied, ultimately, a core reason for undergoing the rigours of radiotherapy will have some element of wanting to live (palliative treatment is an exclusion criterion). We can be confident that this is the case, as they are attending radiotherapy every day for 5&#x02013;7&#x02005;weeks, despite sometimes quite severe side effects. Dietitians then offer an invitation to explain the correlation between malnutrition during radiotherapy and poorer outcomes. It is important that this information is delivered as a description of the HNC population rather than becoming accusatory of the patient's behaviour personally, thus keeping to the first principle. The dietitian then deploys variance by inviting the patient to reflect on their continued attendance at radiotherapy and their concurrent nutritional behaviours that may not be enhancing the likelihood of meeting the core goal of living. As always, deploying variance requires a good rapport and genuineness for it not to seem accusatory and confrontational. From this point, the dietitian attempts to convert the motivation elicited into concrete dietary behavioural changes by asking the patient what they feel are the next step.</p><p>The remaining three principles in EAT will be operationalised in a nutritional planner that the dietitian and patient work on collaboratively. Together, they generate a weekly grid of nutritional behaviours, such as eating breakfast, conducting oral care of ulcers, or drinking a meal replacement supplement. When the patient is happy with the plan, both they and the dietitian sign it, and the dietitian takes a copy and they agree to review it the following week. The patient then ticks each behaviour as they complete it each day. This process makes the behaviours more likely through self-generation,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> self-monitoring,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> having a concrete meal plan,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> tailoring,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> achievability,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> reinforcement and accountability;<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> all of which are CBT strategies that have been successful in nutritional behaviour change trials.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e3"><title>Implementation of EAT</title><p>The intervention was developed to integrate with the <italic>Evidence Based Practice Guidelines for the Nutritional Management of Adult Patients with Head and Neck Cancer.</italic><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> While EAT is predominately a style of interaction, in order to maximise potential benefit for patients, it requires that (1) patients receive frequent contact with dietitians to enable sufficient exposure to the intervention; (2) ongoing dietitian's use of a validated nutrition assessment tool to enable the dietitian to present a patient's non-compliance with dietetic advice in a standard, objective, but non-confrontational way and that (3) patients at risk of depression be offered psychosocial support to reduce the risk that depressive symptoms do not hinder patient motivation and capacity to engage with dietitians or action nutritional plans agreed with dietitians during consultation. As such, during the intervention phase, sites receive a range of supportive clinical practice change strategies to facilitate the delivery of the EAT intervention in addition to the provision and/or maintenance of clinical practice guidelines recommendations regarding the frequency of dietitian contact during and after radiotherapy, the use of a validated nutritional assessment tool to assess and monitor nutritional adequacy of patients, and the screening and referral of patients at risk for psychosocial support. Specifically, the research team will provide sites with the following evidence-based, clinical practice change support strategies (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>).

Although mucosal cancers of the head and neck have traditionally accounted for approximately 3%<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> of all cancer diagnoses, the frequency of this diagnosis has increased exponentially in recent years. Radiotherapy plays a major role in the management of these patients, often in association with surgery or chemotherapy. This is the first study to evaluate a dietitian-delivered behaviour change intervention (EAT) based on MI and CBT to maintain or improve nutritional status among patients with HNC. The results of the proposed trial are expected to make a significant contribution to dietetic clinical practice, the training of future oncology dietitians, and ultimately, to reducing the mortality of patients with HNC.</p><p>Importantly, this study brings together existing research, clinical experience and promising pilot data collected by the research team.
