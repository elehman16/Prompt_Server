rehabilitation using a computer on cognitive function and activities of daily living in
stroke patients presenting impairment of cognitive function. [Subjects] Forty-six stroke
patients were divided into two groups (a training group and control group) through random
assignment. [Methods] The training group received rehabilitation therapy and an additional
computerized cognitive rehabilitation program using The RehaCom software 30 minutes/day, 5
times/week for 5 weeks. The control group received only rehabilitation therapy including
physical and occupational therapy. A comparative analysis on all subjects was conducted
before and after the experiment using a cognitive test and activities of daily living
test. [Results] After 5 weeks of therapy, the training group presented statistically
significant improvement in cognitive function assessment items of digit span, visual span,
visual learning, auditory continuous performance, visual continuous performance, and
others compared with the control group but did not present statistically significant
improvement in activities of daily living. [Conclusion] It was revealed through this study
that computerized cognitive rehabilitation with the RehaCom program results in improvement
in cognitive function and can be used as a treatment tool beneficial to stroke patients
presenting cognitive impairment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Computerized cognitive rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Cognitive function</kwd><kwd>Activities of daily living</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cognitive function refers to the ability to understand events that occur in our daily
living and ability to make decisions and adapt in a variety of environments<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Impairment in cognitive function is a
common symptom in stroke patients, and it brings about difficulties in concentration,
memory, and problem solving ability. It not only acts as the biggest impairment for daily
living but also acts as the impairment for rehabilitation in local society<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the case of conducting cognitive rehabilitation using a computer, it is easier to induce
motivation for therapy because direct feedback can be given to patients regarding the
performance result in comparison with cognitive rehabilitation, and this type of training
can not only provide flexibility but may also shorten treatment time<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study
suggested that cognitive rehabilitation using a computer has an effect on cognitive function
in patients with brain damage, and other previous studies suggested that continuous
computerized cognitive rehabilitation for 5 months or longer improves the cognitive ability
of elderly individuals with low cognitive ability<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, numerous studies have been
conducted on computerized cognitive rehabilitation. In particular, many studies have been
conducted with themes concerning attention and memory, and such studies and interests have
been concentrated on basic cognition level. However, given that there has been a increase in
attention paid to improvement of cognitive function and activities of daily living, there
has been a lack of study on the degree of improvement in cognitive function resulting from
computerized cognitive rehabilitation and its effect on daily living.</p><p>Therefore, the objective of this study was to verify the effect of computerized cognitive
rehabilitation by comparing the level of cognitive improvement between a general
rehabilitation therapy group and computerized cognitive rehabilitation group and examining
the effect of improved cognitive level on activities of daily living.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The experiment in this study was conducted with 46 stroke patients who were receiving
in-patient rehabilitation therapy at Inje University Hospital from Oct. 2013 to Mar. 2014.
The participants understood the objective of this study and provided written informed
consent prior to participation in the study. The study was approved by the ethics committee
of the Inje University Institutional Review Board for Clinical Studies. The participants
were randomly divided into a training group of 23 patients and a control group of 23
patients. The training group received rehabilitation therapy and an additional computerized
cognitive rehabilitation program using the RehaCom software 30 minutes/day, 5 times/week for
5 weeks. The control group received only rehabilitation therapy, including physical and
occupational therapy.</p><p>The Computerized Neuropsychological Test (CNT) was used for assessment of cognitive
function, and the Functional Independence Measurement (FIM) was used for assessment of
activities of daily living.</p><p>In regard to the CNT, 7 tests, the digit span test, verbal learning test, visual span test,
visual learning test, auditory continuous performance test, visual continuous performance
test, and trail making test, were used in the assessment to measure the degree of cognitive
function<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The FIM is composed of 13
items regarding 4 lower domains of physical function, self-care, sphincter control,
transfers, and locomotion, and 5 items regarding 2 lower domains of cognitive function,
communication and social cognition. The responses are recorded on a 7-point Likert scale,
and 1&#x02013;5 points and 6&#x02013;7 points are considered to indicate a dependent state in which
assistance is required and an independent state in which assistance is not required,
respectively. The total number of points is calculated by adding the points together for
each question, with the total ranging from 18 to 126 points; a higher total number of points
signifies a greater capacity to perform activities of daily living independently<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The inter-rater reliability of the FIM has been found to be between 0.83 and 0.99, and the
test-retest reliability has been found to be between 0.48 and 0.93<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cognitive assessment and activities of daily living
assessment were conducted before and 5 weeks after the start of computerized cognitive
rehabilitation.</p><p>The RehaCom software (Hasomed GmbH, Magdeburg, Germany) was used for computerized cognitive
rehabilitation; the treatment sessions lasted 30&#x02005;min and were held 5 times/week for total of
5 weeks. The cognitive training program employed was composed of attention, focus, memory,
spatial imagination, visual impairment, and visuomotor coordination. Computerized cognitive
rehabilitation together with rehabilitation therapy was conducted for the training group,
and rehabilitation therapy only was conducted for the control group.</p><p>The paired t-test was conducted for comparison of differences between the computerized
cognitive rehabilitation group and control group in each test, and the level of statistical
significance was set as &#x003b1;=0.05. The PASW Statistics for Window software (Version 18.0, SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical processing of data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were 8 male and 15 female study participants in the training group, and their average

(called RehaCom) was examined. The RehaCom computerized cognitive rehabilitation system used
in this study is composed of 20 detailed training programs for effective rehabilitation of
cognitive function impairment. These programs are designed to work together and are composed
of not only special and basic items but also a variety of items that closely mimic reality.
In comparison with cognitive rehabilitation the strengths of rehabilitation with RehaCom are
that it enables adjustment of difficulty based on the task performance capacity of the
patient, immediate feedback, reduction in time spent by the therapist once the patient
learns the therapy task, and maintenance of objective and continuous information concerning
performance results<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The objective of
RehaCom is effective and economic therapy for patients, and all RehaCom therapy programs
enable this objective, as they are based on academically verified theory.</p><p>The present study was conducted based on the results of preceding studies; although there
was no statistically significant difference in cognitive ability between the training group
and control group in each test item before therapy, there was improvement in cognitive
assessment after therapy. Thus, the present study revealed that computerized cognitive
rehabilitation has effect on improvement of cognitive function in stroke patients
(p&#x0003c;0.05). In particular, it resulted in improvement in digit span, visual span, visual
learning, auditory continuous performance, and visual continuous performance. Furthermore,
its results are similar to those of Chen et al. and Lee et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, who suggested
that computerized cognitive rehabilitation is effective for recovery of cognitive function
of patients presenting cognitive impairment after brain damage when conducted together with
rehabilitation therapy. However, although the training group presented a high increase in
average points compared with the control group in the activities of daily living scale, no
statistically significant difference was found before and after the experiment. Since other
physical aspects are incorporated with cognitive aspects for the activities of daily living
scale, it would have been difficult for a short-term cognitive treatment of (5 weeks) to
result in a significant difference in activities of daily living.</p><p>A limitation of this study was implementation of computerized cognitive rehabilitation with
adjustment of difficulty based on the performance of each subject rather than according to
the traits of the subjects. Moreover, it was difficult to examine whether or not the
improvement in the cognitive domain of activities of daily living was due to pure
improvement in cognitive function because the physical domain was included together with
cognitive domain in the total points for the activities of daily living assessment.</p><p>The results of the present study revealed that computerized cognitive rehabilitation is
effective for recovery of cognitive function in stroke patients who present cognitive
impairment. In future studies, it is necessary to conduct studies with subjects classified
by post-onset duration of stroke, damaged area, and cognitive function.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>McAllister</surname><given-names>TW</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Cognitive functioning in the affective
