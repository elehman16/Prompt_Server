There are several studies of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in primary care which show that good results can be achieved in the treatment of anxiety disorders and depression, as are reviewed in a number of meta-analyses [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref>]. Almost all of these studies investigated treatments designed for specific disorders. Attempts have also been made to develop transdiagnostic CBT (i.e. the same treatment protocol is used regardless of the diagnosis) [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In a separate report from the present trial [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] we showed that it is possible to design group therapy for common mental disorders in primary care, and that this therapy is promising as a basic treatment for mild to moderate symptoms. Two transdiagnostic group treatments, CBT and a multimodal intervention (MMI), were compared with usual care for patients with anxiety, depressive, and stress-related disorders in a randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome measure was the mental component summary score (MCS) of the Short Form 36 health survey questionnaire (SF-36) [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Both treatments were significantly better than usual care, and MMI was more effective than CBT. On the secondary outcome measures (symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress), only MMI showed significantly larger improvements than usual care. The effects persisted during a one-year follow-up.</p><p>With regard to sick leave, previous research on the effects of psychosocial interventions gives a mixed impression. Whereas a small number of studies have demonstrated positive effects on reducing sick leave [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref>], several studies have reported no or small effects [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], or even a negative effect [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Because of the effects we have found on symptoms and quality of life by group therapy with a transdiagnostic approach, we expected to find a decrease in sick leave by these interventions. The purpose of the present study was thus to investigate whether CBT or MMI, compared with usual care, can reduce sick-leave days for patients with common mental problems in primary care. Since there is conflicting evidence as to whether psychosocial interventions focusing on symptoms also have an effect on work ability, this study should add valuable knowledge to this issue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="ss2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="ss3"><title>Design and main outcome</title><p>The study was a randomized controlled trial with three conditions including usual care and two different group treatments, CBT and MMI. The main outcome in the present study was the odds of being sick-listed, compared with usual care, at different times relative to randomization.</p></sec><sec id="ss4"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients aged 18&#x02013;-65 years with symptoms of depression, anxiety, somatoform disorders, or stress, attending a large primary health care centre in Stockholm, Sweden, with approximately 30 000 enlisted individuals were recruited by the GPs. Patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria for bipolar or psychotic disorders, severe personality disorders, or at high risk of suicidal behaviours were excluded.</p><p>The working situation and sick-listing status of patients were not criteria in the recruitment process of participants to this study.</p></sec><sec id="ss5"><title>Data collection</title><p>The 278 patients who were referred to the study underwent a structured clinical interview in order to obtain DSM-IV diagnoses; background data and measures on quality of life and psychological symptoms were collected. Sick-listing data were obtained from the Social Insurance Agency (SIA). If the length of the sick leave was shorter than two weeks no information was available from the SIA, and these sick leave periods are thus not included. Sick leave was measured as the number of whole days (part-time sick leave was transformed to whole days by multiplying number of days by degree of sick leave) during a period of 30 days. For each month, from 24 months before randomization to 24 months after, the number of sick-leave days was calculated as the sum during the preceding 30 days, disregarding the type of benefit. The benefits included, besides sickness benefit, qualifying days of sickness/waiting period, sick pay from employer, rehabilitation allowance, preventive sickness benefit, and occupational injury benefit. Individuals who received permanent or temporary disability pension at any time during the study period, before or after the randomization, were excluded as it was unlikely that this situation would be influenced by the interventions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the selection of patients for the present study. Of the 278 referred patients, 33 were excluded or declined to participate. Of the remaining 245 patients, 42 received disability pension and were excluded. Another 39 were excluded from the analyses since their SIA sick days did not include sick pay from the employer (they were unemployed and/or running their own business). The remaining 164 patients comprised the study group, with sick leave periods of at least two weeks in length. Forty-six patients had no sick days registered at the SIA during the four-year period.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Flow-chart of how patients were recruited.

The randomization was computer-generated. For the allocation to one of the three groups an e-mail with a code number was sent to a statistician not involved in conducting the study.</p><p>Group CBT was based on generally accepted cognitive and behavioural treatment principles from the domain of anxiety and mood disorders with a transdiagnostic approach, i.e. using the same treatment protocol regardless of the diagnosis [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There was one 120-minute group session per week for 12 weeks, led by one of two psychologists. The sessions included conceptualizations of the problems and the role of thoughts and behaviours; rationales for exposure interventions and behavioural activation; exposure to feared stimuli and emotional awareness training; and finally acquiring new skills in order to prevent relapse.</p><p>MMI was a group intervention following a protocol created by one of the authors (RS) consisting of a mix of existing group interventions and exercises utilized in a variety of therapeutic schools. The group intervention comprised 150-minute group sessions twice a week for six weeks, led by one of three assistant nurses. The main components of the first week's sessions were a unified goal-setting among the group members, and psycho-education about thoughts, emotions, and behaviours that are common in persons with depressive and anxiety symptoms. During the second week the participants were introduced to an exercise in which one participant shared a personal problem with the group and obtained feedback. The focus was also on the importance of physical training, and participants were taught to do a few yoga exercises. The focus of the third and fourth weeks was on understanding the difference between emotions and thoughts, and strategies on how to deal with conflicts. During the fifth week the participants were asked to invite important people in their lives to attend two sessions to work on team building. During the sixth week, strategies for handling difficult thoughts and emotions in highly stressful situations were presented. Following group therapy, each participant also had two additional individual sessions with the assistant nurse to discuss individual goals that would be set prior to group therapy. The assistant nurses had no formal psychotherapeutic education and their training prior to this study was to take part in an MMI group treatment as a member and subsequently as an observer. All three received weekly supervision from the originator of MMI or a group therapist.</p><p>Participants in the usual care group were not offered group therapy. Their GPs prescribed medication and sick-listing when necessary and could refer to psychosocial counselling in primary health care and more rarely to a psychiatric clinic.</p><p>None of the interventions had a specific focus on work ability.</p></sec><sec id="ss7"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>A mixed model to analyse the effect of treatment and time was not considered useful as the residuals were not normally distributed, the number of days of sick leave per month usually being 0 or 30 days. Our primary outcome measure was therefore defined as odds (odds ratios, OR) for being sick-listed or not in a comparison between groups at different points in time, adjusted for whether one was sick-listed before the start of the trial. In this analysis, an individual was considered as being sick-listed during a certain time period if he or she had at least one day of payment administered by the SIA. For the purpose of visualizing the time trends in sick days we showed graphically the mean number of total days registered as sick leave by SIA for the three study groups.</p><p>An independent statistical company (Statisticon AB) performed the analyses on behalf of the authors.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="ss8"><title>Results</title><p>Most participants were women of average to high educational level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table I</xref>).

We found a uniform pattern with an increase in the number of sick days before the date of randomization, followed by a decrease during the follow-up period for all groups. The odds for being sick-listed at different times after randomization showed no group effect with the exception of higher odds for CBT compared with usual care at 24 months. This latter finding should be interpreted with caution as it was restricted to one of three measurement points with a low significance level in a context of multiple comparisons.</p><p>The results seem to indicate that a reduction in psychological symptoms and an increased quality of life among patients with common psychological problems is not enough to reduce the risk of being sick-listed. An alternative or complementary strategy is the use of interventions targeting the working situation and/or workplace. There is some evidence that a combination of the two approaches may be beneficial [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, empirical evidence concerning the effects of workplace interventions on work ability or sickness absence seems to be rather scarce. A meta-analysis from 2009 covering randomized controlled trials on the effects of workplace interventions concluded that, due to a lack of good studies, the issue is unclear regarding mental health problems [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A recent literature review [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] focused on mental health problems and included different outcomes related to return to work. There was some evidence that workplace-based interventions had the potential to affect work absence duration and other outcome measures such as work functioning. The included studies used different ways to combine psychotherapeutic treatment with work-related actions and it is unclear how different components should ideally be combined, and which procedures are best suited for different types of mental problems. We are currently testing a combined model in primary care, designed for patients on sick leave for mental problems. One to three workplace visits by a psychologist are combined with CBT treatment in a clinical setting. Also, MMI in combination with work-related intervention has been used with good preliminary results.</p><p>The strengths of the study are the randomized design and the availability of registry data on sick leave for all participants. An important limitation is that the study was not designed primarily for addressing the sick-listing issue, and we can therefore not evaluate its statistical power in this respect; being sick-listed was not an inclusion criterion, which probably reduced the study's ability to demonstrate effects of psychosocial interventions on sick leave. It could also have been useful to include measures other than days on sick-leave, e.g. self-reported work ability, as in the Work Ability Index [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Other limitations are the small number of therapists (two and three respectively), which restricts the generalizability to other settings, and differences between CBT and MMI in terms of, for example, total therapy time.</p><p>To summarize, group psychosocial interventions designed for patients with common mental problems within primary care showed no more reduction in sick-leave days than was achieved with usual care.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the Regional Ethics Committee of Stockholm (Dnr 2005/447-3; 2009/833-32).</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The trial was funded by the Stockholm County Council.</p><p><bold>Declaration of interest</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflict of interest.
