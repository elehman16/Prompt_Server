Unsurprisingly, mental health complaints including burnout, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression are quite common in nurses <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Impaired mental health can have adverse effects endangering the health and safety of the nurses themselves but also of their patients <xref rid="bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr">[3,4]</xref>. Consequently, it seems worthwhile to pay preventive attention to the mental health and work functioning of nurses.</p><p>One promising preventive tool may be a mental module for workers' health surveillance (WHS). WHS can be used to identify and treat health complaints relevant to work and it should be an essential component of programs aimed at the protection of employees <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In The Netherlands, employers are obliged to periodically offer employees the opportunity to undergo a medical examination targeted toward preventing or limiting the risks for the employees' work-related health. A job-specific assessment should be applied to tailor the interventions to detected work functioning impairments <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Attention has been paid to the occupational hazards of health care employees, but WHS targeting work functioning as well as mental health of nurses and allied health professionals has not been studied in this way.</p><p>We have developed a self-help e-mental health (EMH) approach to a mental module for WHS, consisting of online screening on impaired work functioning and impaired mental health followed by personalized online feedback and online tailored advice combined with access to self-help EMH interventions. Online screening offers a practical and efficient method to screen for self-reported impaired work functioning and impaired mental health. Several EMH interventions are available as subsequent interventions. Self-help EMH interventions may offer some advantages over face-to-face health care, e.g., they can be followed in a self-chosen time and place and at one's own pace. Research has shown that unguided self-help EMH interventions have positive outcomes for a variety of mental health aspects <xref rid="bib7 bib8" ref-type="bibr">[7,8]</xref>. However, their effects on work functioning have not been studied in a specific working population such as nurses and allied health professionals. Moreover, EMH interventions have thus far only been offered as stand-alone interventions for a specific common mental disorder. In our study, we offer a choice of EMH interventions, tailored to the specific complaints as indicated by the individual's screening results.</p><p>We have studied the EMH approach to WHS in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Because we applied a waiting-list design for the control group (i.e., the control group was enrolled in the EMH approach to WHS after completion of the trial), we had the opportunity to study the pre- and posteffects of the EMH approach in a larger group of participants. For this study, we have focused on three outcomes: impaired work functioning, stress complaints, and work-related fatigue. We have chosen stress complaints and work-related fatigue as outcome measures because we consider them to form a generic and encompassing measure of mental health in health care employees. In this study, we addressed the following research question: Does our EMH approach to WHS improve work functioning, stress, and work-related fatigue in hospital nurses and allied health professionals?</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The study participants originated from two study arms of a previous RCT performed in 2011 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The study population for this trial was formed by all nurses, including surgical nurses and anesthetic nurses, and allied health professionals (such as physiotherapists and radiotherapists) employed at one academic hospital in The Netherlands. Because the trial regarded a preventive study, participants were included if they were not, or were not expecting to be, on sick leave for &#x0003e;&#x000a0;2 weeks at baseline. The Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Medical Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands approved the study. All participants gave their written informed consent prior to taking part. Participation rate of the RCT at baseline was 32%.</p><p>In the original EMH approach group, 178 participants filled out the baseline questionnaire and were offered the intervention. Participants from the control group who filled out the last follow-up questionnaire 6 months after baseline were offered the same intervention as the original EMH approach group. They were also asked if we could contact them again in future. Those who agreed (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;117) were invited to complete an extra follow-up questionnaire 3 months after the last RCT follow-up questionnaire. The original EMH approach group and the original control group were then combined to study the effect of offering an EMH approach to WHS in a pre-post design. The scores that were used for this single-group pretest&#x02013;posttest study are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>. The outcome measures were assessed using online questionnaires.</p><p>Thus, in total, 295 participants filled out the pretest questionnaire and were invited for the posttest questionnaire. Forty-three percent (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;128) also filled out the posttest questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention consisted of three parts. (1) Participants were screened on impaired work functioning (seven subscales) and impaired mental health (stress, work-related fatigue, risky drinking behavior, depression including suicide risk, anxiety including panic disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder) using the pretest questionnaire (see G&#x000e4;rtner et&#x000a0;al <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> for information on the instruments and cutoff points that were used). (2) All participants received automatically generated personalized feedback on screening results, onscreen and by e-mail. (3) The personalized feedback was followed by online tailored advice, consisting of an invitation to follow an EMH intervention and (if applicable) the receipt of an onscreen educational leaflet with advice per subscale on how to improve work functioning. In <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> an overview is given of the algorithm used for tailoring the advice.</p><p>The EMH interventions that were used are self-help interventions on the Internet aimed at reducing specific mental health complaints or enhancing wellbeing: (1) Psyfit <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, aimed at enhancing mental fitness; (2) Strong at work <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, aimed at gaining insight into work stress and learning skills to cope with it; (3) Color Your Life <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, aimed at tackling depressive symptoms; (4) Don't Panic Online <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, aimed at reducing panic symptoms for subclinical and mild cases of panic disorder; and (5) Drinking Less <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, aimed at reducing risky drinking behavior.</p><p>The interventions are mainly based on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and combine a variety of aspects, e.g., providing information and advice, weekly assignments, and a forum to get in contact with others with similar complaints. The EMH interventions were developed as stand-alone interventions by the Trimbos Institute (Netherlands Institute of Mental Health and Addiction, Utrecht, The Netherlands) at an earlier stage. In separate trials, Psyfit, Colour your Life, and Drinking Less have had positive outcomes <xref rid="bib7 bib8 bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr">[7,8,15,16]</xref>.</p><p>Few participants in the original EMH approach group had logged onto an EMH intervention <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

<xref rid="bib25 bib26 bib27" ref-type="bibr">[25&#x02013;27]</xref>, the participant characteristics are shown. Most participants were female and employed as a nurse, and had a permanent position at the hospital. Three quarters of the participants screened positive at pretest on impaired work functioning or impaired mental health, or both.</p><p>All participants received online feedback on their personal screening results. The 75 participants (59%) who screened positive on impaired work functioning received the onscreen educational leaflet with advice on how to improve their work functioning. All participants were offered access to EMH interventions: 55 participants (43%) screened negative on impaired mental health and were offered access to Psyfit, whereas 73 participants (57%) screened positive and were offered access to EMH interventions tailored to their screening results. Twenty percent (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;26) of the participants logged on at least once to an EMH intervention. Three of these participants logged on to two EMH interventions. Twenty-three participants logged on to Psyfit, four logged on to Strong at Work, and two logged on to Color Your Life. Nine participants followed an EMH intervention to some extent: eight partly followed Psyfit and one partly followed Color Your Life. No one completed an EMH intervention.</p><p>As shown in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;3</xref>, the score on impaired work functioning decreased from 12 to 11 after the intervention of screening, personalized online feedback, and online advice plus access to EMH interventions (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01). Thirty percent of the participants had relevantly improved work functioning at posttest. When looking specifically at the subgroup of participants who had logged onto an EMH intervention, the decrease in score on impaired work functioning is also statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.04).</p><p>The score on stress decreased between pre- and posttest (from 6 to 5), but this difference was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.10). The effect size was &#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.2; thus, the effect does not seem meaningful. In the subgroup who logged onto an EMH intervention, the score regarding stress also decreased nonsignificantly (from 7 to 5, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.27). However, in this subgroup the effect size was 0.23, indicating a small effect.</p><p>Regarding work-related fatigue, the score significantly decreased after the intervention (from 35 to 29, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01). In the subgroup of participants who logged onto an EMH intervention, the score also decreased, although nonsignificant. The effect size in both the total group and the subgroup was &#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.2.</p><p>Regarding all three outcomes, the subgroup of participants who had logged on at least once to an EMH intervention scored worse than the total group, both at pretest and at posttest. However, they also showed a larger improvement over time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>A mental module for WHS, consisting of online screening on impaired work functioning and impaired mental health followed by personalized online feedback and online tailored advice combined with access to self-help EMH interventions, led to a statistically significant improvement of work functioning and work-related fatigue and had a small meaningful positive effect on stress in nurses and allied health professionals.</p><p>In this study, the outcomes of interest were work functioning and mental health of nurses and allied health professionals. The effects of WHS regarding these outcomes have not been studied before. This is an important approach, because ultimately occupational health care aims to keep employees functioning well and as healthy as possible.</p><p>We used the waiting-list control group of our previous RCT to enlarge the group of participants of the EMH approach to WHS, and especially the group of participants who had participated at pretest as well as posttest. By doing so, we were able to increase our certainty about the effects of the mental module for WHS on several outcomes. Furthermore, because we studied the effects in participants who had a score on pretest as well as posttest, our results are not obscured because of the intention-to-treat principle and thus show the maximum effect that the mental module for WHS has had on those employees who decided to participate in our study. From our previously performed RCT, we know that the control group (who had not yet received the intervention at that time) improved over time <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, a reduction of complaints is not uncommon in RCT control groups and in our study could have stemmed from filling out questionnaires on work functioning and mental health, making people aware of their mental health state even if they did not receive feedback on screening results and subsequent interventions.</p><p>Because only few of the participants in the original EMH approach group logged onto an EMH intervention <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, we slightly adapted the wording of the personalized feedback and the information about the offered EMH interventions for the original control group, for encouragement to follow an EMH intervention. Using <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses, we did not find statistically significant differences between the original EMH approach group and the original control group on pre- and posttest.</p><p>All participants received personalized online feedback and an offer to follow one or more EMH interventions. We found a statistically significant improvement of work functioning, and the work functioning of 30% of the participants in this study had relevantly improved after 3 months. In addition, we found a statistically significant improvement of work-related fatigue, although the size of this effect did not seem meaningful because the effect size was &#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.2. Regarding stress, we also found a small, but not statistically significant, improvement over time. Therefore, it seems that the WHS has an effect on work-related outcomes, but not on the more general outcome of stress. Participants who screened positive on impaired work functioning not only received access to one or more EMH interventions, but also an onscreen educational leaflet with advice on how to improve their work functioning. Although we are not sure whether these participants read and applied the advice, it might have generated a positive effect on the work-related outcomes.</p><p>As stated earlier, the work functioning of 30% of the participants in this study had relevantly improved after 3 months, comparable to what we found in the EMH approach group (30%) and the control group (32%) in the RCT that we performed previously. After 6 months compared to baseline, this percentage was still comparable in the control group (30%), but a larger percentage of the EMH approach group (40%) had improved their work functioning <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. It might take longer than 3 months to achieve a clinically relevant improvement in the majority of health care employees. It is conceivable that it takes time to apply advice to work activities and discuss it with a supervisor.</p><p>The subgroup of participants who had logged on at least once to an EMH intervention scored worse than the total group on all outcomes, both at pre- and posttest. However, they also showed a larger improvement over time, indicating that people who felt relatively worse or received online feedback indicating more impairments were more inclined to try the EMH intervention that they were offered and possibly benefitted more from it. However, the EMH interventions were not followed by many participants, because only 26 employees who fully participated in this pretest&#x02013;posttest study logged onto an intervention. In this subgroup, we found a small positive effect on stress; although it was not statistically significant, it can be considered a meaningful effect. Therefore, to target stress, logging onto an EMH intervention seems a valuable addition to the mental module for WHS. However, the low compliance to the EMH interventions should be addressed. Several reasons may underlie the low compliance. First, because our study regarded a preventive setting, we think that the perceived need of our participants was insufficient to motivate them to log onto and follow an EMH intervention. This idea is supported by findings in other studies <xref rid="bib28 bib29" ref-type="bibr">[28,29]</xref>. Second, some of the participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5) reported problems with logging onto the interventions due to technical problems and/or inadequate computer skills, which might have posed a problem for more participants. A third explanation might be that the channeling from the personalized online feedback toward the EMH interventions might not have been attractive enough to encourage participants to follow an EMH intervention. Finally, we offered several fitting EMH interventions to leave room for personal preferences. Most participants had to decide whether they wanted to follow an EMH intervention, but also determine which one to use. This might have made the option to not participate more attractive.</p><p>Although the EMH interventions were only followed by a small number of participants and only to a small extent, we did find positive results. It seems plausible that undergoing screening and receiving personalized online feedback plus tailored advice when needed form an intervention in itself, as it might encourage thoughts about one's own work functioning and mental health and to seek help if needed.</p><p>To ensure that health care employees stay mentally healthy and well-functioning, preventive strategies should be put in place to identify impaired work functioning or impaired mental health early and to offer tailored support. We recommend setting up and periodically performing WHS for nurses and allied health professionals. If available, occupational health services form a natural platform for WHS. To improve the mental module, we suggest exploring the possibilities of blended care by incorporating guidance by a health care provider, to increase compliance and to check whether the EMH intervention is of added value for the specific employee. Additionally, we recommend adapting the screening to a stepwise method, starting with a general and short screening. The health care provider could perform further specific screening (if needed) and provide feedback. Furthermore, more attention is needed to increase the attractiveness of the EMH interventions, e.g., by applying elements of persuasive design.</p><p>In summary, an EMH approach to WHS improves work functioning and mental health of nurses and allied health professionals. However, because effects were small and participation in the EMH interventions was low, there is ample room for improvement.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>The e-mental health interventions used in this study are stand-alone interventions which were developed by the Trimbos Institute at an earlier stage.
