CAD106 demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, while evoking a strong serological response in up to 81% of patients who received CAD106 450&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g.</p><p>CAD106 avoids activation of A&#x003b2;-reactive T-cells by using a small N-terminal A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;6</sub> peptide. No occurrences of meningoencephalitis, autoimmune disease, CNS inflammation, or A&#x003b2;-specific T-cell responses were observed. The incidence of SAEs, headache, hypertension, and pyrexia was higher in the CAD106 total group versus the placebo group. SAEs in the placebo group (6.7%, 95% CI 0.2%, 31.9%) were less frequent than expected based on the incidence observed in placebo groups from similar but much larger trials (19.9% and 20.6% <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>). In contrast with previous CAD106 studies, several cases of ARIA occurred in the treated group, and these individuals had all developed a strong serological response. Reports of ARIA may be related to the higher CAD106 dose (450&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) or adjuvants used in the present study compared to previous studies (CAD106 doses of 50 and 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g without adjuvant), or the higher number of subjects in this trial, all undergoing scheduled T2* MRI sequence required to detect ARIA-H. All six cases were detected at scheduled MRI scans and all were asymptomatic. Patients with more than one or two (depending on MRI field strength) microhemorrhages (a known risk factor for ARIA) were excluded from the study, which may have limited new treatment&#x02013;emergent ARIA.</p><p>Reproducible and sustained antibody responses were observed from the second injection in a dose-dependent manner <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The antibody response was measured in units in relation to a reference polyclonal rhesus serum, rather than in titer units calculated based on serial dilutions of tested samples as often done for other vaccines (such as AN1792). The approach used in the current study allowed for efficient quantification of a large number of samples in the course of CAD106 development. A direct comparison of the immune response to that evoked by other vaccines with respect to level of antibody titers or number of responders is not warranted as it does not take into account the difference in the quality (e.g., epitopes, affinity, IgG subtypes) of the induced antibodies. For CAD106, the serological responder criteria were set with the aim to identify subjects with persistent and high antibody response. Only SSRs showed an increase in total plasma A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;40</sub>, an indicator of peripheral biological activity of the antibodies. This suggests that the criteria for defining the responder groups were set appropriately.</p><p>Doubling of antibody titers was observed following an increase of dose of CAD106 from 150 to 450&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, but no increase was seen following addition of either adjuvants alum or MF59. However, tolerability was improved when alum was added to CAD106 450&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g. Alum is well established as an adjuvant in prophylactic vaccines with no serious safety issues <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Based on tolerability and immunogenicity, CAD106 450&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g with alum 450&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g was deemed the best combination to induce optimal A&#x003b2;-IgG titers with an acceptable tolerability profile which led to the selection of this CAD106 dose and adjuvant for future studies.</p><p>In an exploratory analysis in a subgroup of patients who underwent <sup>18</sup>F-florbetapir PET, the percentage change in PET SUVR correlated inversely with A&#x003b2;-IgG titers over the 78-week period. However, a direct comparison between the SSR and the NR/placebo groups did not yield a significant difference. The difference between the correlational and the categorical analysis can be explained by the wide spread of antibody titers within the SSR group and the small number of subjects in the NR/placebo group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4).</p><p>For the brain volumetric measures, a statistically significant decrease in cortical gray-matter volumes was observed in biomarker-positive SSRs versus controls. An apparent decrease in brain volume has already been reported for two other anti-amyloid immunotherapies, AN1792 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and bapineuzumab <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The interpretation of the decrease critically depends on whether it results from a volume reduction in the interstitial, neuronal, glial, or any other constituent. Although the antibody response against A&#x003b2; correlated with the decrease in amyloid load, there was no such relation with the decrease in cerebral volume. Hence, the absence of correlation makes a direct causal effect of the antibody response unlikely. The changes in cortical volume in CAD106 SSRs could theoretically have affected the longitudinal measure of change in amyloid load (SUVR) but this also requires further investigation.</p><p>Numerically, the decline in MMSE was larger in the biomarker-positive SSRs compared to controls. However, this did not reach statistical significance and was not supported by results in any of the other clinical scales or correlations to antibody titers. In addition, the small total sample size, and specifically the small control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;14), and the imbalance between the two groups implicate that the numerical difference is of no significance. When the actively treated group was compared to the placebo group in the full analysis set, the longitudinal change in MMSE (&#x02212;3.5) was identical between groups (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table&#x000a0;11</xref>).</p><p>This phase 2 study has limitations. The study design was complicated by the fact that the study was carried out in two semi-overlapping cohorts, where CAD106 was administered with or without an adjuvant (alum or MF59). Furthermore, the study was put on a temporary clinical hold for 2&#x02013;6&#x000a0;months due to the occurrence of one unrelated case of intracerebral hemorrhage. This temporary hold has impacted the dosing regimen for some patients in cohort 2 who did not receive the fourth injection. Finally, patients who did not develop a significant antibody response, as well as matching placebo patients, were withdrawn from the study per protocol. All these factors render the results more difficult to interpret. As a further limitation, amyloid PET SUVR, brain volume, and clinical scale variables were exploratory end points, not powered for significance or adjusted for multiplicity. The small sample size limits the sensitivity for detecting a biological effect and prevents robust conclusions from being made. However, the reduction of amyloid PET SUVR observed in this study is consistent with CNS activity for induced antibodies and the expected mode of action of CAD106.</p><p>In conclusion, this phase 2 study met its primary objectives: CAD106 elicited an A&#x003b2;-specific immune response with CNS activity and an acceptable safety profile. Amyloid PET provided preliminary evidence suggestive of target engagement. The relationship between CAD106-induced A&#x003b2;-IgG antibody titers and clinical efficacy needs to be determined in larger studies, possibly targeting an earlier stage of the disease.<boxed-text id="dtbox1"><caption><title>Research in Context</title></caption><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0010"><label>1.</label><p>Systematic review: We searched PubMed, with the terms &#x0201c;Alzheimer,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;immunotherapy&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;immunization,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;clinical trial.&#x0201d; The AN1792 trial was aborted because of meningoencephalitis.
