All other statistical analyses are descriptive only. The full analysis set (FAS) was used for all efficacy data, except radiographic data which used the radiographic set (RAD).

These data demonstrate that CZP+MTX combination therapy results in a significantly higher proportion of patients achieving sREM than those treated with PBO+MTX, even when using a &#x02018;treat-to-tolerance&#x02019; dosing strategy for MTX. Significant improvements in physical function and inhibition of structural damage were observed for CZP+MTX patients. Consequently, for patients with poor prognostic factors for severe disease progression, treating early and aggressively may represent a unique opportunity to achieve maximal clinical benefit.</p><p>Advances in the treatment options for RA, including DMARDs and biologic DMARDs/anti-TNFs, have made clinical remission and radiographic non-progression an achievable target.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In this study, MTX titration was an important component of treatment and ensured that each patient received the maximum-tolerated MTX dose within the first 8&#x02005;weeks (between &#x02265;15 and &#x02264;25&#x02005;mg/week), which we refer to as optimised MTX. To our knowledge, there are no previous studies in MTX-na&#x000ef;ve or DMARD-na&#x000ef;ve patients with RA where MTX doses have been optimised per-protocol to the levels achieved in C-EARLY. This optimisation may have been responsible, in part, for the response observed for the PBO+MTX and CZP+MTX arms. Optimisation of MTX is not specifically stated in treat-to-target guidelines; however, the mean doses achieved are consistent with international recommendations.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>In addition to sREM, this study also evaluated the rate of remission using alternative remission criteria, including DAS28(ESR), CDAI, SDAI and ACR/EULAR criteria, with superior results consistently observed for CZP+MTX over PBO+MTX, supporting the reliability of the recently validated ACR/EULAR remission definition.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In the C-EARLY trial, despite receiving optimised MTX, a significant proportion of patients were not in remission at Week 52 and an even smaller proportion achieved the primary outcome of sREM. Although patients generally responded well to MTX, which is expected in a DMARD-na&#x000ef;ve population of patients, they responded significantly better to CZP, confirming the clinical relevance of our findings.</p><p>Treatment of patients very early in the pathogenesis of disease is associated with significantly reduced joint destruction and better clinical outcomes.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The analysis of radiographic data in C-EARLY demonstrates that CZP+MTX therapy can inhibit structural damage significantly more than MTX alone&#x02014;the percentage of patients with radiographic non-progression was significantly higher in the CZP+MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX group. These results are consistent with the C-OPERA trial in Japanese patients with early RA, which showed that CZP+MTX treatment results in greater inhibition of structural damage and higher clinical remission rates than PBO+MTX.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>While DAS(ESR)&#x0003c;2.6 is a validated measure of clinical remission, consensus has not yet been reached on what constitutes sREM. Until now, the two RA clinical trials that have used sREM as the primary endpoint chose two different definitions. These trials were an open-label study evaluating etanercept tapering<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and an open-label study evaluating abatacept withdrawal.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> We defined sREM as DAS(ESR) &#x0003c;2.6 at Weeks 40 and 52 of treatment. The use of two time points 12&#x02005;weeks apart was meant to reflect RA management goals used in real-world clinical practice.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>The rates of sREM observed in C-EARLY (28.9% for the CZP+MTX arm) were lower than those initially estimated in the power analysis, which were based on Week 52 remission rates of the etanercept COMET trial (50%).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This is most likely a consequence of the use of sREM, which is a more rigorous endpoint than clinical remission; this is supported by C-EARLY Week 52 remission rates (42% for the CZP+MTX arm), which were comparable with the remission rates observed in COMET.</p><p>Overall, the results from C-EARLY suggest that it is possible to achieve sREM more frequently with combined CZP+MTX treatment than with MTX alone in DMARD-na&#x000ef;ve patients with RA. Consistent with our results, other studies have demonstrated greater efficacy of anti-TNFs in combination with MTX in early RA. These have included infliximab+MTX,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> adalimumab+MTX,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> etanercept+MTX<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and golimumab+MTX.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>No new safety signals for CZP+MTX were observed and there was no increase in infection relative to other anti-TNFs in equivalent patient populations with RA.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> No increase in overall AEs, SAEs or serious infection events (SIEs) in patients treated with CZP+MTX was seen compared with PBO+MTX. As patients were DMARD-na&#x000ef;ve (including MTX) at study entry, their tolerance to MTX treatment could not be anticipated. Thus, the incidence of AEs observed in this study may be partly attributed to the optimised MTX dose. The IR of SIEs with CZP+MTX in this study (3.3/100&#x02005;PY) was comparable with those reported for other anti-TNFs in combination with MTX in similar patient populations with early RA: adalimumab+MTX (2.9/100&#x02005;PY)<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x000a0;and infliximab+MTX (5.4/100&#x02005;PY).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The single CZP-related death in this study occurred in a 65-year-old patient of Indian origin, with hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The patient died of cardiorespiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome, secondary to septic shock caused by bowel perforations. Acid-fast bacillus stains of the gut and saliva were positive. This, in conjunction with the gut pathology, led to a diagnosis of disseminated, non-characterised, mycobacterium infection; the QuantiFERON test was negative and there was no PCR confirmation of TB.</p><p>We conclude that there is a positive benefit&#x02013;risk ratio associated with CZP treatment in combination with MTX as initial therapy in DMARD-na&#x000ef;ve patients within a year of diagnosis of severe, active RA. The beneficial effect of earlier treatment with biologics specifically in patients with poor prognostic factors may be an important consideration in determining the timing of treatment initiation in specific subgroups of patients. Of note, an aggressive combination of CZP with a &#x02018;treat-to-tolerance&#x02019; strategy for MTX at an early stage of disease may contribute to overcome the currently perceived &#x02018;efficacy ceiling&#x02019; for anti-TNFs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Correction notice:</bold> This article has been corrected since it was published Online First.
