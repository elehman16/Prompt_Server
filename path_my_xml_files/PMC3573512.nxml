Externalized traits of temperament are associated with higher serum UA levels both in men and women.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Epidemiological studies suggest that psychosocial factors contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Serum uric acid (SUA), a molecule which plays an important and complex role in oxidative and anti-oxidative processes has been reported to positively correlated with CVD and various measures of psychosocial stress,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] especially in high risk patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>Epidemiological studies have shown that increased levels of physical activity reduce the incidence of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related deaths.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Although the mechanisms responsible for this benefit are not fully understood, exercise is known to have favorable effects on such traditional risk factors as elevated blood pressure (BP), hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia.

To the best of our knowledge, there are few large randomized controlled trials investigating the association between exercise training, SUA and psychosocial status in hypertension, and of those few studies, none has investigated these effects on pure black African population. However, heredity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] and genetical[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] factors have been implicated in the causative of hypertension; also there is possibility that apoliprotein (apo) E, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), interleukin-6 (IL-6) genotype[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) genotype effect in responses to exercise and physical activity in hypertension.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Also, SUA level is affected by age and by genetic and environmental factors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] These interpersonal and interracial differences clearly indicate the needs for study on pure older black African population.
