Postoperative pain is a major cause of fear and anxiety in hospitalized patients. On the other hand, if patients remain pain-free during this period, they can cooperate with the circumstances well, leading to early recovery.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Relief of pain is not only a humanitarian consideration but also an important means for reduction of morbidity and mortality. Over the last two decades, there has been considerable revival of interest in the use of regional anesthesia techniques for surgery and pain management. Ropivacaine was approved for the intrathecal route by the European Union in February 2004 and has consistently demonstrated an improved safety profile over bupivacaine with a reduced central nervous system (CNS) and cardiotoxic potential,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] together with a wide clinical utility at different doses and for a wide range of indications.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Subarachnoid block with local anesthetics such as bupivacaine and ropivacaine is a commonly used anesthetic technique in elective infraumbilical surgeries. It not only provides adequate intraoperative anesthesia but also effective pain relief in the initial postoperative period; however when its effect wears off, patient starts experiencing pain. The local anesthetics act by blocking sodium channels to relieve pain. Nowadays, use of intrathecal adjuvants have gained popularity for prolonging the duration and quality of block. Spinal anesthesia's quality has been reported to be improved by adding opioids (such as morphine, fentanyl, and sufentanil) and other drugs (such as dexmedetomidine, clonidine, magnesium sulfate [MgSO<sub>4</sub>], neostigmine, ketamine, and midazolam), but no drug to inhibit nociception is without associated adverse effects. Magnesium[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] blocks calcium influx and noncompetitively antagonizes N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channels leading to analgesia and can cause side effects of nausea, vomiting, and hypotension at higher doses. Dexmedetomidine[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] acts as an agonist on &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> receptor found in the peripheral and CNSs. Stimulation of the receptors in the brain and spinal cord inhibits neuronal firing, causing hypotension, bradycardia, sedation, and analgesia whereas the analgesic action of intrathecal &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist is by depressing the release of C-fiber transmitters and by hyperpolarization of postsynaptic dorsal horn neurons. This antinociceptive effect may explain the prolongation of sensory block when added to spinal anesthetics. The prolongation of the motor block of spinal anesthetics may result from the binding of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor agonists to motor neurons in the dorsal horn.</p><p>As very few studies have been conducted using cardio stable drug ropivacaine with dexmedetomidine and MgSO<sub>4</sub> as adjuvant, the present study was undertaken with primary aims to compare the hemodynamic stability, onset and duration of sensory and motor block and with secondary aims of postoperative analgesic effect of dexmedetomidine (10 &#x000b5;g) and 75 mg of MgSO<sub>4</sub> given intrathecally along with 0.75% ropivacaine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>After getting Institutional Ethics Committee approval, this prospective randomized, double-blind study was conducted on fifty patients of the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical Status I and II aged between 20 and 65 years of either sex admitted in Guru Nanak Dev Hospital, Amritsar scheduled to undergo infraumbilical surgeries under spinal anesthesia. Patient's unwillingness, coagulation disorders, neurological disorders, morbid obesity, any life-threatening disease, signs of sepsis, previous injury, deformity or previous surgery of spine, anticipated difficulty in regional anesthesia, allergy to study drug, pregnancy, and lactation were taken as exclusion criteria. Thorough preanesthetic checkup of all patients including all routine investigations was done. The procedure was explained to the patient and written informed consent was taken. Pain visual analog scale (VAS) scores were explained to all patients. Premedication was given as tablet alprazolam 0.25 mg a night before surgery, injection glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg, and injection midazolam 0.04 mg/kg body weight by intravenous route just before the procedure in all the groups.</p><p>Preoperatively, pulse rate and noninvasive systolic and diastolic blood pressure of the patients were recorded. In operation theater, intravenous line was secured with 18-gauge intricate, and all the patients were preloaded with 10 ml/kg body weight of Ringer lactate solution over 15&#x02013;20 min. Multipara monitors were applied, and baseline pulse rate, noninvasive systolic and diastolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded. Patients were put in the lateral decubitus position. After scrubbing, washing and wearing sterile gown and gloves, back of the patient's was cleaned with povidone-iodine scrub and then painted with povidone-iodine solution. The area was draped with sterile sheet. L3 and L4 space was located (in case of difficulty L2 and L3 space). Skin wheal was raised with 2% lignocaine and then with midline approach a 23-gauge spinal needle was inserted in the space. After the free flow of cerebrospinal fluid, drug was injected in the space.</p><p>

</p><p>Sensory block was assessed by the loss of sensation to pinprick in the midline using a 22-gauge blunt hypodermic needle every 3 min interval till no change in level occurred. The degree of motor block was assessed every 3 min for first 30 min by the modified Bromage scale. 0 = No motor blockade, 1 = Inability to raise extended leg but can flex knee, 2 = Inability to flex knee, can flex ankle, and 3 = No movement, unable to flex ankle joint. Motor blockade and sensory blockade were assessed at the end of surgery also. Oxygen was routinely administered through oxygen mask at the rate of 5 L/min.</p><p>Bradycardia (defined as heart rate &#x0003c;60 beats/min) was treated with intravenous atropine 0.5 mg. Hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;20% of baseline value) was treated with intravenous ephedrine as per required and additional Ringer's lactate solution. Operation was started when full surgical anesthesia had developed. In case of failed neuraxial block and total spinal, patient was given general anesthesia and the case was excluded from the study. Continuous multipara meter monitoring (pulse rate, respiratory rate, noninvasive systolic and diastolic blood pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and ECG) was done for hemodynamic response.

These advantages are sometimes offset by a relatively short duration of action and complaints of postoperative pain when effect wears off. Spinal anesthesia with ropivacaine hydrochloride is increasingly being used these days owing to its lack of cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity. The efficacy of local anesthetics can be enhanced using adjuvants such as opioids, &#x003b1;2 agonists, magnesium, neostigmine, ketamine.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Prolongation of the duration of spinal block is desirable both for long procedures and for postoperative pain relief. In our study, we compared the addition of intrathecal magnesium and dexmedetomidine to ropivacaine in terms of onset and regression of sensory and motor block and its hemodynamic profile as well as the side effects. Jabalameli and Pakzadmoghadam[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] compared the effects of adding different doses of intrathecal MgSO<sub>4</sub> for spinal anesthesia in the cesarean section and showed that all doses studied provide safe and effective anesthesia, but 75 mg of this drug increases duration of postoperative analgesia and prolong than sensory and motor block without significant increase in side effects, so we choose 75 mg of magnesium as our test drug. Largest dose of dexmedetomidine used intrathecally in humans was 10 &#x000b5;g. The previous studies revealed hemodynamic stability with 5 and 10 &#x000b5;g of dexmedetomidine as intrathecal adjuvant which was suitable for spinal anesthesia for lower abdominal gynecological surgery. Various studies have reported that 10 &#x000b5;g intrathecal dexmedetomidine is safe and devoid of any neurotoxic side effect; hence, we used 10 &#x000b5;g dexmedetomidine[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] along with 22.5 mg isobaric ropivacaine (0.75%).</p><p>In our study, we found out that onset of sensory block was earlier in Group D in comparison to Group M which was statistically significant. This was supported by a study conducted by Shukla <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Naithani <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] who found rapid onset of surgical anesthesia in dexmedetomidine group (2.27 &#x000b1; 1.09 min) when compared to intrathecal magnesium (6.46 &#x000b1; 1.33 min). Our results were different because we used safer ropivacaine instead of bupivacaine. Dexmedetomidine as such does not speed up the onset of action but in comparison to magnesium is faster, which actually slows the speed of onset. Ozalevli <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] observed a similar delay in onset of spinal anesthesia when adding intrathecal magnesium to fentanyl and isobaric bupivacaine.</p><p>In our study, Group D achieved faster motor block which was again statistically significant when compared to Group M. Similar results have been found by Shukla <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] where dexmedetomidine group took (3.96 &#x000b1; 0.92 min), whereas magnesium group took (7.18 &#x000b1; 1.38 min) with bupivacaine to achieve the desired motor block.</p><p>Sunil <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] with the usage of 10 &#x000b5;g of intrathecal dexmedetomidine with hyperbaric bupivacaine found that there is a quicker onset of sensory and motor block when compared to magnesium. Similar results were given by Al-ghanem[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Malleeswaran <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Reason for this delayed onset of action in magnesium group may be due to change in pH and baricity of bupivacaine due to addition of MgSO<sub>4</sub>.</p><p>In our study, it was observed that addition of dexmedetomidine and magnesium both prolonged the duration of sensory as well as motor block when added to ropivacaine (intrathecally), but prolongation was more in dexmedetomidine group as compared to magnesium group which was statistically significant. This result showed a similar trend as observed by Shukla <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] which showed the regression time of block, both sensory up to T10 dermatome and motor to Bromage 3, was prolonged in Group D (352 &#x000b1; 45 min and 331 &#x000b1; 35 min) and in Group M (265 &#x000b1; 65 min and 251 &#x000b1; 51 min) which was statistically significant. In addition, Sunil <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] showed similar results that the time for regression of sensory block to L1 dermatome and Bromage 0 motor block was significantly prolonged in Group D compared to Group M.</p><p>There was a significant delay in the time to the first rescue analgesia in group receiving intrathecal dexmedetomidine when compared to magnesium and also the mean total dose and times of use of analgesics were also reduced in both group with reduction in dexmedetomidine group significantly more than magnesium group. Similar findings are observed by Mahendru <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Gupta <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Al-Mustafa <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The quality of surgical anesthesia was excellent in both groups in the intraoperative period.
