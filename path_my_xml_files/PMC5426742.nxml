A total of 414 healthy pullets (10 weeks), with similar body weight were randomly distributed into three groups (n = 138) and housed in individual cages for up to 12 weeks of age in light controlled rooms and provided normal lighting schedule (10L:14D). At 12 to 18 weeks of age, pullets were housed in three rooms, having varying lighting schedule viz. G1 (8L: 16D), G2 (10L:14D), or G3 (12L:12D). From 19th week onwards lighting schedule was gradually increased every week in incremental manner till all groups started receiving 16L:8D lighting schedule. The age at first egg, weight of first egg laid, percent peak hen day egg production, concentration of plasma luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormones and expression of genes regulating synthesis or/and secretion of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone-I (GnRH-I), and pituitary LH-&#x003b2; and FSH-&#x003b2; were studied during experimental period (12 to 43 weeks of age) of this study. The result indicated that pullets of long day length (G3) group had higher plasma levels of FSH and LH and also better mRNA expression that regulates synthesis or/and secretion of GnRH-I, FSH-&#x003b2;, and LH-&#x003b2; before egg laying. The age at first egg (151.3 days) in pullets of G3 group receiving longer lighting hours (12L:12D) was 8.8 days less (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) compared to pullets of G1 group, while it was 6.9 days less (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) compared to G2. However, significantly higher (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) plasma levels of LH and FSH in pullets of G1 as compared to pullets belonging to G3 group corresponded with the higher (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) cumulative egg production during the experimental period, while these attributes in G2 group didn&#x02019;t differ from either G1 or G3 groups. Pullets of G1 group had significantly higher levels (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) of GnRH-I, FSH-&#x003b2;, and LH-&#x003b2; mRNA abundances at 43 weeks of age than other two groups and this corresponded with the percent (hen day) peak egg production (75.38%) in pullets in this G1 group that was attained at 32 weeks of age, while the peak production of 71.24% was attained at 30 weeks of age in G3 group. There was no effect of lighting schedule on body weight of pullets, recorded during experimental period, at all occasions; belonging to three groups (G1,G2 and G3) and receiving varying hours of photo-stimulation (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). It was inferred that the optimum lighting schedule for Chinese native breed Pengxian yellow pullets during 10 weeks of pre-pubertal growth period is short hours of photo-stimulation (i.e 8L:16D).</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by China Agriculture Research System (CARS-41), The thirteen Five Year Plan for breeding program in Sichuan (2016NYZ0050).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The age at which pullets sexually mature has a direct influence on their laying performance, and genetic stocks have optimal ages at which they reach sexual maturity to produce the maximum possible egg mass [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Among the numerous factors that can affect the time of sexual maturation, the light program (day length and light intensity) to which a flock of laying hens is subjected during the growth and production phase seems to play a critical role [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Pullets grown in light-proof houses are usually not held on constant day lengths during rearing, but are given some pattern of photoperiods, and most lighting programs have recommended combinations of decreasing and increasing photoperiods during different stages of the pullet&#x02019;s life [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Koelkebeck reported that if leghorn pullets and broiler breeder pullets are grown under an increasing daylength, then sexual maturity will be enhanced which can cause egg production and blowout problems in the layer house. If pullets are grown under a decreasing daylength, then sexual maturity will be delayed [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is common to rear egg-type pullets on 8-h day length until they reach 18 to 20 weeks, followed by initial weekly increments of 30 min or 1 h thereafter to a peak of 14- to 16-h day length, depending on genetics [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, managers should continually evaluate the optimal light stimulation based on age for pullets, even if they are using the same strain, because there is constant selection by breeders.</p><p>When the chicken perceives day length to be sufficient to initiate reproductive development (effective minimum of 11 to 12 h), light energy is converted into nerve impulses in the hypothalamus, where it is translated into hormonal signals [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The extra-retinal photoreceptor and biological clock provide inputs to the final component of the hypothalamic pathways for transduction of photoperiodic information: the neurons synthesize and secrete gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which then stimulates luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion from the pituitary gland [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Until now, only three types of GnRH have been found in avian brain. cGnRH-I is thought to be the main hypophysiotropic factor in the control of gonadotropin (GTH) synthesis and secretion, whereas cGnRH-II may act as neurotransmitter and cGnRH-III as a potential mediator to regulate GTH secretion [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The gonadotropins, FSH and LH are heterodimers that share a common &#x003b1; subunit (GP&#x003b1;) and possess hormone-specific &#x003b2; subunits (FSH-&#x003b2; and LH-&#x003b2;) [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. FSH and LH are known to be key hormones in the control of reproduction and stimulate gonadal steroid production and/or secretion [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. More specifically, LH regulates sex steroid production and ovulation, whereas FSH promotes spermatogenesis and ovarian follicle maturation in chickens and other vertebrates [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Pengxian yellow chickens are a unique native chicken breed from Chengdu Plain, Sichuan Province, China. This chicken breed is widely adaptable and has nutritious meat, but reproductive performances need to be improved. Therefore, to create an optimal light program for the late growth period of Pengxian yellow chickens, the effects of different light programs from 12 to 18 weeks on egg production traits and plasma FSH and LH concentrations, and gene expression of hypothalamic GnRH-I, pituitary LH-&#x003b2;, and FSH-&#x003b2; were determined in the present study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Welfare Committee of Sichuan Agricultural University.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Chicken population</title><p>Four hundred and fourteen healthy Pengxian yellow chicken pullets of similar body weight (1072.2&#x000b1;58.6 g) at 10 weeks of age were divided into three light-controlled rooms (n = 138) and reared in individual cages.

In domestic fowl, the seasonality of reproduction has been eliminated by artificial lighting programs, which not only can induce out-of-season lay to balance production over the year, but can maximize total number of eggs laid during a certain period of time [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The lighting program to which a flock of breeders is subjected during the growth and production phase is a key factor in determining the onset of sexual maturity and egg production, especially during the growth period. Lighting programs (photoperiod, light intensity, wavelength etc.) for pullets kept in confined poultry houses must be designed so as to guarantee optimal growth and efficient preparation for the laying period, largely independent of the season [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In this study, we designed three different lighting programs during the late growth period (12 to 18 weeks) in Pengxian yellow chickens, and found 8L: 16D was the optimal photoperiod, which was consistent with&#x02013;earlier observations that a constant 8 hours of light and 16 hours of dark (8L:16D) during the rearing period (0&#x02013;18 weeks) was the most convenient lighting programme for the egg-type strains [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Light is a major determinant of the timing of sexual maturity in domestic pullets. The age at first egg and laying peak advanced with increased day length during the growth phase in our study; these findings are consistent with those of Lewis et al. (1999), who found that transferring pullets from short to long days tends to stimulate ovarian activity, whereas transferring from long to short days suppresses ovarian development [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally, our results are in accordance with those of Lewis et al (1996), who found that age at first egg can be advanced by approximately 5 weeks if photoperiod is increased from 8 to 13 h at 63 days of age compared with a constant short day length [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our findings are also similar to those of Chen et al (2007), who found that photoperiod had an effect on the timing of sexual maturity, and the AFE was 5.7 days earlier for hens exposed to the 17L:7D photoperiod than those exposed to an 11L:13D photoperiod at 20 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>However, the cumulative egg production during our 43 weeks experimental period was lowest in G3, even though the AFE was the earliest. Not surprisingly, because overall egg size can be manipulated with a lighting program during the rearing period, and advanced sexual maturity would reduce egg mass throughout the laying period because of aging of the reproductive tract and reduction in the rate of recruitment or yellow-yolky follicles as well as an increased incidence of follicular atresia, internal ovulation and the production of membranous or soft shelled eggs [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, egg weight (EW) was lightest in the earliest laying group, which supports the idea that that EW is closely related to AFE [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In our study, no significant differences were observed among the three treatments based on the average live body weights of chickens during the growth period and 43 weeks, which was consistent with the results of Banks and Koen (1998), who did not find a significant effect of lighting system during the growth phase on the average live body weight of birds during the production stage [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, our results regarding the effect of photoperiod on body weight were not consistent with substantial scientific evidence that longer day length during the growth period results in higher feed intakes and heavier body weights, because appetite was stimulated by photoperiod, which led to rapid early growth and enhanced skeletal development [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The variation in our results may be because a day length of 8 h provided enough light for normal feed and water access, which meets the requirement for growth development, and the longer daylength possibly may not increase the feed intake in our pullets. Additionally, there is a strong negative relationship between body weight and reproductive efficiency, therefore, the body weight of growth chickens should be controlled within reason.</p><p>Photoperiodic responses are dependent on interactions between endogenous circadian clocks and encephalic photoreceptors [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Unlike mammals, birds do not use melatonin to relay photoperiodic information; instead they obtain it directly through photoreceptors located within the medio-basal hypothalamus [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is well known that the hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal (HPG) axis regulates the reproductive activities, because GnRH in the hypothalamus controls the secretion of FSH and LH, which, together with other hormones, regulate the reproductive seasonality of birds that are both long- and short-day breeders [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Lewis et al (2005) suggested that plasma LH and FSH concentrations during the rearing period might be useful predictors of sexual maturity and egg production rate in chickens [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Similarly, it was stated that the light stimulus will be initiated when light falls in the eye of the chicken, and the photon energy converts into neural impulses in the hypothalamus, then induces the release of LH and FSH hormones from the pituitary, which in turn causes increased growth of the ova [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>We demonstrated changes in plasma FSH and LH concentrations from 18, 22, 24, and 43 weeks. All data sets showed that hormonal changes under different photoperiods were closely related to reproduction. Pullets reared in long day length displayed higher plasma FSH and LH concentrations in the initial laying stage. This concur with Sharp&#x02019;s, who reported similar increase in level of these hormones when laying hens were first exposed to short photoperiods and then transferred to long photoperiods. However, when the procedure was reversed, the FSH and LH concentrations decreased [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Similar differences were found in FSH-&#x003b2; and LH-&#x003b2; mRNA expression in the pituitary gland. Photo-stimulation induced FSH-&#x003b2; and LH-&#x003b2; mRNA expression before the first egg was laid. This could have occurred because selective photo-stimulation of long day length that increased GnRH secretion and GnRH-I mRNA abundance through direct connection between the hypothalamic photoreceptor and GnRH synapses [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and led to a release of LH and FSH with increase of FSH-&#x003b2; and LH-&#x003b2; mRNA expression in the pituitary [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Earlier studies have concluded that photo-stimulatory inputs to GnRH neurons have the potential to increase GnRH-I mRNA transcription or stability [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and subsequent work in quail and turkey demonstrated that GnRH-I mRNA expression was also increased by photo-stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177358.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the plasma FSH and LH concentrations, and FSH-&#x003b2; and LH-&#x003b2; mRNA abundance were higher in G1 during mid- to late laying, which is likely because of the self-adjustment ability in chickens when photoperiod was the same in the three groups from 22 weeks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the findings of this study it was concluded that day length during the growth period (12 to 18 weeks) can affect laying performance and these effects are mediated through alteration in the concentrations of gonadal hormones, which in turn is regulated through expression of related genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis of female Pengxian yellow chickens. The optimal photoperiod for enhanced egg-laying in Pengxian yellow chickens of 12 to 18 weeks was found to be 8L: 16D.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank &#x0201c;Edanz Editing China&#x0201d; for revising the English writing.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0177358.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Lewis</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sharp</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Leeson</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name> (<year>2004</year>) <article-title>Changes in light intensity can influence age at sexual maturity in domestic pullets</article-title>. <source>Br Poult Sci</source>
