[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] Because of frequent arousals and awakenings, sleep in the ICU has a higher proportion of none-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stage 1 and 2 (or light sleep), and reduced restorative slow wave (SW) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and might bring many adverse consequences, including impaired immune function, difficult weaning from mechanical ventilation, delirium and severe morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The cause of sleep disturbance in the ICU is multifactorial. Aside from the primary diseases, medications, mechanical ventilation and so on, ICU noise and light environment, and hormonal imbalance play essential roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Gabor <italic>et al</italic>. reported that ICU noise and patient care activities were responsible for up to 30% of the arousals and awakenings in ICU patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Some studies also found that ICU noise or/and light might increase the sleep-onset latency, shorten total sleep time and disturb sleep structure in healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Hu <italic>et al</italic>. suggest that ICU noise and light might disturb sleep by suppressing nocturnal melatonin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, the ICU environment is a critical factor that causes ICU sleep disturbance, which can be relatively easy to control and diminish, in contrast to most other factors.</p><p>Currently, there are many strategies for ICU acousto-optic control, such as controlling noise and dimming the light at night and large-scale ICU environmental reform and so on, but the low universality and poor feasibility are the major problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, some domestic and international experts recommend that ICUs incorporate earplugs/eye masks into routine nursing care: however, effectiveness is still a matter of debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Hu <italic>et al</italic>. found earplugs and eye masks might elevate the nocturnal melatonin level when tested in healthy subjects in a simulated ICU environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, most critically ill patients in the ICU lose their ability to regulate melatonin secretion by exposure to darkness and light. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] Therefore, more effective strategies for improving sleep disruption induced by ICU noise and light are urgently needed.</p><p>Melatonin is a substance with pleiotropic physiologic action synthesized in the pineal gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Its secretion is suppressed by light and stimulated by darkness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The disruption to the normal timing and amplitude of the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion is associated with disturbed sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Exogenous melatonin has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in the treatment of primary insomnia in the elderly and other circadian rhythm sleep disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Recently several studies found melatonin levels in critically ill patients to be severely depressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], which raised interest in melatonin as a potential therapeutic or prophylactic agent in the management of ICU sleep disturbance. However, until now the influence of melatonin treatment on sleep quality in ICU patients remained controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. No studies have yet evaluated the effects on sleep in ICU patients of oral melatonin, as measured by polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard for assessing sleep quality. However, critically ill patients have disturbed electroencephalographic patterns caused by many complex factors as seen in sepsis, neurologic pathology and medication, among others, and the sleep staging in accordance with the American Association of Sleep Medicine 2007 criteria cannot be met [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, in our study we recruited healthy participants as experimental subjects and conducted the research in a simulated ICU environment, and adopted the gold standard assessment technique to verify our hypothesis. Meanwhile, the comparative study of different strategies for addressing the problem of ICU sleep disturbance has not been performed. In this study, we aimed to investigate and compare the effectiveness of oral melatonin, and wearing of earplugs and eye masks, on sleep quality in healthy subjects who were exposed to a simulated ICU situation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The study protocol was formally approved by the Institutional Review Board of Fuzhou Children&#x02019;s Hospital (approval number 2014&#x02013;001) and by the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (approval number ChiCTR-IPR-14005458). The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki principles. All participants provided written informed consent. Subjects were included in the study if they were older than 18&#x000a0;years of age, had body mass index (BMI) &#x0003c;26&#x000a0;kg/m<sub>2</sub>, were non-smokers, had scores &#x02264;7 on the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), had almost had no daytime sleep and slept only at night, that is, they went to bed between 21:00 and midnight and habitually spent in between 6 and 9&#x000a0;h per night in bed. Exclusion criteria included a history or current diagnosis of other sleep disorders (such as restless leg syndrome, periodic leg movements with arousals, narcolepsy, REM behavior disorder, circadian rhythm sleep disorder, breathing-related sleep disorder, or parasomnia), which was assessed by the clinical manifestation and a diagnostic PSG record (which was also performed to familiarize subjects with the PSG procedures); reduced hearing acuity (&#x0003e;20&#x000a0;dB hearing loss at a single frequency, as tested with an audiometer (Entomed SA 201); blindness (as tested with visual testing and perimetry), and a history of alcohol or medication abuse. Participants with an occupational history that included shift work or recent significant travel across three or more time zones within the prior two weeks were also excluded. In addition, after a screening PSG, participants with an apnea-hypopnea index &#x0003e;15 or a periodic leg-movement arousal index &#x0003e;15, and known allergy to melatonin, were also excluded.</p><p>All healthy participants (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;40) slept in individual private rooms for eight nights (21:00 to 06:00) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The first night served as adaptation, that is, the participants followed the same procedure and data (not to be used in the analyses) were collected just as in the following nights. Then, the study was conducted in two stages. The first stage used a crossover design to investigate the impact of ICU noise and light environment on the sleep quality of healthy subjects. To minimize order effects, half of the healthy subjects (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) were randomly exposed to a simulated ICU noise and light (NL) environment on the second night and to a quiet and dark environment (baseline) on the third night. In the meantime, other participants (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) were exposed in the opposite order. In this stage, all subjects underwent two overnight PSG examinations on the second and third nights. For each subject, study nights were spaced 3&#x000a0;days apart to avoid delay effects. The second stage was to evaluate the effect of melatonin, and earplugs and eye masks, on the sleep quality of healthy subjects exposed to simulated nocturnal ICU noise and light. These 40 participants were assigned randomly to either: (1) simulated ICU noise and light (NL); (2) NL plus placebo (NLP); (3) NL plus melatonin (NLM); or (4) NL plus use of earplugs and eye masks (NLEE) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Subjects in the melatonin and placebo groups did not know they were receiving active therapy, nor did their clinicians. As potential chronophypnotic benefits of melatonin are not immediate and may take at least 3&#x000a0;days to be released, the process of intervention should take 4&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In order to control for possible effects of baseline values on the outcome variable, the baseline data for the simulated ICU environment (Baseline<sub>NL</sub>) needed to be collected and analyzed before the 4-day intervention. Therefore, in this stage, all participants slept in the simulated ICU noise and light environment during the fourth night, and were exposed to corresponding intervening factors based on their group assignment for the following four consecutive nights (fifth to eight night) in the laboratory, and underwent two nighttime PSG evaluations on the fourth night for the baseline, and on the eighth night for assessment of the outcome variable, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention and instruments</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Baseline night (quiet and dark environment)</title><p>The laboratory is constructed so that sounds or vibrations from the surroundings are completely prevented and the background noise level with full ventilation is less than 15&#x000a0;dB (A).

ICU noise was continuously monitored during the night using a sound meter, model AW5610D (AWAI, Hangzhou, China) in the surgical ICU (SICU) environments. The SICU had noise levels far exceeding the 20&#x000a0;dB (A) at nighttime recommended by the Guidelines of the Chinese Association of Critical Care medicine (2006). The mean (standard deviation) noise value in the SICU was 67.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10.2&#x000a0;dB (A), the peak noise level recorded was 99.7&#x000a0;dB (A), and the minimal noise level recorded was 47.3&#x000a0;dB (A). The sound recording equipment, model ICD-P320 (Sony Inc., Tokyo, Japan), was positioned at the bed of patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Simultaneous sound meter readings were taken to ensure similar noise levels during playback in the sleep laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Simulated ICU lighting conditions</title><p>Nighttime illumination in the ICU setting and the sleep laboratory were monitored by a light detector model TES1332 (Taiwantes, Shenzhen, China). In both settings, the main light was provided by fluorescent ceiling lights. The light detector was placed by a patient receiving mechanical ventilation, but not so as to interfere with patient care. Light measurements were taken every hour during the night. In the ICU high mean night light levels ranging between 56.0 and 221.3 lux were maintained. The mean nighttime light level in the sleep laboratory measured 100 lux with the light on, and 5 lux with the light off and the door to the hallway shut. Therefore, the study used 100 lux to simulate the ICU lighting conditions.</p><p>During Baseline<sub>NL</sub>, NL, NLM, NLEE and NLP nights, recorded ICU noise was played and the fluorescent lights were turned on in the sleep laboratory. A sound meter was placed at the head of the subject&#x02019;s bed and the recording time synchronized with the sound meter to ensure playback in a similar range of decibels to that recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Earplugs and eye masks (NLEE night)</title><p>Subjects were instructed to wear earplugs with a 29-dB noise reduction rating (3&#x000a0;M Corporation, Beijing, China) and eye masks during the NLEE night.

The standard procedure for sleep measurement described by Rechtschaffen and Kales was followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Subjects were hooked up for recording of an electroencephalogram (EEG), eye movement, and a submental electromyogram (EMG) in the sleep laboratory. Electrode impedances were within acceptable limits (&#x0003c;10 kQ&#x003a9;). PSG equipment was located outside the subject&#x02019;s room. Sleep variables (sleep period time, sleep efficiency index, sleep-onset latency, REM latency, arousal index and percentage of sleep in REM, stage one, two and three and so on) were scored manually and independently by two scorers who were unaware of the experimental conditions, according to standardized criteria. Polysomnographic records were collected from 21:00&#x000a0;to 06:00 on nights 1 to 4 and on night 8.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Serum melatonin concentration</title><p>Nocturnal blood was collected at 20:50 (before administration), 22:00, 23:00, 24:00, 01:00, 02:00, 03:00, 04:00, 05:00 and 06:00&#x000a0;h on nights 2, 3 and 8. In order to avoid repeated venipuncture, it is routine to give all subjects an indwelling vein needle. The trained technicians were required to access the participant&#x02019;s room as quietly as possible and take blood by the light of an electric torch. Blood samples were collected in plastic tubes without anticoagulant agents and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until assayed. Melatonin concentrations were measured using a commercial radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit for human melatonin (BioSource Europe SA, Belgium). In this assay, sensitivity was 2&#x000a0;pg/mL.

More importantly, we noted that use of both oral melatonin, and earplugs and eye masks improve sleep quality at different levels, especially melatonin.</p><p>In the first part of the study, our results confirmed that in simulated ICU noise and light, healthy subjects not only had greater anxiety and poorer subjective sleep quality, but also suffered from the disturbance of sleep structure, measured as shorter total sleep time, longer sleep-onset latency, longer REM latency, more light sleep, less REM sleep and more arousals and awakenings. Although previous studies have suggested that ICU noise disturbs the sleep quality of healthy subjects to varying degrees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], only the research reported by Hu <italic>et al.</italic> was similar to ours, which combined levels of noise and light in a simulated ICU environment in a sleep laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Although the ICU environment might not be responsible for the majority of ICU sleep disturbance, excessive noise and long-lasting light have proved to be the important and inevitable factors and have negative physiological and psychological effects on patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In some ICUs, a single-bedded room has been chosen for noise reduction, however, most noise leaks from the main ICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although mean sound and mean maximum sound intensities are significantly reduced in a single-bedded room, the frequency of sound spikes remained elevated so there is still a lack of improvement in sleep continuity. Recent emphasis has been on controlling noise level and encouraging the dimming of lights overnight in ICU settings, but control of noise is not always possible, and lights are always present in critical care for patient observations and patient care activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, some domestic and international experts recommend that the ICU incorporates earplugs/eye mask into routine nursing care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the second part of our study, consistent with previous studies, use of earplugs and eye masks significantly improved the sleep quality, as seen in shorter sleep-onset latency, reduced number of arousals and awakenings, better perceived sleep quality and less anxiety. But the tolerability of this intervention is critical. Previous studies showed that some ICU patents were unwilling to use the earplugs and/or eye masks because they found the intervention uncomfortable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In our study, most subjects who wore earplugs and eye masks considered this strategy was effective, however, the discomfort of earplugs is a big problem. Some patients commented that there a feeling of tightness, sore ears, claustrophobia and still being able to hear when using earplugs. So it is necessary to explore other methods that are better tolerated and even more effective.</p><p>An ideal sleep-improvement strategy for avoiding disruption of the ICU environment should be economical, feasible, rapid in onset and offset, and without local or systemic adverse effects. Recently, melatonin has raised concerns among ICU experts. Melatonin is a key circadian regulatory neurohormone mainly secreted by the pineal gland. Light signals play the most important role in the synthesis and secretion of melatonin in the organism via the retina and retina-hypothalamic pathways, acting directly on the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). So melatonin secretion normally increases at night and decreases in the early morning hours. The melatonin rhythm functions to synchronize circadian rhythms, whereas the melatonin rhythm along with all other circadian rhythms are synchronized by the central pacemaker. Therefore, melatonin is a good sleep aid. The interest in melatonin as a potential therapeutic or prophylactic agent in management of sleep disturbance in the ICU derives from demonstrated low plasma concentrations and altered secretion patterns of melatonin in the critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, the physiological regulation of melatonin secretion by darkness and light is abolished in severely ill patients in ICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], so use of eye masks or dimming the lights only might be not enough to return to normal levels. Thus, supplementation of exogenous melatonin, to remodel the melatonin level in the human body that approaches the physiological state, might be a potential strategy for improving sleep among ICU patients.</p><p>The second part of our study investigated and compared the effect of oral melatonin and use of earplugs and eye masks on sleep quality and serum melatonin level in a simulated ICU noise and light environment. Both earplugs and eye masks, and oral melatonin, significantly improved sleep quality, in addition to shorter sleep-onset latency and reduced number of arousals and awakenings; melatonin also increased the duration of REM sleep stage and total sleep time. Furthermore, when oral melatonin was compared to wearing earplugs and eye masks, there was a significant decrease in awakenings and arousals during simulated ICU noise and light. The encouraging results were established both by PSG and by participants&#x02019; self-reports and showed that sleep in the simulated ICU noise and light environment while wearing earplugs and eye masks, or after taking melatonin, was more restorative and less fragmented. Although there is no consensus on the relative functions of the various sleep stages, REM sleep generally is considered to be important for cognitive restoration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. On the other hand, both awakenings and arousals, and acoustic events, can accelerate the heart rate, which is linked to adverse cardiovascular events and may impair the patient&#x02019;s recuperation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Compared to earplugs and eye masks, melatonin administration might benefit sleep better by three mechanisms: (1) although earplugs can lower noise at a certain degree, the frequency of sound spikes remained elevated, which is an important contributor to noise-induced sleep disruption. However, melatonin has some degree of sedative effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and might buffer the stress from noise. That is probably why in our study melatonin administration without any intervention for attenuating ambient noise improved sleep under the noisy overnight sleep conditions; (2) some patients considered the discomfort of earplugs and eye masks to affect sleep quality; (3) wearing earplugs and eye masks could not make the declined melatonin level return to the normal level, but melatonin supplements could bring a them to a higher level.</p><p>Although the cause of the low melatonin level in ICU patients is still unclear, ICU noise and illumination should be significant factors. In the study of Hu <italic>et al</italic>. simulated nocturnal ICU noise and light caused low urinary secretion levels of 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (6-SMT) and high urinary cortisol during the night, and earplugs and eye masks elevated the nocturnal levels of 6-SMT, which suggests that raising the melatonin level might be one of the mechanisms for improving sleep quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, metabolites of melatonin cannot entirely represent the true level in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>There has been no study on the impact of ICU noise and light on nocturnal serum melatonin levels. In normal physiological conditions, the melatonin peaks between 02:00 and 04:00, and troughs during daytime. The average peak melatonin concentration at night is 60&#x000a0;pg/mL, which gradually declines to trough levels of 10&#x000a0;pg/mL during the daytime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Our results for the baseline night were similar to those values. In our study, ICU noise and light significantly suppressed the melatonin level and delayed the peak of melatonin, which also fits with the retrospective study by Jamie <italic>et al</italic>., who found that even small changes in ordinary light exposure during the evening can significantly affect both plasma melatonin concentrations and the entrained phase of the human circadian pacemaker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. We also found that although the subjects were exposed to light overnight, the nocturnal melatonin level still maintained a certain rhythm. Some investigators have speculated that the regulation of melatonin secretion by direct control by the environmental light-dark cycle has conferred on humans an evolutionary advantage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we found that administration of 1&#x000a0;mg of fast-release melatonin was successful in achieving good absorption. The mean maximal serum melatonin concentration was reached at about 1&#x000a0;h after administration, which was close to 20 times higher than the NL-night levels and 12 times higher than baseline levels, and then the levels fell but still remained at a higher level than on the NL, NLP and NLEE nights. Although oral melatonin might result in 10 to 100 times the normal peak night-concentration after ingestion, it has a wide safety margin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It is theoretically possible that high levels of melatonin were achieved with a high dose at night, so that even during the daytime, melatonin blood levels were sufficiently high to promote diurnal sleep as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Daytime sleep would have then occurred and made nocturnal sleep more difficult. In addition, controlled release formulations would bring an increased risk of prolonged periods of supraphysiologic melatonin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], therefore, we chose a relatively low dose of fast-released melatonin for our study. However, after melatonin administration the melatonin levels were lower than those in previous studies, perhaps because of overnight illumination exposure. The most suitable dose of melatonin in critically ill patients in ICU should be confirmed further, because Mistraletti <italic>et al</italic>. found that after administration of indole the melatonin peak was reached earlier in ICU patients than in healthy volunteers, and the rate of melatonin disappearance was slightly slower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In our study, using earplugs and eye masks during the simulated ICU noise and light elevated melatonin level to some degree and advanced the timing of the clock. However, the melatonin level was much lower than in the melatonin group and that is one of the reasons why melatonin has greater benefit on sleep in the simulated ICU environment.</p><p>Our study design has some limitations, which should be reviewed. First, the study was performed in a sleep laboratory with healthy subjects rather than in an ICU setting of critically ill patients, and therefore could not completely simulate the full auditory and visual experience of the ICU. Second, the study was only performed for a 9-h nocturnal period rather than over 24&#x000a0;h. The ICU patients experience circadian rhythm disturbances with sleep traversing the day and night. Therefore, an ideal study should measure the sleep in healthy volunteers lying recumbent over a 24-h period to completely simulate the ICU scenario. In addition, our sample sizes were small, which limited the power of our statistical analyses. Future studies with larger numbers and greater diversity of participants would likely support these recommendations. Finally, although no adverse effects related to the oral melatonin were observed in our healthy subjects during the study period, the potential safety issues related to melatonin administration in ICU patients need to be considered, and the impact of oral melatonin on critically ill patients with ICU sleep deprivation will be our next study focus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our results found that use of melatonin, and earplugs and eye masks in healthy subjects in a simulated ICU environment not only improved subjective sleep quality, but also improved the sleep structure, and elevated nocturnal melatonin levels.
