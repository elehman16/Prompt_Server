Unfortunately, a national consensus statement with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Committee Opinion and the American Dental Association (ADA) reported that many times, neither the pregnant women nor OB/GYN professionals understand that oral health care is an essential component of a healthy pregnancy.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In another study done by Curtis <italic>et al</italic>., in 2013, most of the deans and dental program directors reported limited clinical exposure to prenatal oral health during residency.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Limited data are available on the OB/GYNs' knowledge, attitude, practice, and training regarding oral health care during pregnancy and the association between oral health and pregnancy outcomes.

Before the scheduled oral health educational seminar, a 24-item baseline preseminar questionnaire was distributed among OB/GYN residents at Tufts Medical Center after informed consent form explaining the aim of the study was signed by each participating OB/GYN resident. The preseminar questionnaire aimed to assess the residents' knowledge, beliefs, and previous training in oral health. The questionnaire included 16 knowledge-based and eight belief-based multiple-choice questions. Knowledge-based questions were in a true/false format and aimed to evaluate the OB/GYN resident's knowledge in oral health during pregnancy. Each correct answer received a +1 score and each wrong answer received a zero score. A total was calculated for each participant and for each question. The total number and percentage of OB/GYN residents who correctly answered each knowledge-based question were calculated at before and after the educational seminar and at the 3-month follow-up. A five-point scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5) was used for the belief-based questions. Data regarding the age, gender, race, years in OB/GYN residency and the amount of previous training received in oral health were also collected. The questionnaire was developed with the aid of previous studies and from the ACOG and ADA guidelines on oral health during pregnancy.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Then, a PowerPoint oral health educational seminar was provided by a trained pediatric dentist resident and followed by 15-min discussion. The oral health educational seminar discussed pregnant women and infant oral health, with emphasis on oral health care, prevention, and diet during pregnancy, while promoting the concept of establishing oral hygiene regimens for the baby once the baby's first tooth erupts.</p><p>Immediately following the seminar, the same postseminar questionnaire was administered to assess the effect of the oral health educational seminar on the resident's oral health knowledge and beliefs. Three months later, the same questionnaire was administered to the same residents. All participants completed the pre/post-seminar and the 3-month follow-up questionnaire. For participating in the study, each resident received a $10 gift card. The study period was from July 2013 to February 2015.</p><p>SPSS version 21 (IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0) was used for the data analysis. The Friedman test was used to compare pretest, posttest, and 3-month follow-up results regarding answers to the belief-based questions as well as total score on the knowledge-based questions. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction was used for <italic>post hoc</italic> comparisons.

Most of the OB/GYN residents (84%) at Tufts Medical Center knew that periodontal disease during pregnancy is associated with preterm birth. Similar results were reported in the previous studies done by Suri <italic>et al</italic>., 2015[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Zanata <italic>et al</italic>., 2008.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Suri <italic>et al</italic>. in 2015 reported that 85.4% of OBs identified the association between periodontal disease during pregnancy and preterm delivery,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] compared to 65.8% of the OB/GYNs in the study reported by Zanata <italic>et al</italic>., in 2008.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, our study showed that 76% of the OB/GYN residents at Tufts Medical Center failed to answer the question regarding the association between periodontal disease during pregnancy and preeclampsia as compared to 62% of the OB/GYNs in a study done by Suri <italic>et al</italic>. in 2015 to evaluate OBs' knowledge, attitude, and practice in oral health and pregnancy.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Furthermore, a study conducted by Roche <italic>et al</italic>., in 2011 reported that 80 % of the participated OBG identified periodontal disease as a risk factor for preterm birth and low birth weight.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Although previous studies reported that OB/GYNs had adequate knowledge about oral health during pregnancy, most of the OB/GYNs did not apply their knowledge in their practice.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Suri <italic>et al</italic>., 2015 reported that only 40% of the OB/GYNs included in the study advised routine dental visits during pregnancy and only 47% advised their patients about maintaining oral hygiene during pregnancy.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Wilder <italic>et al</italic>. in 2007 reported that up to 49% of the practicing OB/GYNs rarely or never recommended a dental examination for their pregnant patients.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In our study, while the knowledge and beliefs of the participating residents were evaluated before the educational seminar and immediately after the seminar and at a 3-month follow-up, the practical implications of the acquired knowledge were not evaluated.</p><p>Most of the OB/GYN participating residents were 1<sup>st</sup>-year residents and most of them reported limited previous training in oral health. Similar results were reported by a previous national survey done by Ferullo <italic>et al</italic>., 2011 who assessed the extent of oral health education among United States medical schools. The majority of the United States medical schools reported that they offer very little oral health education to their students.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Another study by Morgan <italic>et al</italic>. in 2015 assessed how OB/GYNs in the United States addressed oral health during pregnancy and reported that most of the OB/GYNs responding to the mail questionnaire reported nonexistent (52%) or inadequate (33%) training in oral health during medical school and residency.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] This emphasizes the importance of providing more oral health education to the OB/GYN residents during their education years.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effect of an oral health educational seminar on OB/GYN residents' knowledge and beliefs after the educational seminar and at a 3-month follow-up. Although a significant improvement in the OB/GYN residents' knowledge was reported at the postseminar and at the 3-month follow-up, the long-term retention of the information and the practical implications of the acquired knowledge are unknown. Therefore, further studies, including those with a larger sample size and with long-term follow up, are recommended.</p><p>Limitations of the study include the method of sampling: A convenience sample of Tufts Medical Center OB/GYNs was taken. The questionnaire was self-report, and belief-based questions may be subject to response bias. The questionnaire was not validated, and due to limited numbers of OB/GYN residents at Tufts Medical Center, the questionnaire was not pilot tested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSIONS</sc></title><p>Within the limitations of the study, OB/GYN residents received limited training in oral health.
