technique on correction of lumbar deformation and alleviation of low back pain. [Subjects]
Ninety patients diagnosed with lumbar deformation and low back pain participated in this
study. [Methods] The participants were divided into three groups according to method of
treatment. The first group was treated with the core muscle release technique (CRT), the
second group was treated with general exercise, and the third group was treated with
electrotherapy. The core muscle release technique group received 50-minute of the core
muscle release technique 5 times a week for 2 weeks, and the participants in this group
were instructed not to receive any other treatments. After the 2 weeks of treatment, the
patients were reexamined. The general exercise group performed Williams flexion exercises
and McKenzie extension exercises 5 times a week for 2 weeks. The electrotherapy group was
treated by application of electrotherapy with an interferential current therapy machine
(TM-301. TOPMED. Seongnam, Republic of Korea) to the abdominal muscles and back muscles of
the lumbar region. [Results] The data suggest that the core muscle release technique,
general exercise, and electrotherapy all helped to decrease the alignment angle and VAS
score. Of these treatment methods, however, the core muscle release technique was the most
effective for treatment of lumbar spine deformation and low back pain. [Conclusion] The
core muscle release technique was most effective for correction of lumbar spine
deformation and pain alleviation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Core muscle release technique</kwd><kwd>Lumbar spine deformation</kwd><kwd>Low back pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low back pain occurs most often in the thoracolumbar, lumbar, or lumbosacral region<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, 90% of patients with acute low
back pain go back to work; however, it has long been known that the symptoms and functional
limitations recur in many cases<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
major cause is injury or muscle weakness in the soft tissue of the trunk<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>; it occurs particularly when the recruitment
of core muscles performing a role in stabilization of the lumbar region is weak<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
With regard to this, Cooper et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>
described how atrophy in lumbar deep muscles was aggravated with chronic low back pain.
Danneels et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> confirmed that
paravertebral muscles were partially atrophied in patients with chronic low back pain as
demonstrated by computed tomography (CT). Kader et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> also confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that the
multifidus was atrophied in about 80% of patients with low back pain. In addition, Hodges et
al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> confirmed that in patients with low
back pain, recruitment of the transversus abdominis, oblique muscle, rectus abdominis, and
erector spinae normally appears in time. The results of these studies show that balanced
development of core muscles is a key to prevention of low back pain. For this reason, the
current fitness trend has been a change from exercise to eliminate pain by restricting
movement by improving muscle strength or stretching<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, to exercises that increase core stability<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently, the concept of motor control has been
integrated into core stability. This is a visual feedback concept, the purpose of which is
to encourage the patient to control their own muscle movement by showing the patient
ultrasonographic images of their own muscle movement to improve muscle performance<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Along with exercises, joint mobilization
or manipulation techniques for vertebral joints have also been used widely to treat spine
imbalance<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nevertheless, core
stability exercises have a few limitations. When a patient is not able to keep himself
steady due to extreme lumbar deviation or extreme muscle imbalance, inconvenient
pretreatment will also be needed. Also, unskilled manipulation can cause joint injury as a
result of direct stimulation of an injured joint. Therefore, in this study we introduced
core muscle therapeutic methods that can build well-proportioned muscles based on two
principles: 1) core stability exercises that anyone can perform easily anywhere to build
muscle without being constrained by the necessity to use particular tools: and 2)
appropriate manipulation for correction of misalignment. In this study, after inducing
well-proportioned manipulation of abdominal muscles, paraspinal muscles, the diaphragm, the
fascia of the pelvic floor, and thoracolumbar regions using the core muscle release
technique (CRT), we examined if lumbar deformation and pain were reduced in patients with
low back pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Ninety subjects, who were briefed on the experimental procedure, were selected from among
those who had once been outpatients of W Hospital in Daejeon, Republic of Korea. Through
X-ray and physical examination, the subjects were all found to have deformities in parts of
the lumbar spine, and they were all confirmed to be lumbar deformation and low back pain
patients by a doctor. This study complied with the ethical principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki, and written informed consent was received from each participant. All participants
were divided into three groups. Group 1 was treated by CRT, Group 2 was treated by Williams
exercise and McKenzie exercise, and Group 3 was treated with electrotherapy. Each group
consisted of 15 male and 15 female participants. The average age was 34.2&#x02005;years in the CRT
group, 35.2&#x02005;years in the common exercise group, and 34.6&#x02005;years in the electrotherapy
group.</p><p>Alignment was measured on a radiograph in the anteroposterior view (AP view) of the lumbar
spine (L-spine) using the PiviewSTAR STARPACS software (Tsp 03&#x02013;02, INFINITT. Co., Ltd.,
Seoul, Republic of Korea). Since the purpose of this study was to determine the degree of
lumbar deviation, we marked two points on the L5 spinous process (SP) and L1 SP and then
connected the two points. Then we drew two intersecting lines perpendicular to each SP line.
The angle between the two intersecting lines was measured for alignment. A visual Analog
Scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the degree of pain.</p><p>The basic position for CRT was the supine position. With both soles flat on a table and the
legs spread as wide as the hip joints, the knee joints were flexed at about 45&#x000b0; so that the
subjects could comfortably lie with their lower backs on the table and rest the upper limbs
next to the trunk. The first step was releasing the diaphragm. The therapist put one hand
under the thoracolumbar junction, laid the other hand on the brachial region, in the
anteroinferior margin of the xiphoid process and the rib; and compressed lightly with both
hands. Compression lasted from three to five minutes. Next, compression therapy was
conducted for the diaphragm with breathing techniques. For compression of the rectus
abdominis and transverses abdominis, the therapist&#x02019;s hands were placed on each side of the
umbilicus, and the patient was instructed to inhale deeply through the nose. The therapist
compressed the elevated abdomen with both hands while the patient slowly exhaled. This was
repeated five times. Therapy on both the internal and external oblique muscles was performed
using the same method used for rectus abdominis compression, except with different hand
positions. Next, compression of the quadratus lumborum in the posterior region was
performed, followed by compression of the erector spinae. To compress the thoracolumbar
region through the fascia, compression began at the scapula height. During compression, the
patients were instructed to flex their backs slowly so as to bend vertebra-by-vertebra the
sections from the thoracic to low-level lumbar spine. Multifidus compression was performed
using the same method as for erector spinae compression, with the therapist&#x02019;s hands
positioned on the multifidus. Compression of the iliopsoas was performed at the one-third
point along the line between the anterior superior iliac spine and the umbilicus along the
length of the iliopsoas. Finally, compression of the pelvic floor muscle was performed. One
of the therapist&#x02019;s hands was placed on the lower back, and the other was placed on the pubic
area or above it; release was induced with light compression<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The general therapeutic exercise group performed three of the Williams lumbar flexion
exercises and three of the McKenzie lumbar extension exercises. For electrotherapy, a hot
pack was first applied for 20 minutes to soften the muscles before an interferential current
machine (ICT; TM-301, TOPMED. Seongnam, Republic of Korea) was used for electrotherapy.
Electrical stimulation was applied twice for 15 minutes each in order to trigger strong
muscle contractions in the front muscles (the rectus abdominis muscle, oblique abdominal
muscle, and transversus abdominis muscle) and back muscles (the erector spinae muscle,
quadratus lumborum muscle, and multifidus muscle). To test the homogeneity of the groups,
one-way ANOVA was carried out. The paired t-test was conducted to determine changes in
lumbar deformation and pain between before and after treatment within each group. One way
ANOVA and post hoc analysis with Scheffe&#x02019;s method were also conducted to determine the
differences in variations among the three groups. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version
21.0) was used for statistical analysis; the significance level (&#x003b1;) was 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>When the ages of the subjects and homogeneity of the pretreatment variables were checked,

of daily living through strengthening and stretching of the muscles<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, exercises for muscle strength could actually
increase the risk of low back pain<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
the risk may be increased particularly for exercises including full flexion or repetitive
torsion of the spine<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, in
recent years interest in the core muscles that control lumbar movement has been rising.
Generally, core stability is improved by exercising global and local stability systems in
the abdominal and lumbopelvic regions<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The global stability system refers to the larger, superficial muscles around the abdominal
and lumbar regions, such as the rectus abdominis, paraspinals, erector spinae, external
oblique, and quadratus lumborum muscles<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The local stability system refers to the
deep intrinsic muscles of the abdominal wall, such as the transversus abdominis, multifidus,
internal oblique, and pelvic floor muscles. These muscles are associated with the segmental
stability of the lumbar spine during gross whole body movements in which postural
adjustments are required<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Various study results show that core stability exercise
is more effective than general fitness exercise<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, even though coordinated
contraction of superficial and deep core muscles is needed for more effective core stability
exercise<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, only local stability
exercises, i.e., exercise for the transversus abdominis and multifidus, have been
emphasized<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, studies of
core stability training considering the synergy effect of the two systems recently came to
the fore<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The core muscle approach in
this study involves a therapeutic program considering the global stability and local
stability systems. The CRT performed in this study involves a therapeutic core muscle
technique for the global and local stability systems. One of the essential elements of CRT
is respiration. As the diaphragm contracts, intra-abdominal pressure increases and provides
spinal stability<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. A recent study showed
that patients with sacroiliac joint pain had injuries in the diaphragm and recruitment of
the pelvic floor<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been also
reported that diaphragmatic dysfunction intensifies the compression on the spine<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, breathing techniques are
considered an important factor in core stability exercises<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been known that the pelvic floor muscle coordinating with
the transverses abdominis during forced expiration also contributes to stability of the
lumbar spine<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the CRT in this study,
the patient was allowed to drawing-in for muscle strength exercises of the diaphragm, pelvic
floor muscles, and transverse abdominis, and multifidus muscles during compression. The key
principle of CRT is to relearn proper movements of the core muscles. Since lack of
coordination of the core muscles causes a decrease in efficiency and a compensation pattern
that lead to hypertonus and overuse injury, motor relearning is more important than muscle
strength exercise<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. CRT controls
unbalanced muscle tone and smoothly induces coordinated contraction when the body moves.
Particularly because muscle tone control for both sides induces proper movement, CRT can be
effective for relearning proper movements. Because inhalation increases feed-forward
activation of the transversus abdominis prior to body movement<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>, relearning in recruitment of the transversus abdominis is
induced by respiratory therapy, and the results in an increase in the stability of the
lumbar region.</p><p>Therefore, since CRT controls the stretching and tone of the core muscles, increases
flexibility, induces smooth movement of joints, and improves the coordination of core
muscles through relearning, it is very effective for correction of deformation and pain
alleviation. In this study, the results showed that deformation decreased and pain was
alleviated after 2 weeks of treatment. So, when CRT is applied along with core stability
exercise, it is expected to ease the financial burden on patients receiving treatment for
lumbar spine deformation and for alleviation of pain by reducing the duration and cost of
treatment compared with core stability exercise alone, and compared with surgical
intervention.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Fordyce</surname><given-names>WE</given-names></name><name><surname>Brockway</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Bergman</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Acute back pain: a control-group comparison of behavioral
