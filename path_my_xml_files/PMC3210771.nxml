Gestational age at delivery was based on ultrasound measurement of fetal bi-parietal diameter in early-mid pregnancy. 247 infants born before 37 wk gestation and 593 term infants were assessed at 12, 18, or 24 months. We assessed survival (death), morbidity (reported by carer, admissions, out-patient attendance), growth (weight and height), and development (Ten Question Questionnaire [TQQ] and Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool [MDAT]). Preterm infants were at significantly greater risk of death (hazard ratio 1.79, 95&#x00025; CI 1.09&#x02013;2.95). Surviving preterm infants were more likely to be underweight (weight-for-age z score; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) or wasted (weight-for-length z score; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) with no effect of gestational age at delivery. Preterm infants more often screened positively for disability on the Ten Question Questionnaire (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.002). They also had higher rates of developmental delay on the MDAT at 18 months (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.009), with gestational age at delivery (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01) increasing this likelihood.

In Malawi, 33 of every 1,000 infants born die in the first 28 days after birth; the lifetime risk for a mother dying during or shortly after pregnancy is one in 36. The comparable figures for the United Kingdom are three infants dying per 1,000 births and a lifetime risk of maternal death of one in 4,700. But for a baby, being born preterm is even more risky and the gap between low- and high-income countries widens still further. According to a World Health Organization report in 2010, a baby born at 32 weeks of gestation (weighing around 2,000 g) in Africa has little chance of survival, while the chances of survival for a baby born at 32 weeks in North America or Europe are similar to one born at term. There are very few data on the longer term outcomes of babies born preterm in Africa and there are multiple challenges involved in gathering such information. As prenatal ultrasound is not routinely available, gestational age is often uncertain. There may be little routine follow-up of preterm babies as is commonplace in high-income countries. Data are needed from recent years that take into account both improvements in perinatal care and adverse factors such as a rising number of infants becoming HIV positive around the time of birth.</p></sec><sec id="s5a2"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>We could improve outcomes for babies born preterm in sub-Saharan Africa if we understood more about what happens to them after birth. We cannot assume that the progress of these babies will be the same as those born preterm in a high-income country, as the latter group will have received different care, both before and after birth. If we can document the problems that these preterm babies face in a low-income setting, we can consider why they happen and what treatments can be realistically tested in this setting. It is also helpful to establish baseline data so that changes over time can be recorded.</p><p>The aim of this study was to document four specific outcomes up to the age of two years, on which there were few data previously from rural sub-Saharan Africa: how many babies survived, visits to a health center and admissions to the hospital, growth, and developmental delay.</p></sec><sec id="s5a3"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers examined a group of babies that had been born to mothers who had taken part in a randomized controlled trial of an antibiotic to prevent preterm birth. The trial had previously shown that the antibiotic (azithromycin) had no effect on how many babies were born preterm or on other measures of the infants' wellbeing, and so the researchers followed up babies from both arms of the trial to look at longer term outcomes. From the original group of 2,297 women who took part in the trial, they compared 247 infants born preterm against 593 term infants randomly chosen as controls, assessed at 12, 18, or 24 months. The majority of the preterm babies who survived past a month of age (all but ten) were born after 32 weeks of gestation. Compared to the babies born at term, the infants born preterm were nearly twice as likely to die subsequently in the next two years, were more likely to be underweight (a third were moderately underweight), and to have higher rates of developmental delay. The commonest causes of death were gastroenteritis, respiratory problems, and malaria. Visits to a health center and admissions to hospital were similar in both groups.</p></sec><sec id="s5a4"><title>What Do these Findings Mean?</title><p>This study documents longer term outcomes of babies born preterm in sub-Saharan Africa in detail for the first time. The strengths of the study include prenatal ultrasound dating and correct adjustment of follow-up age (which takes into account being born before term). Because the researchers defined morbidity using routine health center attendances and self-report of illnesses by parents, this outcome does not seem to have been as useful as the others in differentiating between the preterm and term babies. Better means of measuring morbidity are needed in this setting.</p><p>In the developed world, there is considerable investment being made to improve care during pregnancy and in the neonatal period. This investment in care may help by predicting which mothers are more likely to give birth early and preventing preterm birth through drug or other treatments. It is to be hoped that some of the benefit will be transferable to low-income countries. A baby born at 26 weeks' gestation and admitted to a neonatal unit in the United Kingdom has a 67&#x00025; chance of survival; preterm babies born in sub-Saharan Africa face a starkly contrasting future.</p></sec><sec id="s5a5"><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001121">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001121</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>

Over three-quarters of these deaths occur in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with causes of death often poorly documented.

The estimated neonatal mortality rate is 33/1,000 live births with just over 80&#x00025; of births delivered in a health facility <xref rid="pmed.1001121-National1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. More than 95&#x00025; of women attend for antenatal care in the community, mostly in community-based health centres <xref rid="pmed.1001121-vandenBroek3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Antenatal steroids are not routinely given to women in Malawi prior to preterm birth. Malawi has very limited neonatal care with few units providing special care for preterm infants. Those units that exist have oxygen, antibiotics, and incubators and very little in the way of diagnostic facilities. In recent surveys, 72&#x00025; of children under 6 mo were exclusively breastfed and by 6&#x02013;9 mo, 87&#x00025; of infants are given complementary foods <xref rid="pmed.1001121-National1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study Setting and Population</title><p>We carried out a cohort study assessing mortality, morbidity, development, and growth in post-neonatal infants who were known to have been born preterm (&#x0003c;37 completed wk gestation by ultrasound scan) (group 1) or at term (37&#x02013;41 wk) (group 2). All infants for this follow-up study were born during a placebo-controlled double blind antibiotic intervention study (APPLe trial ISRCTN84023116) in southern Malawi. Birth weights were recorded for those who delivered in a health facility (65.5&#x00025;). In the parent cohort population, low birth weight (&#x0003c;2.5 kg) was recorded in 10.0&#x00025; of babies. Serial ultrasound was not available for this population, therefore making it impossible to diagnose infants as being small for gestational age (due to intrauterine growth restriction or other) during pregnancy. Nutritional status in women was measured using BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) BMI of 22.7 (2.7). More details of the APPLe cohort can be found elsewhere <xref rid="pmed.1001121-vandenBroek2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Two strata were defined: babies born preterm and babies born at term. We attempted to follow up babies who were known to have survived the first 6 wk of life. The entire set of post-neonatal surviving preterm babies born preterm from the APPLe trial cohort of women was included. There were 295 preterm babies identified for follow-up including 27 twin babies (14 pairs, one died). 48 (16.3&#x00025;) infants known to have been born preterm and to have survived the neonatal period were lost to follow-up (moved from area, could be not traced). For the comparison cohort, we selected at least double the number of term-born post-neonatal babies. This selection was done using a computer-generated random list from the APPLe parent cohort. Following this method, 678 babies born at term were identified. 593 (87.5&#x00025;) were found at follow-up and included in the study. 85 infants known to be born at term (12.6&#x00025;) were lost to follow-up (moved from the area, could be not traced) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1001121-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pmed-1001121-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pmed.1001121.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Flow chart of post-neonatal infants followed up in community cohort study.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pmed.1001121.g001"/></fig><p>We aimed to assess all infants on at least one occasion at a corrected age of 12 or 18 or 24 mo.

Corrected age was defined as chronological age (time elapsed after birth) minus number of weeks born less than 40 wk <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Engle1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. All assessments were carried out over a period of 7 mo from May 2006 until December 2006 using a team of six research midwives. 16 infants (ten preterm and six term) were assessed on two occasions 6 mo apart. These assessments are included in the analyses of development. We present the analyses below, with and without twins included.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data Collection</title><p>Socio-demographic characteristics were gathered for each family by interviewing the mother at the time of assessment, using a standard set of questions similar to those used in the Malawi Demographic Health Survey <xref rid="pmed.1001121-National2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> as recommended by the World Bank <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Vyas1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>To assess survival, we collected information on date of death, cause of death, and place of death by interviewing the mother. Cause of death was established using information gathered at verbal autopsy and classified as recommended in recent studies <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Setel1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>To assess morbidity, we collected data using a structured questionnaire. This questionnaire included whether the child was well at the time seen (as reported by the mother and observed by the research nurse midwife), the number of episodes and reasons for accessing care at a health facility, the number and reasons for being admitted to hospital in the past, and, specifically, whether the child had ever had convulsions.</p><p>Growth was assessed for each child by measuring length and nude weight. Weight was measured using electronic infant weighing scales (SECA 735) with reading increments of 10 g. Length was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm using standard locally made length measurement boards based on blueprints for their construction from the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, Georgia) <xref rid="pmed.1001121-DeOnis1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. All growth data were collected by the research nurse midwives who had been specifically trained prior to the start of the study. Training used the &#x0201c;my measure&#x0201d; formulas for anthropometeric standardisation as recommended by the Anthropometric Indicators Measurement Guide <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Coghill1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. At recommended stages of training, ten children had their height and weight measurements repeated on two occasions by each research midwife. Training continued with the research midwives until satisfactory accuracy was obtained. We asked each mother whether the child was still breastfeeding at the time of assessment.</p><p>Development and disability were assessed using the Ten Question Questionnaire (TQQ) <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Durkin1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT), which we have described previously <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Gladstone1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The MDAT has demonstrated good reliability, construct validity, and sensitivity in predicting moderate to severe neurodisability and developmental delay in a Malawian population of malnourished children. We used the MDAT to assess children in two ways: through a pass/fail scoring system and through a numerical scoring system applied to each of four domains of development <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Gladstone1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Only eight of the ten questions in the TQQ were used as the children were all under 2 y and questions 8 and 9 regarding speech and language were not appropriate for this age group. We were unable to specifically assess for cerebral palsy, as this is a clinical diagnosis that without further assessments and imaging was not able to be diagnosed in this rural African setting.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All data were double entered and verified, hosted on a password-protected SQL server with any discrepancies and outlying results reviewed. Mothers and babies were identified only by the mother's identification number and in the case of twins, the twin number. Data were analysed using SPSS for Windows version 17 and Stata version 10. All available data were included in the analyses.</p><p>Analyses compared data for infants and their mothers in the preterm and term delivery groups. All infants were used in the analysis, except where stated otherwise. Survival of infants in each of these strata was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using a Cox's proportional hazards model. Gender was also included in the Cox's proportional hazards analysis. When date of death was not reported (six cases) it was assumed to have been mid-way between birth and the assessment visit. For all other analyses, when data required for an analysis was missing the record was omitted from analysis. Socio-economic status was measured using principal components analysis of multiple assets following methods from the World Bank <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Vyas1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001121-Filmer1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Socio-economic quintiles for the two groups of mothers were analysed using logistic regression with term/preterm as the binary outcome.</p><p>Weight-for-corrected-age (WAZ), height-for-corrected-age (HAZ), and weight-for-height z (WHZ) scores were derived using Epi-info version 3.2.2 with World Health Organization reference data <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Kuczmarski1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001121-US1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. All analyses, except survival analyses, used corrected age (defined above). Growth data and MDAT scores were each analysed using linear regression models with gestational age at delivery as a covariate in the model for both sets of scores; age at assessment was an additional covariate in the analysis of MDAT scores. Stratified Mantel-Haenszel tests were used to examine the association of each of three indices of growth (WAZ and length-for-age [LAZ] and weight-for-length [WLZ] z scores), and the number of times health care was accessed with prematurity, stratified by age of assessment. Other binary or categorical outcomes were analysed using Pearson chi square tests unless otherwise stated.</p><p>Stratified Mantel-Haenszel tests were also used to examine the association between being underweight (WAZ&#x0003c;&#x02212;2) and identification of disability on the TQQ or severe developmental delay on the MDAT.

This cohort of preterm infants is unique because gestational age was established by ultrasound dating. We have shown that these infants are almost entirely a population of late preterm infants, but despite this, are still more likely to have higher rates of malnutrition and developmental delay than term infants. As rates of prematurity are high in sub-Saharan African settings <xref rid="pmed.1001121-vandenBroek1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001121-Osman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001121-Kumala1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, this study provides evidence to show how crucial it is to concentrate on improving outcomes within this group.</p><p>Recent studies from high-income countries have also demonstrated this relatively increased mortality in late preterm babies; however, outcomes have mainly been measured only in the neonatal period <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Osrin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Studies have suggested that causative factors may include thermal instability, hypoglycaemia, respiratory distress, apnoea, jaundice, and feeding difficulties <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Saigal1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. There is a dearth of evidence from developing countries, but it could be surmised that infants born in the late preterm period in rural African settings are likely to be at increased risk for many of these problems with high levels of poverty, poor post-natal care, and high infection rates. Moreover, the population of infants in our study were not exposed to antenatal steroids and will be more likely to suffer from respiratory distress syndrome and related respiratory disorders <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. These late preterm infants may also be malnourished due to feeding difficulties that cannot be augmented through supplementary feeding methods present in high-income settings. Poor nutrition will affect immune status and further lead to an increased risk of infection. There is some limited evidence that extra care of preterm-born infants in Asia, such as home care, skin-to-skin contact, and additional support for breastfeeding, may have some potential to prevent death in this group <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Darmstadt1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001121-Agrawal1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001121-Yasmin1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. At the time of this study, Kangaroo Mother Care was limited in the community and district health care settings in Malawi, but services are now being scaled up and hopefully may improve rates of post-neonatal mortality in these late preterm-born infants <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Victora1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>Male infants within our cohort of infants born at term were more likely to die than female infants in the post-neonatal period. There is limited evidence that gender does have an effect on perinatal, neonatal <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Ulizzi1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and under five death rates <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Kanungo1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, but the reasons for this are not clear.</p><p>There is little information on cause of death in infants in resource-poor settings, particularly in early infancy. Verbal autopsy tools in this population were found to be useful and we documented more deaths in preterm infants associated with respiratory problems compared to infants born at term. In the absence of an agreed definition and framework for measuring morbidity in community settings in children, we used reported health-seeking behaviour as a proxy measure. Almost all mothers reported their children as well at the time of the study taking place. Almost all mothers had visited a health centre for routine weighing and immunisation and almost one in four children had been admitted as an inpatient in the first 2 y of life. There was no difference in health-seeking behaviour between babies born preterm and those born at term. The reports from the mothers of their children being &#x0201c;well&#x0201d; at the time of the study was surprising considering the morbidity we then encountered in terms of malnutrition, developmental delay, and the high rates of admission to the health centre. Our tools for assessing morbidity were clearly not specific enough and highlight that parent-reported morbidity is not a good measure of childhood morbidity. Currently, an agreed framework or standard for measuring morbidity in children is not available and further studies using other approaches are very much warranted <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Rudan1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>In our cohort, children born preterm were significantly more likely to be underweight and wasted and did not demonstrate catch-up growth in contrast to those born at term. Comparison with studies from high-income settings is difficult as most have studied very preterm or low birth weight infants <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Hack1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001121-Saigal2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. We have identified one other community cohort study from a middle-income country (Brazil) reporting a 3&#x00025; rate for being underweight with a comparison to terms of 0.8&#x00025; <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Santos1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Rates in our study were much higher (32.3&#x00025; for term infants and 22.9&#x00025; for preterms), suggesting a much higher overall level of malnutrition in this rural sub-Saharan African population. Despite this level, only 0.5&#x00025; of children in our study were admitted for malnutrition despite routine weighting of babies. This finding suggests that there must be some difficulties for health care providers in either recognising or referring these children with malnutrition. In our population, weight was the indicator that most clearly showed demonstrable differences between the two groups. Weight is often a more sensitive measure of differences between groups and it is recognised that length is consistently more difficult to measure accurately than weight <xref rid="pmed.1001121-DeOnis1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>; this may reflect why significant differences between the groups were seen for WAZ and WLZ but not LAZ. The higher-than-expected levels of low WLZs in our population may also be a reflection of this. It may be that we were observing more acute changes in malnutrition in our sample. We did not have accurate birth weights on enough of the infants to be able to measure change in weight over time between the two groups. Therefore it is not clear from our study whether the significant differences in WAZs between the two groups may be more innately related to preterm infants also being born small for gestational age and never catching up. There were no significant differences in breastfeeding rates at each of the ages assessed to account for the differences in weight between the two groups. We did not have information about supplementary feeding and age of introduction. Considering our findings however, longitudinal studies in this population using both ultrasound to measure gestational age, birth weights, and serial growth measurements with clearer assessments of breastfeeding and complementary feeds could clarify some of these issues.</p><p>Infants born preterm were twice as likely to be identified as having a disability using the TQQ as well as to fail the MDAT. Studies from high-income countries have demonstrated educational difficulties in children born late preterm. As far as we are aware, there are no similar studies on developmental outcomes in cohorts of accurately gestationally dated late preterm-born infants from a low-income setting. A study in Bangladesh measured development using a variety of more complex assessment tools adapted from those in high-income countries (Bayley II and Stanford Binet) <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This study demonstrated significant differences in development, at a slightly higher level than ours, but the babies were much more preterm (&#x0003c;33 wk gestation) and dated using proxy measures. We have shown that a two-stage approach <xref rid="pmed.1001121-Kauchali1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> using the TQQ followed by a more detailed developmental assessment using culturally appropriate assessment tools (such as the MDAT) is feasible even in the most rural settings. Caution is needed, however, when attributing importance to these early assessments of mild impairment as found by using a developmental assessment tool such as the MDAT. Follow-up of this cohort beyond the preschool period would be extremely beneficial to assess the actual amount of impairment, particularly as we found no differences in severe delay between the preterm and the term groups.</p><p>It is widely recognised that both nutrition and prematurity have an impact on development. We confirmed that these associations are present in this population from sub-Saharan Africa, but the cross-sectional nature of this study did not allow us to evaluate this relationship in more detail&#x02014;this would clearly be an interesting area for further research. We suggest that in the absence of more sophisticated screening mechanisms, weight and development could be used as &#x0201c;morbidity markers&#x0201d; and serve as an entry point for identifying other health needs especially for babies born preterm.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To date, interventions in low-income settings to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality have targeted the perinatal period. Our data show that, for surviving preterm babies who survive the immediate neonatal period, even in this mainly late preterm-born surviving group, there is ongoing disadvantage with increased risk of death, growth retardation, and developmental delay. Further detailed qualitative and longitudinal studies to assess the causal mechanisms for these problems would be extremely beneficial. Along with these studies, post-neonatal interventions need to be trialled that might improve outcomes in this group of preterm-born children.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge all the research midwives who collected data for the study, particularly the Senior Research Midwives, Edith Kayira and Chikondi Ntonya, and all carers and children from Southern Malawi who took part in the study.
