Untrained patients counterbalanced their improvements with worsening of sensitivity over &#x0223c;9 degrees<sup>2</sup> of their visual field. Worsening was minimal in trained patients.

Clinically, cortically induced blindness (CB) is assessed with Goldmann, Humphrey, and other forms of visual perimetry, presenting as homonymous defects contralateral to the damaged brain hemisphere.</p><p>While substantial spontaneous recovery can occur in the first few weeks to months postdamage, CB defects are then thought to become stable and permanent.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Patients are commonly sent home without visual rehabilitation, and when therapy is recommended, it tends to focus on developing compensatory eye movement strategies<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> or on using substitution, such as prism lenses.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Although able to improve visual functioning and quality of life, neither form of therapy alters the visual defect.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In fact, there is currently no widely accepted clinical method to restore vision in CB,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> although multiple research studies have shown visual training to recover particular functions within chronic CB fields (see Melnick et al.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> for review). However, whether restitution therapies improve perimetry has been relatively little explored, and results vary widely. In addition, some prior studies were confounded by poor standards and controls,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> while others yielded promising results.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> As such, significant controversy remains about the ability of restitution therapy to improve cortically blind visual fields.</p><p>The goal of the present study was to quantify the effect of visual discrimination training on Humphrey automated perimetry in chronic CB. We performed a retrospective analysis of Humphrey visual fields (HVFs) from patients with chronic CB trained using the Huxlin discrimination paradigm, with performance measured using online fixation control.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Changes in pretraining/posttraining HVFs were also compared with those from HVFs collected at 2 time points prior to the onset of training&#x02014;i.e., in untrained CB (UCB) controls.

In 5 patients (UCB1&#x02013;UCB5), 2 HVFs were collected before training, allowing assessment of HVF stability. UCB1 then completed training and was designated CB1. UCB2&#x02013;UCB5 failed to complete training or to generate reliable posttraining HVFs (appendix e-1); thus, they were not included in our trained cohort.

Training locations were chosen as sites where performance first dropped to chance (50% correct) during blind field border mapping. Patients trained at home, performing 300 trials per day, per location, at least 5 days per week. They e-mailed data log files automatically generated by the training software back to the laboratory for analysis weekly. Once performance became comparable to that at equivalent, intact field locations (measured during pretests), training moved 1 degree deeper into the blind field along the X-axis (Cartesian coordinate space). While home training was performed without an eye tracker, patients were instructed to fixate whenever a fixation spot was present. In addition, after 6 months of training, or recovering normal discrimination performance at &#x02265;2 blind field locations, home training was verified in laboratory with fixation control enforced using an Eyelink 1000 eye tracker (SR Research Ltd., Kanata, Canada).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Quantitative analysis of HVFs.</title><p>HVFs were collected as detailed in appendix e-1 and several metrics calculated by the Humphrey STATPAC software (Zeiss Humphrey Systems, Atlanta, GA) were analyzed as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Pattern deviation (PD): deviation from the age-corrected population mean for each HVF testing location.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Perimetric mean deviation (PMD): overall difference in sensitivity between the tested and expected hill of vision for an age-corrected, normal population.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Short term fluctuations (STF): test/retest variance during 10-2 HVF test.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Composite, binocular HVFs were generated in MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) by first averaging luminance detection thresholds (dB) from monocular HVFs at identical test locations between both eyes (figure e-2A), justified given the homonymous nature of the deficit.

Natural-neighbor interpolation was applied between test locations with 0.1 degree<sup>2</sup> resolution, creating composite visual fields of 121 tested locations and 161,398 interpolated data points, covering an area 1,616 degrees<sup>2</sup> in size. Difference maps were generated (figure e-2B) by subtracting the initial, composite, noninterpolated HVF from the second HVF, then interpolating the difference to create a smooth map of visual sensitivity change (trained patients: figure e-3; untrained patients: figure e-4).

In addition, a significant, long-standing controversy about the efficacy of restitution therapies emerged within the field.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The present work does not claim to resolve this controversy, but instead, offers new methodology to quantify changes in automated perimetry, with broad applicability to CB, as well as other conditions affecting central vision, such as glaucoma or macular degeneration. While interpretation of our results is tempered by small sample sizes, partial blinding, and lack of randomization, bias was partially reduced because all participants were recruited with the intent to train. They were thus treated identically in terms of testing, except that some had 2 baseline HVFs, allowing us to consider native stability of HVFs. Coupled with the previously reported lack of improvement in untrained CB patients,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> our findings both motivate and inform future clinical trials designed to critically examine the effects of vision restoration on perimetry in larger cohorts of patients.</p><p>The present results expand our previous work demonstrating substantial transfer of learning across untrained visual functions.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> We now show that training chronic CB patients to discriminate global motion, static orientation, or both also shrinks perimetrically measured field defects. This shrinkage was associated with significant improvements in PMD (&#x0223c;1 dB), the small magnitude of which is likely due to the fact that PMD is computed across the entire HVF. Here, significant improvements occurred over &#x0223c;108 degrees<sup>2</sup> or 6.6% of the total HVF. Nonetheless, prior work showed changes &#x02265;0.6 dB to be meaningful in glaucoma patients with similarly sized visual loss as our patients.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> A PMD change of 0.7 dB over placebo was also considered significant in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and mild visual loss (NORDIC Committee<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>).</p><p>Critically, HVF improvements were not influenced by patient age, time since lesion, or initial deficit size (suggesting that lesion size may not affect recovery). Thus, any patient with chronic CB may recover some lost vision following rigorous training. However, the number of training sessions and locations correlated with the area of HVF improvement. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3D</xref>, one can estimate that substantial improvements in visual sensitivity over an area 80 degrees<sup>2</sup> in size can be attained with &#x0223c;150 consecutive training sessions (of 300 trials each) at 2&#x02013;3 blind field locations. Assuming 2 sessions/d, such training should take &#x0223c;3 months to complete. However, our data also suggest that continued training may generate continued improvement. Thus, patients should train as long as improvement is observed.</p><p>HVFs repeated without intervening training revealed decreases in both local and overall (PMD) sensitivity. Whether this represents a form of visual disuse atrophy, a consequence of retrograde degeneration of neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and retina,<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> or whether patients learned to ignore weak, unreliable vision near their blind field remains to be determined. That worsening was not systematically reported previously may be due to HVF analyses in prior studies lacking sensitivity to such changes. Nonetheless, our results suggest that visual discrimination training, even when started &#x0003e;6 months poststroke, can reverse potential declines in sensitivity.</p><p>That HVF improvements occurred within trained blind field locations is not surprising. Training to detect or discriminate stimuli in the blind field improves contrast sensitivity<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and HVFs are, in essence, a luminance contrast detection task with broadband stimuli.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> However, improvements in trained tasks are typically restricted to trained locations in CB patients,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> while here, 80% of HVF improvements occurred within 10 degrees of the original blind field border, suggesting enhanced plasticity in this region. In addition, close to 86% of improvements occurred where pretraining sensitivities ranged from 3 to 18 dB, while 75% of the trained areas had baseline sensitivity &#x0003c;3 dB, a consequence of our procedure for selecting training locations. These findings highlight an interesting difference in visual functions assessed by clinical perimetry vs laboratory psychophysics: namely regions with &#x0003c;3 dB sensitivity on Humphrey perimetry appear to possess measurable, residual visual abilities, which can be retrained back to normal.</p><p>While speculative, a possible substrate of training-induced visual improvements in CB is engagement of extrageniculostriate pathways. Projections from the dLGN that bypass V1 provide direct input to V2/V3,<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> V4,<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and MT/MST.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> These pathways may mediate blindsight<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>&#x02014;residual visual processing present in some CB fields.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> After V1 damage, extrageniculostriate pathways are thought to rely primarily on koniocellular (K-cell), as opposed to parvocellular (P-cell) and magnocellular (M-cell), dLGN neurons, partly because K-cells appear to be more resistant to retrograde degeneration.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> K-cells also possess contrast sensitivity and spatial frequency preferences that match responses seen in blindsight<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> and our patients posttraining.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Finally, K-cell pathways may switch from a modulatory to a driving role following damage to V1.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Repeated, directed activation of these pathways through visual discrimination training could strengthen their driving role. This in turn may allow the residual visual system to better utilize information bypassing V1, measurably improving conscious vision both perimetrically and in visual discrimination tasks.</p><p>We used a fine-grained, quantitative analysis of HVFs to show that visual discrimination training at discrete blind field locations can generate large swaths of visual improvement and may prevent progressive vision loss in chronic CB patients. Together with the observed benefit of visual discrimination training on perimetry, the lack of effect of time since lesion on recovery suggests that a controlled, randomized, blinded, crossover clinical trial would be the optimal design to further elucidate this phenomenon in a larger patient population. Despite the limitations inherent in this pilot study, our findings remain exciting for several reasons. First, they illustrate yet another form of learning transfer in CB: a recovery of luminance sensitivity following visual discrimination training in which neither luminance nor contrast was varied. Second, this boost in sensitivity was reliably reported by CB patients during perimetry and can presumably be used in their day-to-day lives. Third, the amount of perimetry improvement attained did not depend on major demographic parameters, but was proportional to the amount of training performed. Finally, training-induced sensitivity improvements occupied previously impaired regions along the blind field border. Together, these data provide compelling evidence that contrary to established thought, cortical visual impairment is reversible in part. Specifically, visual discrimination training in chronic CB fields improves fixation-controlled visual performance on both the trained tasks and Humphrey perimetry.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>Supplemental data at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://neurology.org/lookup/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000003921">Neurology.org</ext-link></p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The authors thank Terrance Schaefer for performing Humphrey visual field tests on all the patients and Drs.
