In 1994, minimally invasive pancreatoduodenectomy (MIPD) was introduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. After a slow introduction, the use of MIPD has increased rapidly in recent years. Several cohort studies have suggested that MIPD is safe and feasible when performed by experienced surgeons in high-volume centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the benefits of MIPD in real-life clinical practice remain unclear. On the one hand, meta-analysis of cohort studies showed that MIPD is associated with decreased intraoperative blood loss (weighted mean difference, &#x02212;384&#x000a0;mL; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), less delayed gastric emptying (odds ratio, 0.7; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) and decreased length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference, &#x02212;3&#x000a0;days; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) compared with open pancreatoduodenectomy. On the other hand, MIPD increases operative time significantly and registry studies have expressed concerns on its safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Compared with open pancreatoduodenectomy, mortality might be doubled after MIPD in low-volume centers performing fewer than 10 MIPD procedures annually (8% versus 3%; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These studies raise concerns about the feasibility and generalizability of MIPD and clearly demonstrate the need for a randomized controlled trial, especially in this era when minimally invasive pancreatic surgery is gaining popularity worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">The cost-effectiveness and quality of life associated with MIPD have currently only been reported in small observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These studies reported higher operative costs of MIPD, which were compensated by lower postoperative costs because of shorter hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the limited sample sizes of these studies do not allow reliable conclusions. Moreover, outcomes of open pancreatoduodenectomy have also improved in recent years with enhanced recovery strategies leading to shorter postoperative hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These parameters should therefore be assessed in a multicenter randomized trial using an enhanced recovery setting for both MIPD and open pancreatoduodenectomy.</p><p id="Par17">In the Netherlands, a platform for such a multicenter randomized trial has been created by the Dutch Pancreatic Cancer Group (DPCG), a nationwide multidisciplinary group including all 17 centers performing pancreatic surgery in the Netherlands. The DPCG followed the internationally accepted Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, and Long-term (IDEAL) study framework for surgical innovation for the implementation of minimally invasive pancreatic surgery in the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Since 2014, the DPCG successfully implemented minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy in all Dutch pancreatic centers within the LAELAPS (longitudinal assessment and realization of laparoscopic pancreatic surgery) project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Thereafter, the DPCG initiated a similar nationwide training program for laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy (the LAELAPS-2 project) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This program included detailed technique description, video training, and proctoring sessions (on-site and off-site) by (inter)national experts. Analysis of outcomes of 114 MIPDs performed within LAELAPS-2, in the first four DPCG centers that performed &#x0003e;20 MIPDs, showed an 11% conversion rate, a 43% Clavien&#x02013;Dindo III or higher complication rate, and a 4% complication-related 90-day mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Hereafter, a structured training program in robot-assisted pancreatoduodenectomy using the Pittsburgh approach (the LAELAPS-3 project) was implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Based on these outcomes and the IDEAL study framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], it was decided that a randomized controlled trial was indicated in those centers that performed at least 20 MIPDs.</p><p id="Par18">The LEOPARD-2 trial follows the LEOPARD trial on minimally invasive versus open distal pancreatectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] but has a phase 2/3 design to assess patient safety more closely. The aim of the LEOPARD-2 trial is to compare time to functional recovery after surgery, complications, quality of life, and costs after MIPD versus open pancreatoduodenectomy, within an enhanced recovery setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par19">The LEOPARD-2 trial is a randomized controlled, parallel-group, patient-blinded, multicenter, phase 2/3, superiority trial investigating the safety and effectiveness of MIPD versus open pancreatoduodenectomy, in an enhanced recovery setting at high-volume (&#x02265;20 pancreatoduodenectomies annually) pancreatic centers who completed a dedicated MIPD training program.

Both laparoscopic surgery and robot-assisted surgery, e.g. using the da Vinci&#x000ae; Surgical System, are allowed as both are considered equivalent methods of MIPD.</p><p id="Par35">All procedures are performed by two trained gastrointestinal surgeons (see section on quality and safety). Patients are under general anesthesia; epidural is not mandatory. The patient is placed in a supine position on a bean bag. The right arm is placed along the body and the left arm in 90&#x000b0; abduction. The suprapubic region is kept free for a Pfannenstiel incision. Trocars are placed in a soft semicircular fashion: subumbilical (12&#x000a0;mm trocar), left and right to the umbilicus (two 12&#x000a0;mm trocars), 4&#x000a0;cm subcostal (two 5&#x000a0;mm trocars), with an optional 5&#x000a0;mm subxipho&#x000ef;dal trocar for liver retraction. Diagnostic laparoscopy is performed to rule out metastasis. The cystic duct and artery are transected, the gallbladder is partly mobilized and sutured to the anterior abdominal wall for liver retraction. Likewise, the round ligament is retracted to the anterior abdominal wall, with either a suture or retractor. The lesser sac is opened and a Kocher maneuver is performed. The inferior border of the pancreas and the superior mesenteric vein are visualized. The gastro-epiploic artery and vein are transected. Lymph node station 8a is dissected, followed by identification of the hepatic artery, gastroduodenal artery, and portal vein. The gastroduodenal artery is transected between multiple Hem-o-lok clips (Teleflex Medical, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). A tunnel is created under the pancreas and a 15&#x000a0;cm long vessel loop is passed and secured to itself. The stomach is transected just proximal or distal to the pylorus using an endostapler after temporary removal of the nasogastric tube. The pancreas is transected using diathermia or an ultrasonic or sealing device, but the pancreatic duct is transected sharply with scissors and intubated to ensure that it is open. The first jejunal limb is dissected from the peritoneal reflections, transected using an endostapler, and fully mobilized. The two jejunal ends are fixated using a suture, thus facilitating passing behind the mesenteric root. After retracting the duodenum and jejunum to the right side of the mesenteric root, the duodenum is stretched and the uncinate process is mobilized. First, the superior mesenteric vein and then the superior mesenteric artery branches are mobilized until the pancreatic head is fully dissected. The common hepatic artery is followed up to the right hepatic artery. Retroportal lymph nodes are resected according to the International Study Group on Pancreatic Surgery guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The hepatic duct is tunneled and transected.</p><p id="Par36">After a 15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;min break, a modified Blumgart pancreatojejunostomy is performed (preferably using 3D laparoscopy) using four 3/0&#x000a0;V-loc barbed sutures (Covidien, New Haven, CT, USA), a 10&#x000a0;cm 6&#x02013;8 Fr internal pancreatic stent, and four to six duct-to-mucosa sutures (Vicryl (Ethicon Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA) or Novosyn (B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany). In this way, the jejunal wall is folded around the pancreatic stump. Approximately 5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;cm distally, on the same jejunal loop, an end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy is performed, either using 10 to 15 12&#x000a0;cm long Vicryl 4/0 interrupted sutures or either two 4/0&#x000a0;V-loc barbed (Covidien, New Haven, CT, USA) or polydioxanone (Ethicon Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA) running sutures. Through a right subcostal stab incision, a 27 Fr surgical drain is placed through Winslow up to the superior border of the pancreaticojejunostomy. Cholecystectomy is now completed. An antecolic 4&#x02013;5&#x000a0;cm end-to-side gastrojejunostomy is performed using an endostapler, and closed using a V-loc barbed 3/0 suture (Covidien, New Haven, CT, USA). In the case of a pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy, an end-to-side duodenojejunostomy is performed using running V-loc barbed 3/0 sutures (Covidien, New Haven, CT, USA). The specimen is extracted through a Pfannenstiel incision, which is subsequently closed in layers. A second surgical drain is placed from the right, at the inferior border of the pancreaticojejunostomy with the tip under the gastrojejunostomy. Alternatively, this second drain may be placed from the left. After hemostatic control, trocars are removed and all 12&#x000a0;mm fascia openings and the skin are closed. Optionally, preperitoneal continuous wound catheters are placed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For robot-assisted pancreatoduodenectomy, the Pittsburgh approach is followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Control: open pancreatoduodenectomy</title><p id="Par37">Patients undergo multimodal pain therapy with either an epidural catheter or preperitoneal wound catheters with patient controlled analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Subcostal laparotomy is performed. The steps taken are essentially similar to MIPD but the variation in technique is expected to be larger. Since outcomes of open pancreatoduodenectomy in the Netherlands are good, the surgical technique in the control arm reflects their usual practice; also, the anastomoses will be performed according to local protocol. Procedure variations according to the surgeon&#x02019;s preference are allowed, but must be recorded in the case record form.

An unplanned open reconstruction in a patient randomized for MIPD in whom the procedure was started minimally invasively (i.e. procedure with laparoscopic resection and open reconstruction) will be reported as conversion. Patients allocated to MIPD who undergo intraoperative conversion to open pancreatoduodenectomy will still be analyzed in the MIPD group according to intention-to-treat principles.

The quality of blinding is assessed by asking patients whether they think the operation was performed minimally invasive or via an open approach on day 3 and just before removing the abdominal dressing (i.e. when functional recovery has been reached, or on day 5). If earlier inspection is required, attempts are made to maintain patient blinding unless there is a medical reason to remove the dressing (e.g. wound infection).

However, considering that (a) the duration of recovery will most probably be censored in only 4% of patients at a maximum and that (b) taking the full length of the postoperative observation period as a proxy estimate for the time to recovery in these outlying patients will hardly affect the comparison of the study groups because of the non-parametric testing strategy with the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test and, finally, that (c) a power of 80% for a Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis as its best alternative can only be achieved at the cost of a much higher and infeasible patient inclusion rate, we will analyze the data as if no censoring takes place.

LEOPARD-2 follows the LEOPARD trial on minimally invasive versus open distal pancreatectomy and the Longitudinal Assessment and Realization of Minimally Invasive Distal Pancreatectomy in the Netherlands training programs (LAELAPS-1, &#x02212;2 and &#x02212;3) in minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted pancreatoduodenectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These programs were initiated by the DPCG, a national collaboration of surgeons, gastroenterologists, medical oncologists, pathologists, (interventional) radiologists, dietitians, and nurses.</p><p id="Par66">All randomized controlled trials on new surgical techniques face a dilemma over when to start including patients. During the design phase of the LEOPARD-2 trial, the timing of the start of the trial in relation to the learning curve was discussed at several meetings. Previous surgical trials on minimally invasive surgery have been criticized for their timing, because of either starting too early or too late. For instance, the multicenter, randomized controlled MANCHET trial on minimally invasive fundoplication in gastro-esophageal reflux disease was criticized for starting too early (i.e. before completion of the learning curve) with consequently inferior results for the minimally invasive approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This was confirmed by a follow-up study (i.e. after the learning curve) by the same group, which found superior outcomes for minimally invasive fundoplication. Recently, the ORANGE trial on minimally invasive liver surgery was stopped early because of slow accrual owing to strong patient and surgeon preference for the minimally invasive approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. One could conclude that this trial was initiated too late, in a phase when both patients and surgeons felt the minimally invasive approach was shown to be superior, and the essential period of perceived surgical equipoise had already been passed.</p><p id="Par67">The DPCG initiated a structured training program for minimally invasive pancreatic surgery in the Netherlands. After training in minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (LAELAPS-1), outcomes were superior as compared with the period prior to training, including 8% conversion rate and 0% mortality in 130 minimally invasive procedures. Consequently, the same teams of surgeons were trained in laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy (LAELAPS-2). Again, outcomes were sufficient, including 11% conversion and 4% complication-related mortality in the first 114 procedures from four centers who completed&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;20 MIPDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Next, the length of the learning curve was discussed, taking the argument on timing (not too early, not too late) into account. Based on the results for the first 114 procedures and a previous report, a minimum of 20 total minimally invasive procedures was decided to be the cut-off to participate in the LEOPARD-2 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">This cut-off of 20 procedures was also reported in an international survey among 435 pancreatic surgeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Possibly, better outcomes could be obtained with higher cut-offs, such as 80 procedures as reported in a study for operative time, but not for conversion or mortality, where 20 procedures seemed to suffice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, as this study does not focus on operative time as the primary endpoint measure and such a high cut-off might lead to the danger of performing the trial too late, leading to passing the critical period of equipoise and both the patient&#x02019;s and doctor&#x02019;s preference shifting to some extent, postponing the trial would be fatal for its execution. Furthermore, it should be realized that it will take 4 to 8&#x000a0;years for most centers to perform 80 procedures minimally invasively. It would seem unethical if so many patients were to be exposed to a potentially increased surgical risk during such a long learning period. In other words, the cut-off of 20 procedures was also chosen for pragmatic reasons, including high external validity (i.e. reflecting clinical practice in most centers), rather than for the highest likelihood of positive results (i.e. superior outcomes for MIPD).</p><p id="Par69">Another point of discussion is the primary endpoint. As in the LEOPARD-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and ORANGE trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], postoperative time to functional recovery was chosen as the most objective parameter for postoperative recovery. Length of hospital stay was considered less objective, as it is also related to patient preference, home care facilities, and doctor preferences. An alternative endpoint measure, overall or clinically relevant complications, has mainly been reported in retrospective studies and a significant difference between minimally invasive and open pancreatoduodenectomy has not been confirmed by case-matched studies or meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Both complications and length of hospital stay are, however, assessed in the LEOPARD-2 trial and will be reported in the final publication.</p><p id="Par70">Because of the standardized reporting of the LAELAPS-1 and &#x02212;2 training programs, the LEOPARD-1 and &#x02212;2 trial registration, the LEOPARD-1 and &#x02212;2 study protocols and final publication of results, the internal validity can be well interpreted. The LEOPARD-2 trial includes all adult patients undergoing elective pancreatoduodenectomy for nearly all indications. Additionally, surgical procedures will be performed in both academic hospitals and large teaching hospitals by surgeons who have all completed the LAELAPS-1 and &#x02212;2 training programs. This should be taking into account when assessing the external validity of LEOPARD-2. Our group strongly recommends this approach of specific procedure-based training before starting MIPD, given the obvious complexity of the procedure with the required surgical skills.</p><p id="Par71">Blinding of patients in surgical trials has long been deemed impossible. However, several randomized controlled surgical trials have shown that patient blinding is feasible in case of a dedicated protocol committee and trial coordination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Multiple publications in high-impact journals have emphasized the importance of blinding in randomized studies, as in surgical studies results are also likely to be influenced by the patient&#x02019;s expectation (i.e. the Hawthorne effect) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. As in the LEOPARD trial, we attempt to improve study quality as much as possible, and therefore decided to add patient blinding. In this way, we minimize the effect of patient&#x02019;s expectation on the primary study outcome measure, time to functional recovery, an endpoint measure that is obviously influenced by psychological factors.</p><p id="Par72">In conclusion, the LEOPARD-2 trial is a multicenter randomized controlled phase 2/3, superiority trial investigating safety and time to functional recovery of MIPD and open pancreatoduodenectomy performed by surgeons who have performed&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;20 MIPDs within a dedicated training program. This trial aims to provide level one evidence on the added value of the minimally invasive approach in daily practice within high-volume (&#x0003e;20 pancreatoduodenectomies annually) centers, just after 20 procedures have been performed. When this hypothesis is confirmed, it will enhance the worldwide implementation of MIPD, and consequently improve overall patient outcome.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par73">The first patient was randomized on 2 March 2016.
