<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and is the most effective and preferred option for patients requiring a step-up in asthma controller therapy, at least in adolescents and adults. However, although almost all studies have confirmed that the addition of a LABA reduces asthma exacerbations, controversy has arisen around data from a large-scale safety study<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and meta-analyses<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> suggesting that more severe and life-threatening asthma events and even deaths may be increased in patients receiving LABAs. A possible explanation for this apparent increase in risk is the failure of patients being treated with LABA to receive concurrent ICS treatment.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Indeed, this has been supported by meta-analyses comparing ICS/LABA administered as concurrent treatment (rather than from separate inhalers) with ICS alone.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Nonetheless, this concern has resulted in reassessment of the benefits and costs of combined treatment with LABA and ICS, whether as mono-components or in combination inhalers, and for studies to examine more closely rare severe life-threatening asthma exacerbations.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Thus, large prospective safety trials of currently marketed LABAs are underway internationally.</p><p>A new ICS/LABA combination currently being evaluated for use in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease contains fluticasone furoate (FF) and vilanterol (VI). FF is a novel ICS structurally distinct from fluticasone propionate (FP), with an ester derived from 2-furoic acid at the C-17&#x003b1; position that replaces the simpler propionate ester,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> conferring both greater affinity for the GC receptor and longer retention in respiratory tissues than FP.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Once-daily FF has been shown to be effective in phase IIb trials,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref> and the FF dose used in this study was selected on the basis of data from these studies. VI is a once-daily inhaled LABA shown to produce prolonged bronchodilation for at least 24&#x02005;h. Previous clinical studies of FF/VI delivered from a single inhaler, conducted in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and including higher dosages of FF than in the present study, have shown this combination to have an acceptable safety profile.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

FF/VI also significantly improved trough FEV<sub>1</sub> and the number of patients achieving well-controlled asthma. FF/VI had a good safety profile without evidence of life-threatening asthma events. Reducing asthma exacerbations is considered in asthma guidelines to be the most important endpoint of future risk, and is of considerable benefit to patients because of their impact on quality of life and the high healthcare costs associated with their management. Although increasing the dose of ICS has been shown to be highly effective at reducing exacerbation risk, this approach needs to be considered in conjunction with the potential side effects of long-term use of higher doses of ICS.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>The results with FF/VI are consistent with those of many studies, confirming that the addition of a LABA to a medium dose of ICS improves lung function and asthma control and reduces the risk of severe asthma exacerbations including hospitalisations.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref> However, our study is the first to demonstrate this improvement with once-daily dosing. We did not compare the efficacy of FF/VI treatment with doubling the dose of FF in this cohort of patients with uncontrolled asthma, but results from studies with that design have provided clear evidence of greater clinical benefit of combination therapy compared with doubling the dose of ICS.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;26</xref> Unlike FP and beclametasone dipropionate, for which three doses are available for use in adults, two doses of FF will be available for use in adults/adolescents. FF 100&#x02005;&#x003bc;g is suitable for use in patients who require FP 100&#x02013;250&#x02005;&#x003bc;g twice daily and FF 200&#x02005;&#x003bc;g is suitable for patients who require FP 500&#x02005;&#x003bc;g twice daily or equivalent. Therefore, in this study, some patients will have been randomised to a similar ICS dose to baseline and some may have received a reduced ICS dose.</p><p>In this study the results of secondary endpoints, including annualised rate of severe exacerbations, further support the primary endpoint. The improvements in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> and reductions in ACQ7 scores confirm superior current asthma control with the FF/VI combination. In addition, the frequency of severe asthma exacerbations leading to hospitalisation, emergency room visit or unscheduled healthcare provider visit was similar for both FF and FF/VI. Thus, there was no indication of an increased risk of such severe events with the addition of the LABA, a finding that is consistent with several meta-analyses of studies comparing combined ICS/LABA with ICS alone.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>

In this study two new treatments were compared: a new once-daily moderate dose of FF and FF combined with VI. The resultant annualised rate of severe asthma exacerbations was low in both treatment groups, 0.19 for FF (corresponding to approximately one exacerbation every 5&#x02005;years per patient) and 0.14 for FF/VI (one every 7&#x02005;years), despite the fact that all patients were required to have had a severe asthma exacerbation during the 1-year period prior to randomisation. The exacerbation rate observed in the FF group compares favourably with those observed in previous studies of patients uncontrolled on medium-dose ICS, in which annualised rates ranging from 0.31 to 0.35 were reported for patients receiving budesonide alone.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>

Thus, the 25% decrease seen in this study represents a clinically useful improvement from an already very low base rate.</p><p>Regarding safety, FF and FF/VI were well tolerated and the incidence of treatment-related adverse events and all SAEs was low and similar across treatment groups.

In addition, the monitoring of rescue use preceding and during the time of each severe asthma exacerbation confirmed that exacerbations were preceded by a period of loss of asthma control, supporting the accuracy and appropriateness of recording of asthma exacerbations.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>Strengths of this study include its innovative design in which the duration was not predetermined. Instead, the study was terminated when a specified number of acute exacerbations had occurred. In addition, most patients remained in the study and received treatment for 52&#x02005;weeks or more, thus permitting a reliable determination of the annualised rate of severe asthma exacerbations. In contrast, in studies of fixed duration, although nominally of 12&#x02005;months&#x02019; duration, mean exposures to study drugs are reduced owing to premature withdrawals, particularly for patients who experience exacerbations. However, the event-driven design makes it difficult to compare the results of the present study with those of fixed duration. In our study, informative censoring did not occur differentially between the two treatment arms.</p><p>The dose of FF/VI (100/25&#x02005;&#x003bc;g) used in this study was selected on the basis of data from earlier phase dose-ranging studies.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> FF 100&#x02005;&#x003bc;g was used as the comparator, ensuring that all patients were treated with at least a mid-strength ICS throughout the study. This study was not designed to compare the effect of adding a LABA with that of increasing the dose of ICS. The study did not examine the effect of time of dosing. Finally, the study population exhibited marked bronchodilator responsivenes to a &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist (salbutamol) at the screening visit (approximately 500&#x02005;mL and 22% of baseline), although only 200&#x02005;mL and 12% was required for inclusion.</p><p>In summary, this study confirms that the combination of FF/VI 100/25&#x02005;&#x003bc;g administered once daily in the evening to adolescents and adults with moderate asthma significantly reduced the risk of severe asthma exacerbations, improved lung function and led to asthma control in a larger proportion of patients than FF 100&#x02005;&#x003bc;g. Both treatments were well tolerated with similar safety profiles and a low incidence of treatment-related AEs and SAEs, and no increased risk of serious asthma-related events was seen with the addition of VI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="thoraxjnl-2013-203600-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1072" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all patients and investigators involved in the study, and the members of the adjudication committee and Independent Data Monitoring Committee.
