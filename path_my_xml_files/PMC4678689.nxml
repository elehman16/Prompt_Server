Approximately 500 to 1000 procedures per 100,000 head of population are performed annually in developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The most common complication following UAS is a post-operative pulmonary complication (PPC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] with a reported incidence of 13&#x02013;53&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This is higher than the incidence for other major surgical procedures such as open lung resection, cardiac surgery via sternotomy, open lower abdominal surgery, and orthopaedic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A PPC is either a specific respiratory complication such as pneumonia or an undefined respiratory dysfunction that is clinically significant, compromises a patient&#x02019;s predicted recovery, and requires additional medical management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The variability in PPC rates following UAS may be explained by the differing studied patient risk profiles and PPC definitions utilised.</p><p>Respiratory pathophysiological changes after UAS are well reported, including atelectasis, impaired mucociliary clearance, diaphragm dysfunction, reduced lung volumes, and respiratory muscle and cough strength deficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These can contribute to bacterial proliferation and/or severe atelectasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], thus increasing respiratory infection risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. PPCs are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, hospital expenditure, and length of stay (LOS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Strategies to prevent PPCs should remain a high priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] due to their relatively high prevalence, relationship to poor patient outcomes, and increased health care costs.</p><p>Preventative non-pharmaceutical therapies such as coached deep breathing and coughing (DB&#x00026;C) exercises and early ambulation are traditionally provided to patients following UAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Additionally, incentive spirometers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] can be utilised. These are often delivered by physiotherapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], though in countries where physiotherapists are not involved with this patient group, this type of respiratory therapy is provided by nurses, doctors, or other health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, the efficacy of post-operative respiratory therapy to prevent PPCs following UAS is controversial. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have concluded that lung expansion exercises including DB&#x00026;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], incentive spirometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and PEP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] are of little benefit in reducing PPCs, with only NIV considered efficacious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Specifically, when post-operative ambulation is standardised, the addition of DB&#x00026;C exercises does not reduce the incidence of PPCs in addition to assisted early ambulation alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, almost all clinical trials have included pre-operative physiotherapy (Pre-Op) education and training as usual care delivery to all participants. It is possible that this intervention alone may have independently reduced the risk of a PPC.</p><p>Evidence from six clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] suggests that a single Pre-Op education session may reduce PPC rates by up to 78&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] after UAS. However, these trials have methodological limitations, including small sample sizes, inconsistent end points, generalisability restrictions (single-centre trials, predominantly low-risk patient groups), sources of bias (non-random sampling, unblinded assessors and Hawthorne effects), and non-standardisation or reporting of potential confounders. These methodological limitations bring the reported effect on PPC rates with pre-operative physiotherapy education into question.</p><p>Even if the reported benefit on PPC rates is a true effect, it is not known if Pre-Op education and training would be effective in the context of recent advances in perioperative management such as Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) guidelines. This multimodal package of 10&#x02013;18 care elements provides significant improvements in complication rates and LOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Pre-operative education and lung expansion training are strongly recommended within ERAS guidelines, although it is acknowledged that evidence to support this specific element is weak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Additionally, Pre-Op physiotherapy interventions previously studied were predominantly provided the day before surgery. This may not reflect current practice where, in many centres, patients attend a multi-disciplinary assessment clinic one to 6 weeks before their operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. It is unknown whether Pre-Op physiotherapy education provided at these longer time intervals might also produce the previously reported effect on PPC prophylaxis.</p><p>Surveys of physiotherapy services to UAS patients in Australia have shown a stark reduction in hospitals (20&#x000a0;% down to 5&#x000a0;%) providing Pre-Op physiotherapy over the past 15&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The reasons for this disinvestment of services are unknown. There are no cost-benefit analysis studies investigating physiotherapy to reduce respiratory complications, so conclusive evidence to inform the allocation of physiotherapy services to pre-operative education and training is lacking. Additionally, only short-term outcomes have been assessed. Reducing PPCs during the acute hospital stay may also improve important patient-focused longer term outcomes such as health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and physical capacity following discharge.</p><p>Considering the relative high incidence of PPCs following major UAS and the benefit to both the patient and the health care system if these were reduced, a well-designed, adequately powered trial is needed to determine both the clinical effect and cost benefit that Pre-Op physiotherapy education and training may, or may not, have on reducing PPC incidence following major UAS. Results will guide future cost-effective allocation of services to patients who require UAS.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Trial objectives</title><p>The primary objective of the Lung Infection Prevention Post Surgery - Major Abdominal - with Pre-Operative Physiotherapy (LIPPSMAck POP) trial is to estimate the effect that Pre-Op physiotherapy education and training has on the incidence of PPCs following major UAS, when compared to an information booklet alone. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of Pre-Op physiotherapy on hospital and ICU LOS, hospital costs, incidence of pneumonia, unplanned ICU admissions, time to early ambulation, readiness to discharge from hospital, and, at six weeks following surgery, patient-reported complications, HRQoL, and functional capacity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p>The LIPPSMAck POP trial is a pragmatic, investigator-initiated, bi-national, multi-centre, randomised controlled, parallel group, clinical trial.

Participants will be given an estimate of their likelihood of a PPC based on a risk prediction tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and educated about the effect of anaesthesia, UAS, and bed rest on mucociliary clearance and lung volumes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. To ameliorate these factors and prevent bacteria stagnation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] the importance of participating in an early post-operative ambulation program and performing self-directed DB&#x00026;C exercises will be emphasised. Participants will be informed that a physiotherapist will assist them to walk as soon as possible on the first post-operative day, aiming for a duration longer than 10&#x000a0;min and at a pace causing mild breathlessness. Outside these assisted sessions, participants will be advised to walk or exercise by their bedside as frequently as they are able.</p><p>As it is frequently not possible to ambulate as early and as often as recommended to assist in preventing respiratory complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], participants will be educated on the necessity of performing self-directed breathing exercises to protect their lungs following their operation. They will be instructed to perform DB&#x00026;C exercises immediately from waking from the anaesthetic and then every hour during daytime waking hours until their first ambulation session, and then at any time when they are not ambulant. The physiotherapist will coach each participant in at least three repetitions, and as many as required to master technique as judged by the physiotherapist. This trial&#x02019;s DB&#x00026;C exercises consist of two sets of 10 slow-flow breaths to maximum inspiratory capacity with two to three inspiratory sniff breath stacking manoeuvres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Each breath is held for 3 to 5 s. Each set of 10 breaths is followed by three coughs, or a forced expiratory technique with an open glottis called a &#x02018;huff&#x02019;, with a small firm pillow pressed over on the abdominal incision to support the wound and to encourage greater expiratory force. Participants will be encouraged to practice these exercises prior to their operation to develop familiarity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Standardisation of pre-operative interventions</title><p>The information booklet content will remain consistent between participating centres, although the formatting may change for site-specific requirements. All participating pre-operative physiotherapists will be required to view a scripted audio-visual recording of the pre-operative intervention prior to recruiting their first patient. They are instructed to adhere to the overall themes and premises of information delivery as included within the protocol script and video. Years of experience, seniority grade, and numbers of participants seen by each physiotherapist will be reported.</p><p>Ideally, interventions will be provided in person at PAC within six weeks of the scheduled surgery. However, in keeping with a pragmatic approach, if an eligible patient or physiotherapist is unable to attend PAC, patients can be enrolled, randomised, and provided with the interventions on another convenient day, or via telephone, prior to surgery. The mode of delivery will be recorded and the total proportion of telephone sessions will be reported. If a participant&#x02019;s operation is delayed and the time from Pre-Op physiotherapy to day of surgery becomes greater than 42&#x000a0;days, a physiotherapist will contact the participant by phone for a review assessment and to remind them to read the booklet as provided at PAC. Participants allocated to the intervention group will, in addition, have a review of the education session and the DB&#x00026;C exercises repeated over the phone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Standardisation of post-operative procedures</title><p>At the first available opportunity following surgery, all participants will be seen by a physiotherapist for a standardised assisted ambulation session (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Ambulation is defined as marching on the spot beside the bed or walking away from the bedside for more than 1 min. Once a patient is ambulant for more than one minute, an Allied Health Assistant (AHA) will conduct all further ambulation sessions. If an AHA is unavailable, then a physiotherapist will continue to provide assisted ambulation. Health professionals (profession and years of experience) delivering ambulation will be reported.

The proportion of retrospective assessments will be reported. Components will be collected via the patient&#x02019;s medical record and pathology/radiology databases. Diagnostic components (chest X-ray (CXR), white cell count (WCC), sputum microbiology) are recorded only if results are available.

The final manuscript will be written in accordance with the CONSORT extensions for a pragmatic trial using a non-pharmacological intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Studies in major UAS that have used the same PPC diagnostic tool as our group have reported a PPC rate of 13&#x02013;18&#x000a0;% across all types of UAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] with a specific rate of approximately 40&#x000a0;% in high-risk patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Due to high incidence rates and costs of PPCs to patients and health care systems, there is great interest in their prevention.</p><p>Several clinical trials have compared a variety of different types and combinations of interventions to prevent PPCs. Trials demonstrating improvements in PPC rates have used multimodal interventions, so it is difficult to determine which component is effective in reducing PPCs, or indeed, if it is necessary to provide the whole &#x02018;package of care&#x02019; to gain a significant benefit. This may influence resource provision, as providing the full package of therapy exactly as studied to gain the reported reduction on PPC rates may not be feasible, could be costly, and, indeed, may not be necessary in its entirety. Previous clinical trials have demonstrated that a single pre-operative education session can reduce PPC incidence to as low as 6&#x000a0;%, compared to a no-treatment control group rate of 27&#x000a0;%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], though assessors were un-blinded and potential confounders were not reported. Further, these trials were conducted 10&#x02013;15 years ago, and changes in surgical and perioperative care have been significant in this time. The potential to significantly reduce the incidence of a high impact complication such as a post-operative respiratory complication with a low-cost and easily provided intervention of a single pre-operative physiotherapy session is appealing. It may not be &#x02018;how much&#x02019; physiotherapy that is important, but rather &#x02018;when&#x02019; that physiotherapy is provided. Unfortunately, conclusive evidence to support this hypothesis is lacking.</p><p>The LIPPSMAck POP trial is the first randomised controlled study powered and designed to investigate whether Pre-Op education and training reduces the incidence of PPCs. This RCT has been specifically designed to address previous methodological shortcomings in clinical trials investigating this intervention. Eligible participants are all patients listed for elective upper abdominal surgery and are representative of the heterogeneous nature of patients listed for these procedures. To ensure generalisability of results, the intervention will be delivered pragmatically and reflect current service delivery in Australia and New Zealand. Pre-operative education will be provided by a range of physiotherapists with different experience levels, including supervised students. The intervention and control has been designed and standardised to be provided by a physiotherapist of any experience level.</p><p>The active control of being assessed by a physiotherapist and receiving an identical subjective and objective interview and booklet, was chosen instead of a no-treatment comparator to specifically control for the Hawthorne effect. The LIPPSMAck POP trial standardises assisted early ambulation services and removes all physiotherapy coached respiratory therapy and provision of lung expansion devices post-operatively. We have not attempted to control for ambulation initiated by the participant or lung expansion exercises provided by nursing or medical staff and, in practice, this would be extremely difficult to achieve. However, with effective random allocation and blinding of post-operative staff members, it is reasonable to expect that patients in both the control and the intervention group will have an equal chance of having similar exposure to these factors. Regarding other known confounders such as pain management strategies, fluid administration, and intraoperative ventilation strategies, we have not attempted to standardise these due to the feasibility of doing so across three sites. Instead, the impact of potential perioperative confounders will be evaluated during statistical analysis and reported.</p><p>The primary outcome, PPC, will be measured by assessors masked to group allocation; all post-operative ward staff responsible for the delivery of all physiotherapy, medical, nursing, and general care and discharge planning will also be masked. The success of blinding procedures will be measured and reported. In modern health care delivery it is also important to consider the impact of an intervention on patient reported quality of life and not just on objective clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. It is hypothesised that if Pre-Op physiotherapy education is effective in reducing the incidence of a PPC, this may improve post-surgical recovery. Improvements in recovery may influence HRQoL following discharge from hospital, particularly physical functioning domains, as has been demonstrated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. LIPPSMAck POP will be measuring 6-week post-discharge patient reported complications, HRQoL, and functional capacity to estimate the potential effect that PPCs may have on these outcomes.</p><p>In conclusion, the LIPPSMAck POP trial is an investigator-initiated, bi-national, multi-centre, pragmatic, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial, powered and rigorously designed to test the hypothesis that pre-operative physiotherapy education prevents post-operative pulmonary complications in patients following major upper abdominal surgery.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is ongoing and is actively enrolling.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AHA</term><def><p>Allied Health Assistant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASA</term><def><p>American Society of Anaesthesiologists</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COPD</term><def><p>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p>case report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CXR</term><def><p>chest X-ray</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DB&#x00026;C</term><def><p>deep breathing and coughing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>D/C</term><def><p>discharge</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ERAS</term><def><p>Enhanced Recovery After Surgery</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FiO<sub>2</sub></term><def><p>fraction of inspired oxygen</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HDU</term><def><p>high dependency unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRQoL</term><def><p>health-related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICU</term><def><p>intensive care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LOS</term><def><p>length of stay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MET</term><def><p>metabolic equivalent</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MGS</term><def><p>Melbourne Group Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIV</term><def><p>non-invasive ventilation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAC</term><def><p>Pre-Admission Clinic</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCA</term><def><p>patient controlled analgesia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCEA</term><def><p>patient controlled epidural analgesia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEP</term><def><p>positive expiratory pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEEP</term><def><p>positive end-expiratory pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>POD</term><def><p>post-operative day</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPC</term><def><p>post-operative pulmonary complication</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RAPA</term><def><p>Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RPE</term><def><p>rating of perceived exertion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAQ</term><def><p>Specific Activity Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-36</term><def><p>36-Item Short Form Health Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SpO<sub>2</sub></term><def><p>pulse oximetry oxygen saturation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UAS</term><def><p>upper abdominal surgery</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>URTI</term><def><p>upper respiratory tract infection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WCC</term><def><p>white cell count</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>IB conceived and designed the study, drafted and revised the protocol, and is co-ordinating the trial.
