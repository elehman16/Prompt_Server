Acute ultrasonography (US) investigation to measure the diastasis between the tendon ends has previously been used to classify acute Achilles tendon ruptures; however, no study has used US to predict reruptures and functional outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>To investigate whether acute US can be used to predict the risk of reruptures and outcomes after treatment of an acute Achilles tendon rupture.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design:</title><p>Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Forty-five patients (37 men, 8 women) with a mean age of 39 &#x000b1; 9.2 years (range, 23-59 years) from a cohort of 97 patients participating in a randomized controlled study comparing surgical and nonsurgical treatment were included. US was performed within 72 hours from the index injury. Diastasis between the tendon ends was documented. Reruptures were documented, and the patients&#x02019; functional outcomes were measured 12 months after injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients with a diastasis of &#x0003e;10 mm treated nonsurgically had a higher degree of rerupture. In the nonsurgically treated group, 3 of 4 patients with a diastasis of &#x0003e;10 mm suffered from rerupture (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001). Moreover, in the nonsurgical group, there was significantly worse outcomes in patients with a diastasis of &#x0003e;5 mm in terms of patient-reported outcomes using the Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS) (<italic>P</italic> = .004) and heel-rise height at 12 months (<italic>P</italic> = .048) compared with the group with a lesser degree of tendon separation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>US may be a useful tool to predict the risk of rerupture and greater degree of functional deficit. It may be an important measure in a clinical treatment algorithm for deciding whether a patient will benefit from surgical intervention after an acute Achilles tendon rupture.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ultrasonography</kwd><kwd>Achilles tendon rupture</kwd><kwd>rerupture</kwd><kwd>diastasis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>There is a seemingly never-ending debate on which treatment should be recommended for patients with an acute Achilles tendon rupture.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Results from several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have shown a higher rerupture rate in patients treated nonsurgically compared with a greater risk of wound infection after surgery.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The results after nonsurgical treatment have markedly improved since the introduction of a functional brace and early weightbearing.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Focus has recently shifted toward providing individualized recommendations.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, further research is needed to determine which factors can predict success with either treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>
</p><p>The greater incidence of rerupture in nonsurgical patients may be due to nonhealing, which in turn could be a result of a large initial gap between the tendon ends. Thermann and Zwipp<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> proposed that an initial diastasis of more than 5 mm would adversely affect the functional outcome. Ultrasonography (US) in 25&#x000b0; of plantar flexion was suggested to be able to identify those patients who were suitable for nonsurgical treatment.</p><p>US has been used as an image modality for the diagnosis and evaluation of injuries for over 20 years.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, acute Achilles tendon rupture is mainly a clinical diagnosis, where the history of an audible snap and sudden pain combined with a palpable gap and a positive Thompson test is sufficient to establish the diagnosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In patients with a typical history of trauma, a complete rupture can be assumed since partial ruptures are uncommon.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> US is not recommended as a means to establish diagnosis since there is risk that the patient is not treated correctly if the physician relies too heavily on US alone.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>
</p><p>On the other hand, Kotnis et al<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> used dynamic US as a selective criterion for determining whether patients should receive surgical or nonsurgical treatment. According to these researchers, a gap less than 5 mm was proposed as a limit for to whom nonsurgical treatment could be recommended. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prospective comparative research has been performed using acute US to predict reruptures and correlate with subjective and functional outcome. There is no study that has evaluated whether there is a difference in complications, symptoms, and function in patients with different sized diastases.</p><p>The aim of this study was to assess whether acute US could be used to predict rerupture and outcomes. The hypothesis was that in patients with an initial large diastasis between the tendon ends treated nonsurgically, there would be a greater risk of rerupture as well as inferior functional and patient-reported outcomes 12 months after treatment.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-2325967116667920"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section2-2325967116667920" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>The first 45 patients from a cohort of 97 patients from an RCT comparing surgical and nonsurgical treatment were included in this study.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> We were not able to perform US on the remaining 52 patients due to new organization within the hospital, which occurred during the RCT.

US was performed by 1 of 2 experienced radiologists using a Siemens Sonoline Antares system (Siemens Healthcare Global) provided with a variable frequency (VF) of 13.5 mHz multifrequency linear array transducer, using an 11.4-mHz default setting and scanning parameters aimed for superficial musculoskeletal scanning. Scanning of the Achilles tendon was performed in both longitudinal and axial planes assisted by dynamic scanning during passive ankle motion to facilitate identification of the tears. Moreover, extended-field-of-view scanning (SieClear, compound scanning) was done to illustrate the tendon gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2325967116667920">Figure 2</xref>), while all measurements were performed using real-time scanning. No stand-off pads were used, and scanning was performed with the ankle in both neutral and approximately 30&#x000b0; of passive plantar flexion. Frank anechoic tendon defects or tendon discontinuities of the fibrillary echo texture were direct criterion of tendon tears. The gap between the 2 tendon ends was measured in approximately 30&#x000b0; of plantar flexion at the center of the tendon gap and graded as 0 to 5 mm, &#x0003e;5 to 10 mm, and &#x0003e;10 mm. These groups were used to evaluate whether there was a difference in rerupture occurrence between groups. Measurements were performed by identifying the tendon ends on the central part of the tendon on a sagittal scan. Imaging was performed using optimal settings including the highest resolution possible, with measurements performed on zoomed images, and the mean of 3 separate measurements was used as the result value of the gap. Only the tendon fibers were scanned, and no attention was given to the paratenon.

The total number of patients in the subgroup was 4, 3 of which sustained a rerupture. This gives a positive predictive value of 75% to sustain a rerupture when having an initial gap &#x0003e;10 mm and being treated nonsurgically. Moreover, in the nonsurgically treated group, patients with an initial gap &#x0003e;5 mm had a significantly greater (<italic>P</italic> = .004) degree of symptoms (ATRS) and significantly lower (<italic>P</italic> = .048) heel-rise height.</p><p>This study supports the use of acute US to measure tendon diastasis as part of a clinical treatment algorithm to determine whether a patient with an acute Achilles tendon rupture will benefit from surgical treatment. It has been shown that surgical treatment is related to an increased risk of infection and sural nerve damage whereas nonsurgical treatment may lead to an increased risk of rerupture.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> A rerupture is one of the most serious complications; it is therefore of great interest to identify risk factors to avoid rerupture. The aim of the current research was to find measures that can help with the decision of whether surgical treatment is of benefit for an individual patient to minimize the risk of rerupture despite the increased risk of other complications. In the present study, there was a correlation between a large initial diastasis and the risk of rerupture in nonsurgically treated patients. However, our sample was too small to determine whether surgical treatment of those with a gap &#x0003e;10 mm will prevent rerupture. Our findings further suggest that a diastasis of more than 5 mm between the tendon ends indicates a need for surgical treatment to improve clinical outcomes. This conclusion is similar to the findings of Kotnis et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>
</p><p>Previous work by Thermann et al<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and Kotnis et al<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> has suggested that a more than 5-mm diastasis may be considered to confirm nonapposition of the tendon ends and hence be a recommended cutoff point to offer surgical management. If the tendon ends are not in proper contact during the first 2 weeks, this might lead to difficulties in terms of tendon healing, with either an increased risk of rerupture or poor outcome related to tendon lengthening. Voleti et al<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> have shown that if there is insufficient tendon contact in the early phase, a healing problem can be expected. However, tendon healing is similar to bone healing, with new tendinous tissue forming a callus to bridge the gap between the tendon ends. To be able to restore the continuum, the ends need proximity as strength and other mechanical properties continuously improve during the healing phase.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Even though nonsurgical treatment works well in most patients, in those with too large of a diastasis, there might be insufficient approximation of the tendon ends even if the injured leg is placed in the equinus position. In the present study, we found that the patients with a &#x0003e;10-mm diastasis had a greater degree of rerupture, indicating that the 5-mm diastasis might not be the definite cutoff point for predicting rerupture. On the other hand, those with a &#x0003e;5-mm diastasis and treated nonsurgically had a greater degree of symptoms and worse function. Hence, the results support using the size of the diastasis as a measurement for determining the need for surgical treatment, but further research is needed to confirm whether 5 mm is the optimal cutoff point.</p><p>US has previously been used early after injury.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, in this study, the purpose was to describe the frequency of various types of ruptures based on the location and contact types (contact and structure of interposition between the tendon ends). However, US is not recommended to be used as a diagnostic tool due to occurrence of false negatives, and patient history and clinical examination are sufficient for diagnosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In this study the diagnosis of acute Achilles tendon rupture was made by the orthopaedic surgeon during the clinical examination prior to performing the US examination.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has also been shown to be a useful tool in assessing the diastasis between tendon ends.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> However, greater costs and not so easy accessibility restrict its use. With future development within the field of radiology and with more readily available MRI scans, it seems that MRI may have an increasing role in the future of assessing rupture patterns.</p><p>ATRS is a commonly used patient-reported outcome when evaluating outcomes after an acute Achilles tendon rupture. In our study, the nonsurgical group with a diastasis of &#x0003e;5 mm scored 20 points lower than patients with a diastasis of &#x02264;5 mm (<italic>P</italic> = .004). However, this difference was not observed in the surgical group. The nonsurgical group with a diastasis of &#x02264;5 mm also had similar results to surgically treated patients. Previous RCTs comparing surgical and nonsurgical treatment have not been able to demonstrate significant differences in ATRS after 12 months.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-2325967116667920" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>
</p><p>This study also showed that patients with a larger diastasis treated nonsurgically had a significantly lower heel-rise height compared with those with a diastasis of &#x02264;5 mm (<italic>P</italic> = .048). Heel-rise work showed a trend in favor of surgically treated patients (<italic>P</italic> = .08). The differences between nonsurgically and surgically treated patients were smaller and nonsignificant in terms of jump tests (CMJ, <italic>P</italic> = .258; hopping, <italic>P</italic> = .749). Furthermore, when comparing surgical and nonsurgical management for patients with a diastasis &#x0003e;5 mm, there was a significant difference in heel-rise height (<italic>P</italic> = .037) and heel-rise work (<italic>P</italic> = .01). This could indicate that nonoperative treatment of a large diastasis creates a worse outcome with regard to heel-rise function.</p><p>To our knowledge, there is no previous study that has been able to correlate findings between US and functional and patient-reported outcomes in a prospective study. The treatment protocols for both groups were identical except for the surgical or nonsurgical treatment. Since these patients were all part of an RCT with very strict inclusion and rehabilitation criteria and where both groups followed identical rehabilitation protocols, we consider this to be a strength of the present study.</p><p>A limitation of the present study is the limited number of patients. US imaging was planned for the entire RCT study, but due to hospital reorganization, we were only able to perform the US assessment on the first 45 patients, which makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions regarding rerupture. Another limitation of the study is that 2 experienced radiologists performed the US examinations; however, there is a possibility for varied assessment between the investigators; interrater reliability is missing in the present study.</p><p>Finally, there is a need for further larger studies to clarify the benefit of using US as a tool to select treatment for patients suffering from an acute Achilles tendon rupture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section13-2325967116667920"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Acute US measurement of the diastasis between the ruptured tendon ends may give the treating physician an indication of the risk of having a rerupture and poor outcome, hence providing guidance in the decision between surgical and nonsurgical management. Nonsurgical management of Achilles ruptures with a gap &#x0003e;10 mm had a significantly higher rate of rerupture than nonoperative treatment with a gap &#x0003c;10 mm. Nonsurgical management of ruptures with a gap &#x0003e;5 mm led to inferior outcomes for heel-rise height and heel-rise work compared with surgical treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors thank Stefan Sewall for his help in performing the ultrasound investigations.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn1-2325967116667920"><p>The authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest in the authorship and publication of this contribution.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2325967116667920"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
