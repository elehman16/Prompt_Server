The current study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of HBV vaccine coadministered with tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine compared with HBV vaccine in healthy individuals through measuring hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) levels.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This was a randomized controlled clinical trial, which was implemented in Isfahan, Isfahan Province (Iran) in 2013. One hundred and forty healthy individuals, whose HBsAb titers were less than 10 IU/L were recruited. The subjects were randomly assigned to either in intervention or control trials. The control group received 40 &#x003bc;g of recombinant HBV vaccines intramuscularly injected at 0, 1, and 6 months; however, the intervention group was simultaneously vaccinated by Td with the first dose of HBV vaccine. HBV antibody levels (titer) were measured before the vaccination and 6 months after the last vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Antibody titers of the subjects in the intervention and control groups increased from 5.07 &#x000b1; 2.9 IU/L to 744.45 &#x000b1; 353.07 IU/L and from 4.45 &#x000b1; 3.4 IU/L to 589.94 &#x000b1; 353 IU/L, respectively (both <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

This preventive strategy includes infant vaccination at birth, which is sought by a two-dose vaccine series by 6 months of age.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Every vial of vaccine commonly contains 10 &#x003bc;g of antigen; however, this vaccination strategy fails to protect adequately in 5-10% of individuals.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] These percentages vary in accordance with the types of vaccine administrations as well as the patient's characteristics.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Different strategies have been evaluated to promote immune response to HBV vaccine. For example, third generation vaccines, which contain Pres1/Pres2/S antigens derived from mammalian cells, could partially enhance immune response.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Furthermore, immune response enhanced when Chinese adults were immunized with more antigen contents.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In another study, the potency of HBV DNA vaccines delivered with mesoporous silica as core and layered double hydroxide (LDH) as shell was endorsed.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Not only some nanoparticles such as glycol chitosan (GC), which were administered by intranasal rout enhanced mucosal immune response but also immunomodulator drugs such as levamisoles induced further seroprotective levels of HBV antibody.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Nevertheless, these strategies are complicated and have not successfully passed all of the stages of randomized clinical trials (RCTs).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Recently, the concurrent application of tetanus-diphtheria (Td) and HBV vaccine have been assessed in nonresponder dialysis patients. This clinical trial showed significantly increased responses in nonresponder individuals.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, the effects of Td and HBV vaccination on the persistent production of hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) are ambiguous. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the positive influence of Td, as an immune stimulator for HBV vaccine, on HBsAb levels in healthy and HBV-vaccinated individuals whose HBsAb titers were under 10 IU/L (individuals with insufficient immune response).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This was a randomized controlled clinical trial [Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) number: IRCT2014051015999N2), which was implemented at Alzahra Hospital (Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (IUMS), Isfahan, Isfahan Province, Iran) in 2013. Ethical approval for the study was granted by IUMS (reference number: 191049).</p><p>The study population contained the medical staff of Alzahra Hospital assigned as healthy individuals showing insufficient immune responses for HBV vaccines. The age range of the participants was between 22 years and 60 years. The female-to-male ratio was 70:30.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were those with negative HbsAg as well as those subjects who had insufficient immune response when their HBV antibody titers were lower than 10 IU/L. Exclusion criteria included malignancies, different types of immunodeficiency, and corticosteroid therapy. One hundred and forty subjects were selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria through convenience sampling methods and were randomly assigned to the control group and intervention group. Participants in both the groups were matched based on age, sex, and history of HBV vaccination. Informed consent was obtained from each participant.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Interventions and variables assessment</title><p>Participants in the control group were vaccinated only against HBV. The vaccination schedule was implemented through Cuban HBV vaccines, which were produced by Heber Company in Cuba. All of these subjects who had insufficient immune responses for HBV vaccines intramuscularly (IM) received 40 &#x003bc;g of the abovementioned recombinant vaccine at 0, 1, and 6 months.</p><p>Participants in the intervention group were vaccinated using a combination of HBV vaccine and Td in which the participants in the intervention group were administered with 40 IU of Td with the first dose of HBV vaccine; Td and HBV vaccination were conducted at different sites. The same HBV vaccination protocol was conducted in both the intervention and control groups. HBsAb levels were measured before the vaccination schedules and 6 months after the last vaccination; HBsAb titer was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a commercial kit (Diagnostic Bio probes s.r.j, Milan, Italy).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (version 18.0, Chicago, Il, USA) was used for the statistical analysis. Quantitative variables were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) and median (range) and normality of variables were assessed using Kolmogrove-Smirnov and P-P plot approaches. For nonnormal (positive skewed), logarithmic transformation was conducted. Antibody titer levels were compared from the baseline assessment to 6 months after intervention using paired samples <italic>t</italic>-test while differences between the groups based on mean differences were evaluated using independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test. <italic>P</italic> values being under 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There was no significant difference in antibody titers of both the groups before the intervention (<italic>P</italic> = 0.26); however, after 6 months, significant increases were observed in both the groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (see results of within-groups analysis). The observed increments were significantly higher in the intervention group in which the mean differences (changes from baseline values) were notably higher in Td combination with the HBV vaccination group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.011) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The levels of HBsAb titers in study groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-20-958-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study showed that Td vaccination can be applied as a feasible approach to promote efficient and persistent immunity in healthy individuals with insufficient HBsAb titers.</p><p>Immune response to HBV personally varies due to complex biological structures being accountable for the level of immunogenicity.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] For example, different studies demonstrated that variation occurred in class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA II), and interleukin 4 (IL-4) genes strongly correlated with HBV antibody levels.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Furthermore, other genes such as interferon gamma (IFNG), mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8), interleukin-10 receptor subunit alpha (IL10RA), integrin alpha L(ITGAL), interleukin 4 receptor (IL-4R), interleukin 10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-12 beta chain (IL12B), and FOXP1 as well as epigenomic modifications play some crucial roles in protective immunity.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Thus, it seems plausible that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) befell some subjects and probably contributed to part of the immune failure.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Different studies aiming to promote immune responses in immunocompromised subjects have been implemented. To elaborate, greater dose (40 &#x003bc;g) and more repeated vaccination series have been undertaken; nevertheless, the vaccination success rate did not get completely ameliorated.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] On the other hand, the persistence of antibody titers in subjects vaccinated in adulthood is somewhat ambiguous.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The present study evaluated impact of Td as an adjuvant when simultaneously applied with HBV vaccine.</p><p>This study demonstrated that antibody titers of both the groups were significantly augmented when high and frequent booster doses of HBV vaccine were applied. This finding was in compliance with previous studies, which documented appropriate promotion of immune responses.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] For example, Naveen Gara <italic>et al</italic>. documented that 94% of their healthy adult subjects receiving booster HBV vaccine developed antibody level &#x0003e;12 mIU/mL.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] This antibody titer, however, was not perfectly favorable when the efficient protective level of HBV antibody was 100 IU/L.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>HBV revaccination in hemodialysis patients too was neither durable nor successful. For instance, only 44% of the weak responders whose antibody titers varied from 10.0 IU/L to 99.9 IU/L, developed persistent and protective antibody level for 12 months.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The persistency of antibody responses failed while different approaches were exploited. In fact, neither Td vaccine nor the high application of HBV vaccine significantly promoted durable immune responses. Of the subjects, 14.6% simultaneously vaccinated with both Td and HBV vaccine were not allocated as persistent responders, whereas 18.9% of the patients treated with four doses of HBV vaccine did not have a protective level of HBS antibody.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>From the viewpoint of the antibody difference, in comparison with the control group, our study documented that the level of antibody in the intervention group significantly increased. In addition, antibody titer of the intervention group was significantly higher than the control group. These findings were in compliance with some of the previous studies. S&#x000f6;nmez <italic>et al</italic>. showed that non-responders, who were found in both hemodialysis patients and healthy individuals and simultaneously vaccinated with tetanus toxoid (TT) and HBV recombinant vaccines (S2SRHB), produced more significant HBS antibody.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Furthermore, Ocak <italic>et al</italic>. showed that TT vaccine, which was administered 2 days before HBV vaccination, might be efficient for immune response stimulation.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Nevertheless, Shahidi <italic>et al</italic>. documented that HBsAb did not persist in those who were simultaneously vaccinated with Td and HBV.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] It seems plausible that these patients did not produce durable HBsAb due to their uremia.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] On the other hand, adult immunization schedule in 2014, which was prepared by the centers for disease control and prevention in the USA, suggested Td as a booster dose of HBV vaccine for every 10 years.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Furthermore, tetanus vaccination and its immunomodulatory impact might affect the levels of immunoglobulin G subclasses, which could constitute a dominant subclass of HBsAb.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Altogether, this data showed that Td vaccination was a feasible opportunity to promote HBV antibody in healthy individuals.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHOR'S CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>MS contributed in the conception and design of the work, definition of the intellectual content, literature research, clinical and experimental studies, data acquisition as well as manuscript preparation, editing, and review.
