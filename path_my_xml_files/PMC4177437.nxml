One-day preparation has been anecdotally reported to be effective but there are few published prospective studies comparing the safety and efficacy of one-day preparation with that of three-day preparation. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of a one-day bowel preparation with Miralax&#x000ae; with that of a three-day preparation for colonoscopy in children.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled trial with children age 2&#x02013;21&#x000a0;yrs. undergoing elective colonoscopy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive Miralax&#x000ae; for either one or three days. Children with known electrolyte disturbances, dehydration, fecal impaction, metabolic or renal disease were excluded. A metabolic panel was monitored before and after bowel preparation. Subjects reported the tolerability and side effects of Miralax&#x000ae; via a survey. Effectiveness of the bowel preparation was assessed using a stool diary and a bowel cleansing scale during colonoscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>32 subjects were enrolled; 18 received one-day bowel preparation and 14 received 3-day preparation.

Children between 2 and 21&#x000a0;years of age undergoing elective colonoscopy were enrolled into the study. The exclusion criteria for this study were a history of allergy to PEG, fecal impaction, known electrolyte abnormalities, as well as renal and metabolic diseases. Written consent from subjects or their parents was obtained at the time of enrollment.</p><p>Subjects were randomly assigned to either a one-day or a three-day preparation group. Those in the one-day group were instructed to take 4.5gm/kg/day PEG 3350 up to a maximum dose of 255&#x000a0;g and those in the three-day group to receive 1.5&#x000a0;g/kg/day, up to a daily maximum dose of 85gm and total dose of 255&#x000a0;g. Written instructions were provided to take PEG with any clear liquid. Subjects were asked to take 1 scoop (17&#x000a0;g) of PEG mixed with 8&#x000a0;oz. of clear liquid every 30&#x000a0;minutes. Those under 7&#x000a0;years of age were asked to take &#x000bd; scoop (8.5&#x000a0;g) mixed with 4&#x000a0;oz. of clear liquid every 30&#x000a0;minutes. Subjects in the three-day group were instructed to take a regular diet for the first two days of preparation and a clear liquid diet on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day. Subjects in the one-day group were instructed to take clear liquid diet on the day of bowel preparation. Subjects in both groups were asked not to take anything by mouth (NPO) eight hours before procedure except sips of water up to three hours before procedure.</p><p>Demographic data such as age, gender, race, ethnicity and weight were collected. Indications for colonoscopy were recorded. Subjects were given written instructions regarding the total amount of PEG to be taken over one-day or three-days, what to take it with, in terms of quantity and frequency, and diet while undergoing bowel preparation.</p><p>Subjects were asked to report how tolerable (easy, tolerable or difficult) the preparation was and whether they completely took PEG as prescribed. If the patient did not take the entire prescribed regimen, reasons for not completing the preparation were elucidated. Subjects were also asked if they were willing to take the preparation again in the future, if they had to. Serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and serum osmolality were checked before and after the bowel preparation to monitor the safety of the preparation. While undergoing the preparation, a stool diary consisting of stool frequency, color and consistency was completed by all subjects.</p><p>At the time of colonoscopy, the pediatric gastroenterologist (HL) involved in the study, who was blinded to the preparation given, graded the degree of bowel cleansing as poor, fair, good or excellent depending on the type and amount of liquid debris or stool present. Endoscopic images were also evaluated by a blind reviewer (a second pediatric gastroenterologist, MEB). All segments of the colon were evaluated (cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum), with photographs of each segment reviewed independently by the primary endoscopist and the blinded reviewer. A previously described grading system was used for this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A grading of excellent required no stool or small amount of thin fecal fluid to be seen. A good grading was characterized by liquid fecal matter that could be removed by suction easily. A grading of fair meant that thick stool was present, requiring suction with water lavage. A grading of poor required solid stools present with poor visualization of the mucosa. A grading of good or excellent was acceptable for the evaluation of the colonic mucosa and a repeat colonoscopy was not required. Primary outcomes measured were efficacy, safety and tolerability of PEG given one-day vs. three days for bowel preparation for colonoscopy.</p><p>Frequency and descriptive statistics were calculated. Associations between categorical variables and treatment group were measured by Chi-square or Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests. Differences between groups on continuous variables were assessed using Student&#x02019;s t-tests. P values&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. SPSS version 12.0 was used for statistical analysis.</p><p>Funding for this study was provided by the St. John Hospital &#x00026; Medical Center Graduate Medical Education Research Committee.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 32 subjects, 18 in the one-day group and 14 in three-day group, were recruited and included in the data analysis. No patients were excluded from this study based on the exclusion criteria listed. The mean age of subjects was 13.6 and 11.6&#x000a0;years in the one and three day groups, respectively. In the one-day prep group, 8/18 subjects were male, whereas, 10/14 subjects were males in the three-day group. The majority of patients in both groups, 15/18 in the one-day group and 12/14 in the three-day group, were Caucasian. In both groups, the most common indication for colonoscopy was rectal bleeding (11/18 in the one-day group versus 10/14 in the three-day group). Other indications were chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, family history of familial polyposis syndrome and Crohn&#x02019;s disease.

This is important for the patient in terms of acceptability and missed days of school and his/her parents, in terms of taking time off of work. This is one of the first prospective studies evaluating the use of PEG 3350 without electrolytes for a one-day bowel preparation for colonoscopy in children and young adults in comparison with the three-day preparation. The data from our study indicates that the safety, efficacy and tolerability of bowel preparation with PEG given one-day are not inferior to that of three-day preparation.</p><p>At our institution, PEG is usually used as a three day bowel preparation in children. A recent retrospective study by Adamiak et al. reported an efficacy of 93% with one-day use of PEG for bowel preparation in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In our patient population, a similar efficacy (100%) with one-day preparation was noted.</p><p>The side effects reported in both groups in this study have previously been reported with use of PEG for bowel preparation as well as for other indications such as constipation, fecal impaction and bowel irrigation. Although there was a slightly higher incidence of side effects in the one-day group compared to three-day group, they were well tolerated and were not statistically significant. Following completion of the bowel preparation, low serum bicarbonate and low osmolality were noted in two patients in both groups, but they were of no clinical significance in this study. As the patients were asymptomatic, repeat serologic evaluation was not undertaken at a later time to document normalization.</p><p>In the one-day group, 89% of patients reported that the preparation was easy or tolerable and 72% completely took the prescribed amount of PEG based on their weight. Those that ingested only part of the preparation reported that their stools were clear and they did not feel that it was necessary to take the remaining PEG. This did not affect the quality of bowel cleansing.</p><p>The small sample size is an important limitation of our study. This was due to a slow recruitment rate at our institution. Another possible limitation of this study is evaluation bias by the gastroenterologist evaluating the degree of bowel cleaning at colonoscopy. However, this has been eliminated by having an independent gastroenterologist (blind reviewer), not involved in the study, review the endoscopic images and grade the preparation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The data from our study suggests that bowel preparation with PEG given as a one-day preparation is tolerable, safe and effective, and is not inferior to a three-day preparation. A shorter duration of bowel preparation will increase compliance, reduce the number of school days missed for children and workdays missed for their parents. However, future studies with a larger sample size are necessary to confirm these results. Furthermore, consideration for split dose preparation, as is becoming the standard in the adult population undergoing colonoscopy, may be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] as a part of future studies.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>VK and AH collected the data.
