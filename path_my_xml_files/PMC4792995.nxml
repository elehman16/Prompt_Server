combined with exercise tasks on the function of the upper limbs and activities of daily
living. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-five stroke patients who were receiving physical
therapy at K Hospital in Gyeonggi-do, South Korea, were classified into a mirror therapy
group (n=12) and a conventional therapy group (n=13). The therapies were applied for 30
minutes per day, five times per week, for a total of four weeks. Upper limb function was
measured with the Action Research Arm test, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, and the Box and
Block test, and activities of daily living were measured with the Functional Independence
Measure. A paired test was performed to compare the intragroup differences between before
training and after four weeks of therapy, and an independent t-test was performed to
compare the differences between the two groups before and after four weeks of therapy.
[Results] In the intragroup comparison, both groups showed significant differences between
measurements taken before and after four weeks of therapy. In the intergroup comparison,
the mirror therapy group showed significant improvements compared with the conventional
therapy group, both in upper limb function and activities of daily living. [Conclusion]
The findings of this study demonstrated that mirror therapy is more effective than
conventional therapy for the training of stroke patients to improve their upper limb
function and activities of daily living.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Mirror therapy</kwd><kwd>Upper extremity</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is a disease of the central nervous system caused by partial loss of brain
function<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, which can lead to motor
disorders, perception disorders, language disorders, sensory disturbances, etc., and two out
of three patients experience damage to motor function in the upper limbs<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Furthermore, stroke can bring about limitations in activities of daily living, such as
eating and dressing/undressing; also, disability in bodily functions develops in about 66%
of patients and in activities of daily living in about 75% of patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the upper limb function of stroke patients is an
important factor in daily living that needs to be emphasized in the rehabilitation
field<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Various techniques for recovery of upper limb function in stroke patients have been
suggested, including mirror therapy, which is a relatively new treatment that recovers the
motor function of the upper limbs by inducing a reorganization of the brain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mirror therapy is a therapeutic
intervention that uses the motions of the unaffected side of the body, reflected in a
mirror, as visual feedback<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. This visual
feedback enables bilateral motor training and stimulates functional improvement of the
brain<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among recent studies on mirror therapy with stroke patients, Radajewska et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> verified significant improvements in hand
function and activities of daily living through various motor-training exercises of the
hands in 60 subacute stroke patients. Thieme et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> analyzed the effects of mirror therapy in 60 stroke patients who
were classified into three groups: individual mirror therapy, group mirror therapy, and a
virtual therapy control group. An analysis of the results showed that all three groups
improved significantly in motor function, functional levels, and activities of daily living.
However, they reported that the individual mirror therapy group showed greater improvement
in the spasticity of finger bending compared with the mirror therapy group.</p><p>However, there are only a few studies that have investigated the effects of mirror therapy
combined with exercise tasks on upper limb function and activities of daily living in stroke
patients. Focused and repetitive approaches to tasks promote the recovery of the upper limbs
and enhance the motor patterns, agility, and manipulation skills of these limbs<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore in this study, mirror therapy
combined with exercise tasks was applied to stroke patients, and the changes in upper limb
function and activities of daily living were examined in order to provide reference data for
intervention settings aimed at improving these parameters in stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 25 stroke patients, who were at least six months past their
initial diagnosis and who were being treated as outpatients at K Hospital in Seongnam City,
Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. The selection criteria were as follows: a diagnosis of
hemiplegia due to stroke, stroke of at least 6 months in duration, a score on the
Mini-Mental State Examination not lower than 24 points, understood the procedure and purpose
of the study, and volunteered to participate in the study. This study was approved by the
Institutional Human Research Review Board of Sahmyook University.</p><p>The study was structured as a pretest-posttest two-group design. Subjects who signed an
informed consent from received a pretest one week before the beginning of the four-week
exercise program and a posttest after completion of the program. The pretest and posttest
consisted of measurements of upper limb function and activities of daily living. Bias of the
tester was minimized through the blinding method. To minimize selection bias, the 25
subjects who had been identified by the selection criteria threw dice before starting the
exercises and were classified into the mirror therapy combined with exercise (MT) group if
they threw an odd number or to the conventional therapy (CT) group if they threw an even
number. Both groups performed one 30-minute exercise session per day, five days per week,
for a total of four weeks. Two therapists trained and supervised the subjects during the
exercise program.</p><p>The subjects in the MT group sat on chairs in front of a desk and bent their hip joints,
knee joints, and ankle joints at 90&#x000b0;, with both feet on the floor at shoulder width. A
mirror was stood on the desk, parallel with the median line of the body and facing the
unaffected upper limb. The size of the mirror was identical to that of the mirror used in
the study by Stevens and Stoykov<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Each
group performed the tasks with their unaffected side sequentially, from task 1 to task 9,
slowly and under the supervision of a therapist. It was agreed that each task would be
performed 10 times. The therapists encouraged the subjects to conduct the exercises with
purpose while watching themselves in the mirror. The exercise program for the MT group
included reaching, grasping, manipulation, towel folding, table wiping, sponge squeezing,
pegboard, card turnover, and typing. The therapist randomly chose each exercise task, and
the subjects performed the nine tasks alternately for 30 minutes<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The CT group performed 30-minute training sessions for the improvement of upper limb
function and activities of daily living. The subjects performed a total of nine tasks
consisting of tasks 1 through 9 (arm bicycling, peg board exercise, skateboard-supported
exercises on a tabletop, donut on base putty kneading, double curved arch, bimanual placing
cone, block stacking, graded pinch exercise, plastic cone stacking, shoulder curved arch)
alternately, while the therapist guided them on how to perform the patterns and tasks
accurately.</p><p>The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) is an assessment tool used to identify the functional
improvement of an upper limb&#x02019;s performance ability<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. It subitems include holding (six items), grasping (four items),
picking up (six items), and total movements (three items). The total score for these 19
items is 57, and a higher score is associated with a higher performance level. The
inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability of this test are r=0.99 and r=0.98,
respectively, which are quite high<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Box and Block Test (BBT) consists of 2.54&#x02005;cm cubic wood pieces and a 53.7&#x000d7;8.5&#x000d7;27.4&#x02005;cm
rectangular box with a partition at the center. This test measures the number of wood pieces
passed in one minute from one hand to the other after being picked up with one hand. The
test-retest reliability of this tool is 0.99 for the left hand and 0.94 for the right hand.
The inter-rater reliability is 0.99 for the left hand and 1.00 for the right hand<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) was developed as an evaluation tool by Fugl-Meyer et
al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, who defined 50 detailed motions
based on Brunnstrom&#x02019;s classification of hemiplegia and six-step recovery. The total score
for upper limb motor function is 66, including 18 items each for the shoulder, elbow, and
forearm, five items for the wrist, seven items for the fingers, and three items for the
coordination of the upper limbs. The score may be recorded as a percentage of recovery<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Each small test is performed three times,
and the highest score is adopted. The test duration is about 30 minutes. The inter-rater
reliability and intra-rater reliability are high at 0.995 and 0.992, and the test-retest
reliability interval is 0.94&#x02013;0.99<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) was developed by Granger and others in 1983. It
is divided into two domains: functional and perceptual. The FIM instrument comprises 18
items in six categories: self-care, sphincter control, transfers, locomotion, communication,
and social cognition. This method can objectively evaluate the activities of daily living
and has a high inter-rater reliability, ranging from 0.83 to 0.96<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All statistical analyses in this study were conducted using PASW Statistics 18.0 for
Windows. Among the general characteristics of the two groups, Chi-squared tests were used to
analyze gender, diagnosis, and Brunnstrom stage. The age, weights, heights, and Mini-Mental
State Examination scores of the patients were analyzed through independent sample t-tests.
Normality was tested using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Within-group comparisons for all
variables were performed by using the paired t-test. Independent sample t-tests were
performed to compare paretic upper-extremity function and the abilities of the two groups to
perform activities of daily living before and after the intervention. The statistical
significance level of all data was set to &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of the study subjects are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The general characteristics of the subjects (N=25)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group variable </th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MT (n=12)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CT (n=13)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">45.2 &#x000b1; 4.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">52.6 &#x000b1; 3.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.3 &#x000b1; 2.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67.5 &#x000b1; 2.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">162.0 &#x000b1; 1.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">164.7 &#x000b1; 1.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMSE (score)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.8 &#x000b1; 0.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.2 &#x000b1; 0.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (66.7%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (61.5%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (33.3%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (38.5%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diagnosis</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Infarction</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (33.3%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (30.8%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hemorrhage</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (66.7%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (69.2%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Affected side</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Right</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (33.3%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (38.5%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Left</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (66.7%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (61.5%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Brunnstrom stage</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (8.3%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (7.7%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (50.0%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (46.2%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (41.7%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (46.2%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are shown as the N (%) or mean &#x000b1; SD.

Among them, mirror therapy is widely used as a treatment that promotes the functional
recovery of paralytic upper limbs by promoting the recovery of motor function and
encouraging movement on the affected side. Both groups in the present study showed
significant intragroup differences in upper limb function and activities of daily living.
The intergroup comparisons revealed that the MT group showed more significant improvements
than the CT group.</p><p>In this study, both mirror therapy combined with exercise tasks and conventional therapy
were applied to stroke patients, and the effect on upper limb function and functional
independent measures was investigated. Both groups showed inter-group improvement, and the
MT group showed greater improvement in a comparison between the two groups. The upper limb
function testing revealed intragroup improvements in both groups, and between the two
groups, the MT group showed greater improvements. The findings of this study corresponded
with the results of Thieme et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, who
analyzed the effects of mirror therapy on 60 subacute stroke patients classified into
individual mirror therapy, group mirror therapy, or virtual therapy control groups and found
that while all three groups exhibited significant improvement in motor function, functional
levels, and activities of daily living, the subjects who received individual mirror therapy
showed more significant improvement than the subjects who received group mirror therapy in
the spasticity of finger bending. The neurological mechanism of these results can be found
in the premotor area, which is the core area of motor control and plays a key role in motor
recovery after brain damage<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kantak et
al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that mirror therapy
activated this premotor area, thereby increasing the activity of the partially damaged
primary motor area and enhancing residual upper limb motor function. Furthermore,
visualization of voluntary movement of the affected upper limb through a mirror can activate
the complementary motion area in the bilateral inferior parietal lobe and the primary motion
cortex, and this influences the recovery of motor function through reorganization, in which
the functions of the damaged part of the brain are substituted by surrounding areas after a
stroke<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The FIM results showed intragroup improvement in both groups, and the MT group showed
greater improvement between the two groups. This result corresponded with the findings of
Invernizzi et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, who carried out a
four-week program of upper limb exercises consisting of mirror therapy and false mirror
therapy in 26 stroke patients and found that both groups showed significant improvement in
upper limb function and activities of daily living, but the mirror therapy experimental
group showed greater improvement than the control group. Out present results are also
consistent with a study conducted by Park et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, who reported that when a mirror therapy program was conducted for
30 stroke patients, upper-extremity functional ability improved, and activities of daily
living values increased. Furthermore, the results of the present study also agree with the
study of Yavuzer et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, who found that
mirror therapy had significant effects on the recovery of upper limb function in subacute
stroke patients and that it also improved the self-care domain of the FIM.</p><p>This study is limited in its generalization to all stroke patients, and because the
activities of daily living cannot be fully controlled, the possibility of other factors
influencing the recovery of upper limb ability and activities of daily living cannot be
fully excluded. Furthermore, since the types of tasks were limited, the functional transfer
of the upper limbs has limitations. In the future, studies with more functional and diverse
tasks are required.</p><p>In conclusion, the two groups showed intergroup differences in upper limb function and
activities of daily living after four weeks of therapy, and the mirror therapy group showed
greater improvement. This result indicates that mirror therapy has positive effects on the
recovery of upper limb function and activities of daily living in stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Prange</surname><given-names>GB</given-names></name><name><surname>Jannink</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Groothuis-Oudshoorn</surname><given-names>CG</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Systematic review of the effect of robot-aided therapy on
