Sixty adults were recruited into a randomized clinical trial and were intramuscularly immunized with two virosomal vaccine H5N1 (NIBRG-14) doses (21 days apart) of 30&#x003bc;g HA alone or 1.5, 7.5 or 30&#x003bc;g HA adjuvanted with Matrix M. The kinetics and longevity of the serological responses against NIBRG-14 were determined by haemagglutination inhibition (HI), single radial haemolysis (SRH), microneutralization (MN) and ELISA assays. The cross-H5 clade responses in sera were determined by HI and the antibody-secreting (ASC) cell ELISPOT assays.

The NIBRG-14-specific seroprotection rates fell significantly by six months and were low against cross-reactive strains although the adjuvant appeared to prolong the longevity of the protective responses in some subjects. By 12 months post-vaccination, nearly all vaccinees had NIBRG-14-specific antibody titres below the protective thresholds. The Matrix M adjuvant was shown to greatly improve ASC and serum IgG responses following vaccination.

Human cases of H5N1 are rare, however infection results in high fatality rates. Between 2003 and January 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 694 cases of human H5N1 infections in 16 countries with 402 deaths [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. H5N1 infections have mainly been detected in the Asian continent, with Indonesia (197 cases), Egypt (203 cases), Viet Nam (127 cases), Cambodia (56 cases), China (47 cases) and Thailand (25 cases) reporting the highest number of cases [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The first known fatal case of human H5N1 in North America was imported to Canada from Asia in 2014, highlighting the potential for trans-continental spread of these viruses.</p><p>Vaccination is the main intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with influenza H5N1 infections. The Influenza H5N1 virus is a poor immunogen compared with seasonal strains or pandemic 2009 H1N1 and humans do not have pre-existing immunity to H5 viruses. Human clinical trials have shown that at least two doses of H5N1 vaccines formulated with effective adjuvants are needed to elicit protective immune responses [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Very few adjuvants are currently used in human vaccines with aluminium salts being the most widely used, but these do not augment the response to H5N1. Novel adjuvants such as proprietary oil-in-water emulsions (AS03, MF59) have shown great potential for antigen dose-sparing and augmenting immune response to homologous and cross-reactive strains after H5 vaccination (reviewed by [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). Immune stimulating complex (ISCOM) technology is another promising adjuvant with a good safety profile in humans and has been shown to augment the antibody and cellular immune response after vaccination (summarized in [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). ISCOMs are formed by strong cholesterol binding to <italic>Quillaja</italic> saponins (<italic>Quillaja saponaria</italic> Molina) forming 12nm rings, which in turn are held together by lipid based hydrophobic interactions to form spherical particles 40nm in diameter. Matrix M is a third generation ISCOM and is a mix of Matrix C, which is a highly active but slightly reactogenic sapononin, and Matrix A, which is a weaker but well tolerated saponin [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In a phase I clinical trial involving 60 healthy adults, we have demonstrated that a Matrix M-adjuvanted H5N1 (NIBRG-14) virosomal vaccine has an acceptable safety profile, capacity for antigen dose sparing and induce a balanced Th1/Th2 antibody and cellular responses, including multifunctional T cells [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

In the current study, we report in detail the early kinetics of the homologous and cross-H5 clade immune response and the long-term effectiveness of the NIBRG-14 H5N1 influenza vaccine formulated with or without the Matrix M adjuvant in humans. Furthermore, we tested the protective efficacy of the NIBRG-14 H5N1 vaccine against challenge with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infection in a ferret infection model, which is a well-established model for influenza research (reviewed by [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study participants and ethics statement</title><p>A phase I open label clinical trial was conducted in 60 healthy adult subjects (20&#x02013;49 years old) at the Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.

The random allocation was concealed from all except the clinical investigator until completion of the immunological assays. A dose escalation study was performed where five subjects from each group were vaccinated twice, 21 days (&#x000b1;1) apart with the virosomal H5N1 vaccine alone (30&#x003bc;g HA) or with vaccine (1.5, 7.5 or 30&#x003bc;g HA) formulated with Matrix-M (50&#x003bc;g) adjuvant. This was followed by immunization of the remaining 10 subjects from each group using the same vaccination schedule. A sample size of 15 was determined by the clinical investigator as the minimum number needed to detect statistically significant differences between the vaccine groups. A group size of 15 is common for first in humans, phase I trials, however, a larger phase II/III trial would be required with higher statistical power to provide further safety and immunogenicity data. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were reviewed for each subject before administration of each dose of vaccine. Blood samples were collected at 7, 14 and 21 days after each dose of vaccine and 180 and 365 days after the first vaccination.

In this study, we report in detail the early kinetics and the long-term persistence of the homologous and cross-reactive immune responses after vaccination with a candidate H5N1 influenza vaccine formulated with or without the Matrix M adjuvant. Overall, analysis of the longitudinal data using a mixed model shows that formulation with the Matrix M adjuvant significantly enhanced (P&#x0003c;0.05) the serological (HI, SRH, MN) and IgG responses against H5N1 influenza viruses (<xref rid="pone.0131652.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).</p><p>Vaccination is still the best means of combating an eventual pandemic caused by a HPAI H5N1 virus. Our findings, using the three commonly used serological assays (HI, SRH and MN) revealed a low antibody response against NIBRG-14 after the first vaccination (days 7 and 14), with only a few subjects mainly in the adjuvanted 7.5 and 30&#x003bc;g HA groups having protective responses. Three weeks after the first dose, 66% and 47% of subjects in the 30&#x003bc;g adjuvanted group had protective titres by HI and SRH assays, respectively, however only 7% had protective MN titres. This may reflect the different sensitivities of the serological assays and is in contrast to previous studies where higher sensitivities were reported for MN compared to the HI assay (reviewed by [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). Our HI titres are comparable with that observed after a single dose of H5 vaccines adjuvanted with oil-in-water adjuvants, but higher than HI titres elicited by alum-adjuvanted H5 vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131652.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This is consistent with observations from a number of clinical trials where alum failed to greatly improve the immune responses to split virus influenza vaccines in humans (reviewed by [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]).</p><p>The second vaccine dose greatly improved the protective antibody responses to the NIBRG-14 virus as measured by the HI, SRH and MN assays, but no significant increase was detected in the H5N1 specific serum IgG response. The day 42 NIBRG-14-specific serological responses, which were strongest in the adjuvanted 30&#x003bc;g HA group, were comparable to those observed in adult subjects after two doses of oil-in-water adjuvanted H5 vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131652.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131652.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131652.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], but substantially higher than an alum adjuvanted vaccine [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or a high dose (90&#x003bc;g HA) non-adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These results highlight the need for appropriate adjuvant formulation of H5 influenza vaccines for enhancing immunogenicity and the superiority of the Matrix M adjuvant over more traditional adjuvants such as alum. The seroprotection rates fell significantly by six months, although the adjuvant appeared to extend the longevity of the protective responses in some subjects, as was the case in other H5N1 influenza vaccine trials [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131652.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. By 12 months after primary vaccination, almost all subjects had NIBRG-14-speciific HI, SRH and MN titres below the protective thresholds. Interestingly, we detected long-term H5N1-reactive B<sub>mem</sub> cells in all vaccine groups at day 365. B<sub>mem</sub> cells can be rapidly reactivated upon infection or secondary immunization and differentiate into plasma cells producing high avidity antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. B<sub>mem</sub> cells may also recognize viral escape mutants more effectively than long-lived plasma cells [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Maintenance of serological memory plays an important role in combating secondary and tertiary waves of disease that may occur during a pandemic.</p><p>The humoral immune response was further characterized by determining the kinetics of the serum IgG (ELISA) and ASC (ELISPOT) responses. The NIBRG-14-specific serum IgG response peaked after the first dose (day 21), but by 6 months, the titres were similar to pre-vaccination levels. Despite the low long-term IgG titres, we have recently observed that the H5 HA1-specific IgG avidity continues to rise and was highest at 6&#x02013;12 months post-vaccination [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The NIBRG-14-specific ASC response in all groups, except in subjects vaccinated with 1.5&#x003bc;g HA peaked at day 7, which has previously been shown to correspond with the peak plasmablast (CD19<sup>+</sup>CD20<sup>-</sup>CD27<sup>high</sup>CD38<sup>high</sup>) response [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although we did not sample a time point before day 7, we believe this to be the peak response based on our previous observations with trivalent seasonal [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], pandemic H1N1 [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and candidate H7N1 [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] influenza vaccine studies in humans. The NIBRG-14-specific IgG ASC response in the 1.5&#x003bc;g HA group peaked at day 28, however as we only sampled day 28, we cannot rule out an earlier peak after the second dose. The magnitude of the day 7 NIBRG-14-specific IgG and IgA ASC response is similar to the response detected after vaccination with an alum-adjuvanted H7N1 vaccine, but substantially lower than observed after seasonal influenza vaccination in primed adults [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131652.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131652.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The weak NIBRG-14-specific ASC and serological responses (HI, SRH and MN) at day 7 may be explained by the fact that humans are generally not primed by previous exposure to avian H5N1 viruses. Therefore na&#x000ef;ve subjects may only have a small repertoire of cross-reactive memory B cell pool that can be rapidly reactivated after vaccination. Interestingly, a relatively strong NIBRG-23-specific IgG ASC response at day 7 may suggest a memory response against this strain. Furthermore, the dose-dependent increase in IgM ASC responses (day 7) observed in groups given an adjuvanted vaccine also suggests activation of a na&#x000ef;ve B cell response against the H5N1 viruses after vaccination.</p><p>H5N1 viruses continue to circulate in wild birds on three continents and based on phylogenetic characterization and sequence homology in the H5 HA gene, a number of distinctive H5N1 virus subgroups (clades) have been identified [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131652.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The wide geographical spread and the considerable antigenic diversity of H5N1 viruses are significant challenges for pandemic preparedness, as effective vaccines need to elicit broadly cross-reactive antibody responses to heterologous strains. Our data demonstrated a significant HI response against the NIBRG-88 (clade 1.1) and NIBRG-23 (clade 2.2.1) strains in the group that received the adjuvanted 30ug HA vaccine. Similar improvements in cross-clade antibody responses have been observed with H5N1 vaccines adjuvanted with MF59 and AS03 compared with non-adjuvanted formulations [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131652.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Together with clade 1 (NIBRG-14), the 1.1 and 2.2.1 phylogenetic sub-clades have caused human infections or are in current circulation, hence induction of immunity against these strains is highly relevant. The weakest cross-reactive HI response was observed against the RG-2 strain (clade 2.1.3.2) and this may reflect greater differences in the sequence homology between the HA of NIBRG-14 and RG-2 strains. Importantly, the peak cross-reactive HI responses were observed one week after the second dose. Induction of an early cross-reactive response is important, as we cannot predict which H5N1 strain will cause disease if a pandemic emerged. The long-term (six month) antibody response was poor even after formulation with the adjuvant, which is consistent with previous observations [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Administering a third (booster) H5 vaccine dose may induce longer lasting cross-reactive immune response as has been shown in several studies (reviewed by [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). The cross-clade response was further analysed in the ELISPOT assay to measure ASC and to our knowledge, this is the first report showing cross-H5 clade ASC responses in humans after pandemic H5N1 vaccination.</p><p>Ferrets are a natural influenza host and represent a well-established model for influenza research (reviewed by [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). The virosomal vaccine was tested in ferrets to investigate the number of doses and time required for inducing a protective immune response against HPAI H5N1 challenge. Vaccination reduced febrile responses, severe weight loss and prevented the local and systemic spread of the virus. Similarly, recent studies have shown that two doses of AS03 or MF59-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccines induce protective immune responses in ferrets and reduce virus shedding in the upper respiratory tract [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131652.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The reduced virus shedding as observed in our and other studies could be an important factor in limiting the horizontal transmission of the virus to susceptible hosts. We observed that two doses of the H5 vaccine in combination with the Matrix M adjuvant was required to induce high levels of HI antibody titres and protect the animals from morbidity and mortality associated with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus challenge. Mathematical modeling has shown that induction of a protective immune response within two weeks after the outbreak of influenza pandemic is required for maximal reduction in viral transmission [<xref rid="pone.0131652.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Collectively, this data suggest that ideally the population should be vaccinated twice, at least four weeks before the emerging pandemic wave in order to achieve protective immunity and minimize virus transmission.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that the virosomal H5N1 vaccine provides protection against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus challenge in a ferret model. In humans, the H5N1 vaccine induced an early and persistent immune response that was enhanced by the addition of the Matrix M adjuvant. Combining the H5N1 vaccine with the Matrix M adjuvant resulted in broader cross-H5 clade immune responses.
