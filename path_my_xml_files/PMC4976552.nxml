Kramer in 1955 postulated the &#x0201c;hydrodynamic theory&#x0201d; as follows. The dentinal tubules contain fluid or semi-fluid materials and their walls are relatively rigid. Peripheral stimuli are transmitted to the pulp surface by movement of this column of semi-fluid material within the tubules. However, he was not convinced that the theory of dentinal fluid movement was responsible for the transmission of pain of the hypersensitive dentin. Later, Brainstorm <italic>et al</italic>., 1962, proposed this hydrodynamic theory to explain the mechanism for the hypersensitivity associated with exposed dentin. The hypothesis was that movement of fluid in the dentinal tubules was capable of stimulating the pulpal nerve tissue (plexus of Raschkow). Therefore, root surface areas with an increased number of exposed (or open) dentinal tubules should have an increased potential for dentin fluid flow and hence increased DH.</p><p>The most commonly used agents in the treatment of DH are classified as anti-inflammatory agents, protein precipitants (formaldehyde, silver nitrate, and strontium chloride), tubule-occluding agents (potassium oxalate, calcium hydroxide, potassium nitrate, and sodium fluoride [NaF]), tubule sealants (resins and adhesives), and miscellaneous (lasers).[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Till date, numerous agents have been tried to eliminate this unpleasant symptom, in the form of mouthwashes, dentifrices, gel, ionic exchange gadgets (iontophoresis), etc. However, none of these agents are capable of delivering the drug constantly for long periods and requires frequent revisits by patients or may take long time for providing relief. Clinical trials have supported different approaches, and the results have been contradictory.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Several studies have described a synergistic action of lasers with NaF.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Hence, the aim of the present study was to clinically evaluate the efficacy of 5% NaF varnish and 980 nm diode laser (DL) irradiation alone and in comparison with the combination of NaF varnish and 980 nm DL in the management of DH.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 120 teeth from thirty patients were selected from the Department of Periodontics with moderate or severe DH according to the visual analog scale (VAS) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic data</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-20-307-g001"/></table-wrap><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of the patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-20-307-g002"/></fig><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Criteria for selection</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>The inclusion criteria were patients in good systemic health, good oral hygiene, and clinically demonstrable DH teeth, specifically canines and premolars, which were reliable in their response to test measurements.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>The exclusion criteria were patients with any systemic or psychological diseases, constant use of analgesic, anti-inflammatory drugs, or allergic responses to dental products, carious lesions, defective restorations, fractures, prosthesis or orthodontics appliances, periodontal pockets, mobility, or evidence of pulpits.

A possible elimination of painful symptoms resulting from the DH seems to be directly related to the interruption of stimuli transmission to the nerve endings of odontoblast processes by reducing the fluid movement inside the dentinal canalicules through the narrowing or occlusion of tubules openings.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Cervical DH has multifactorial etiology and generally more than one factor is found to be associated with this painful manifestation. Therefore, more than one treatment method should be associated to desensitize the dentin to satisfactory levels.</p><p>Conventional therapies for the treatment of DH comprehend the topical use of desensitizing agents, either professionally or at home such as protein precipitants, tubule-occluding agents,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] tubule sealants, and recently, lasers.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Any treatment that reduces the dentin permeability must diminish dentin sensitivity. The occlusion of dentinal tubules leads to reduction of dentin permeability and proportionally, also decreases the degree of DH.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>According to the hydrodynamic theory, the effectiveness of dentin desensitizing agents is directly related to their capacity to promote the sealing of the dentinal canaliculi.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Several studies [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] describe a synergistic action of lasers in association with desensitizing agents. For this reason, if laser device is used in addition to a conventional desensitizing agent, the latter remains above the tooth surface for 60 s before the irradiation.</p><p>In the present study, no difference was found at each interval for control group (placebo) for all the sites analyzed in the study.</p><p>The gradual reduction in stimuli in Group 2 (NaF) may be attributed to the reaction that occurs between NaF and calcium ions of dentinal fluid and that leads to the formation of calcium fluoride crystals, which are deposited on the dentinal tubule openings. In addition, the patency of sensitive dentin interferes with the action of therapeutic tubule-occluding agents and demands a longer treatment, as the number and width of dentinal tubules in hypersensitive-exposed areas have been shown to be higher than in normal dentin, which is in accordance with the study conducted by Liu and Lan, 1994.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The reduction in mean TS and AB stimulation with NaF varnish is also in accordance with a study done by Ritter <italic>et al</italic>., 2006[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] who reported distinct reduction in DH when observed between initial measurements and 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-week examination periods of NaF varnish and dentin bonding agents.</p><p>For Group 3 (DL) compared to baseline, there was a gradual decrease in the mean tactile and AB stimulation in 24 h, 1 week, 1 month, and 2 months. This is in accordance with a study by Matsumoto <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] which observed 85% improvement in teeth treated with laser, Yamaguchi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] observed an effective improvement index of 60% in the group treated with laser compared to the 22.2% of the control nonlased group, and Kumazaki <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] showed an improvement of 69.2% in the group treated with laser compared to 20% in the placebo group.</p><p>The power parameter used in this study was 2 W/CW which was agreeable by a study done by Liu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] This study demonstrated that 2 W/CW (166 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) was a suitable parameter for a 980-nm DL to seal dentinal tubules without excess melting of the dentin. The maintenance of this analgesic state of the dentin comes from sealing of dentinal tubule, which impedes the internal communication of the pulp with external oral fluids.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>Group 4 (NaF + DL) showed a definitive reduction for both the stimuli. Several studies [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] describe a synergistic action of lasers in association with desensitizing agents. In fact, the laser system can favor the permanence of the desensitizer for longer time than when they are used alone. Significant improvements in sensitivity was registered in all groups. DH showed a marked reduction compared to the other groups. Results are also in accordance with the study done by Umberto <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] they compared the effectiveness of 980 nm DL alone and with topical NaF gel (NaF) and concluded that DL is a useful device for DH treatment if used alone and mainly if used with NaF gel. Kumar and Mehta [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] in their clinical trial found a dramatic reduction in the VAS and cold AB index after the combination use of fluoride and laser together.</p><p>Lower reduction values were registered in Group 2 (NaF) compared to Group 4 (NaF + DL). It is probable that the better performance of combined treatment was due to the higher NaF varnish adhesion to the dentinal tubules when combined with laser energy.</p><p>Therefore, based on the results of this study, it is clear that 5% NaF varnish, DL, and the combination of 5% NaF varnish and laser, all three are able to improve the DH condition. However, combination of laser and NaF varnish yields better results in terms of decrease in hypersensitivity.</p><sec id="sec2-11"><title>The limitations of the present study</title><p>
