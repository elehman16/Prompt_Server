Leishmaniasis is endemic in 88 countries, mostly developing ones. Worldwide, 350 million individuals are at risk of leishmaniasis and 1.5&#x02013;2 million new cases of leishmaniasis occur each year, of which 75% are cutaneous <xref rid="pone.0066123-World1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Ninety percent of all cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) cases occur in 7 countries: Afghanistan, Algeria, Brazil, Iran, Peru, Saudi Arabia and Syria. It is considered as a major health problem in 14 countries <xref rid="pone.0066123-Desjeux1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0066123-Dowlati1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. CL has been reported from all provinces of Iran and is endemic in many of them.

They have to be administered only as intramuscular, intravenous or intralesional injections and could be associated with severe side effects and significant discomfort <xref rid="pone.0066123-Khatami1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. There is no vaccine available for prevention of CL for general human use <xref rid="pone.0066123-Khamesipour1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Two published systematic reviews demonstrated that there is a lack of strong evidence regarding effective, safe and inexpensive treatments for CL <xref rid="pone.0066123-Khatami1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066123-Gonzlez1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>It is logical to imagine that bringing all aspects of wound management paradigm into consideration for treating ulcerative lesions of CL may improve the results of any intervention that are used in the treatment of CL cases. Wound management paradigm includes treating the cause, wound bed preparation and patient related concerns. Wound bed preparation contains debridement, control of inflammation or infection and moisture balance <xref rid="pone.0066123-Sibbald1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Unfortunately, the conventional treatments of CL tend to concentrate only on the treatment of the causative protozoa and little attention has been paid to other aspects of wound management in this disease. In the majority of randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) in which the efficacy of different therapeutic interventions for acute Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis have assessed, principles of wound management has been ignored <xref rid="pone.0066123-Dow1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066123-Modabber1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

Almost all chronic wounds are colonized with different microorganisms and it is well known that when the bacterial burden of the wound gradually increases, it could interfere with normal wound healing, deteriorate the inflammation and pain of the wound, and results in more complex management of it <xref rid="pone.0066123-Dow1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0066123-Sadeghian1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Use of appropriate antimicrobial dressing for ulcerative CL may improve wound healing by reducing the bacterial burden of the wound and providing clean moist environment.</p><p>Silver dressing can improve local wound care through provision of infection control and moisture balance <xref rid="pone.0066123-Demling1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Silver exerts its antimicrobial effects through several mechanisms including the interaction with DNA and inhibiting reproduction and cell division, disrupting the bacterial cell wall by interacting with bacterial enzymes and proteins, which are important for cell respiration and nutrients transportation.

To compare the mean for data with normal distribution one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and for data that do not follow normal distribution proper nonparametric statistical tests were used.

In the consultative meeting to develop a strategy for treatment of CL at Institute Pasteur of Paris in 2006, it was recommended to use hydrating dressings (specially the types that contain polyurethane) for the treatment of the lesions of CL <xref rid="pone.0066123-Modabber1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Although the efficacy of the i.l. MA injections alone in the treatment of lesions of CL due to <italic>L. major</italic>, 6 weeks after initiation of this intervention, was different from 26.0% to 86.7% in the past studies, it was higher than the observed cure rate of 12.5% in the present study <xref rid="pone.0066123-Firooz1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0066123-NassiriKashani1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The reported cure rate of 40% at week 10 after initiation of treatment in the present study is also quite low. The lower cure rate which has been found in the present study might be explained by either the differences in the inclusion and the exclusion criteria or the &#x0201c;primary outcome&#x0201d; definition.</p><p>The present study indicates that silver dressing do not make significant changes in the efficacy of the i.l. MA in the treatment of CL due to <italic>L. major</italic>. Navarro <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0066123-Navarro1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> studied anti-leishmanial effect of silver. By comparing the affinity of DNA versus albumin to two synthetic complexes of silver, they observed a strong interaction of the complexes with DNA. The affinity of the complex one ([Ag (dpq)<sub> 2</sub>] NO3) for DNA was higher than for albumin but in the case of the complex two ([Ag (dppz)<sub> 2</sub>] NO3) the affinity was same for DNA and albumin. The complex one reduced growth of promastigotes of <italic>L. mexicana</italic> by 55% and complex two showed a leishmanicidal effect. The anti-leishmanial effect of these silver complexes was dose dependent. The authors concluded that this effect was related to interaction with parasitic DNA. Navarro <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0066123-Navarro1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> used silver complexes in promastigote forms of <italic>Leishmania</italic> in vitro, but in the present study, silver dressing was used clinically in the patients who had the amastigote form of <italic>Leishmania</italic> in their macrophages. So, the differences in the kind of the parasite (<italic>L. mexicana vs</italic>. <italic>L. major</italic>), in the form of it (promastigote <italic>vs.</italic> amastigote), in the type of silver (silver complexes <italic>vs.</italic> Ag<sup>+</sup>) and its concentration in the wound might explain the inefficacy of silver dressing in the treatment of CL.</p><p>The rate of relapse after treatment with i.l.

This could be explained partly by a decrease in the number of referred CL patients to Golabchi Clinic in Kashan from certain nearby places like Natanz. Changes in the incidence of CL in the region may also contribute to this problem. Despite extending the recruitment period by almost 8 months, this limitation could not be effectively overcome. There were also some limitations in randomization and blinding in the present study. An important limitation in randomization was that the patients were randomized and all lesions on each patient were treated with the same intervention. The dependency of the lesions on the patients has not been evaluated and the findings of this study have not been adjusted for the dependency. Although adjusting for dependence might widen 95% CIs, it would be associated with no important clinical implications (i.e.: the 95% CIs already indicated no statistical significance).</p><p>To minimize information bias, blinding of the participants and the assessor at the same time is more effective than blinding of the assessor alone. Double blinding was not possible in the present study since the silver and the inert dressings were not alike exteriorly, and the interventions were different in the arms of the study. While patients were asked to remove and wash the site of the application of the dressings before coming to the clinic and not to talk about the interventions they received with the assessors, the effectiveness of blinding was not assessed systematically.</p><p>Although it seems that use of dressing can improve treatment of CL due to <italic>L. major</italic>, the present study could not demonstrate that use of either silver or inert dressing significantly change the efficacy of i.l. MA in the treatment, and the rate of relapse and adverse events.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0066123.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
