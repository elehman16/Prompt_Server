The studies conducted in this field have indicated the effect that nutrition education has had on improving the nutrition behaviors in students.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] It must be noted that the value of educational programs depends on the effectiveness of these programs, and the effectiveness of these programs depends on the use of theories and models.</p><p>It should be noted that the educational programs based on models are more effective than traditional training.</p><p>One of the models that is applied for studying and identifying behaviors and creating new behaviors is the BASNEF Model, which has been composed of a different structure, such as, beliefs (attitude toward behavior evaluation), attitude toward behavior, subjective norms, and enabling factors. The effectiveness of this model has been approved in many researches.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>For example, a study by Sharifirad showed that the BASNEF-based nutritional educational intervention improved dietary intake as well as glycemic control, three months after intervention.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>In the Khani Jeihooni study, the findings indicated that the mean scores of the BASNEF Model variables were significantly increased in the experimental group compared to the control group, after intervention. Applying the BASNEF Model is very effective in developing an educational program for diabetics.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>In another study by Roostaei, aimed at nutritional and exercise behaviors, showed that using the BASNEF model as an intervention in the elderly led to increased knowledge, attitude, and intent of act intention about nutrition in them.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] But, researchers can&#x02019;t find similar study by using of BASNEF model about nutrition in student.</p><p>Considering the unfavorable nutritional behaviors among students and the effect of nutrition education on its reduction and the importance of using the BASNEF Model, the present study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the educational program, based on the BASNEF model, on the nutritional behaviors among second-grade, middle school, female students in Isfahan city.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This is a quasi-experimental study conducted in Isfahan (Iran) in 2008, on second-grade, middle school, female students (72 students) from two public schools located at district 4 of the Esfahan Education Department. From five districts of the Education Departments, district 4 was selected randomly, and among the female public middle schools, two schools were chosen, and from each school, two classes, each of which consisted of 36 students, were selected randomly and were assigned to two control and intervention groups.</p><p>Two questionnaires were used, one of which was designed based on the BASNEF Model and 24-hour food recall. The questionnaire had three sections: Knowledge (22 questions), BASNEF Model (31), including six questions on attitude toward behavior evaluation, six questions on attitude toward behavior, five questions on belief norms, four questions on subjective norms, five questions on enabling factors, and five questions on behavior intention, which were completed twice before intervention and one month after intervention, in a self-administered format, and 24-hour food recall was completed in three days (two usual days and one holiday) by the interview method.</p><p>Content validity was established by five experts, who were health educators and nutritionists. The reliability of the questionnaire was determined by Cronbach's alpha (range, 0.7-0.82).</p><p>The Likert scoring method was used to assess the answers as follows: (certainly agree = 4, agree = 3, no idea = 2, disagree = 1, and certainly disagree = 0) and the score range for every section was 0 to 100.</p><p>For the knowledge section, one score was given to each correct answer. The score for wrong answers was zero.</p><p>Prior to the educational intervention in both groups, the questionnaires were completed and then educational intervention was performed for the intervention group in three educational sessions, (two sessions for students and one session for their mothers), the duration of which was 75 minutes, and pamphlets and a booklet were given to the students after each educational session.</p><p>In the first session, the health educator informed them about favorable nutrition behavior and the importance of nutrition behavior in puberty, and tried to promote the attitude toward behavior in the students by group discussion. In the second session, the health educators held group discussions to familiarize the belief norms and subjective norms. In the third session, the specialist, using the food pyramid, tried to educate the students about the five food groups for reforming nutritional behavior. Finally, their mothers were informed about the food pyramid and the necessity for a proper nutritional behavior in students. The students in both groups were intimated in detail about the study and were asked to read and sign a consent form.</p><p>Keeping this in view, the number of consumed units for each group was extracted from a 24-hour nutrition record and then the following actions were performed.</p><p>Ten scores were devoted to the nutrition group, whose minimum recommended unit number by its pyramid had been supplied. In case no unit was consumed in the nutrition group, a score of zero (0) was denoted. For an amount that was lower than the minimum recommended unit number by its pyramid, the proportion of consumed units was divided by the number of recommended units and multiplied by 10. If a student had consumed the minimum recommended units from each nutrition group, she obtained two scores, which totally became 50 for five groups, of this score. Also the scores were related to the nutrition variety, which totally reached 60 scores, and ultimately if the function of the dietary regime was wonderful the score was equal to 60, if the efficiency and dietary regime was favorable the score was equal to 50-59 scores, and if the dietary regime was unfavorable the score was equal to&#x0003c;50.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (version 18). Comparison between the two groups was done by the independent <italic>t</italic>-test. Paired <italic>t</italic>-test analysis was used for comparison in one group before and after intervention. A two-tailed <italic>P</italic> value lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 72 students entered the study.

This was similar to the result of Vakili's study.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Following the intervention the mean score of attitude toward behavior evaluation had increased in the intervention group. This significant difference indicated that educational intervention based on the BASNEF model encouraged the student to have a positive attitude. These findings were consistent with other studies.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>One month after intervention the attitude toward evaluation of behavior had increased in the control group. It seemed that increasing the knowledge on nutritional behavior in students and the consideration of the parents and teachers were the causes of this increase.</p><p>The paired <italic>t</italic>-test showed that one month after intervention the attitude toward evaluation of behavior in the control group had increased; the reason for which could be attributed to the increase of knowledge in this group, as also the consideration of parents and teachers to nutritional behaviors in students, which was influential in this respect. This result supports the findings of the Kohzadi study.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Before intervention the mean score of the attitude toward nutritional behavior in the two groups has been high, the reason for which can be attributed to a high attitude toward evaluation of behavior in both the groups. As it is shown in the BASNEF model, evaluation of the behavior results is before intention. When students get a positive evaluation from the results for behavior (favorable nutritional behavior), this factor itself creates a motivation in the students toward better nutritional behavior. This findings shows that the education must be designed to motivate an individual toward favorable nutrition and he/she must understand the helpful results of favorable nutritional behavior, so that their intention toward favorable nutritional behavior is increased.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>This finding is consistent with other studies.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>There is no significant difference in normative beliefs in the two groups before educational intervention in this study, although the mean score of normative beliefs one month after educational intervention has increased significantly in the intervention group. This increase is the result of the educational intervention based on the BASNEF Model in the intervention group and also involvement of their mothers.</p><p>Various studies show that in most cases, involvement of the family (especially mothers,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] friends, peers[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and daughters of the family)[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] in the educational intervention is effective, such as, in the subjective norms.</p><p>These results indicated that the behavior intention in both groups had increased, which could be attributed to other constructs of the model, such as, attitude toward behavior evaluation and attitude toward behavior and normative beliefs. As it was seen in the BASNEF model, these constructs had an effect on intention. These results support the findings of many other studies conducted on these variables.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] This finding is consistent with Hazavehei's finding in relation to the BASNEF model.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>This study reveals the significant increase in intention as a result of educational intervention in intervention group, which was also proved in other studies.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>Increase in the mean scores of the enabling factors after education in the intervention group is due to the following:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Student's access to educational classes, pamphlets, and an educational booklet</p></list-item><list-item><p>Student's access to the necessary foods provided by the family, especially mothers</p></list-item><list-item><p>Lack of student's access to unhealthy foods through the school's food buffet.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The enabling factors could affect attitude change, this result was consistent with the Mohamaei and Baghiani-Moghadam studies.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] In the mentioned studies, the scores of the enabling factors were significantly improved after intervention, in the intervention group. The increase in the enabling factors was similar to the result of other studies.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>In the control group also, the mean score of the enabling factors had decreased. Certainly one of the reasons for the decrease was the knowledge on nutrition obtained by the students and the parents&#x02019; and teachers&#x02019; attention to this subject (favorable nutrition behavior), who felt the necessity to access the enabling factors. These findings were supported by Taghdisi's study as well.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>The effect of education with regard to the increase in the mean score of attitude toward behavior evaluation, attitude toward behavior, normative beliefs, behavior intention, and enabling factors has caused behavior improvement in the intervention group. Before intervention 83.3% of the students&#x02019; behavior had been unfavorable, but reached 36.1% after intervention; and in the control group, 88.9% of the students had unfavorable nutrition function before and one month after intervention. One month after education, there was an increase in consuming many of the foods in the group of nutrition (milk and milk products, fruits, vegetables, meat and protein foodstuff) in the intervention group, which showed the effect of education on consuming these foods, which was consistent with other studies in the field of nutritional education.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</p><p>The study was limited to students in district 4 only.
