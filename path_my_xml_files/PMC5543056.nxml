As policy discussions for the expanded use of RTS,S/AS01 continue, it will be critical to determine the performance of the vaccine according to seasonal patterns of malaria transmission in regions of Africa. Given waning vaccine efficacy over time, this secondary analysis demonstrates that administering the vaccine to children in the months prior to malaria season could maximize impact of the vaccine. We followed children (5&#x02013;17 months) and infants (6&#x02013;12 weeks) assigned to one of three groups: (1) vaccine with four doses; (2) vaccine with three doses; (3) control. The primary endpoint was defined as episodes of clinical malaria. During the 4-years of follow-up, 658 of 1544 (42.6%) children and infants had at least one episode of clinical malaria. With each 1-inch increase in rainfall per month there was an associated increase in the rate of malaria by 12.6% (95% CI 9.6%, 15.6%, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) among children and 15.9% (95% CI 12.8%, 18.9%, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) among infants. There was no evidence of effect modification of vaccine efficacy by precipitation (89% power).</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Globally, malaria incidence among at-risk populations fell by 37% between 2000 and 2015, with a corresponding 65% reduction in malaria deaths among children under 5 years of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Despite substantial financial and developmental resources directed toward the reduction of malaria incidence in Africa, Malawi has not seen a significant decrease in malaria transmission. The entomological inoculation rate (EIR) in Malawi varies depending on the method of sampling and calculation, but previous researchers have estimated a weighted median (25&#x02013;75 percentile) EIR of 9.1 (1.7, 61.0). This value is similar to Ghana&#x02019;s weighted median EIR of 7.6 (1.7, 50.4) but is much higher than Kenya&#x02019;s EIR of 0.2 (0.0, 1.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. With regard to long-lasting insecticidal-treated nets (LLINs), Malawi has seen an increase in the percentage of households with at least one LLIN from 27% in 2002 to 58% in 2012, with over 18 million LLINs distributed in the decade. Still, this rate is far below the Global Fund&#x02019;s target of 80% of households with at least one LLIN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Though Malawi&#x02019;s population is at mesoendemic transmission risk for malaria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, it was one of only two (out of 44) malaria-endemic countries that saw an increase in a population-adjusted <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasite rate among children aged 2&#x02013;10 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The multi-site, phase 3 trial of RTS,S/AS01, which is the most advanced candidate malaria vaccine, is complete. Across 11 study sites in seven countries in Africa, administration of the vaccine in four doses was shown to reduce clinical malaria by 36.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 31.8%, 40.5%) in children 5&#x02013;17 months old and by 25.9% (95% CI 19.9%, 31.5%) in infants 6&#x02013;12 weeks old, although efficacy varied across sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The European Medicines Agency has adopted a positive scientific opinion of the vaccine, leading to a recommendation by the WHO&#x02019;s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) and the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC) for the implementation of large-scale pilot projects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In April 2017, the WHO announced that Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi had been selected to participate in the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Program (MVIP) of RTS,S/AS01 beginning in 2018. The three countries were chosen for their high coverage of LLINs, a high malaria burden even after LLIN scale-up, promising malaria and immunization programs, and participation in the Phase 3 trial of RTS,S/AS01<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The expected four-year program will provide insights on the feasibility of delivering the vaccine in real-life settings, safety in the context of routine use, and impact on childhood survival rates. Results from the MVIP will be useful before full-scale deployment across the continent. To inform these policy discussions, it will be critical to understand the variation in vaccine efficacy over space and time and within different environmental contexts. It is widely understood that RTS,S/AS01 will not serve as a panacea and that the vaccine must be used in conjunction with other control measures, such as LLINs and prompt and appropriate artemisinin combination therapies. However, implementation of the vaccine may be particularly effective in certain environments, such as areas where malaria transmission is high or seasonal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Site-specific data that considers the seasonality of vaccine efficacy have been limited. Apart from other programmatic considerations, an understanding of the seasonality of transmission and temporal variations in each pilot location is critical in deploying effective pilot interventions. For example, seasonal malaria chemoprevention is optimally targeted at regions with shorter, more intense malaria transmission seasons and requires accurate timing within that season<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Mathematical models have also shown that while absolute vaccine impact would increase with increasing levels of malaria transmission, a higher proportion of averted episodes and high cost-effectiveness may be possible in lower transmission regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Precipitation is particularly interesting because greater exposure to infected mosquito bites during the peak rainy season may overwhelm vaccine efficacy. We undertook an analysis of the phase 3 trial of RTS,S/AS01 in Lilongwe, Malawi, to evaluate its efficacy against episodes of clinical <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria and its effect modification by seasonal variation in precipitation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design and Precipitation Data</title><p id="Par6">The details of the study design have been described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

Parents or legal representatives of all participants witnessed and provided informed consent at enrollment to the study. Non-literate parents indicated consent by giving a thumbprint in place of a signature.

The Lilongwe vaccine trial catchment area was identified using neighborhood location information from patients who came to the Area 18 Health Center in the previous year. Three different geographic data sources were examined to identify the catchment area. To recruit participants, community-based information sessions were conducted for families with infants and children who met the enrollment age criteria. Flyers were also distributed in the identified communities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="Par9">Analyses of vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria were explored in an intention-to-treat cohort and included all episodes from the time of enrolment until the date on which the last enrolled infant or child completed follow-up.</p><p id="Par10">Vaccine efficacy was defined as the percent reduction in the incidence or hazard rate. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to compare rates of first or only malaria episodes between groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Monthly precipitation was considered in the proportional-hazards model as a time-varying covariate with a time lag of two months. Interaction terms for vaccination status and precipitation were included to assess effect modification. Cumulative risk of malaria was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and log-rank tests were conducted to compare malaria incidence between randomized groups.</p><p id="Par11">Vaccine efficacy against multiple malaria episodes was estimated using negative binomial regression and three extensions of the Cox regression model for recurrent events &#x02013; the Andersen-Gill (AG), the Prentice Williams Peterson total time (PWP-TT), and the Prentice Williams Peterson gap time (PWP-GT) models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In the negative binomial regression model, the logarithm of follow-up time was used as an offset. Waning of vaccine efficacy was assessed in the negative binomial regression by examining efficacy in years one through four of the study follow-up period. The AG model considers time at-risk since study enrolment, assumes a common baseline hazard function for all episodes, and includes a single parameter for the vaccine effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The PWP models are stratified proportional hazards models where all children and infants are included in the first stratum, children and infants with at least one malaria episode are included in the second stratum, and so forth. The PWP-TT model considers time at-risk since study enrolment, whereas the PWP-GT model resets the time index to zero after each malaria episode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. PWP models that allow for vaccine effects to vary across malaria episodes were used to estimate vaccine efficacy in each malaria episode (Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The AG, PWP-TT, and PWP-GT model estimates of vaccine efficacy against multiple malaria episodes were adjusted for monthly precipitation, and interaction terms for vaccination status and precipitation were included to assess effect modification.

This information will be valuable for roll-out strategies for RTS,S/AS01, particularly in areas with transmission patterns where seasonal malaria chemoprevention is effective. The majority of this burden lies in the Sahel sub-region and a band across sub-Saharan Africa that includes most of Namibia, Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique, where a combined 39 million children under five are at-risk for malaria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Pilot programs will soon be underway to assess whether routine immunization can deliver the four-dose schedule effectively, whether the vaccine can prevent deaths, and to what extent the safety concerns identified in phase 3 trials are confirmed in larger phase 4 trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, for these pilot programs to be successful, they must be implemented in a way that recognizes differences in vaccine performance across a variety of transmission intensity regions. Considering waning vaccine efficacy over time, this study demonstrates that among seasonal transmission regions, implementation of the vaccine should be given differential weighting based on precipitation patterns and its initiation prior to the peak transmission season may maximize impact.</p><p id="Par25">Precipitation was significantly associated with increased malaria incidence after a time lag of two months. This finding suggests that there is a strong, direct association between rainfall and malaria incidence. The intensity of transmission is dependent on the density, biting, and survival rates of the mosquito vector, which are heavily influenced by seasonal temperature and precipitation patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. A previous study of malaria attack rates in Northern Ghana showed that the risk of infection was lowest during the period of 2&#x02013;3 months at the end of the dry season<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Our model showed that the level of rainfall most strongly predicted malaria incidence after a time lag of two months (60.5 days). This time lag is consistent with previous time series analyses in a holo-endemic area of Ghana and across the East African highlands, which showed that high-resolution precipitation data could directly predict malaria incidence among children less than 15 years of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. This period of time also closely matches the theoretical vector-parasite-host cycle, which includes the growth of the <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito from egg to reproductive age, the development of the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasite in the vector from gametocytes to sporozoites, and the incubation period in the human host from infection to onset of malaria symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par26">Age played an important role in the number of clinical malaria episodes observed, with infants significantly more likely to experience multiple episodes of malaria. Consistent with findings from the phase 3 trial, vaccine efficacies were higher among children compared to infants in the negative binomial model, AG model, and PWP models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This observed difference may be explained in part by differences in naturally acquired immunity and physiological effects between the two age groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Due to the lower efficacy rates observed among infants, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization and the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee jointly decided that it would not recommend RTS,S vaccination among this younger age group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, it is likely that continued reductions in malaria exposure will lead to an increased burden among children over five-years old. In a comparison of four mathematical models, enhanced prevention measures and RTS,S vaccination was predicted to cause such an age shift in malaria incidence, disproportionately affecting children of older ages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Pilot implementations should assess the magnitude of the predicted age shift and its impact on severe disease and mortality. Future studies would be needed to establish safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine against older age groups, including adults.</p><p id="Par27">Extensions of the Cox model for estimating vaccine efficacy against all clinical episodes showed significant efficacy for both the V&#x02009;+&#x02009;1 group and V group. In each instance, the PWP models (total time and gap time) indicated lower vaccine efficacies compared to the negative binomial and Andersen-Gill models (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This observed difference may be explained in part by the ability of PWP models to estimate RTS,S efficacy for each episode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The negative binomial model is a reasonable choice for estimating an overall effect in disease reduction with time as an offset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, but the added value of the PWP models is the ability to accommodate time-dependent variables like precipitation and a more efficient use of data because timing of malaria episodes is considered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The PWP models are especially useful when the effects of covariates such as vaccination and precipitation are different in subsequent episodes, which is likely the case because RTS,S efficacy has been shown to wane over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, the PWP models also have limitations. For example, the conditional nature of the models leads to very small, nonrandom risk sets for later episodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, making vaccine efficacy estimates for subsequent episodes imprecise (95% CIs for hazard ratios in Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). In light of these methodological differences, it is important that results from extended Cox models are interpreted properly when applied to RTS,S implementation research.</p><p id="Par28">In conclusion, precipitation was significantly associated with increased malaria incidence among children and infants, with a surge in new cases following a time lag of two months. In assessing rates of first malaria episode or all malaria episodes, there was no evidence of effect modification of vaccine efficacy by precipitation. These findings suggest that despite increased malaria incidence in the rainy season, efficacy of RTS,S/AS01 does not change based on time of year. Thus considering waning vaccine efficacy, vaccination prior to peak transmission seasons is likely to maximize impact.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
