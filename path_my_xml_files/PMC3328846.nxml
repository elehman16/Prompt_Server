We tested whether a pharmacist-led, information technology-based intervention was more effective than simple feedback in reducing the number of patients at risk of measures related to hazardous prescribing and inadequate blood-test monitoring of medicines 6 months after the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this pragmatic, cluster randomised trial general practices in the UK were stratified by research site and list size, and randomly assigned by a web-based randomisation service in block sizes of two or four to one of two groups. The practices were allocated to either computer-generated simple feedback for at-risk patients (control) or a pharmacist-led information technology intervention (PINCER), composed of feedback, educational outreach, and dedicated support. The allocation was masked to general practices, patients, pharmacists, researchers, and statisticians. Primary outcomes were the proportions of patients at 6 months after the intervention who had had any of three clinically important errors: non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) prescribed to those with a history of peptic ulcer without co-prescription of a proton-pump inhibitor; &#x003b2; blockers prescribed to those with a history of asthma; long-term prescription of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or loop diuretics to those 75 years or older without assessment of urea and electrolytes in the preceding 15 months. The cost per error avoided was estimated by incremental cost-effectiveness analysis.

At 6 months' follow-up, patients in the PINCER group were significantly less likely to have been prescribed a non-selective NSAID if they had a history of peptic ulcer without gastroprotection (OR 0&#x000b7;58, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;38&#x02013;0&#x000b7;89); a &#x003b2; blocker if they had asthma (0&#x000b7;73, 0&#x000b7;58&#x02013;0&#x000b7;91); or an ACE inhibitor or loop diuretic without appropriate monitoring (0&#x000b7;51, 0&#x000b7;34&#x02013;0&#x000b7;78).

Further details of the methods are available in the trial protocol.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> We chose a cluster design because the intervention was applied by the general practice. General practices were eligible to participate if they were computerised with electronic prescribing. Practices were excluded if they did not routinely record morbidities such as asthma or peptic ulcer in patients' computerised records; did not routinely use computers to record prescriptions issued; intended to change their computer systems during the study to that of a different supplier that was not compatible with Quest Browser; were in primary care trusts that were undertaking interventions that might overlap with our intervention; took part in the pilot study of the trial; or expected large changes in list-size (numbers of registered patients) during the study.</p><p>The study was approved by the Nottingham 2 research ethics committee. We obtained written consent from all general practices after a face-to-face meeting at which the study was explained in more detail. For the economic analysis, the general practices recruited to the study were asked to write to all patients identified through baseline data collection who appeared in the numerator of one of our outcome measures (ie, they had a potential medication error). Patients were given a leaflet about the study and were asked to give written consent for the research team to access their medical records.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>We stratified eligible practices by centre (Manchester and Nottingham) and list size (&#x0003c;2500, 2500&#x02013;6000, and &#x0003e;6000 patients) and randomly allocated them within strata (1:1 ratio) to receive the intervention or control by block randomisation with block sizes of two or four. The allocation sequence was centrally generated, independent of the investigators, by the clinical trials unit at the University of Nottingham (UK). Practices were enrolled by the research team and allocated by the independent web-based randomisation service provided by the unit. Access to the allocation sequence was restricted to the clinical trials unit data manager and the sequence was concealed until all analyses were completed.</p><p>General practices, patients, pharmacists, and researchers visiting practices to extract computerised data were not masked to the allocation. All outcome data for the trial were extracted from patient records by prespecified electronic searches and so these data could not be altered before leaving the practice. Data were then sent electronically by secure file transfer protocol and automatically entered into a database on the trial manager's computer. Researchers who cleaned the data and the trial statisticians were masked to allocation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p>Because patients were proactively identified as being at high risk of potentially serious errors, we judged that a control group of no intervention was unethical. The control group practices therefore used simple feedback; after collection of data at baseline, control practices received computerised feedback for patients identified as at risk from potentially hazardous prescripting and inadequate blood-test monitoring of medicines plus brief written educational materials explaining the importance of each type of error. Practices were asked to introduce changes they considered necessary within 12 weeks after the collection of data at baseline.</p><p>Intervention practices received simple feedback plus a pharmacist-led information technology complex intervention (PINCER) lasting 12 weeks. The pharmacist arranged to meet with members of the practice team to discuss the computer-generated feedback for patients with medication errors. All doctors were encouraged to attend this meeting with at least one member of the nursing staff, the practice manager, and at least one member of the reception staff. Before the meeting, whenever possible, all relevant members of staff were provided with a brief summary of the objectives of the PINCER intervention and a summary of the findings from the computer search. At the meeting the pharmacists were asked to use the principles of educational outreach while taking account of human error theory in their discussions. After this initial meeting, pharmacists were expected to use various techniques to help correct medication errors that had been identified and prevent future medication errors. Interventions included review of patients' medical records; discussions with family doctors to decide on actions to be taken; invitation of patients to be reviewed or to have blood tests; and working with members of the practice team to improve local safety systems.

We used outcome measures 1, 2, 3, 5a, 5b, 7, and 8 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). We excluded outcome measure 4 because the number of patients with errors was very small and outcome measures 6, 9, and 10 because obtaining full data in all practices was difficult.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref></p><p>Costs were the direct costs of provision of an intervention to reduce prescription errors in general practice. The study was not powered to detect differences in costs because no previous study on which to base a power calculation exists. The time horizon was 6 months in the base case. Because all costs were incurred by the practices, correction for clustering was not needed.</p><p>The only cost for the simple feedback group was from the researchers returning to the practices at set times to generate error reports from general practice systems. This cost was retained in the model to account for the equivalent resource that would be used to generate these error reports in the real world. The PINCER intervention consisted of these report-generation costs, plus pharmacist training sessions, facilitated meetings, monthly meetings, practice feedback meetings, and time spent in each practice outside meetings following up errors.</p><p>Before incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, we adjusted costs and outcomes for a range of practice characteristics. We used the negative binomial model<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> for regression analysis of errors because variance was greater than the mean for errors per practice in both groups (overdispersion), and the variation differed between groups. Poisson regression would underestimate the standard errors of the coefficients. We estimated adjusted costs by generalised linear modelling. A simple probabilistic decision-analytic model was populated to generate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, which were calculated for differences in error rates between the PINCER and simple feedback groups:</p><p><disp-formula id="formula10"><mml:math id="M1" altimg="si6.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo>cost</mml:mo><mml:mi>&#x02009;</mml:mi><mml:mtext>PINCER</mml:mtext><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mtext>cost</mml:mtext><mml:mi>&#x02009;</mml:mi><mml:mtext>simple</mml:mtext><mml:mi>&#x02009;</mml:mi><mml:mtext>feedback</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>outcome</mml:mtext><mml:mi>&#x02009;</mml:mi><mml:mtext>PINCER</mml:mtext><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mtext>outcome</mml:mtext><mml:mi>&#x02009;</mml:mi><mml:mtext>simple</mml:mtext><mml:mi>&#x02009;</mml:mi><mml:mtext>feedback</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>To identify the magnitude of uncertainty of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, we generated a bootstrap estimate of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio sampling distribution.

Participating and non-participating practices had much the same numbers of family doctors and socioeconomic profiles, however, participating practices were larger, more likely to be training practices, and had slightly higher <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qof.ic.nhs.uk">quality and outcomes framework</ext-link> scores, than did non-participating practices (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">webappendix</xref>). <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the number of patients per practice with each primary outcome measure.

In total, generation of reports cost &#x000a3;3342&#x000b7;24 for 36 simple feedback and 36 PINCER intervention practices at 6 months and &#x000a3;5013&#x000b7;36 for the same number of practices at 12 months. This was the only cost in the simple feedback group. The PINCER group also generated training costs of &#x000a3;9933&#x000b7;26, preparation costs of &#x000a3;102&#x000b7;89, facilitated meeting costs of &#x000a3;6976&#x000b7;81, monthly meeting costs of &#x000a3;1996&#x000b7;30, practice meeting costs of &#x000a3;794&#x000b7;52, and error management costs of &#x000a3;14&#x02008;641&#x000b7;20. The cost components were added to give the total mean cost per practice in each group of the trial (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">webappendix</xref>).</p><p>Adjusted costs were estimated by generalised linear modelling with the assumption of a &#x003b3; distribution (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">webappendix</xref>). Only baseline list size was significant (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">webappendix</xref>).</p><p><xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> summarises the costs and outcomes used in the incremental cost-effectiveness analysis and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref> shows the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves at 6 months and 12 months. This analysis suggests that PINCER had a 95% probability of being cost effective if the decision-maker's ceiling willingness to pay reached &#x000a3;75 per error avoided (at 6 months) or &#x000a3;85 per error avoided (at 12 months). Because the error reduction is sustained at 12 months, this analysis suggests that the intervention could be delivered yearly, rather than every 6 months, and still retain equivalent cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="cesec90"><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial shows that the PINCER intervention is more effective than simple feedback for reduction of the numbers of patients at risk from hazardous prescribing and inadequate blood-test monitoring of medicines in general practice. In view of the high risk of serious iatrogenic harm associated with errors, reductions of the magnitude noted in this trial are likely to be clinically important.</p><p>The main strengths of this study include the pragmatic design, the large numbers of practices enrolled, and the range of clinically relevant outcomes tested. We avoided bias in allocation of practices by use of an independent centralised web-based randomisation service, and the sequence of treatment allocations was masked until all data analyses had been completed. Also, none of the practices were lost to follow-up. Because the data were extracted electronically from general practice computer systems, and those who cleaned the data were masked to treatment allocation, no risk of bias existed. Analyses were undertaken independently by two statisticians, masked to treatment allocation, both producing similar findings. When minor differences were identified, the reasons for these were explored and discrepancies resolved. Although some of the intraclass correlation coefficients estimated from our models were larger than those used in our sample size calculations, this difference did not result in insufficient power because significant effects were shown for those outcomes.</p><p>The simple feedback we used as a control is superior to routine models of care used in the UK, therefore the true effect size of PINCER in comparison to standard care might have been underestimated. We have also sought to assess the sustained effect of PINCER at 12 months after the intervention.</p><p>We have undertaken an embedded longitudinal qualitative assessment, which shows that general practice staff are receptive to the PINCER intervention and that the introduction of the intervention was a valuable educational experience for them (Creswell K, unpublished). Our parallel cohort study in 438 practices throughout England confirms that the trial's findings can be generalised widely (Shiekh A, unpublished).</p><p>However, our trial does have some limitations. Practices that agreed to participate and those that did not differed slightly (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">webappendix</xref>). The characteristics of the groups were much the same, but the intervention practices were slightly more deprived and likely to be training practices than were control practices (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">webappendix</xref>). We therefore adjusted for these two factors in our analysis. Moreover, results of our parallel national cohort study showed that the frequency of these errors was much the same in a large sample of non-intervention practices, suggesting that the practices enrolled in this trial are likely to be representative of practices nationwide. Although data extraction for our prespecified primary outcome measures worked successfully in all general practices recruited for the study, we encountered some difficulties with three of the secondary outcome measures. Finally, our sample size calculations were made on the basis of assessment of outcomes at the main 6 month assessment point; therefore the study might have been underpowered to assess outcomes at 12 months.</p><p>We deliberately focused on potential medication errors rather than adverse events and therefore we cannot be certain that the pharmacist-led intervention will reduce harm to patients. Nevertheless, a strong argument can be made for focus on the measurement of errors rather than on adverse events for assessment of the quality of clinical practice, as the former relate most closely to actions that are within the control of health-care professionals.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p><p>We are developing an economic model incorporating the clinical and economic effects of changes in error rates to allow calculation of costs per quality-adjusted life-years. Little equivalent work about this topic has been done. An exploratory economic modelling study<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> estimated that a pharmacy-based intervention to reduce medication errors would have a probability of being cost effective with a quality-adjusted life-year value of &#x000a3;10&#x02008;000 of more than 60%. This finding suggests that pharmacist-led interventions to reduce error rates have the potential to be cost effective according to currently used cost-effectiveness thresholds. The <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">webappendix</xref> contains further discussion of the economic analysis.</p><p>Since the start of our trial, important studies have questioned the effectiveness of isolated pharmacist-centred interventions in general practice. For example, the HOMER trial<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> aimed to assess whether home-based medication review by pharmacists in older people would affect hospital readmission rates. The researchers reported an increase in hospital admissions and no improvement in quality of life or death rate. The RESPECT trial<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> showed no benefit of involvement of community pharmacists in the moderation of drug management (pharmaceutical care) in older people in general practice. Findings are awaited from a trial in the USA assessing the effectiveness of a pharmacist intervention for reduction of medication errors after hospital discharge for high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref></p><p>In view of the conflicting evidence for the effectiveness of pharmacist-led interventions in primary care, the effectiveness of PINCER should be considered (<xref rid="box2" ref-type="boxed-text">panel 2</xref>). First, we used an educational outreach approach, which is a moderately powerful intervention for changing professional behaviour.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Pharmacists who took part in the trial received training on the use of these techniques and the evidence base for the outcome measures used in the trial. Second, we focused on specific examples of hazardous prescription or inadequacies in medication monitoring, which might have increased our ability to detect change compared with more generalised measures. Third, the pharmacists established working relations with the practices, which granted them access to patient records for contextual information and the mandate to provide practical support to make changes to patients' medications and organise blood tests. Fourth, the intervention was multifaceted, used the potential offered by information technology, and aimed to simultaneously tackle different barriers to change; such interventions are known to be more effective than are simpler interventions.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref></p><p>Because of the pressing need to reduce errors in health care,<xref rid="bib4 bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4&#x02013;6</sup></xref> PINCER offers an effective method for reducing a range of medication errors in general practice. An essential prerequisite is the use of electronic health records, which effectively reduces errors.<xref rid="bib7 bib8 bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7&#x02013;9</sup></xref> The intervention that we have developed will be suitable for implementation in the increasing number of countries where clinical records are now computerised and where the roles of pharmacists to monitor proactively for clinically important medication errors can be extended.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation
