To assess the efficacy of vilazodone across a range of symptoms and severities of depression, data from two phase III, 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were pooled for analysis. Overall improvement in depressive symptoms measured using the Montgomery&#x02013;&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) for vilazodone treatment compared with placebo as early as Week 1 and continued throughout double-blind treatment. Vilazodone treatment compared with placebo showed significant improvement on all 10 individual MADRS symptom items at end of treatment (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). Rates of response and remission were significantly greater in the vilazodone group relative to the placebo group, with numbers needed to treat ranging from eight to nine for response and 12&#x02013;17 for remission. Between-group treatment differences in MADRS and the other outcome measures were similar among all depression subgroups, with no consistent pattern associated with depression severity. These findings support the efficacy of vilazodone across a broad range of depressive symptoms and severities for the treatment of major depressive disorder.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>antidepressant</kwd><kwd>major depressive disorder</kwd><kwd>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</kwd><kwd>serotonin 1A receptor agonists</kwd><kwd>vilazodone</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic and debilitating disorder with high rates of medical and psychiatric comorbidity, functional impairment, and significant personal and societal costs (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Greenberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Egede, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Katon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Daly <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). The heterogeneous symptoms of MDD include sad mood, loss of interest, sleep disturbance, change in appetite, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, and psychomotor agitation (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). Depression can be characterized as mild, moderate, or severe on the basis of symptom severity, functional impairment, and level of patient distress. Typically, depression severity in clinical trials is categorized by a cutoff score on a depression rating scale such as the Montgomery&#x02013;&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery and Asberg, 1979</xref>) or Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton, 1960</xref>); threshold scores greater than 28&#x02013;30 on MADRS or greater than 25&#x02013;28 on the 17-item HAMD (HAMD<sub>17</sub>) are commonly, but somewhat arbitrarily, used to define severe depression (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Nemeroff, 2007</xref>). Approximately one-third of patients with MDD are severely depressed (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Thase, 2000</xref>); patients with severe depression tend to have a prolonged course of illness, higher rates of morbidity and mortality, less likelihood of spontaneous remission, and recurrent episodes with early relapse (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Thase, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Nemeroff, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Many patients do not fully respond to initial pharmacologic treatment and experience residual depressive symptoms with a poorer long-term prognosis (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Zajecka, 2003</xref>). Fewer than half of the patients typically attain response (&#x02265;50% improvement) or remission (full resolution of symptoms) during initial treatment. In the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, a large multicenter study on antidepressant treatments conducted in &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; clinical settings, patients who received the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), citalopram, during the initial treatment step had a 47% response rate and a 33% remission rate after 14 weeks of treatment (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Trivedi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In addition, among fully remitted patients, 90% still had at least one residual symptom of depression, with the number of residual symptoms being associated with a higher probability of relapse (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Nierenberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). These findings point to the need for additional treatment options that offer broad efficacy across diverse MDD populations.</p><p>Initial reports of possible synergy between drugs that affect SSRIs and serotonin 1A (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>) receptors were published in three case studies on treatment-resistant depression in 1991 (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Bakish, 1991</xref>). Vilazodone, a potent SSRI and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor partial agonist, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2011 for the treatment of MDD in adults. Preclinical evidence has suggested that the partial agonism of vilazodone at the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor may increase endogenous serotonin levels more than an SSRI alone (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Hughes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The efficacy of vilazodone for the treatment of MDD was shown in two phase III, 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (NCT00683592 and NCT00285376; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Rickels <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Khan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). In both trials, significant improvement versus placebo was observed on the primary efficacy measure, MADRS total score change from baseline to the end of treatment. Vilazodone was generally well tolerated in both studies; diarrhea and nausea, the most common adverse events, were predominantly mild or moderate in intensity, tended to occur early and were transient, and resulted in few discontinuations from treatment (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Liebowitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Improvement was also observed in the individual trials by significant differences in favor of vilazodone versus placebo on the HAMD<sub>17</sub>, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA; <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton, 1959</xref>), and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) Scales (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Guy, 1976</xref>). The long-term safety and tolerability of vilazodone were supported by a 1-year open-label study (NCT00644358; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Robinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). To assess the efficacy of vilazodone across a range of depressive symptoms and severities, data from the two phase III, 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were combined and analyzed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Data from two 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Rickels <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Khan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) on the use of 40 mg/day vilazodone for the treatment of MDD in adults were pooled for this analysis.

After washout and screening, patients were randomized (1 : 1) to receive vilazodone or placebo for 8 weeks of double-blind treatment. The dosage of vilazodone was increased to the 40-mg target dose (given once daily with food) on a fixed-dose schedule of 10 mg for 7 days, followed by 20 mg for 7 days, and 40 mg for the remainder of the studies. Efficacy was assessed at baseline (Week 0) and at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8/end of treatment (EOT).</p><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Eligible patients were 18&#x02013;70 years of age, with a diagnosis of single-episode or recurrent MDD according to the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, 4th ed., text revision criteria (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>); the diagnosis was confirmed by Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Sheehan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>).

The 2.8-point mean difference in MADRS score at EOT favoring vilazodone over placebo is indicative of clinically relevant improvement in depression (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery and Moller, 2009</xref>). Statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in MADRS total score at Week 8 were observed with vilazodone compared with placebo regardless of the severity of baseline depression symptoms. The MADRS treatment advantage for vilazodone versus placebo (least squares mean difference) was greater than 2 for all severity subgroups, supporting the clinical relevance of treatment across the range of depression severities (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery and Moller, 2009</xref>). Between-group treatment differences were generally similar for other efficacy outcome measures across the range of depression severity subsets, with no apparent trends among subgroups. Although a prior meta-analysis has suggested that antidepressant treatment is most efficacious in patients with the most severe symptoms (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Kirsch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), the results of these analyses support the therapeutic benefit of vilazodone across a spectrum of depression severities. A retrospective analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials conducted in 2012 concurred with our results, finding significant antidepressant efficacy for patients with mild&#x02013;moderate MDD (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Stewart <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Depression symptom improvement, as measured by both MADRS total score and HAMD<sub>17</sub>, was apparent for vilazodone treatment compared with placebo by the first postbaseline assessment (Week 1) and continued throughout treatment across a range of depression severities. Patients who experience clinically meaningful improvement (i.e. &#x02265;20% improvement from baseline) in depressive symptoms in the first 2 weeks of treatment have a greater likelihood of stable treatment response and remission of symptoms (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Szegedi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Early improvement (e.g. within 2 weeks) may enhance treatment compliance and lessen relapse or recurrence (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Demyttenaere <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Taylor <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Szegedi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The results of these analyses are interesting considering that vilazodone treatment compared with placebo treatment led to a statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms as early as the first week of treatment despite the fact that patients did not attain full therapeutic dosage of vilazodone until Week 3 of the 8-week double-blind treatment period.</p><p>Vilazodone treatment compared with placebo treatment led to a statistically significant improvement in all 10 individual MADRS symptom items. The improvement in the &#x02018;suicidal thoughts&#x02019; item was unanticipated because patients with suicidal ideation, recent suicidal attempt, or suicidal risk were excluded from the trials. Efficacy across a broad range of depression symptoms may lessen the likelihood of residual symptoms, which is associated with a risk for relapse, greater psychosocial impairment, and reduced quality of life (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Menza <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Vilazodone compared with placebo also significantly improved overall anxiety symptoms on the basis of HAMA scores. It is possible that the combined property of serotonin reuptake inhibition and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> partial agonism of vilazodone leads to a broader antidepressant efficacy with enhanced anxiolytic efficacy in MDD patients compared with serotonin reuptake inhibition alone (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Blier and Ward, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Sussman, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Papakostas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The clinical relevance of improvement in depression symptoms with vilazodone was shown by an absolute treatment difference of greater than 10% compared with placebo on all response rate criteria (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery and Moller, 2009</xref>). NNT values for response of eight and nine further suggest the clinical relevance of these data as an NNT of less than 10 represents the threshold for demonstrating clinically relevant response to antidepressant treatment (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Cipriani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Remission to an asymptomatic state is considered by many to be the ultimate standard of efficacy for antidepressant drugs in depressive disorders. In these analyses, absolute differences in remission rates for vilazodone versus placebo ranged from 6 to 9%, corresponding to NNTs of 12&#x02013;17 for remission. A recent review of vilazodone that used a MADRS total score of less than 10 as the remission criterion reported remission rates of 25.4% for vilazodone and 18.1% for placebo, with an NNT of 14 (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Citrome, 2012</xref>). MADRS remission rates in our analysis (MADRS total score&#x02264;10), 28.6% for vilazodone and 20.1% for placebo (NNT=12), were slightly higher than the rates observed in the study by <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Citrome (2012)</xref> (MADRS total score&#x0003c;10). This may reflect the slightly less stringent but more common definition of remission used in our analysis (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Zimmerman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), in which patients with a MADRS total score of 10, as opposed to a maximum score of 9, are categorized as remitters. In addition, it is possible that the 8-week duration of the trials may have been insufficient for some patients to attain remission of symptoms, and more patients might have remitted with longer treatment; this may be especially true for the more severely depressed patients with high baseline MADRS scores (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Schatzberg, 1999</xref>).</p><p>The two clinical trials with almost identical study designs and patient populations facilitate the pooling of data for increased statistical power to assess additional treatment effects of clinical interest, and provide more precise estimates with large enough sample sizes for subgroup analyses. Limitations of these analyses include lack of head-to-head comparison with other antidepressants and more stringent entry criteria that may limit generalizability. In addition, the cutoff score used to denote severe depression in this analysis (MADRS&#x02265;35) is more stringent than the score often used in clinical trials (MADRS&#x02265;30; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Nemeroff, 2007</xref>), resulting in a sample size that may be insufficient to detect significant treatment differences in the subgroup designated as severely depressed. Finally, these analyses were carried out <italic>post hoc</italic> and did not correct for multiple comparisons.</p><p>Vilazodone treatment was significantly superior to placebo treatment on all efficacy outcome measures, with consistent efficacy across a range of depression severities in MDD patients. Clinically relevant advantages of vilazodone treatment over placebo treatment were evident in overall measures of depression, individual depressive symptoms, and antidepressant response and remission rates.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by Forest Research Institute, Jersey City, NJ, USA.
