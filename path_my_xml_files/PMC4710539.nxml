We compared both a three-dose i.m. and a three-dose i.v. parenteral ARS regimen with the standard five-dose regimen using a non-inferiority design (with non-inferiority margins of 10%).</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>This randomized controlled trial included children (0.5&#x02013;10 y) with severe malaria at seven sites in five African countries to assess whether the efficacy of simplified three-dose regimens is non-inferior to a five-dose regimen. We randomly allocated 1,047 children to receive a total dose of 12 mg/kg ARS as either a control regimen of five i.m. injections of 2.4 mg/kg (at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h) (<italic>n =</italic> 348) or three injections of 4 mg/kg (at 0, 24, and 48 h) either i.m. (<italic>n =</italic> 348) or i.v. (<italic>n</italic> = 351), both of which were the intervention arms. The primary endpoint was the proportion of children with &#x02265;99% reduction in parasitemia at 24 h from admission values, measured by microscopists who were blinded to the group allocations. Primary analysis was performed on the per-protocol population, which was 96% of the intention-to-treat population. Secondary analyses included an analysis of host and parasite genotypes as risks for prolongation of parasite clearance kinetics, measured every 6 h, and a Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis to compare parasite clearance kinetics between treatment groups. A post hoc analysis was performed for delayed anemia, defined as hemoglobin &#x02264; 7g/dl 7 d or more after admission.</p><p>The per-protocol population was 1,002 children (five-dose i.m.: <italic>n =</italic> 331; three-dose i.m.: <italic>n =</italic> 338; three-dose i.v.: <italic>n =</italic> 333); 139 participants were lost to follow-up. In the three-dose i.m. arm, 265/338 (78%) children had a &#x02265;99% reduction in parasitemia at 24 h compared to 263/331 (79%) receiving the five-dose i.m. regimen, showing non-inferiority of the simplified three-dose regimen to the conventional five-dose regimen (95% CI &#x02212;7, 5; <italic>p =</italic> 0.02). In the three-dose i.v. arm, 246/333 (74%) children had &#x02265;99% reduction in parasitemia at 24 h; hence, non-inferiority of this regimen to the five-dose control regimen was not shown (95% CI &#x02212;12, 1; <italic>p =</italic> 0.24).

Malaria infections, which can be caused by several parasites, can be &#x0201c;uncomplicated&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;severe.&#x0201d; Prompt treatment of uncomplicated malaria, which presents with flu-like symptoms, is essential to prevent the development of severe malaria. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) for the first-line treatment of uncomplicated malaria in countries where the disease is always present. In ACT, artemisinin derivatives (fast-acting antimalarial drugs that are cleared rapidly from the body) are combined with a slower-acting, more slowly eliminated partner drug to prevent the original infection recurring and to reduce the risk of the malaria parasites becoming resistant to either drug. Severe malaria, which is usually caused by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, is characterized by anemia and by damage to the brain and other organs. Severe malaria kills more than 400,000 people (mainly young children living in sub-Saharan Africa) every year.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>WHO recommends that severe malaria be treated with intravenous or intramuscular injections of artesunate, a parenteral (injectable) form of artemisinin; patients with severe malaria cannot take pills reliably or safely. Specifically, WHO recommends that patients be given 2.4 mg of artesunate per kilogram of body weight intravenously or intramuscularly at the time of admission (0 hours) and at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours (followed by ACT to ensure full parasite clearance). But this five-dose regimen is complex. A simpler regimen would be easier to administer in resource-limited settings, where giving the correct doses on time to small, sick children can be challenging. In this open-label, non-inferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT), the researchers investigate the efficacy of a three-dose artesunate regimen for the treatment of severe malaria in African children. RCTs compare outcomes in people randomly chosen to receive different interventions; in an open-label RCT, both the researchers and the participants know which treatment is being given; a non-inferiority trial investigates whether one treatment is not worse than another treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers randomly allocated 1,047 children aged six months to ten years with severe malaria attending seven clinical centers in five African countries to receive a total dose of 12 mg of artesunate per kilogram of body weight as five intramuscular injections of 2.4 mg/kg given at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours (the control regimen) or as three intramuscular or intravenous injections of 4 mg/kg given at 0, 12, and 24 hours (three-dose intramuscular and intravenous regimens, respectively). The trial&#x02019;s primary endpoint was the proportion of children whose parasitemia (parasite count in the blood) at 24 hours was &#x02264;1% of that at admission (in other words, &#x02265;99% parasite clearance). Among the 1,002 children who received the planned drug doses (the per-protocol population), 78% in the three-dose intramuscular group had &#x02265;99% parasite clearance compared to 79% in the five-dose intramuscular group, a result that met a preset criterion for non-inferiority at 24 hours of the three-dose intramuscular regimen to the control regimen. However, because only 74% of the children in the three-dose intravenous group had &#x02265;99% parasite clearance, this regimen was not shown to be non-inferior to the conventional five-dose regimen.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings when combined with the findings of several secondary analyses suggest that, in African children, a three-dose intramuscular artesunate regimen is non-inferior to the WHO-recommended regimen for the treatment of severe malaria. The study&#x02019;s open-label design may limit the accuracy of its findings, as may its use of a primary endpoint midway through drug treatment rather than at the end (the researchers note that 60% of deaths from severe malaria occur during the first 24 hours of illness and that parasitemia is harder to measure later during treatment) and its use of parasite clearance rather than death as the primary endpoint (case fatality rates in severe malaria treatment trials are very low, so a much larger study would be needed if death were used as the primary endpoint). Overall, these findings support the use of the three-dose intramuscular artesunate regimen for the treatment of severe malaria. Importantly, however, 22% of the children in the study developed delayed anemia, irrespective of treatment regimen. Thus, although further studies are needed to clarify whether treatment with artesunate or the malaria infection itself was responsible for the delayed anemia, patients treated with artesunate for severe malaria should be routinely monitored for this complication.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Additional Information</title><p>This list of resources contains links that can be accessed when viewing the PDF on a device or via the online version of the article at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001938">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001938</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Information is available from the World Health Organization on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/topics/malaria/en">malaria</ext-link> (in several languages); the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report/en/"><italic>World Malaria Report 2014</italic></ext-link> provides details of the current global malaria situation, including information on malaria in individual African countries; WHO&#x02019;s <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/atoz/9789241549127/en/"><italic>Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria</italic></ext-link> and its <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/atoz/9789241548526/en/"><italic>Management of Severe Malaria</italic>: <italic>A Practical Handbook</italic></ext-link> are available</p></list-item><list-item><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria">malaria</ext-link> (in English and Spanish), including personal stories about malaria</p></list-item><list-item><p>The UK National Health Service Choices website also provides information about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/malaria/Pages/Introduction.aspx">malaria</ext-link>, including a personal story</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information is available from the Roll Back Malaria Partnership on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rollbackmalaria.org/">global control of malaria</ext-link>

WHO recommends ARS (2.4 mg/kg) administered by intravenous (i.v.) or intramuscular (i.m.) routes at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after admission [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], although simpler regimens would be preferable, assuming that safety and efficacy were not compromised [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The advantages of a simpler regimen are obvious to health care workers in under-resourced settings, where finding and maintaining i.v. access in small, sick children to ensure that correct doses are given on time is a challenge [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In an earlier study, a simplified three-dose ARS i.v. regimen was found to be non-inferior in pharmacodynamic efficacy to the conventional WHO regimen [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and its pharmacokinetics (PK) were defined with a formulation that conformed to standards of good manufacturing practice. Since then, WHO has prequalified another formulation of ARS (Guilin Pharmaceutical, Shanghai, China), making it more widely used. We have also compared the i.v. and i.m. routes of this product for severe malaria in African children and have described the PK of a WHO-recommended dose regimen using ARS [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This regimen of one dose of 2.4 mg/kg followed by four doses of 1.2 mg/kg has been superseded by a regimen of five doses of 2.4 mg/kg, and there has since been debate about the simplified (once daily) i.v. regimen for severe malaria [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

We assessed whether splitting the total dose of 12 mg/kg into a simplified once daily i.m. or i.v. three-dose regimen (4 mg/kg per dose) is non-inferior to the WHO-recommended five-dose regimen (2.4 mg/kg per dose). We also examined associations of genetic polymorphisms of <italic>pfmdr1</italic> and <italic>kelch-13</italic> with parasite clearance kinetics and, in post hoc analysis, the occurrence of delayed anemia.</p><p>Our primary study objective was to assess the non-inferiority of i.v.

ARS simplified dosing regimens (4 mg/kg ARS at 0, 24, and 48 h; 12 mg/kg total dose) to the standard i.m. treatment dosing regimen (2.4 mg/kg ARS at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h; 12 mg/kg total dose) in clearing parasitemia in African children with severe malaria. Our secondary study objectives were to compare the tolerability and safety of the three ARS dosing regimens, to analyze host and parasite genotypes as risks for prolongation of parasite clearance kinetics, measured every 6 h, and to compare parasite clearance kinetics between treatment groups. An exploratory objective was to analyze genetic polymorphisms in humans and parasites linked to disease and treatment, and a post hoc objective was to assess the occurrence of delayed anemia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Methods</title><p>The trial was performed according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice.

Thick blood films were also examined on days 7, 14, and 28.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with &#x02265;99% parasite reduction from the baseline asexual parasite count at 24 &#x000b1; 1 h. Parasitemia was always quantitated before the 24-h dose was administered, i.e., after either one (intervention arms) or two (control arm) doses of ARS had been administered. This endpoint was derived from discussions in the SMAC network and from our own studies [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and is based on the following reasoning. First, WHO guidelines for the treatment of severe malaria [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] are based on studies that have used multiple outcomes. For efficacy, these are death, parasite clearance time, fever clearance time, time to discharge from hospital (days), and coma resolution time. As studies using mortality as an endpoint are impracticable in seasoned centers where overall mortality from severe malaria is &#x0003c;5%&#x02014;requiring sample sizes that are too large&#x02014;we have chosen a parasitemia clearance parameter as an endpoint. Parasite clearance kinetics was also used when a quinine loading dose (20 mg/kg salt, if no pretreatment) was being developed and compared with the then standard dose (10 mg/kg salt), when a mortality study comparing the two regimens was ruled out on sample size grounds. Parasite clearance time was a crucial determinant of efficacy for comparing the same drug in two dosing regimens [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In severe malaria, clinically advantageous benefits of more rapid clearance of parasites by ARS (even when given by suppository) have been reported in comparison with i.m. artemether [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The 24-h time point was chosen as an endpoint because most deaths (&#x0003e;60%) from severe malaria take place within 24 h of admission, and accurate assessment of parasitemia becomes more difficult at later time points.</p><p>Evaluation of the whole regimens is included in the secondary outcome measures (and there is no discrepancy between the results for this and the 24-h end point). Further endpoints were time to total clearance of asexual parasites, time to 99% reduction of asexual parasites, time to 90% reduction of asexual parasites, time to 50% reduction of asexual parasites, proportion of patients with genotype-uncorrected adequate clinical and parasitological response on day 28, percent reduction in asexual parasites from baseline at 24 h after initiation of randomized study drug, and percent reduction in asexual parasites from baseline at 48 h after initiation of randomized study drug.</p><p>During the conduct of this study, several patients in the case series developed delayed hemolytic anemia following ARS therapy, mostly in the second and third week from the start of therapy [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Motivated by these events, we amended our trial protocol and undertook two exploratory post hoc analyses of delayed anemia. In the first, all trial participants were screened and treated for delayed anemia, defined as hemoglobin (Hb) &#x02264; 7 g/dl seven or more days after admission. In the second, a subgroup of 72 patients in Kumasi and Lambar&#x000e9;n&#x000e9; who underwent detailed hematological monitoring for 28 d following discharge from the hospital were assessed for hemoglobin and laboratory markers of hemolysis (such as lactate dehydrogenase) during follow-up [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For the patients in the subgroup, we were able to assess laboratory markers of hemolysis (such as lactate dehydrogenase) in more intensive follow-up, whereas the last day of scheduled sampling for these particular markers for all other patients in the study was day 7.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Participants</title><p>Children were aged 6 mo to 10 y, with a diagnosis of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> infection (parasitemia &#x02265; 5,000 parasites/&#x003bc;l on initial blood smear) and clinical signs and symptoms severe enough to require hospitalization, according to the SMAC definition of severe malaria that best reflects the policies of African hospitals [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

Primary analysis was on the PP population, since it is more conservative in non-inferiority models. Testing was done hierarchically, with comparisons of the two experimental arms (three-dose i.m. and three-dose i.v.) against the control (five-dose i.m.), corrected for multiple testing using the Bonferroni method. Only when both tests rejected the null hypothesis was a further test comparing the two experimental arms planned. As secondary endpoints, parasite clearance times were calculated using Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimates and a Cox model with treatment arm and study center as covariates, when not otherwise described. Alpha &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant.</p><p>The needed sample size was calculated based on the results of our prior study [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

Using the Farrington and Manning procedure [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] as implemented in the Design package of R v. 2.10.1, the calculated sample size needed was 316 per arm when multiple comparisons between the groups were included. The total estimated sample size needed, with 10% headroom for loss to follow-up, was therefore 1,044 participants.</p><p>The non-inferiority margin delta was pre-specified as an absolute difference of 10% for the primary endpoint on the basis of our previous study [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and published methods for analyzing time-to-event outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For the Cox model, the non-inferiority margin was translated into a hazard ratio (HR) assuming a 82% cure rate (&#x02265;99% reduction in parasitemia at 24 h) with the control (five-dose i.m.) regimen and an at least 72% cure rate with the experimental (three-dose i.m. and three-dose i.v.) regimens.</p><p>All patients who received at least one dose of the study drug were included in the safety analysis.

A population PK model, assuming 100% conversion of ARS to DHA, was developed using the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling software Phoenix NLME 1.2 (Pharsight, St. Louis, Missouri, US). The final population PK models for ARS, DHA, and DHAG were evaluated using visual predictive checks. Plasma concentration over time data were described by a one-compartment PK model with additive residual error and an exponential term for interpatient variability.

This three-dose i.v. regimen had previously been found to be comparable in efficacy to the WHO-recommended five-dose i.v. regimen [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

Since the Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for one-sided equivalence does not account for stratifying covariates, which may be anti-conservative, the robustness of the results was tested with Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for study center, which showed non-inferiority (lower confidence interval limit of the HR &#x0003e; 0.74) [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] for all comparisons (three-dose i.m. versus five-dose i.m., HR 1.04 [97.5% CI 0.88&#x02013;1.24]; three-dose i.v. versus five-dose i.m., HR 0.89 [97.5% CI 0.75&#x02013;1.06]; three-dose i.m. versus three-dose i.v., HR 1.18 [95% CI 1.00&#x02013;1.37]).

Here, simpler three-dose i.m. and i.v. regimens have been compared to the WHO-recommended five-dose i.m. regimen. This study provides new insights into ARS PK, delayed anemia, and genetic markers of delayed parasite clearance. Our studies used the pharmacodynamic endpoint of parasite clearance rather than other clinical outcome measures such as mortality because the latter requires impracticably large studies (as debated [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). In comparing the same drug given in different doses and by different routes, parasite clearance kinetics should accurately reflect differences in in vivo antiparasitic activity because the mechanism of action is the same. It follows that if there are no differences in parasite clearance kinetics between treatments, then they can be considered to be of comparable efficacy. For uncomplicated malaria, for example, inadequate oral dosing with ARS is associated with prolonged parasite clearance kinetics, and in severe malaria a loading dose of quinine significantly shortened parasite clearance times compared with a non-loading-dose regimen [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>From our previous study, we concluded that a simplified once daily regimen was non-inferior in efficacy to the conventional i.v. ARS dosing regimen [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This study establishes that the once daily i.v. is not consistently non-inferior to the three-dose and five-dose i.m. regimens. There are several corollaries to this observation. First, clearance kinetics with i.v. once daily ARS in this study (74% achieved &#x02265;99% clearance from baseline at 24 h) is very similar to the previous result of 76% with i.v. once daily ARS. This latter result was also comparable to the five-dose WHO-recommended i.v. regimen in that smaller study and points to a preference for the i.m. route because it is associated with faster clearance kinetics (Figs <xref rid="pmed.1001938.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001938.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Second, these results confirm that the endpoint chosen is both robust and pharmacodynamically sensitive as a measure of ARS antimalarial efficacy. Also, a once daily simplified i.m. regimen is of comparable efficacy to the five-dose WHO-recommended i.m. regimen, a finding that was robust when analyzed using different statistical methodologies. This finding has important implications for practice. The i.m. route for administration of antimalarials is preferable to the i.v. route in small children [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Analysis of secondary endpoints of parasite clearance supports the results of the primary endpoint analysis, and suggests that the once daily i.m. regimen has an even faster time to 90% parasite clearance than the conventional i.m. regimen (median 12 versus 18 h; Figs <xref rid="pmed.1001938.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="pmed.1001938.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>; <xref rid="pmed.1001938.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).</p><p>The frequently observed <sup>N86Y</sup>Pfmdr1 polymorphism has previously been associated with increased sensitivity to artemisinin in in vitro assays in Senegal [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and decreased sensitivity to artemether in Nigeria [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], with no effect in Thai isolates [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our results provide in vivo evidence for decreased sensitivity to ARS (DHA) of parasites with <sup>N86Y</sup>Pfmdr1. Changes in the frequencies of polymorphisms in <italic>pfmdr1</italic> are clearly worth monitoring in future epidemiological studies. High unadjusted cure rates (95%) in our patients may reflect the large artemisinin (24 mg/kg total dose of ARS and artemether) component of the treatment course and efficacy of the combination partner (lumefantrine).</p><p>The results of our population PK analysis are consistent with classical and previous population PK studies on parenteral ARS [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], including in Tanzania [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A suggestion, based on modeling, that doses higher (~3 mg/kg per dose for children &#x0003c;10 kg) [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] than currently recommended by WHO may be needed for smaller children is obviated if our higher dose (4 mg/kg) and simpler regimen is implemented. As noted previously, there was no relationship between PK parameters and efficacy. We also present, to our knowledge for the first time, an analysis of the glucuronide derivative of DHA (<xref rid="pmed.1001938.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>; <xref rid="pmed.1001938.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This is quantitatively the most important primary metabolite of DHA. Although it has poor antimalarial activity (IC<sub>50</sub> of DHAG = 5.7 &#x003bc;M, mean of two experiments), DHAG plasma concentrations commonly peaked above 5 &#x003bc;M (<xref rid="pmed.1001938.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>), rendering a contribution to parasite clearance possible. Repeated dosing with ARS, in any regimen, does not show evidence of accumulation (<xref rid="pmed.1001938.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). This analysis also allows us to examine other potential mechanisms for toxicity, which hitherto has not been possible.</p><p>During the conduct of our trial a series of case reports appeared about delayed anemia in travelers who had received parenteral ARS. Therefore, we amended the study protocol to address the occurrence of delayed hemolytic anemia in our ongoing study. We identified delayed anemia after ARS treatment using a small subgroup of patients from the current study [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in whom it was possible to study anemia defined by several criteria (low haptoglobin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, decrease inHb, exclusion of sickle cell disease and G6PDH deficiency). Secondly, in a post hoc analysis that included the whole study population, we defined delayed anemia as Hb &#x02264; 7 g/dl 7 d or more after admission. We confirmed the occurrence of delayed anemia in a significant proportion (22%) of African children by using this simplified definition that may therefore have greater practical utility. This definition of anemia does not reveal any relationships with PK parameters for ARS, DHA, or indeed DHAG. Instead, a higher leucocyte (<xref rid="pmed.1001938.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>) and neutrophil count at day 7 is associated with delayed anemia, suggesting that if ARS is the cause of anemia, the mechanism does not involve bone marrow toxicity, because ARS can cause dose-dependent neutropenia [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In a recent study of 60 travelers treated with ARS for severe malaria, 13/66 (22%) had delayed anemia, which compares well with our findings. In this study, pitting was significantly associated with delayed anemia [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Pitting is a process whereby dead early-stage parasites are removed from erythrocytes by the spleen. Pitting may contribute to the pathophysiology of delayed anemia, which is associated with markers of delayed hemolysis, although available findings from AQUAMAT do not support this [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the AQUAMAT study, the incidence of post-admission severe anemia (Hb &#x0003c; 50 g/l) was comparable in the quinine (5.7%) and ARS (4.6%) groups [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and both groups had identical proportions of patients (55%) receiving blood transfusions. It is unfortunate that only neurological sequelae were monitored after discharge in the AQUAMAT study, as the risks of delayed anemia with ARS compared to quinine could have been quantified in this cohort.</p><p>Weaknesses of this study are its open-label design, which may introduce biases in outcome variables, although allocation bias was minimized and the primary outcome measures of parasite clearance were assessed in a blinded way. The primary analysis at 24 h was before the full treatment regimens had been completed, which may appear as a study limitation unless all parasite clearance estimates are also considered. Additionally, delayed anemia was first described in travelers&#x02014;and could therefore be addressed&#x02014;only after the study was mostly complete. It was studied in detail in 72 patients [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], with the remaining analysis being performed post hoc. As there was no comparator arm using a drug other than ARS, further studies will be needed to clarify the impact of artemisinins on delayed anemia. Some colleagues outside the SMAC network may argue that mortality needs to be an endpoint in a study with severe malaria. However, our studies show that case fatality rates in severe malaria trials performed following principles of good clinical practice should not exceed 5%, but rather be between 1% and 2%, regardless of whether the WHO definition or our SMAC definition of cases is used [<xref rid="pmed.1001938.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, death as an endpoint is precluded by sample size requirements.</p><p>Simplifying ARS usage with a once daily i.m. regimen in severe malaria is supported by our results, but because delayed anemia is common, patients should be monitored for this complication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001938.s001"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Dataset used for the analysis.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1001938.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001938.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>&#x02265;99% parasite clearance 24 h after treatment initiation for the per-protocol population.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1001938.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001938.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Time to parasite clearance (hours) for the intention-to-treat population.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1001938.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001938.s004"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Fever clearance times, 37.5&#x000b0;C threshold, for the per-protocol population.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1001938.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001938.s005"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Fever clearance times, 37.7&#x000b0;C threshold, for the per-protocol population.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1001938.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001938.s006"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Fever clearance times, 38.0&#x000b0;C threshold, for the per-protocol population.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1001938.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001938.s007"><label>S6 Table</label><caption><title>Biochemical measurements for the intention-to-treat population.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1001938.s007.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001938.s008"><label>S7 Table</label><caption><title>Study design.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1001938.s008.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001938.s009"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1001938.s009.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001938.s010"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>CONSORT statement.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1001938.s010.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Guilin Pharmaceutical for supplying ARS.
