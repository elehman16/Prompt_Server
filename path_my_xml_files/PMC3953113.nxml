Two studies of TDF PrEP among men who have sex with men showed slight bone mineral density (BMD) loss. We investigated the effect of TDF and the interaction of TDF and hormonal contraception on BMD among HIV-uninfected African men and women.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>We evaluated the effects on BMD of using daily oral TDF-FTC compared to placebo among heterosexual men and women aged 18&#x02013;29 years enrolled in the Botswana TDF2 PrEP study. Participants had BMD measurements at baseline and thereafter at 6-month intervals with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans at the hip, spine, and forearm.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 220 participants (108 TDF-FTC, 112 placebo) had baseline DXA BMD measurements at three anatomic sites. Fifteen (6.8%) participants had low baseline BMD (z-score of &#x0003c;&#x02212;2.0 at any anatomic site), including 3/114 women (2.6%) and 12/106 men (11.3%) (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02). Low baseline BMD was associated with being underweight (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02), having high blood urea nitrogen (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02) or high alkaline phosphatase (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03), and low creatinine clearance (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04). BMD losses of &#x0003e;3.0% at any anatomic site at any time after baseline were significantly greater for the TDF-FTC treatment group [34/68 (50.0%) TDF-FTC vs. 26/79 (32.9%) placebo; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04]. There was a small but significant difference in the mean percent change in BMD from baseline for TDF-FTC versus placebo at all three sites at month 30 [forearm &#x02212;0.84% (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01), spine &#x02212;1.62% (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0002), hip &#x02212;1.51% (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.003)].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Use of TDF-FTC was associated with a small but statistically significant decrease in BMD at the forearm, hip and lumbar spine.

Tenofovir and tenofovir-emtricitabine were chosen for these trials because of their good safety profile <xref rid="pone.0090111-Gallant1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, long half-life <xref rid="pone.0090111-Hawkins1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and excellent penetration into the genital compartment <xref rid="pone.0090111-Dumond1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, use of tenofovir resulted in decreased bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV-infected patients in clinical trials <xref rid="pone.0090111-Gallant2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0090111-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and cases of fractures and/or osteomalacia due to tenofovir use have been reported <xref rid="pone.0090111-Perrot1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Because of the mounting evidence of the effectiveness of tenofovir in preventing HIV transmission and the increasing likelihood that it will be widely used as PrEP, it is important that we understand its long term effects on the BMD of HIV-uninfected, healthy people. In a randomised clinical trial of PrEP among men who have sex with men in San Francisco, 10% of HIV-negative men had low BMD (z-score &#x0003c;&#x02212;2.0) at baseline; tenofovir use resulted in a small but statistically significant decline in BMD at the hip and femoral neck <xref rid="pone.0090111-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Sub-Saharan Africa with its high HIV burden could benefit from PrEP if it is strategically implemented among high-risk heterosexuals. Because PrEP would be used during sexually active periods, persons might choose to use PrEP for many years. Many would start as adolescents or young adults during their period of skeletal maturation. It is therefore important that we have baseline BMD data for potential users of PrEP, as well as data on any long-term changes in BMD due to prolonged exposure to tenofovir.</p><p>There are few data on baseline BMD values in African populations. A study of 20 black African and 20 white European males showed that the bone mineral content (BMC) of the African males as well as their body mass index (BMI) was significantly less than those of the white Europeans. In contrast, neither BMD nor the ratio of BMC to BMI differed between the two groups <xref rid="pone.0090111-Bileckot1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In a study done in the United States, race had a highly significant effect on BMD of the lumbar spine, trochanter, femoral neck, and mid-radius. BMD was higher in blacks than in whites. There were no significant interactions between race and age or race and weight when the data from black and white men were combined <xref rid="pone.0090111-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In a study of BMD of recent African immigrants in the United States, spinal BMD was significantly lower in recent Sudanese immigrants than in African Americans or Caucasians. Hip and total body BMD were associated with length of stay in the United States, suggesting a potential role of environmental factors in the ethnic differences in BMD <xref rid="pone.0090111-Gong1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>
</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sponsored a PrEP trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of daily TDF-FTC among HIV-uninfected, sexually active young men and women in Botswana <xref rid="pone.0090111-Thigpen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In a subset of study participants, we compared the change in BMD among participants taking oral daily TDF-FTC or placebo, using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as a previously validated measure of BMD. In addition, we characterized BMD at baseline as well as the risk factors for developing low BMD during the course of the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT Checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090111.s003">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090111.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><p>Between March 2007 and October 2009, 1219 participants were enrolled and randomised in the TDF2 Study conducted at the CDC-Botswana research clinics in Gaborone and Francistown, Botswana. Full details of the conduct and results of the TDF2 Study have been previously published <xref rid="pone.0090111-Thigpen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This was a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety trial of TDF-FTC among sexually active HIV-uninfected young Batswana adults. The first 309 TDF2 Gaborone participants were offered enrollment into the BMD sub-study; 221 participants (109 on TDF-FTC, 112 on placebo) consented to the BMD sub-study and had at least one DXA scan performed. The BMD sub-study DXA scans were scheduled at baseline and every subsequent 6 months while participants were enrolled in the TDF2 study. All 221 BMD sub-study participants had a baseline DXA scan but one participant had a DXA scan of the spine only.(participant was 19 years old at the time of his baseline DXA scan and the DXA machine was programmed to process from 20 years and above for the hip and forearm. Therefore a full baseline scan was not done on this participant). Sixty-eight (62.4%) participants on TDF-FTC and 79 (70.5%) on placebo had at least one follow-up DXA scan. Among those also enrolled in the BMD sub-study, forty-two (38.5%) participants on TDF-FTC and 52 (46.4%) participants on placebo completed the TDF2 study. Reasons for exclusion and discontinuation are detailed in the CONSORT diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090111-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Participants found to have low BMD (T-scores &#x0003c;&#x02212;1.0) as per World Health Organization (WHO) reference ranges were provided calcium supplementation <xref rid="pone.0090111-World1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0090111-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0090111.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Study design and participant flow diagram.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0090111.g001"/></fig><p>In this sub-study, DXA scanning was conducted at Medical Imaging Botswana in Gaborone. All participants were enrolled in Gaborone, and were seen monthly for the assessment of adverse events, rapid HIV testing, and pregnancy testing for female participants. Quarterly visits included laboratory safety monitoring of chemistry results which included, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and inorganic phosphorus. Rapid HIV testing and dispensing of study medication were done monthly.</p><p>All participants were informed of the risks and benefits of participation and provided written consent for the TDF2 study and separately for the BMD sub-study. The TDF2 study and BMD sub-study were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Health Research and Development Committee of the Botswana Ministry of Health (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00448669).</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Bone mineral density assessment</title><p>BMD measurements were performed with a QDR 4500C (Hologic Co., Bedford, MA, USA) DXA scan machine by Medical Imaging Botswana at the distal and ultra-distal forearm, the lumbar spine and the hip. The distal forearm was defined as the area between the lines where the radio-ulnar distance measures 24 mm apart proximally and 8 mm apart distally. The ultra-distal forearm was defined as the 10 mm strip of radius distal to the line where the radius and ulna are 8 mm apart. The posterior-anterior L1&#x02013;L4 lumber spine and the total hip were evaluated. All measurements were done on the same side for each participant for the duration of the study. Serial measurements of BMD at any of the three sites were used to assess changes in bone density. World Health Organization (WHO) reference ranges were used for clinical evaluation of DXA results.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Additional data collection</title><p>For all participants, baseline body weight and height were recorded at enrollment, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Additionally, parathyroid hormone and Vitamin D, testosterone (males), calcium and alkaline phosphatase were analyzed at baseline and at any point in the study when a participant developed low BMD defined as a z-score that was &#x0003c;&#x02212;2.0.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>We conducted baseline and longitudinal analyses of BMD. The baseline analysis explored the relationship between low BMD and participant characteristics and laboratory parameters. The longitudinal analysis assessed the change in BMD over time between the TDF-FTC and placebo treatment groups. All fractures and their anatomic locations were compiled by treatment group and gender.</p><p>Gender and treatment group (TDF-FTC, placebo) were considered <italic>a priori</italic> variables that remained in all analyses regardless of statistical significance. Demographic variables included age group (18&#x02013;24, 25&#x02013;29 years), education (primary school or less, secondary school, postsecondary school), and marital status (married, single). Medical history variables included alcohol use in the past three months and female hormonal contraception at enrollment (oral, injection or implant, none). Clinical variables included body mass index at baseline, creatinine, creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen, inorganic phosphorous, vitamin D, testosterone (males), parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, albumin-corrected calcium, and mean BMD at baseline (forearm, lumbar spine, hip).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Baseline analysis</title><p>We compiled baseline demographic characteristics and laboratory parameters for all 221 BMD enrolled subjects including those who only had a baseline DXA scan without further follow-up scans.

Low BMD was defined as a z-score of more than 2.0 standard deviations below the mean at any anatomic site forearm, lumbar spine, hip as per International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD), 2007 Position Statement on BMD reporting in men younger than age 50 <xref rid="pone.0090111-International1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> One male TDF-FTC participant only had a z-score for spine (&#x02212;1.8) and was excluded from the low BMD correlates analysis, leaving 220 participants. We calculated the prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and compared the observed number of low BMD cases to the expected number using an exact binomial test. We expected 2.3% (five) of our 220 DXA participants to have a BMD z-score below &#x02212;2.0. Prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated using a Poisson model with robust standard error. For categorical characteristics, the PR was calculated using one category as the reference. Since laboratory parameters are continuous, the PR was based on a one-unit change.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Longitudinal analysis</title><p>The longitudinal analysis used all subjects who had at least one post baseline follow-up DXA scan. We computed the percent of participants who had &#x0003e;3% BMD decrease at any time compared to their baseline measurement and compared TDF-FTC to placebo and females to males using a two-sided Fisher's exact test. A &#x0003e;3% loss represents more than expected BMD loss in a population of healthy men in which BMD should be stable <xref rid="pone.0090111-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> We used a linear mixed model with participants as a random effect to estimate the BMD percent change over time by anatomic site (forearm, lumbar spine, hip) and included the following fixed effect factors: treatment group (TDF-FTC, placebo), time at 6-month intervals, and interaction between the treatment group and 6-month interval. The linear mixed effects model analysis was repeated adjusting for gender and other characteristics and laboratory parameters in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090111-t001">Table 1</xref> that had a p-value&#x0003c;0.10. An additional BMD percent change analysis used only females and included the contraceptive data (injectable, oral or no contraceptive) in the linear mixed-effects model. The female only base model contained the following predictor variables: treatment group, time, and interactions for contraceptives by time and by treatment group. These models were used to estimate the mean percent change in BMD from month 0 to 30. All analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and p-values&#x0003c;0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0090111-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0090111.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Baseline characteristics of TDF2 DXA sub study participants who had at least one DXA bone mineral density scan at forearm, spine and hip: Botswana, 2007&#x02013;2010.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0090111-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0090111.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Baseline Only<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">a</xref> N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;74 (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Longitudinal Cohort<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt102">b</xref> N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;147 (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P-value</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

The mean percent change from baseline and 95% CI by treatment group at weeks 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090111-g002">Figure 2</xref>. There was no significant difference in the rate of change for the percent change in BMD from baseline i.e., slope, between the TDF-FTC and placebo groups for any of the anatomic sites. Hence, a common slope parameter was estimated for each of the anatomic site models. The common TDF-FTC and placebo slopes for mean percent change in BMD for forearm (+0.37% per year; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01) and spine (+0.62% per year; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.007) were significant and positive, which indicates that over time the mean BMD for both treatment groups increased. Though the BMD loss appears to stabilize over time, it never gets better relative to the placebo arm. This difference appears to be noticeable by 6 months and then doesn't get worse. There was a significant net difference in the mean percent change from baseline between the groups: the mean percent change in BMD at month 30 for the forearm was +0.97% for the TDF-FTC group versus +1.83% for the placebo group. For the spine it was &#x02212;0.09% and +1.55% at month 30, respectively. These constant between-group percentage point differences of &#x02212;0.86 (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.008) for forearm and &#x02212;1.64 (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0002) for the spine were significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090111-t003">Table 3</xref>). The slope for mean percent BMD change over time was not significant for the hip, which means the net difference from baseline and between treatment groups was constant over time. The mean BMD change at month 30 for the hip was &#x02212;1.03% (TDF-FTC) versus +0.52% (placebo). This results in a significant 1.55 percentage point difference from baseline in the hip mean BMD for the TDF-FTC group compared to placebo (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001).</p><fig id="pone-0090111-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0090111.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Mean percent bone mineral density (BMD) change (with 95% confidence intervals) from baseline to subsequent months by treatment group (TDF-FTC versus placebo).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0090111.g002"/></fig><table-wrap id="pone-0090111-t003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0090111.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Univariate and multivariable model results for the net difference between TDF/FTC and placebo in mean percent change in bone mineral density for months 6&#x02013;30 from the baseline: Botswana, 2007&#x02013;2010.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0090111-t003-3" xlink:href="pone.0090111.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Model</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comparison</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean Percent Change in BMD</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">95% CI</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P-value</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Although alkaline phosphatase was significant, it was not included in the model because it was only measured at baseline. Four BMD sub-study subjects seroconverted to HIV-positive during the TDF2 study. However, all four subjects seroconverted after their last DXA measurement. Hence, there was no need to censor these subjects during the analysis. In the multivariable model, as for the base models, there was a significant decrease in mean percent BMD change from baseline for the TDF-FTC versus placebo treatment groups of &#x02212;1.62% for spine (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0002), &#x02212;1.51% for hip (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.003), and &#x02212;0.84% for forearm (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090111-t003">Table 3</xref>). In addition, for the forearm multivariable model BMI was significant and underweight subjects had a significant +1.03 percentage point difference from baseline compared to the BMI others (others includes normal, overweight, and obese) (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.007).</p><p>Of the 220 participants with baseline scans at all three sites, there were 106 observations for which they had been placed on a calcium supplement for low BMD at some point during the 6 months prior to a DXA scan, but continued on study drug. We did a sensitivity analysis and re-ran our multivariable models by 1) controlling for those on a supplement and 2) removing time points at which a participant was on a calcium supplement. The sensitivity analysis results for the difference in mean percent change in BMD for TDF-FTC compared to placebo when controlling for calcium in the model were &#x02212;1.69% for spine (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0001), &#x02212;1.49% for hip (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.003), and &#x02212;0.82% for forearm (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02). These results are almost identical to the full model and the calcium laboratory parameter was not significant in any model. The sensitivity analysis results for the difference in mean percent change in BMD for TDF-FTC compared to placebo when removing the 106 observations with calcium supplements are &#x02212;1.51% for spine (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.002), &#x02212;1.54% for hip (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.008), and &#x02212;0.58% for forearm (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.11).

The TDF-FTC treatment group consistently had a greater decrease in BMD from baseline for all significant differences than the placebo group. The multivariable models revealed that the only additional risk factor that was significant was BMI and only in the forearm model (underweight compared to normal/overweight/obese classes combined) Our findings for the hip are consistent with those of a PrEP study conducted among HIV-negative men in San Francisco, which found that TDF use resulted in a small but statistically significant decline in BMD at the hip <xref rid="pone.0090111-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The BMD loss in this study was greater compared with those observed in the CDC MSM and iPrEx studies. This probably reflects a different study population.</p><p>A high percentage of healthy young Batswana adults in this study had baseline z-scores that were below the expected range for age (6.8%) and young men had a higher prevalence of low BMD than did women (11.3% versus 2.6%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02).

It is not clear from our data whether the greater prevalence of abnormal z-scores in this otherwise healthy young population is due to true biological abnormality or whether it simply implies that the reference ranges, which were primarily drawn from European and North American cohorts, are not applicable to an African population.</p><p>Low baseline BMD was significantly associated with being underweight, high blood urea nitrogen, and low creatinine clearance, implying a relationship with nutritional or renal status. Low baseline BMD was also associated with high alkaline phosphatase, which may reflect bone mineral breakdown. Lab values of Vitamin D, calcium, parathyroid hormone, inorganic phosphorus, and testosterone (in males) were not associated with low baseline BMD. The proportion with &#x0003e;3% BMD loss at anatomic site during follow up was greater for the TDF-FTC group than the placebo group. BMD losses at any anatomic site at any point after baseline were significantly greater for the TDF-FTC treatment group than the placebo group for 3% decrease, but there were no significant differences of BMD loss by gender. It is noteworthy that there was BMD loss over the course of the study even among participants in the placebo arm.(BMD loss at arm only 2, spine and arm 3 and spine only 3) While this is consistent with some recent studies that indicate that BMD loss, particularly at the hip, begins shortly after achieving peak bone maturation in early adulthood and accelerates with age <xref rid="pone.0090111-Nordstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090111-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090111-Riggs1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> it still raises the largely unanswered question of the extent to which BMD normally fluctuates among healthy young adults and whether the population in this study differs from populations in other regions.</p><p>The two participants who sustained traumatic fractures had low baseline Z-scores (TDF/FTC participant: forearm &#x02212;1.7; spine &#x02212;1.8; hip &#x02212;0.3.

The effect on the upper limb was small, equivalent to about a 1.7% greater increase in BMD in the supplemented groups compared with the control groups.
