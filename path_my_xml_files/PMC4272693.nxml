In this study, &#x0201c;double-blind&#x0201d; includes study patients and data analyzers, including the Central Adjudication Committee (CAC). Prior to the initiation of this study, approval (REB #10-403) was obtained from the McMaster University / Hamilton Health Sciences Research Ethics Board. Two surgeons (K.R. and O.A.) at 2 clinical centres within Hamilton Health Sciences (McMaster University Medical Center and Hamilton General Site) participated in this study. Briefly, patients with RC tears who provided informed consent were randomized to receive either PRP or normal saline during their arthroscopic RC repair surgery and at 4 weeks after their arthroscopy procedure. Patients completed demographic and baseline questionnaires prior to their surgery. Patients were assessed at 2, 4, and 6 weeks postoperatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1941738114548413">Figure 1</xref>). The study aimed to include 50 patients based on an initial power calculation; however, a prespecified interim analysis was conducted after 50% recruitment to evaluate efficacy and statistical power. At the time of the interim analysis, it was determined that for a statistically significant difference in VAS pain score between the treatment and control groups, based on the current scores, a much larger sample would be required. The study stopped because of futility.</p><fig id="fig1-1941738114548413" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of study methodology.

Surgery commenced with a diagnostic arthroscopy of the glenohumeral joint. The cuff tear size was evaluated using a calibrated probe. A full subacromial bursectomy was performed. An acromioplasty was performed with release of the coracoacromial ligament and bony overhang of the acromion. The greater tuberosity was then further prepared. Next, a small awl was hand-tapped to make the pilot hole in the greater tuberosity for an Arthrex 5.5-mm BioCorkscrew suture anchor insertion. The anchor was then inserted in the mid-greater tuberosity footprint area. Each anchor was double loaded with number 2 Fibrewire sutures. One anchor was inserted for each centimeter of the supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus tear that required repair. The repair incorporated any delaminated areas. A single row repair was performed.</p></sec><sec id="section14-1941738114548413"><title>Platelet-Rich Plasma Preparation and Trial Interventions</title><p>PRP was prepared using the Arthrex Autologous Conditioned Plasma (ACP) Double Syringe System (Arthrex, Inc). This system allows for rapid and efficient concentration of platelets and growth factors from autologous blood for use at the treatment site.</p><p>The surgeon performed the intraoperative injection of either the prepared PRP or normal saline under direct visualization. Patients randomized to the normal saline group received a normal saline injection (6-9 mL). For patients randomized to the PRP group, half of the PRP volume (6-9 mL total volume) was injected directly into the RC tendon under direct visualization in several positions along the repair site (articular side). The injecting needle was then placed in the subacromial space, and all instrumentation was removed before performing the skin closure. After the skin closure, the subacromial space was suctioned of residual fluid, and the remaining PRP (3-4.5 mL) was injected into the subacromial space.</p><p>At the 4-week visit, under ultrasound guidance, the second PRP or normal saline injection (depending on randomization) was administered by the attending surgeon, trained to use a SonoSite Ultrasound (Bothwell). Blood draw was performed using an 18- to 20-gauge needle for all patients to maintain blinding. A 3-mL lidocaine skin injection was first administered to raise a skin wheal. Using a 22- to 25-gauge needle, 1 to 2 mL of the randomized product was injected at the supraspinatus tendon&#x02013;bone interface, and the rest was injected on top of the supraspinatus tissue in the subacromial space (2-3 mL).</p></sec><sec id="section15-1941738114548413"><title>Postoperative Care</title><p>Patients were all discharged home on the day of surgery. The use of an ice pack was recommended, and Percocet was permitted for the first 48 hours postoperatively. All other postoperative pain management methods were avoided, including regional nerve blocks, pain pumps, and injections of any pain medication. Standard physiotherapy guidelines were followed.</p></sec><sec id="section16-1941738114548413"><title>Patient Follow-up</title><p>Patients were assessed in the perioperative period by their attending surgeon at 2, 4, and 6 weeks postsurgery.

In addition, our interim analysis demonstrated a lack of clinically important benefit to PRP after arthroscopic RC repair using quality of life measures at 6 weeks. Given the sample size requirements to find a difference in the standardized mean difference between the groups at the designated time points, the trial was stopped early as the initial enrollment plans would not approach adequate power. While the study could not demonstrate that the injected product influenced the pain score, the overall decrease in pain from baseline for both groups demonstrates that arthroscopic surgery to repair RC tears does provide pain relief. Five patients were confirmed by the blinded CAC to have RC tears larger than 3.0 cm, and 4 of them had pain scores documented at 6 weeks; their eventual removal from the dataset did not change the primary outcome.</p><p>Secondary objectives assessing function and quality of life exhibit varying patterns. The EQ-5D scores increased and decreased in both groups at each follow-up visit, and it is not clear whether there was overall improvement or not, failing to demonstrate any statistically significant findings. Of interest, the PRP group showed slightly improved scores from baseline to 6 weeks, whereas the saline group showed slightly worsened scores. The WORC scores improved in both groups at week 6 compared with baseline, demonstrating improvement in functioning after surgical repair without any specific benefit for augmentation with PRP. The DASH scores were also relatively similar between groups, worsening immediately after surgery and improving at weeks 4 and 6. The scores at 6 weeks were very similar between the 2 groups and better in the saline group; however, the PRP group showed improvement at week 6 compared with baseline, whereas the saline group&#x02019;s mean score at week 6 was worsened from baseline.</p><p>No revision surgeries occurred over the 6-week follow-up period; however, there were 4 adverse events. Three of these occurred in the PRP group and 1 in the saline group. The CAC determined that the infection occurring at the site of surgery after the patient&#x02019;s week 4 follow-up was to be considered a study event. No other adverse events were deemed to be study-related. Because of the small sample size, no conclusion can be made regarding differences in adverse event frequency between the 2 groups.</p><p>While the present study did demonstrate some slight trends in pain reduction in the PRP group, these overall findings are consistent with the mounting literature examining the use of PRP to augment arthroscopic RC repair surgeries. A randomized controlled trial by Castricini et al<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1941738114548413" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> included 88 patients who underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn RC with or without an intraoperative interposition of an autologous platelet-rich fibrin matrix between the RC and bone. This study reported no difference in shoulder function between the treatment and control group using the Constant score.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1941738114548413" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> A second study by Jo et al<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1941738114548413" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> offered patients a choice of whether to receive an interpositional PRP gel or not (control) during surgical RC repair. Nineteen patients received PRP and 23 did not. Similar to the present study, this study reported that there was no difference in pain scores or functional scores at any point during the follow-up period.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1941738114548413" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Both the previously mentioned studies did not use injections, but rather matrices placed between the cuff tissue and bone at the time of surgery, and this may limit comparisons with the present study. Randelli et al<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1941738114548413" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> conducted a clinical trial involving 14 patients followed for 24 months. All patients were given a PRP injection along with an autologous thrombin component intraoperatively. This study demonstrated significant decreases in VAS pain scores at 6, 12, and 24 months in comparison with preoperative scores. However, no control was used for this trial, so the results cannot be attributed to the application of PRP.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1941738114548413" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Randelli et al<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1941738114548413" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> completed another study involving 53 patients, again where PRP injections were given intraoperatively in combination with an autologous thrombin component. Block randomization was implemented, and a control group was added. They reported that pain scores in the PRP group were significantly lower at 3, 7, 14, and 30 days postoperatively. Similar to our findings, however, they found no difference in outcomes at day 30. They also noted that there was no difference in the healing rate of the 2 groups when captured and analyzed via magnetic resonance imaging.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1941738114548413" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>In summary, 2 of the 3 previously conducted studies that involved a control did not report any benefit to the application of PRP intraoperatively; however, each study reported on different outcome measures, and at different time points, rendering a comparison difficult. Randelli et al<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1941738114548413" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> captured pain scores immediately postoperatively at days 3, 7, 14, and 30, allowing for major differences between the treatment and control groups to be recognized. Jo et al<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1941738114548413" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and Castricini et al<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1941738114548413" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> did not obtain frequent functional and pain measurements postoperatively and may have missed differences between the groups. Each trial involved an individual treatment at operation; the current trial exclusively included a second injection at 4 weeks postoperatively, allowing for the exploration of further effects that PRP may have had on pain outcomes.</p><p>There are several strengths in the present study. First, the patients were all randomized and blinded to their treatment groups. All study events were independently assessed by a blinded CAC. Quality of life and pain scores were collected at frequent time points postoperatively, allowing for an increased likelihood that subtle changes may be noticed; as pain is often at its highest immediately postoperatively, this is beneficial. Furthermore, the follow-up was 96% at 6 weeks.</p><p>An apparent limitation of this pilot study was the short follow-up period. Although data on pain, the primary outcome measure used for assessing the effect of PRP, were intended to be analyzed shortly after surgery, 6 weeks is an insufficient time period to capture all potential RC re-tears and revision surgeries. Another limitation of the study was the inability to screen for RC tear size before recruitment, which led to 5 patients being included with tear sizes above the 3-cm limit for inclusion. In addition, our results are primarily applicable to patients with traumatic and degenerative RC tears that are repaired initially within 18 months of diagnosis. Patients with preexisting conditions associated with upper extremity pain or systemic disorders may not have outcomes similar to those included in the present study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section26-1941738114548413"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study demonstrated no conclusive benefit for reducing postoperative pain after augmenting arthroscopically repaired RC tears with PRP compared with saline at 6 weeks; therefore, the primary hypothesis is rejected. It failed to demonstrate that patients receiving PRP injections intraoperatively and at 4 weeks postoperatively have decreased pain and superior functional outcomes than those receiving normal saline. Identifying therapies that improve outcomes in patients with RC tears remains a challenge and deserves ongoing investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Franca Mossuto and Lilly-Ann Reynolds for all of their assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The following authors declared potential conflicts of interest: Alisha Hak, BSc, and Sheila Sprague, PhD, received payment for writing or reviewing the manuscript from GRS Inc; Mohit Bhandari, MD, PhD, FRCSC, is a paid consultant for Smith &#x00026; Nephew, Stryker, Amgen, Zimmer, Moximed, and Bioventus.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1941738114548413"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
