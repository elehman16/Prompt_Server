In his original description of 11 cases, one child had seizures, three children were mute, and five children were macrocephalic.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However, despite a large body of pharmacological, pathological, electrophysiological, and functional imaging investigations, the etiology of ASD still remains unclear.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Known medical conditions account only for quarter (or less) of the diagnosed cases of ASD.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>One of the best known associations is increased risk of developing epilepsy and is commonly reported to occur in one-third of individuals with ASD. The occurrence of epilepsy in ASD has been extensively investigated.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Evidence suggests that epilepsy itself is a risk factor for autism, independent of other central nervous system dysfunction. Infantile spasms are an independent risk factor in tuberous sclerosis complex for ASD suggesting a etiopathologic role for epilepsy in the development of ASD.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Furthermore, epilepsy seems to be a major factor contributing to the severity of behavioral problems in ASD and is strongly correlated with worse cognitive functioning.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Nonspecific electroencephalography (EEG) changes, such as slowing or asymmetry, and epileptiform discharges, consisting of spikes or sharp wave discharges, sharp slow waves, generalized spike-wave, and generalized polyspikes are common among patients with active epilepsy,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] but are reportedly rare (1%&#x02013;4%) in healthy children.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In contrast, children with ASD exhibit high rates of these abnormalities even in the absence of epilepsy[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and their presence should not be considered as evidence of epilepsy.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The term isolated epileptiform discharges (IEDs) is commonly used to denote the occurrence of epileptiform discharges in the complete absence of identifiable seizures as opposed to interictal spike discharges occurring between seizures.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Several studies have reported IED rates of approximately 30% in ASD.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] One of the earlier studies (1975), reported 40% in a single recording, whereas two recordings showed IED in 60% and three showed IED in 80% of the sample (<italic>n</italic> = 147), highlighting the importance of prolonged or repeated monitoring to detect IED.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Another study of children with ASD referred for video EEG monitoring to evaluate possible seizures found IED in 59%.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] A retrospective review of almost 900 children with ASD who had no known history of epilepsy, found 61% with epileptiform EEG (IED) activity. One of the most important findings of this investigation was that, in this population, IEDs were detected only during sleep.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Approximately one-third of children with ASD present with insidious regression in language, behavior, social, and play skills, that is, autistic regression (AR). &#x000c2;, smaller percentage of autistic children will experience late severe regression, usually between 2 and 10 years.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In a study, examining the relationship between IEDs, epilepsy, and regression in 585 children with ASD concluded that IED (not epilepsy) is a risk factor for the development of AR. The presence of focal IED suggest the possibility of causative relationship, that is AR can be considered as a form of epileptic encephalopathy.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Although fundamental questions regarding the relationship of IED to the cognitive, language, and behavioral deficits seen in autism are still not evaluated in large-scale population-based studies, presumptive evidence from hospital-based samples indicate that it may give an important clue to an underlying neurological abnormality, at least for a subset of autism patients.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>It has long been known that interictal discharges can interfere with normal neural processing.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Recently, there has been more attention to the concept of deleterious transient cognitive impairment due to the presence of background epileptiform discharges in patients with epilepsy.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] This is important to highlight because of treatment implications, as large number of individuals with ASD could conceivably benefit from treatment of IEDs.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, most of the reviews point out that there is lack of &#x0201c;convincing evidence&#x0201d; with regard to the treatment of IEDs.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a prospective double-blind comparative study of children of Autism with those exhibiting IEDs group with no abnormal EEG (non-IED).

Social functioning of these children as assessed by VSMS points to an average social functioning of 27 months (SD = 6 months).

Both groups (IED and non-IED) are unremarkable with respect to age, age at diagnosis, and gender distribution. There was also no significant difference between the groups in terms of interventions, either pharmacological or nonpharmacological. Essentially, both groups are similar to each other in almost all sociodemographic variables. Surprisingly, both groups also show a similar pattern of prenatal, perinatal or postnatal risk factors risk factors and measures of head circumference, indicating that presence of IED is independent of environmental variables. This indicates that IED was present (presumably) before birth that is well before the clinical manifestations of autism. IED group exhibits more intense autistic features, low social functioning, and more severe behavioral problems when compared to non-IED group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005). Over the 2-year follow-up, 20% from the IED group exhibited new onset of seizures when compared to 3% from the non-IED group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.032) indicating that former has an increased chance of developing seizures. Despite this increased risk, intragroup comparison reveals that there is no significant difference in clinical severity, social functioning, and behavior problems between those converted to clinical seizures and those who had not. Thus, IED not (the presence or occurrence of) seizures is important with respect to clinical parameters. IED group can further be subdivided into those exhibiting sharp waves and those exhibiting other waves. Intragroup comparison reveals that both groups are similar in all clinical variables except in behavioral problems. Sharp waves are associated with more severe behavioral problems (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) indicating that sharp waves may be distinct neuro-electrophysiological signature in a subgroup of autism patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The presence of IED in a subgroup of ASD children portends more severe autism, social impairment, and behavioral problems. IED is not related to prenatal, perinatal or postnatal risk factors, head circumference, or any of the sociodemographic variables indicating that IED can be viewed as an endophenotype at least in a subgroup of ASD. Further studies with adequate sibling controls, long-term follow-up, quantitative computerized EEG, and neuroimaging will shed light on this neuroelectrophysiological signature of ASD.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Limitations</title><p>Study is limited by small sample size. Another drawback is no repeat EEG was taken during the follow-up evaluation. Sleep EEG or repeated EEG may have identified more IED in ASD.
