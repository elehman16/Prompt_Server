MADRS and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity score change from baseline to week 10 was significantly greater for vilazodone 20&#x02009;mg/day, vilazodone 40&#x02009;mg/day, and citalopram versus placebo. Sustained response rates were numerically higher, but not significantly different, in all active treatment groups versus placebo. The most common adverse events (&#x02265;5% of vilazodone patients, twice the rate of placebo) were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting (vilazodone 40&#x02009;mg/day only), and insomnia.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective treatments for MDD and the most commonly prescribed first-line treatment options. Many patients, though, do not adequately respond to or do not tolerate their initial SSRI (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Rush, 2007</xref>); however, these patients may show strong response to or tolerate a different SSRI (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Rush <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Rush, 2007</xref>). Although all SSRIs modulate serotonin reuptake, they differ in their pharmacologic profiles, which may influence efficacy and tolerability in individual patients. Access to multiple antidepressant options with different pharmacological profiles may improve the management of MDD and patient outcomes.</p><p>Vilazodone is an SSRI and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor partial agonist approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of MDD in adults. The efficacy of vilazodone 40&#x02009;mg/day was demonstrated in two 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trials (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Rickels <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Khan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). A phase IV trial supported the efficacy and tolerability of vilazodone 40&#x02009;mg/day (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Pomara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Long-term safety and tolerability were supported in a 1-year, open-label trial of vilazodone 40&#x02009;mg/day (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Robinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Data from phase II and phase III trials suggested that vilazodone 20&#x02009;mg may be effective in treating MDD. This study was designed to fulfill a postmarketing commitment with the FDA to identify the minimum effective dose of vilazodone. The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of vilazodone 20 and 40&#x02009;mg/day were evaluated in patients with MDD; citalopram was included as an active control for assay sensitivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This 10-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study (NCT01473381) was conducted at 54 US study centers between December 2011 and June 2013 in full compliance with FDA guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each investigational site and all patients provided written informed consent.</p><p>The study comprised a 1- to 4-week screening period, a 10-week double-blind period and a 1-week double-blind down-taper. Patients were randomly assigned by computer-generated numbers (1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1&#x02009;:1&#x02009;&#x02009;:&#x02009;1) to placebo, vilazodone 20&#x02009;mg/day, vilazodone 40&#x02009;mg/day, or citalopram 40&#x02009;mg/day. Investigators and patients were blinded to allocation of the study drug throughout treatment and down-taper period.</p><p>Patients assigned to the vilazodone 20 and 40&#x02009;mg/day groups were dosed as follows: week 1, 10&#x02009;mg/day, week 2, 20&#x02009;mg/day (subsequently maintained for 20&#x02009;mg/day arm), week 3, 40&#x02009;mg/day. Patients assigned to citalopram were titrated from 20 to 40&#x02009;mg/day over a 2-week period. All study drug was taken once daily in the morning with food.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>This study included adult (18&#x02013;70 years of age, inclusive) male and female outpatients who met <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health</italic>, 4th ed., text revision (DSM-IV-TR) (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">APA, 2000</xref>) criteria for MDD, had an ongoing major depressive episode lasting 8 or more weeks and up to 12 months, and had a Montgomery&#x02013;&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery and Asberg, 1979</xref>) total score of at least 26. Female patients of childbearing potential were required to have a negative &#x003b2;-hCG pregnancy test and be currently using a reliable method of contraception. Patients were required to have normal physical examination findings, clinical laboratory test results, and ECG result, or abnormal results that were judged to be not clinically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients with a DSM-IV-TR-defined axis I disorder other than MDD within 6 months of study or a history of other specific psychiatric diagnoses, including bipolar disorder or any psychotic disorder, were excluded; secondary comorbid generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder and/or specific phobias were allowed. Patients at risk for suicide [defined as attempt within the past year, score&#x02265;5 on MADRS Item 10 (Suicidal Thoughts), investigator judgment based on interview or the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)] (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Posner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) were excluded. Exclusion criteria also included history of nonresponse to two or more antidepressants, use of psychoactive drugs (within 2 weeks of the study), or requiring concomitant treatment with prohibited medications (exceptions were eszopiclone, zopiclone, zaleplon, zolpidem, or zolpidem extended release). Medical conditions that could interfere with study conduct, confound the interpretation of results, or endanger patient well-being led to exclusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy and safety assessments</title><p>The primary efficacy measure was the MADRS [assessed at screening, baseline (week 0), and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]. The Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Guy, 1976</xref>) was assessed at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Other measures included the CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Guy, 1976</xref>) (weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton, 1959</xref>) (weeks 0, 4, 6, 8, 10). Safety was assessed by adverse event (AE) recording (MedDRA, version 15.1), physical examination, clinical laboratory and vital sign measures, ECGs, C-SSRS (all visits), and the Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (CSFQ) (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Clayton <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>) (weeks 0, 4, 8, 10).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Safety analyses were based on the safety population, which comprised all randomized patients who received one or more doses of double-blind study drug. The intent-to-treat population was used for all efficacy analyses and comprised all patients in the safety population who had one or more postbaseline MADRS assessments.</p><p>The primary efficacy outcome was MADRS total score change from baseline to week 10, which was analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment group, study center, visit, and treatment-group-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and the baseline value and baseline-value-by-visit interaction as covariates.</p><p>CGI-S score change from baseline to week 10 was a secondary efficacy outcome and was analyzed using an MMRM approach similar to the primary measure. MADRS sustained response (defined as MADRS total score&#x02264;12 for at least the last two consecutive double-blind visits) rate, also a secondary efficacy outcome, was analyzed using the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test controlling for study center. Additional efficacy measures included MADRS response (defined as&#x02265;50% improvement in total score compared with baseline), CGI-I score at endpoint, CGI-I response rate (defined as CGI-I&#x02264;2), and change from baseline to week 10 in HAMA total score. CGI-I and HAMA outcomes were analyzed using an MMRM approach similar to the primary analyses. MADRS and CGI-I response rates were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model.</p><p>Sensitivity analyses for the primary and secondary outcomes were conducted using a pattern-mixture model (PMM) based on non-future-dependent missing value restrictions (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Kenward <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) and an analysis of covariance based on the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach. All efficacy analyses were performed for each active treatment group versus placebo; the study was not powered to detect differences between active treatment groups. A matched parallel gatekeeping procedure (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) was applied to control type I error at the 0.05 significance level across the primary and secondary efficacy parameters and vilazodone doses.</p><p>Demographic and baseline characteristics were tested using a two-way analysis of variance with treatment group and study center as factors for continuous variables and the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test (controlling for study center) for categorical variables. Descriptive statistics were used for all safety parameters except CSFQ. Change from baseline to week 10 in CSFQ total score was analyzed for vilazodone 20 and 40&#x02009;mg versus citalopram and for citalopram versus placebo using an MMRM approach with treatment group, sex, study center, visit, and treatment-group-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline CSFQ total score as covariate and a Hochberg procedure (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Hochberg, 1988</xref>) to control for multiple comparisons.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patient disposition and demographic characteristics</title><p>Of the 1162 patients who were randomized, 1138 patients received one or more doses of double-blind study drug (safety population); 1133 patients had a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline MADRS assessment (intent-to-treat population).

In short-term clinical trials, a mean drug-placebo difference of at least two points on the MADRS has been suggested to indicate clinically relevant treatment effects (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Melander <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery and M&#x000f6;ller, 2009</xref>). For both vilazodone doses, mean drug-placebo differences exceeded this two-point threshold suggesting that the improvements in vilazodone-treated patients were clinically relevant. These results were supported by PMM and LOCF analyses. The SSRI citalopram was also associated with significant and clinically relevant improvements on the MADRS, supporting the validity and assay sensitivity of this trial.</p><p>The CGI-S can broadly capture additional dimensions that contribute to disease severity such as patient distress, functional impairment, and quality of life (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Targum <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Significant improvement in CGI-S scores relative to placebo suggested that vilazodone treatment was associated with reduced global disease severity.</p><p>Sustained response (MADRS&#x02264;12 for at least the last two consecutive visits during double-blind treatment) is a newly defined efficacy outcome that was developed with guidance from the FDA to show evidence of treatment benefits that are maintained beyond an individual time point in a short-term study. In this study, sustained response rates were higher in all active treatment groups compared with placebo but the differences did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>Results on additional efficacy measures supported the beneficial effects of vilazodone seen on the primary efficacy outcome. Vilazodone 20&#x02009;mg/day was significantly superior to placebo on CGI-I scores and MADRS response rates at week 10. HAMA change from baseline and CGI-I response rates improved over time but did not achieve statistical significance relative to placebo. In the vilazodone 40&#x02009;mg/day group, all additional efficacy measures except for HAMA total score were statistically significant versus placebo. Citalopram showed significant advantages to placebo on all additional efficacy measures.</p><p>Antidepressant side effects are common and can negatively impact patient outcomes. Intolerability to medication is one of the most common reasons patients discontinue antidepressant treatment (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Demyttenaere <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Bull <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In patients that continue antidepressant treatment, adverse side effects can add to patient distress and diminish quality of life (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Cassano and Fava, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Papakostas, 2008</xref>). Some side effects, such as nausea and diarrhea, are usually short-term and resolve over time (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) while others, such as swelling, blurred vision, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain, are considered chronic side effects that persist with continued treatment (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Vilazodone and citalopram were generally well tolerated in this study with most AEs considered to be of mild or moderate severity. Gastrointestinal-related AEs, particularly diarrhea, were higher in the vilazodone groups relative to citalopram and placebo; gastrointestinal-related events generally occurred during the early weeks of treatment and were transient in nature. Rates of fatigue and somnolence appeared to be higher with citalopram relative to vilazodone; conversely, insomnia was higher in the vilazodone groups compared with the citalopram group.</p><p>Sexual dysfunction is both a symptom of MDD and a common and persistent side effect associated with SSRIs. In this study, rates of sexual dysfunction-related AEs were lowest with placebo and slightly higher with citalopram compared with vilazodone. In addition, the CSFQ was used to assess sexual function throughout the study. All treatment groups showed improvements from baseline in mean CSFQ scores, with the greatest improvement occurring in the vilazodone 20&#x02009;mg/day and placebo groups and smallest increases in the citalopram group. The differences between treatment groups were not statistically significant.</p><p>Weight gain is also a persistent treatment-related side effect and a common reason for antidepressant nonadherence (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In this study, mean weight gain was low and similar across treatment groups. Changes in other vital signs and laboratory parameters were small and similar between treatment groups.</p><p>This study was not powered to detect differences between dose groups but inclusion of two vilazodone doses allowed evaluation of potential dose response. Improvements in most efficacy measures were comparable between vilazodone 20 and 40&#x02009;mg/day groups. Vilazodone 40&#x02009;mg/day showed higher rates of CGI-I response relative to vilazodone 20&#x02009;mg/day. Vilazodone 20&#x02009;mg/day was associated with slightly lower rates of somnolence and vomiting, and greater improvements in CSFQ scores.</p><p>Limitations of this study include inclusion and exclusion criteria, which may limit generalizability of the results, and the short duration of the study. The study included both an approved vilazodone 40&#x02009;mg/day dose group and the active control citalopram 40&#x02009;mg/day; however, this study was not powered to detect differences in efficacy and tolerability between active treatment groups.</p><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Treatment with vilazodone 20 and 40&#x02009;mg/day compared with placebo was associated with significantly greater improvements in depression symptoms as measured by MADRS total score. The magnitude of changes on the primary, secondary, and additional efficacy parameters were generally comparable between active treatment groups. Both vilazodone doses were generally well tolerated in this study. These results support the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of vilazodone 20 and 40&#x02009;mg/day in the treatment of MDD. Vilazodone 20&#x02009;mg/day may represent an effective dose option for the treatment of MDD.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Writing assistance and editorial support for the preparation of this manuscript were provided by Adam Ruth, PhD, of Prescott Medical Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois, a contractor of Forest Research Institute, a subsidiary of Actavis/Forest Laboratories Inc.
