Nonpharmacologic interventions hold promise for enhancing functioning in these patients, potentially delaying functional impairment that denotes transition to dementia. Previous findings revealed that mnemonic strategy training (MST) enhances long-term retention of trained stimuli and is accompanied by increased blood oxygen level&#x02013;dependent signal in the lateral frontal and parietal cortices as well as in the hippocampus.

High definition tDCS (active or sham) will be combined with either MST or autobiographical memory recall (comparable to reminiscence therapy). Participants undergo memory testing using ecologically relevant measures and functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after these treatment sessions as well as at a 3-month follow-up. Primary outcome measures include face-name and object-location association tasks.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia (i.e., Alzheimer's dementia&#x02014;AD) with a rate of about 9.5% in those for more than age 70 years; this rate is expected to increase twofold to threefold in the coming decades <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Delaying conversion to AD will not only improve patient quality of life but may also reduce the financial costs of the disease. The diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) captures those who are cognitively symptomatic and at high risk of conversion to AD, yet demonstrate relatively preserved everyday functioning <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Learning and memory deficits are the most common presenting problem <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and are associated with medial temporal lobe atrophy and dysfunction <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Associative memory paradigms may be especially sensitive to early decline given their reliance on medial temporal lobe structures <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In fact, patients with MCI demonstrate deficits on ecologically relevant associative tasks such as face-name <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and object-location associations <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, which are accompanied by hypoactivation of key lateral frontoparietal and medial temporal regions relative to control subjects <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The lateral frontoparietal network (i.e., middle and inferior frontal gyri, inferior frontal sulcus, and intraparietal sulcus) is known to be important in successful memory formation <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, possibly because of its role in mediating working memory <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We further supported the importance of this network using effective connectivity analyses, which revealed that cognitively intact older adults engaged the left frontoparietal network during the successful encoding of new object-location associations <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In contrast, MCI patients engaged the right frontal eye field, a region known to mediate basic attentional saccades. Together, these findings suggest that memory deficits in patients with MCI may emerge through a combined &#x0201c;loss&#x0201d; of medial temporal and frontoparietal functioning.</p><p>The critical question is how to enhance or otherwise maximize memory in those with MCI, especially considering the limited cognitive effects of existing pharmacologic agents <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The current, ongoing, double-blind, randomized controlled trial addresses this question using two promising nonpharmacologic approaches: mnemonic strategy training (MST) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).</p><p>As we previously described <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, MST teaches participants to use cognitive &#x0201c;tools&#x0201d; that enhance the organization of information while also requiring patients to process information more deeply, factors known to enhance memory <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. We demonstrated that MST enhances memory for face-name <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and object-location associations <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and others have found comparable benefits for tasks such as word lists <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. These behavioral improvements were accompanied by increased activation in regions of the lateral frontoparietal network <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and the hippocampus <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Together, these findings suggest that MST may enhance memory by re-engaging these previously dysfunctional brain regions/networks. However, our prior data indicate two potential limitations. First, MST appears less effective in patients with &#x0201c;late&#x0201d; MCI (i.e., those closer to developing AD) than &#x0201c;early&#x0201d; MCI (i.e., those closer to &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d;) <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Second, patients have difficulty spontaneously transferring MST to novel types of information, a common problem in this area of research.</p><p>We selected tDCS as a potential method for overcoming these limitations. tDCS modulates neuronal excitability by passing a weak electric current between electrodes that are placed on the scalp. Traditionally, tDCS uses two electrodes (usually 25&#x02013;35&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup>): an anode that &#x0201c;introduces&#x0201d; the electrical current and a cathode that &#x0201c;collects&#x0201d; the current. Evidence suggests that neuronal somata under the anode become depolarized <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Thus, tDCS does not directly induce neuronal firing but, rather, produces conditions that make firing more or less likely to occur. To enhance focality, we are using high definition (HD) tDCS. This method uses a 4&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;1 ring configuration in which the central electrode is surrounded by four electrodes of the opposite polarity <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Practically, this means that the &#x0201c;ring&#x0201d; electrodes each use about &#x000bc; of the electrical current, whereas the central electrode uses the full amount. This approach limits the cortical modulation effects to the area of the four-electrode ring (see <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>) and presumably minimizes the confounding physiological effects of the ring electrodes. Applied to the motor cortex, HD-tDCS induces greater and more persistent neuromodulatory effects than the traditional approach <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> while remaining well tolerated and without significant side effects (see <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>).</p><p>We believe the combined use of MST and HD-tDCS is especially appropriate because there is evidence that concurrent tDCS and training enhances consolidation of the trained skill (see <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>). We target the left lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) given its importance in successful learning and in mnemonic strategy use (as described previously). Thus, we are particularly interested in the synergistic effects of combined MST and HD-tDCS. The current trial randomizes participants to one of four treatment groups that consist of MST or an autobiographical memory recall (ABR) in combination with active or sham HD-tDCS.</p><p>The primary objectives of the study are as follows:<list list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0010"><label>(1)</label><p>Examine the cognitive benefits of the interventions using ecologically relevant outcome measures. We predict main effects of group where MST is more effective than ABR and active HD-tDCS is more effective than sham HD-tDCS. Our primary interest, however, is in the cognitive by stimulation group interaction where we expect the greatest benefits of combined MST&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;active HD-tDCS and least (if any) improvement in ABR&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;sham HD-tDCS. Persistent gains are predicted to be most likely in the combined MST&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;active HD-tDCS group.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0015"><label>(2)</label><p>Use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate the neuroplastic/neurophysiological changes associated with intervention. We predict main effects of group where the MST and active HD-tDCS groups will demonstrate greater (ventro)lateral PFC activation than the ABR and sham HD-tDCS groups. The cognitive by stimulation group interaction is again of particular interest and should mirror the behavioral changes in Aim 1. An intriguing alternative outcome of reduced activation within the context of improved behavioral performance (analogous to a repetition suppression fMRI effect) would suggest increased processing efficiency.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Exploratory analyses will examine treatment effects on working memory and semantic processing. The targeted left ventrolateral PFC plays an important role in working memory, semantic processing, and successful memory encoding, all of which may be enhanced by active HD-tDCS over this region. These effects will be evaluated via behavioral performance and fMRI with the expectation of a main effect of stimulation (active&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;sham) but not necessarily a cognitive training group (given the targeted nature of MST) or interaction effect.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>This is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial with parallel groups allocated 1:1:1:1 using a superiority framework.

Specifically, patients will (1) report a subjective decline in memory (report can also be provided by an informant or clinician), (2) demonstrate objective impairment in memory (based on neuropsychological testing), and (3) remain generally independent in activities of daily living.

We designed these measures to adhere to common parameters used in clinically based tests to facilitate comparison with the wider area of research. Both these tasks have three versions that are comparable based on a number of critical features. Mnemonic strategies require time to implement (see discussion of important methodological factors in <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>), so both tasks provide 15-second exposures for each of 15 associations. Memory for these stimuli is evaluated after a 15-minute delay. Recognition foils are actual target stimuli (i.e., targets that were incorrectly paired with the face or object), thereby reducing reliance on familiarity and increasing reliance on recollection of the actual association. Key features and dependent variables for these tasks are listed subsequently. These measures are collected during the baseline/screening session, Session 6 (&#x0223c;60&#x000a0;minutes after the end of training), and Session&#x000a0;8.</p><sec id="sec2.3.1"><label>2.3.1</label><title>Face-name generalization task</title><p>Memory for each association is first assessed using <italic>cued recall</italic> where the patient sees a face and is asked to recall the name.

Recall of the route is assessed in both serial and random order. The dependent variable is the number of turns correctly recalled. Analyses will evaluate change from baseline.

Each run consists of six active blocks (three novel and three repeated stimuli) and seven rest blocks (20&#x000a0;seconds each). During active blocks, five stimuli are presented for 5&#x000a0;seconds each and are separated by an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5&#x000a0;seconds. The ISI was randomized so that the across-block average within a given run was 15&#x000a0;seconds, which led to variability in the length of individual active blocks (from 34 to 46&#x000a0;seconds). Participants are instructed to push a button with their right index finger each time a new stimulus appears, a requirement meant to ensure they are attending to the task at hand.

In developing these tasks, we selected a total of 45 stimuli using color versions of the classic Snodgrass and Vanderwart set (obtained at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://spell.psychology.wustl.edu/Rossion_stimuli/" id="intref0020">http://spell.psychology.wustl.edu/Rossion_stimuli/</ext-link>) and, specifically, five stimuli from each of nine semantic categories. We created three groups of 15 stimuli (three semantic categories with five stimuli per category in each list) (Group 1: body parts, animals, and furniture; Group 2: tools, fruits, and clothing; Group 3: musical instruments, vegetables, and vehicles). These same three groups of stimuli are used in each scan session to mitigate any stimulus-specific effects; however, the stimuli used for a given cognitive task (0-back, 2-back, semantic 2-back) are rotated for each session. For example, group 1 could be used for 0-back during Session 1, 2-back for Session 7, and semantic 2-back for Session 8. Stimuli are presented using a block design (4 minutes, 30 seconds) that consists of five active and six (20&#x000a0;second) rest blocks. Within each 30&#x02033; active block, 15 stimuli are presented for 1&#x02033; and separated by a 1&#x02033; ISI.

Participants are also informed that sham HD-tDCS may be used but are not told the difference between active and sham parameters. All participants receive a study ID that is used on all study materials (i.e., no personal identifiers are used). All data are double scored and entered into a secure database to which only study team has access.</p><p>A series of random 6-digit computer-generated codes were created and preprogrammed into the Soterix Medical, Inc Clinical Trial tDCS unit. We use the sealed envelope method in which group assignment (i.e., the cognitive training condition and the numeric code for the tDCS unit) is placed within a sealed envelope at the beginning of the study. This numeric code is participant unique and allows for double blinding of HD-tDCS condition. A blocked randomization schedule is used with 1:1:1:1 allocation to each of the four groups that are run in parallel (i.e., active HD-tDCS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;MST, sham HD-tDCS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;MST, active HD-tDCS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;ABR, or sham HD-tDCS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;ABR). Soterix Medical Inc generated the codes. The study principal investigator (B.M.H.) generated the allocation sequence and shuffled the sealed envelopes. Study staff enroll participants and assign study conditions.</p><p>At the beginning of Session 2 (i.e., the first training session), a study staff member opens the envelope, thereby revealing the participant's cognitive training group and unique HD-tDCS code. Thus, participants are double-blinded (i.e., to the other cognitive intervention and to HD-tDCS status) and study staff are single-blinded (i.e., to HD-tDCS status). A study team member who did not administer the intervention(s) performs the outcome evaluations. A separate study team member who is double-blinded analyzes first level fMRI data. Second-level fMRI analyses will be performed at the end of the study after breaking the blind. Unblinding will occur during the study period only if a patient experiences an unexpected adverse event.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6.2"><label>2.6.2</label><title>Intervention by group</title><p>All groups undergo five training sessions on consecutive days.

The cognitive intervention (i.e., MST or ABR) occurs during the next 60 to 110&#x000a0;minutes (the first 30&#x000a0;minutes are concurrent with HD-tDCS) and the final 10&#x000a0;minutes are used to answer any questions and remove the HD-tDCS electrodes.

MST begins at the same time as HD-tDCS stimulation and persists for approximately 30 to 90&#x000a0;minutes after stimulation has ended. This approach intends to capitalize on the neuroplastic changes induced by HD-tDCS and to adaptively shape them using MST, thereby reinforcing the interactions necessary for successful strategy use. Patients will use the same three-step process as in our prior studies <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We refer to this process as &#x0201c;FRI&#x0201d;, for feature (F), reason (R), and image (I). In the first step, a salient <italic>feature</italic> is identified. Participants are encouraged to select something that is especially unique or unusual about the stimulus. Next, a verbally based <italic>reason</italic> for selecting that specific feature is developed. This reason should integrate the feature with the targeted information (e.g., the name). Finally, participants <italic>imagine</italic> and integrate these previous steps using mental imagery (i.e., by creating a mental &#x0201c;picture&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;movie&#x0201d;). On each subsequent trial, we require participants to recall the feature, the reason, the image, and then the targeted information (e.g., the name) in that specific order. To reinforce the use of the FRI approach, patients are given nine trials per stimulus. This process is designed to promote a specific series of steps that participants will use when encountering information in the future, thereby altering the manner in which they learn and recall information. We previously discussed the benefits of a trial-based format <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, which ensures comparable exposure to the study methods relative to a session or time-based design where individual sessions may differ substantially both within and between participants. Participants are required to independently develop the feature, reason, and image cues for each stimulus. A member of our research team monitors and records each step of the process to ensure compliance. We provide assistance and model appropriate cues as needed to promote successful strategy use. Participants practice this MST approach using a total of 12 stimuli (six faces and names; six objects and locations) in each session (108 trials per session; 540 total trials across all sessions).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6.2.2"><label>2.6.2.2</label><title>Autobiographical memory recall</title><p>We selected ABR as an active control condition for MST because it focuses on memory and engages patients in general conversation with our research team, thereby matching nonspecific factors and total session time. This approach is similar to reminiscence therapy, which has shown some positive effects in patients with AD <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> and, as a result, can be considered an active comparator.</p><p>This condition begins at the same time as HD-tDCS and persists for approximately 30 to 90&#x000a0;minutes after stimulation has ended. During each session, participants are asked to identify and write a brief description of five emotionally positive memories from each of five distinct periods of life (Session 1, 0&#x02013;15&#x000a0;years old; Session 2, 16&#x02013;30&#x000a0;years old; Session 3, 31&#x02013;45&#x000a0;years old; Session 4, 45&#x000a0;years old to 5&#x000a0;years ago; Session 5, last 5&#x000a0;years). Participants are then asked to describe each memory in their own words. The entire session is audio recorded for later transcription and analysis. After this free recall period, our staff asks the participant to rate how pleasant, significant, intense, novel, and vivid each memory is using a 7-point scale (with anchored values; 1 being lowest/worst and 7 being highest/best). Participants are also asked how frequently they think about or recall the memory. We then ask a series of questions that are meant to further probe the episodic aspects of each memory including how the participant felt during the event, what sights were around them, what kind of smells they experienced, and why the participant thinks they still recall the particular memory. These questions are meant to ensure comparable engagement and experience as with the MST group. In addition, however, we intend to analyze the transcribed data for linguistic qualities by Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count or other related methods. This approach may be especially informative given that HD-tDCS is being performed over the left lateral PFC (including &#x0201c;Broca's area&#x0201d;), which is known to be vital for speech production. Thus, it is possible that active HD-tDCS versus sham HD-tDCS could facilitate speech output over the course of the five sessions (this possibility will be evaluated in exploratory analyses). Such findings may be especially powerful given evidence that MCI patients recall fewer episodic details and use less complex language relative to control subjects <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6.2.3"><label>2.6.2.3</label><title>High definition transcranial direct current stimulation</title><p>Stimulation is performed using a Soterix Medical Inc tDCS unit (Clinical Trial system and connected 4&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;1 HD stimulation unit) within a quiet room. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref> shows our HD-tDCS montage and finite element models of electrical current flow (comparable results can be obtained using HD-Explore software from Soterix Medical, Inc).

Range checks and double entry will be used to ensure data accuracy. MRI data are transferred to a secure server and analyzed using an &#x0201c;attached&#x0201d; virtual machine. The primary analytic technique for behavioral data will be regression using the SAS mixed procedure (PROC MIXED or another comparable approach), which allows the interdependence of observations to be modeled directly and can include subjects with missing data at one of the follow-up periods. PROC MIXED has the capacity to handle unbalanced data when the data are missing at random (skipped visits, patient dropout, and so forth), although a large amount of missing data is considered unlikely because of the nature of the study and the efforts that will be made to ensure consistent follow-up participation. Each mixed linear model equation will model the change from baseline for one of the outcome measures as a function of intervention group, post-training session (i.e., Session 7 or 8), and group&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;post-training session interaction. In addition, all models may include potential confounders that differ at baseline between the groups (at <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.05) even despite randomization (there should be few, if any, given the sample size). Results of primary and secondary outcome measures will be considered significant if <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;.05.</p><sec id="sec2.9.1"><label>2.9.1</label><title>fMRI analyses</title><p>Given the anatomic specificity of our hypothesis, our primary fMRI analyses will use a region of interest (ROI) approach following the anatomic boundaries of the left ventrolateral PFC. After single-session preprocessing, we will calculate voxelwise area under the curve in which the hemodynamic response is averaged across all voxels and time points for the previously described contrasts during each of the fMRI session (Sessions 1, 7, and 8). This has the benefit of providing a single value for each group in each session, thereby substantially reducing the number of contrasts and increasing power. We will examine the ROI-based data using the same PROC MIXED (or related) procedures. Exploratory whole brain analyses will also be performed to evaluate treatment-induced changes that would suggest compensatory and/or restorative mechanisms. Connectivity analyses will be performed using the ROI as the seed area. We will then correlate the change in activation for both the immediate and long-term effects with the corresponding average change in behavioral performance on our primary outcome measures of the object-location touch screen test and face-name generalization task. These behavioral measures are completely independent of the fMRI data and, therefore, will provide an unbiased measure of the relationship between these variables. Exploratory behavioral and fMRI analyses for the working memory and semantic processing tasks will follow the aforementioned analytic plan.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><p>This ongoing double-blind, randomized controlled trial with four parallel groups evaluates the behavioral and neurophysiological changes associated with MST and HD-tDCS in patients with MCI. As discussed previously, prior research indicated that MST enhanced long-term retention of new information but that these benefits were attenuated in more advanced patients. In addition, patients have difficulty spontaneously transferring MST to new types of information&#x02014;a limitation that makes this type of training task-specific. HD-tDCS was included a method that may enhance functioning on its own, facilitate the acquisition and long-term use of MST, and, perhaps, increase the range of patients who benefit from MST. This approach builds on prior evidence from the motor literature that stimulation may enhance and/or prolong effects of behavioral training <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Thus, the difference in outcome measures in Session 6/7 (post-treatment) relative to baseline will provide evidence of near-term efficacy, whereas the difference between post-training and the 3-month follow-up will provide vital information about the persistence of changes and inform the timing of any necessary booster sessions.</p><p>Several methodological challenges exist with this type of study and we have adopted a number of procedures to proactively deal with such issues. First, we use a range of methods to enhance retention including didactics about why dropout is so detrimental to longitudinal research, encouraging participants to take part only if they are certain they will complete the study, and providing session reminders (via participant's preferred method of contact). Second, scheduling is tailored to the participants' availability, thereby minimizing conflicts. Third, additional travel funds were allocated to ensure equal access for all interested and eligible participants. Fourth, participants are allowed to take part in all standard clinical care activities. Importantly, however, there are no cognitive or physically based clinical programs for those with MCI that could confound results in the geographical region. Participants are required to be stable on medications for at least 4&#x000a0;weeks before the study and are asked not to alter their medications, unless recommended by their physician, until the end of the study. Any changes in medications or other health conditions are recorded at the time of the next study visit.</p><p>Our outcome measures were designed to be ecologically relevant to enhance participant motivation and transfer to everyday life. Although group-level effects are important, the study will yield rich clinical and neuroanatomic data that will be used to identify individual patient factors that affect treatment response. Such factors include cognitive functioning (e.g., scores on standardized neuropsychological testing) as well as the structural (e.g., brain volume/cortical thickness) and functional integrity of the brain at baseline (e.g., resting-state functional connectivity). Together, we expect our findings will provide critical information about these nonpharmacologic approaches that will guide future research and, ideally, meaningfully inform clinical practice in this growing population.<boxed-text id="dtbox1"><caption><title>Research in Context</title></caption><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0020"><label>1.</label><p>Systematic review: Previous studies have demonstrated that mnemonic strategy training can (re)engage key lateral frontoparietal and medial temporal regions thereby enhancing learning and memory, at least under some conditions.
