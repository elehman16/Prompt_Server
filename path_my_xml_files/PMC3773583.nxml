The release of cytokines, including interleukins, plays a key role in the pathophysiology of the process. Simultaneously, cessation of ventilation and pulmonary blood flow contribute to ischaemia&#x02013;reperfusion injury in the lungs when reperfusion is maintained. Collapse of the lungs during cardiopulmonary bypass leads to postoperative atelectasis, which correlates with the amount of intrapulmonary shunt. Atelectasis also causes post-perfusion lung injury. In this study, we aimed to document the effects of continued low-frequency ventilation on the inflammatory response following cardiopulmonary bypass and on outcomes, particularly pulmonary function.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods</title><p>Fifty-nine patients subjected to elective coronary bypass surgery were prospectively randomised to two groups, continuous ventilation (5 ml/kg tidal volume, 5/min frequency, zero end-expiratory pressure) and no ventilation, during cardiopulmonary bypass. Serum interleukins 6, 8 and 10 (as inflammatory markers), and serum lactate (as a marker for pulmonary injury) levels were studied, and alveolar&#x02013;arterial oxygen gradient measurements were made after the induction of anaesthesia, and immediately, one and six hours after the discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results</title><p>There were 29 patients in the non-ventilated and 30 in the continuously ventilated groups. The pre-operative demographics and intra-operative characteristics of the patients were comparable. The serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) increased with time, and levels were higher in the non-ventilated group only immediately after discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass. IL-8 levels significantly increased only in the non-ventilated group, but the levels did not differ between the groups. Serum levels of IL-10 and lactate also increased with time, and levels of both were higher in the non-ventilated group only immediately after the discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass. Alveolar&#x02013;arterial oxygen gradient measurements were higher in the non-ventilated group, except for six hours after the discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass. The intubation time, length of stay in intensive care unit and hospital, postoperative adverse events and mortality rates were not different between the groups.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite higher cytokine and lactate levels and alveolar&#x02013;arterial oxygen gradients in specific time periods, an attenuation in the inflammatory response following cardiopulmonary bypass due to low-frequency, low-tidal volume ventilation could not be documented. Clinical parameters concerning pulmonary and other major system functions and occurrence of postoperative adverse events were not affected by continuous ventilation.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cardiopulmonary bypass</kwd><kwd>respiration</kwd><kwd>artificial</kwd><kwd>lactic acid</kwd><kwd>interleukins</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Abstract</title><p>Since the development of the first heart&#x02013;lung machine in the 1950s, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has been the only way to provide a motionless and bloodless field. During CPB, circulation is maintained by mechanical pumps and venous blood is artificially oxygenated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref></p><p>Cardiopulmonary bypass is a non-physiological state where blood is exposed to artificial surfaces; laminar flow is employed instead of pulsatile flow, the heart is exposed to cold cardioplegic arrest and the body temperature is lowered. These key derangements lead to a series of inflammatory events involving the endothelium, leukocytes, platelets, complement system and the coagulation cascade, with the release of various cytokines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R02">2</xref> Surgical trauma, blood product transfusion and haemodilution also participate in this inflammatory process.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref></p><p>During CPB, pulmonary arterial circulation and alveolar ventilation are ceased and only bronchial arterial circulation supply oxygen to the lungs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref> After weaning from CPB, pulmonary reperfusion leads to ischaemia&#x02013;reperfusion injury (I/R), with the release of oxygen free radicals and the resultant lipid peroxidation and endothelial damage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref> Maintaining ventilation and pulmonary flow during CPB attenuates the inflammatory response.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref></p><p>In this study, we aimed to compare ventilation and non-ventilation regimes during CPB in patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Its influence on pulmonary injury was evaluated using lactate levels and measurement of alveolar&#x02013;arterial oxygen gradients, and on postoperative cardiopulmonary functions using clinical parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2a"><title>Methods</title><p>A prospective, randomised study was carried out. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and written informed consent was obtained from every patient. The study followed the Declaration of Helsinki 2008 on medical protocol.</p><p>Between October 2011 and February 2012, patients subjected to elective CABG surgery were studied. Patients undergoing redo surgery, and those with pre-operative renal failure (serum creatinine &#x0003e; 1.3 mg/dl) or hepatic dysfunction (serum aspartate/alanine amino transferase &#x0003e; 40 U/l), myocardial infarction within six weeks prior to surgery, any kind of pulmonary disease, pre-operative use of steroids and ejection fraction below 30% were excluded from the study.</p><p>A total of 59 patients were prospectively randomised into two groups as follows: in the operation room, each patient was numbered chronologically by the same perfusionist. He reviewed the patient&#x02019;s file prior to the induction of anaesthesia, based on a form explaining the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the anesthesiologist was informed about the proposed regimen. Odd-numbered patients (<italic>n</italic> = 30) were ventilated during CPB and the even-numbered patients (<italic>n</italic> = 29) were not ventilated.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Peri-operative management and anaesthesia</title><p>Pre-operative acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/day was continued in all patients prior to the day of surgery. All patients were pre-medicated with 10 mg of oral diazepam. Anaesthesia was induced with etomidate 2 mg/kg, fentanyl 1&#x003bc;g/kg, vecuronium 1 mg/kg, isofluorane 1 MAC with 50% oxygen and 50% air, and remifentanyl 1&#x003bc;g/kg bolus, followed by a 0.5-&#x003bc;g/kg/min infusion. Intra-operative arterial (through the radial artery catheter) and central venous pressure (through the right internal jugular vein catheter) monitoring was done.</p><p>The CPB circuit was primed with 1 500 ml Isolyte-S&#x000ae; (Eczaciba&#x0015f;i-Baxter, Istanbul), which is a balanced electrolyte solution, and 5 000 units of heparin were added. After anticoagulation with heparin (300 U/kg), CPB was established using a roller pump with a membrane oxygenator (Dideco Compactflo Evo, Sorin group, Mirandola Modena, Italy). The average flow rate varied from 2.3 to 2.4 l/min/m<sup>2</sup>. Surgery was performed under mild hypothermia (33&#x000b0;C). Mean arterial pressure was kept between 45 and 70 mmHg. All patients were rewarmed to 37&#x000b0;C (nasopharayngeal temperature) before weaning from CPB. Heparin was neutralised with 1:1 protamine sulfate.</p><p>Cold (4&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C) blood cardioplegia (1 000 ml, 25 mEq/l potassium) was administered after aortic cross clamping, and 500-ml repeat doses were given every 15 to 20 minutes (antegrade and from the venous bypass grafts; retrograde in the case of left main stenosis). Terminal warm blood cardioplegia (36&#x02013;37&#x000b0;C) was given prior to aortic clamp release. The operating room temperature was kept at 20&#x02013;21&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Following surgery, the patients were taken to the intensive care unit (ICU), intubated, and intravenous propofol (1&#x02013;2 mg/kg/h) and morphine (0.01&#x02013;0.02 mg/kg/h) were given for the maintenance of analgesia and sedation.</p><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) was diagnosed based on an electrocardiogram. All patients were ECG monitored continuously during the ICU stay and for the first 24 hours in the ward. An ECG was immediately performed in cases of irregular pulse, palpitations or symptoms related to possible AF.</p><p>Primary outcome variables included mean time to extubation, length of stay in ICU and postoperative hospital stay, incidence of renal dysfunction (based on the finding that the peak creatinine value was &#x02265; 1.5 times the pre-operative value), postoperative stroke, total amount of blood loss postoperatively, postoperative exploration for haemorrhage, amount of blood and blood products used, and in-hospital mortality.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Ventilation strategy</title><p>After intubation, before and after CPB, all patients were ventilated with F<sub>i</sub>O<sub>2</sub> of 0.4 to 0.5, at a tidal volume of 7 ml/kg and respiratory rate of 12/min. Positive end-expiratory pressure was not used, and no requirement for FiO2 over 0.5 was required to maintain adequate oxygen saturation. The variability in ventilation parameters was to maintain a partial arterial carbon dioxide pressure between 35 and 40 mmHg.</p><p>In the non-ventilated group (NV), following establishment of CPB, ventilation was stopped (open to atmospheric pressure). In the ventilated group (V) mechanical ventilation with 0.5 F<sub>i</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at 5 ml/kg tidal volume and 5/min respiratory rate with zero end-expiratory pressure was maintained. In the ICU, patients had volume-controlled ventilation and were extubated when their haemodynamics were stable, and neurological and respiratory functions were noted.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Blood sampling and measurements</title><p>Peripheral arterial blood samples were collected from the radial artery catheter after the induction of anaesthesia (T<sub>0</sub>), and immediately after (T<sub>1</sub>), one (T<sub>2</sub>) and six hours (T<sub>3</sub>) after the discontinuation of CPB.

Only John <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> reported less extravascular lung fluid accumulation and a decreased period of ventilation.</p><p>In our study, we employed a modified ventilation strategy, the tidal volume was 5 ml/kg, but frequency was 5/min to avoid an uncomfortable operating field. Different from these studies, we documented higher &#x00394;A&#x02013;aO<sub>2</sub> in the non-ventilated group, except for six hours after discontinuation of CPB.</p><p>The effects of continued ventilation during CPB on pulmonary function are still controversial. This controversy is very briefly summarised by Schreiber <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis comprising 814 participants of 16 randomised trials. They concluded that continued ventilation was beneficial when serum levels of inflammatory cytokines were considered. Moreover, oxygenation parameters were improved and shunt fraction was decreased. However, all these documented effects were short-lived, questionable, and did not influence the clinical course and final outcomes.</p><p>A similar review reported by Vohra <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> also concluded that no convincing results of any ventilation strategies were available. In our study, aside from the cytokine levels and other formula measurements, the clinical outcomes were not affected by continuous ventilation during CPB. The intubation time, length of stay in ICU and hospital, and occurrence of postoperative adverse events were not different between the groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We did not document an objective finding that continuous, low-frequency ventilation attenuated the inflammatory response and positively affected postoperative pulmonary functions, adverse events and outcomes. We believe that further studies with increased numbers of patients and more detailed investigation of inflammatory markers should be done to be able to draw any conclusions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The IL kits were provided by Sanovel Pharmaceutical Company, Istanbul, Turkey.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
