We enrolled young infants (aged 0&#x02013;59 days) who either presented at a primary health-care clinic or were identified by a community health worker with signs of clinical severe infection. We included infants who were not critically ill and whose family refused admission. We randomly assigned infants to either intramuscular procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin once a day for 7 days (reference); oral amoxicillin twice daily and intramuscular gentamicin once a day for 7 days; or intramuscular procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin once a day for 2 days followed by oral amoxicillin twice daily for 5 days. The primary outcome was treatment failure within 7 days of enrolment and the primary analysis was per protocol.

We undertook the trial in five low-income settlements in coastal Karachi, Pakistan (Rehri Goth, Ibrahim Hyderi, Ali Akbar Shah Goth, Bhains colony, and Bilal colony), which are roughly 1 h drive from the main campus of the Aga Khan University in Karachi. These settlements are served by five primary health-care clinics, have an annual birth cohort of 8000, and have ongoing household surveillance of young infants aged 0&#x02013;59 days (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 1</xref>).</p><p>Infants from the catchment area were either referred to a study clinic by community health workers during routine household surveillance or presented with their family at one of the five primary health-care clinics, at which study clinicians screened them for eligibility to participate in the trial.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Inclusion criteria were age 0&#x02013;59 days, living in the catchment area, refusal by family to be admitted to hospital, and one or more signs of clinical severe infection (<xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text">panel</xref>). Infants were excluded from the study if their family agreed to admission, weight at presentation was less than 1500 g, major congenital malformations or suspected chromosomal abnormalities were present, surgical conditions needed hospital referral, they had been admitted for illness in the past 2 weeks, they had been included previously in the study, or they had one or more signs of critical illness (<xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text">panel</xref>). If the infant had signs of clinical severe infection, the study clinician first recommended hospital referral. If the family refused admission and the infant had no signs of critical illness, the study clinician offered trial enrolment with facility-based and home-based treatment. If the infant had signs of critical illness, parents were counselled again on the importance of hospital referral. If parents still refused admission, they were offered the reference treatment (ie, procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin) and were not enrolled or randomly allocated. Study methods have been described in detail.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p><p>We obtained written informed consent for infants to participate in the trial from parents or guardians. Consent included documentation of the refusal for hospital referral and acceptance of enrolment. A third party (community member) witnessed the consent procedure, and this individual also signed the consent form. We read the consent form to illiterate participants and took a thumbprint in lieu of a signature, which a third party witness countersigned. The study was approved by the ethics review committee of the Aga Khan University, ethics review committee of WHO, and the ethics committee at the London School of Hygiene &#x00026; Tropical Medicine.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>After obtaining consent, we randomly allocated infants to one of three antibiotic regimens: 7 days of procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin, administered intramuscularly (reference treatment); intramuscular gentamicin once a day and oral amoxicillin twice daily for 7 days; or procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin administered intramuscularly once a day for 2 days followed by oral amoxicillin twice daily for 5 days.

Study participants' families and study clinicians were not blinded to treatment allocation because giving placebo injections to sick young infants was judged unethical.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p>Study drugs were provided by the Aga Khan University pharmacy, stored at room temperature away from direct sunlight at study clinics, and administered using study-specific dosage charts present at every public health-care clinic (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 2</xref>). We administered intramuscular procaine benzylpenicillin (40&#x02008;000&#x02013;60&#x02008;000 units per kg) once a day, intramuscular gentamicin (4&#x000b7;0&#x02013;5&#x000b7;0 mg/kg in early neonates aged 0&#x02013;6 days; 5&#x000b7;0&#x02013;6&#x000b7;5 mg/kg in infants aged 7&#x02013;59 days) once a day, and oral amoxicillin (75&#x02013;100 mg/kg per day) twice daily in divided doses. Paramedics or study clinicians administered intramuscular injections at study clinics; study personnel gave the morning dose of oral amoxicillin at the clinic, and a community health worker visiting the child's household administered the evening dose. If the baby vomited within 30 min, the oral drug was re-administered. We followed up every participant daily at the public health-care clinics, from enrolment to day 8, then on day 11 and day 14 for vital signs (respiratory rate, temperature, and heart rate), danger signs of critical illness (<xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text">panel</xref>), improvement or deterioration in clinical status (defined as resolution or presence of one danger sign of critical illness),<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and adverse events (ie, relapse, death, or treatment failure). We referred young infants who failed treatment to hospital. If families still refused admission, we treated the infant with intramuscular ceftriaxone once a day for 1 week.</p><p>We collected blood samples at enrolment using appropriate aseptic precautions. We captured blood sample collection procedures on video for about 10% of participants as a quality assurance measure. We injected about 2&#x02013;3 mL of blood (median 2&#x000b7;1 mL [IQR 1&#x000b7;4&#x02013;2&#x000b7;8]) into a bottle (BACTEC Peds Plus; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and transported the sample to the Infectious Disease Research Laboratory at Aga Khan University within 3 h of collection; we incubated the sample in a continuous monitoring system (BACTEC 9240; Becton Dickinson) for 5 days. If bottles were flagged positive by the automated system, we Gram-stained and subcultured blood culture broth on appropriate media&#x02014;eg, 5% sheep blood agar and chocolate agars incubated in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 35&#x000b0;C; Maconkey agar incubated in air at 35&#x000b0;C; or 5% sheep blood agar incubated anaerobically at 35&#x000b0;C. We did all identification and susceptibility tests in accordance with American Society for Microbiology procedures and Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> when applicable. For a few blood cultures that were smear-positive for campylobacter-like organisms but that did not yield bacterial growth on conventional culture, we also did PCR of the 23S RNA-conserved region of campylobacter, helicobacter, and arcobacter complex. Briefly, we extracted DNA (MagNA Pure extraction kit; Roche Diagnostics, Burgess Hill, UK) then did conventional PCR (Eppendorf MasterCycler Gradient; Marshall Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA)<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> and gel electrophoresis.</p><p>We categorised blood culture results as no growth, contamination, or bacteraemia (known or probable pathogen). We classed blood cultures with growth of common skin flora as contamination. We used bacteraemia to describe blood cultures positive for known pathogens, whether isolated singly or mixed with other pathogens or contaminants, or pathogens less commonly associated with neonatal sepsis, whether isolated singly or mixed with other pathogens or contaminants (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 3</xref>).</p><p>We checked for adverse events at every follow-up visit. Community health workers reported adverse events to study doctors at every study clinic, who graded them as serious or non-serious. Serious adverse events were those possibly related to study drugs, including: severe diarrhoea with dehydration requiring facility management; Stevens-Johnson syndrome; anaphylaxis; and acute renal failure. A study supervisor (trained paediatrician) verified the grading. Quarterly adverse event reports were reviewed by the study's data safety and monitoring board and technical scientific committee.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome of our trial was treatment failure within 7 days of enrolment, which we defined as either: death; admission; clinical deterioration;<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> change in antibiotic regimen because of infectious comorbidity (to intramuscular ceftriaxone); serious adverse event; occurrence of a new sign of clinical severe infection (<xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text">panel</xref>) on or after day 3; persistence of presenting signs at day 4; or recurrence of initial signs of sepsis on or after day 5. Among young infants who had treatment failure, secondary outcomes were: death within 7 days of enrolment; death at any time before the day 14&#x02013;15 assessment; and admission for any reason at any time within 7 days of enrolment. Among children who did not have treatment failure, secondary outcomes were: admission at any time between the day 8 and day 14&#x02013;15 visits; death at any time between the day 8 and day 14&#x02013;15 visits; and non-fatal relapse at any time between the day 8 and day 14&#x02013;15 visits (defined as admission, development of any sign of critical illness, or development of any sign of suspected sepsis).</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We postulated (from our previous experience) that the simplified antibiotic regimens would have equivalent efficacy to the reference treatment and that the risk of treatment failure would be 10% in all groups. For every comparison with the reference treatment, we planned to estimate the difference in the risk of failure between the two treatment groups and to use a two-sided 95% CI to assess the equivalence of the two simplified antibiotic regimens. We judged simplified antibiotic regimens as efficacious as the reference if the upper bound of the 95% CI for the difference in treatment failure was less than 5. Based on this criterion, we estimated that a sample size of 750 assessable children per treatment group would provide at least 90% power to show that the simplified antibiotic regimens were as efficacious as the reference treatment.</p><p>Since the aim of our trial was to show the equivalence of different antibiotic regimens, rather than superiority of one regimen over another, we analysed the primary outcome per protocol<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> rather than by intention to treat, which would tend to reduce any differences between treatment regimens. We defined per-protocol infants as those who had completed clinical follow-up fully (eight visits on 8 days) or partly (three visits days 2&#x02013;4, at least one visit days 5&#x02013;8, and known vital status at day 8) and who had adhered to treatment fully or partly (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 6</xref>). We defined infants who were fully adherent to treatment as those who received all doses of scheduled antibiotics for 7 days (or by the time of treatment failure, if failure occurred) and who had not received any other antibiotic from a study or non-study clinician. We defined infants who were partly adherent to treatment as those who had received all scheduled antibiotics on the first 3 days of treatment (or by the time of treatment failure) and at least 50% of all scheduled doses of each antibiotic on days 4&#x02013;7 (or by the time of treatment failure), and who did not receive any non-study injectable antibiotic before the day 8 visit (unless given because of treatment failure) or any non-study oral antibiotic on days 1&#x02013;3.</p><p>We did statistical analyses with Stata version 13.

Treatment failure was recorded within 7 days of enrolment in 90 (12%) of 747 infants who received procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin (reference), 76 (10%) of 751 who were given amoxicillin and gentamicin (risk difference with reference, &#x02212;1&#x000b7;9, 95% CI &#x02212;5&#x000b7;1 to 1&#x000b7;3), and 99 (13%) of 753 treated with procaine benzylpenicillin, gentamicin, and amoxicillin (risk difference with reference, 1&#x000b7;1, &#x02212;2&#x000b7;3 to 4&#x000b7;5); the upper bound of the 95% CI for both comparisons was within the prespecified margin for equivalence. The most common causes of treatment failure across the three study groups were persistence of presenting signs at day 4 (n=62), admission (n=51), and clinical deterioration (n=43). In analyses of all randomly allocated infants (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 4</xref>), treatment failure was recorded in 97 (12%) of 820 assigned procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin (reference), 81 (10%) of 816 allocated amoxicillin and gentamicin (risk difference with reference, &#x02212;1&#x000b7;9, 95% CI &#x02212;4&#x000b7;9 to 1&#x000b7;1), and 111 (14%) of 817 assigned procaine benzylpenicillin, gentamicin, and amoxicillin (risk difference with reference, 1&#x000b7;8, &#x02212;1&#x000b7;5 to 5&#x000b7;0).</p><p>28 (1%) of 2251 infants in the per-protocol analysis died within 7 days of enrolment, due to clinical severe illness, and the risk of death was similar across the three treatment groups (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>): 11 (1%) of 747 infants died who received procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin (reference), seven (1%) of 751 died who were treated with amoxicillin and gentamicin (risk difference with reference &#x02212;0&#x000b7;5, 95% CI &#x02212;1&#x000b7;6 to 0&#x000b7;6), and ten (1%) of 753 died who were given procaine benzylpenicillin, gentamicin, and amoxicillin (risk difference &#x02212;0&#x000b7;1, &#x02212;1&#x000b7;3 to 1&#x000b7;0). No deaths were attributable to study procedures. A further six children died between day 8 and day 15: two who were treated with procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin (both neonatal sepsis); two who received amoxicillin and gentamicin (diarrhoea, and neonatal sepsis); and two who were given procaine benzylpenicillin, gentamicin, and amoxicillin (neonatal tetanus, and neonatal sepsis). None of these six deaths was judged attributable to study procedures by the principal investigator or the data safety and monitoring board. Among all randomly allocated infants, 35 (1%) of 2453 children had died within 7 days of enrolment (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 4</xref>), 12 (1%) of 820 children assigned procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin (reference), ten (1%) of 816 allocated amoxicillin and gentamicin (risk difference with reference, &#x02212;0&#x000b7;2, 95% CI &#x02212;1&#x000b7;4 to 0&#x000b7;9), and 13 (2%) of 817 assigned procaine benzylpenicillin, gentamicin, and amoxicillin (risk difference with reference, 0&#x000b7;1,&#x02013;1&#x000b7;1 to 1&#x000b7;3). By day 15, a further three infants had died who were allocated procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin, two children assigned amoxicillin and gentamicin had died, and three children died who were allocated procaine benzylpenicillin, gentamicin, and amoxicillin.</p><p>Three non-fatal serious adverse events were reported among the 2453 randomly allocated infants, one in a child assigned procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin (diarrhoea with severe dehydration) and two in children allocated amoxicillin and gentamicin (diarrhoea with severe dehydration, and generalised rash). Two of these three events contributed to the initial reason for treatment failure at day 2. All three infants had recovered by the day 15 visit and were included in the per-protocol analysis. Among the 2251 children in the per-protocol analysis, 193 (9%) non-serious adverse events occurred, 79 (11%) in 747 infants treated with procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin, 55 (7%) in 751 who received amoxicillin and gentamicin, and 59 (8%) in 753 who were given procaine benzylpenicillin, gentamicin, and amoxicillin. The most frequent events were injection-site swelling (n=88) and mild diarrhoea (n=81).</p><p>Blood cultures were obtained from 2067 (84%) of 2453 randomly allocated infants, of which 1713 (83%) were negative after 5 days of incubation and 273 (13%) were contaminated. 81 (4%) cultures were positive for various pathogens (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 5</xref>); 79 grew a single organism whereas two were polymicrobial. Campylobacteraceae were the commonest group of pathogens cultured (n=18), followed by pseudomonads (n=13), enteric Gram-negative bacteria (n=12), and <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (n=8). Of 23 Gram-positive organisms, 19 (83%) were susceptible to penicillin. Of the Gram-negative bacteria, gentamicin susceptibility results were available for 14 organisms, and all but one <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> isolate were gentamicin susceptible. Ampicillin-susceptibility test results were available for 18 Gram-negative isolates, and nine (50%) were ampicillin susceptible. Overall, 32 (86%) of 37 microbes available for antimicrobial susceptibility were sensitive to a regimen including penicillin or amoxicillin and gentamicin. Ten (13%) of 75 children with bacteraemia and 227 (12%) of 1618 without bacteraemia had treatment failure; thus, bacteraemia did not predict treatment failure in per-protocol infants (risk difference 1&#x000b7;03, 95% CI &#x02212;6&#x000b7;8 to 8&#x000b7;9).</p></sec><sec id="cesec100"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results show that, in Pakistan, simplified antibiotic regimens are as efficacious as the reference treatment for young infants with clinical severe infection whose families refuse referral to hospital.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> This finding is consistent with those of two similar trials from Africa,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and Bangladesh.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Results from these trials have contributed to development of new WHO guidelines for management of young infants with possible serious bacterial infection where referral is not feasible.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p><p>A strength of our Pakistan study is that we included a much higher representation of infants aged 0&#x02013;6 days with clinical severe infection (44% of all enrolled children) compared with the other randomised equivalence trials of the simplified antibiotic regimens from Bangladesh<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> and Africa (Kenya, Nigeria, and Democratic Republic of Congo).<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Additional strengths of our study are the availability of bacterial aetiological data and antimicrobial susceptibility data.

A pooled analysis of data from our trial, the Bangladesh trial, and the AFRINEST trial in Kenya, Nigeria, and Democratic Republic of Congo is underway and will have an adequate number of infants aged 0&#x02013;6 days to support policy recommendations for this age group.

Susceptibility testing showed that a regimen based on penicillin or amoxicillin plus gentamicin would cover more than 80% of pathogens encountered.</p><p>The mix in severity of clinical severe infections in our study was affected by the proportion of infants identified at a very early stage by household surveillance. However, we made this trade-off to ensure adequate enrolment of infants aged 0&#x02013;6 days who otherwise do not present to facilities. Another consideration is whether the milder spectrum of illness, potentially including many children without a bacterial infection, could have biased the results of our trial towards equivalence. Although some enrolled children will undoubtedly not have had a bacterial infection, in a pilot study<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> using the same inclusion criteria as this study, a significantly higher rate of treatment failure was reported among children treated with co-trimoxazole and gentamicin compared with those treated with procaine benzylpenicillin and gentamicin.</p><p>Our study shares some limitations with the trials in Africa and Bangladesh.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> First, we did not mask clinicians or participants for ethical reasons;<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> placebo injections were not judged justifiable in sick young infants. Second, families of enrolled infants most probably refused admission because their child was not perceived to be very sick.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Critical illness was a chosen exclusion criterion in the design phase because we believed treatment of very sick young infants with simplified antibiotic regimens would have been unethical. Nevertheless, 35 (1%) of 2453 trial participants died despite antimicrobial treatment and 265 (12%) of 2251 per-protocol infants did not respond to treatment, indicating a substantial level of severe illness among enrolled children. Third, concern has been raised about observer bias in assessing the soft study endpoints.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Quality of clinical assessment was ensured through repeat training and supervision, and all treatment failures were confirmed independently by another study clinician, as described elsewhere.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Fourth, most infants were diagnosed clinically without availability of laboratory tests to indicate the presence or absence of infection. Since the main aim of this study was to find pragmatic solutions to scant access to antibiotic treatment for most young infants with newborn infections in low-resource settings, in environments where laboratory testing will not be available in the near future, we chose to use clinical definitions. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that because of the absence of reliable laboratory tests to diagnose newborn infections, and the high risk of adverse outcomes, it is common practice to diagnose neonatal sepsis clinically and treat empirically with antibiotics pending laboratory results, even in high-resource hospital settings. Finally, although low case-fatality was recorded with the study treatments under stringent trial conditions and close monitoring, application of these findings in programmatic settings might not yield such impressive results when adherence with treatment might be lower. The programmatic effect of implementation of these guidelines must be assessed carefully.</p><p>Our data show that simplified antibiotic regimens with fewer injections administered closer to home by a trained health provider were as efficacious as a reference strategy comprising more penicillin-gentamicin injections for treatment of young infants with clinical severe infection whose families declined admission. Overall, this evidence supports easier to administer regimens and can inform national and international policy on the treatment of sick young infants in situations when hospital admission is not accepted.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Oza</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Hogan</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Global, regional, and national causes of child mortality in 2000&#x02013;13, with projections to inform post-2015 priorities: an updated systematic analysis</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>385</volume><year>2015</year><fpage>430</fpage><lpage>440</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25280870</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>WHO</collab></person-group><article-title>Pocket book of hospital care for children: second edition&#x02014;guidelines for the management of common childhood illnesses</article-title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/child_hospital_care/en/" id="interrefs50">http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/child_hospital_care/en/</ext-link><year>2013</year><comment>(accessed Nov 1, 2016).</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref30"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zaidi</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name><name><surname>Tikmani</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name><name><surname>Warraich</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Community-based treatment of serious bacterial infections in newborns and young infants: a randomized controlled trial assessing three antibiotic regimens</article-title><source>Pediatr Infect Dis J</source><volume>31</volume><year>2012</year><fpage>667</fpage><lpage>672</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22481421</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref40"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Owais</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sultana</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Stein</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name><name><surname>Bashir</surname><given-names>NH</given-names></name><name><surname>Awaldad</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Zaidi</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Why do families of sick newborns accept hospital care?
