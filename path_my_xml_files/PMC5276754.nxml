(TTPBWS) and conventional physical therapy (PT) on subjects with anterior cruciate
ligament reconstructions. [Subjects and Methods] A total of 40 subjects were randomly
allocated to either a treatment group or a control group. Subjects received either
treadmill training with partial body weight support (treatment group) or conventional
physical therapy (control group). The circumferences of the lower extremities, Holden
classifications, 10-meter walking times and the International Knee Documentation Committee
(IKDC) scores were compared at 12 and 24 weeks post-operation. The knee joint stability
was tested at 24 weeks post-operation using a KT-1000. [Results] Significant differences
were found between the two groups at the 12 weeks post-operation. For most of the
measures, there was no significant difference between the groups at 24 weeks
post-operation. Interestingly, for most of the measures, there was no significant
difference between their values in the treatment group at 12 weeks and their values in the
control group at 24 weeks post-operation. [Conclusion] The function of a subject&#x02019;s lower
extremities can be improved and the improvement was clearly accelerated by the
intervention of treadmill training with partial body weight support, without compromising
the stability of the knee joints in a given follow-up period.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Partial body-weight support</kwd><kwd>Anterior cruciate ligament</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is very common in sport activities and traffic

Nineteen subjects did not meet the inclusion criteria and sixteen subjects declined
to participate. The inclusion criteria were: unilateral knee injury, preoperative MRI
showing a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament; positive drawer test, Lachman test, and
pivot shift test confirming the subjects had knee instability, but did not have meniscus,
cartilage, multiple ligament injuries and fractures; willingness to participate in a
rehabilitation program; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction performed by the same

gait.</p><p>All the subjects were treated with arthroscopic four strands of anterior cruciate ligament
reconstruction using autologous hamstring tendon, and fixed with a button plate and suture
plate suspension fixation system. Subjects were randomly and evenly (20 subjects per group)
allocated to either the treatment group or the control group by choosing sealed envelopes

during training. Subjects attended the outpatient rehabilitation room, according to the plan
of rehabilitation training, 3 times per week.</p><p>The program of the subjects in the control group was as follows: 1 week post-operation:
quadriceps and hamstring muscles isometric contraction, passive joint flexion and extension
exercises; 2 to 4 weeks post-operation: protective straight leg raises and partial
weight-bearing walking exercises; 5 to 12 weeks post-operation: closed and open chain knee
extension, knee extensor resistance exercises, full weight bearing stretched and flexed
walking exercises, squat exercise, descending steps, balance board and power bicycle
exercise; 13&#x02013;24 weeks post-operation: start to step forward and backward running, sideways
running and the &#x0201c;S&#x0201d; shape running practice.</p><p>In addition to performing the same training program as the control group, all subjects in
treatment group were asked to perform treadmill training with partial body weight support
with a brace limiting knee flexion to 60 degrees from 1 week post-operation. Initially,
subjects were encouraged to stand while bearing only some of their weight and shift their
gravity during standing. The initial weight-bearing was 30%, with a 20% increase every week,
aiming for double lower limb full weight-bearing and the ability to shift gravity stably at
6 weeks. Subjects were trained to get accustomed to the feeling of standing on both legs,
and then try gravity shift training with the help of a posture correction mirror and
guidance from the therapist to correct their standing position. The initial speed of the
treadmill was 0.2 m/s and was increased by 0.2 m/s every week; the slope of the treadmill
was always 0 degrees. Full weight-bearing walking training lasted from 7 to 24 weeks
post-operation under the protection of crutches at treadmill speeds of 1.0&#x02013;1.5 m/s.</p><p>The assessments included:</p><p>a. Circumference of lower extremities: the circumference of the leg was measured 10&#x02005;cm
above the patella in the supine position, and was compared with the healthy side.</p><p>b. Holden classification: Holden walking capacity classified into 5 levels.</p><p>c. Ten-meter walking time at maximum gait speed: Subjects 10&#x02005;m walking time at the fastest

proposition that early reconstruction helps to prevent secondary knee osteoarthritis and
meniscus injury has become the consensus. However, the operation can only restore the static
structural stability, while dynamic stability and knee function recovery require early
scientific and appropriate rehabilitation training. Traditional rehabilitation program
options can generally be divided into conservative rehabilitation programs and aggressive
rehabilitation programs<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The former have the problems of a long recovery period and
low satisfaction among subjects, while the latter have the risk of implant loosening, bone
tunnel enlargement and swelling of the joint. Therefore, rehabilitation should vary from
person to person and be based on the principle of appropriate rehabilitation<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In view of the fact that subjects after
ACL reconstruction can&#x02019;t bear their total body-weights and to compensate for the slow
recovery of the knee joint, we introduced treadmill training with partial body-weight
support into the rehabilitation program.</p><p>Walking is a complex and random movement that involves muscles of the whole body
cooperating to produce body displacement<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The discomfort and instability of the knee joint after ACL
reconstruction can lead to varying degrees of decline in walking efficiency<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The first demand of subjects undergoing
any surgery involving a low extremity joint is restoration of the pre-injury walking
condition, and this requires an improvement in the cooperative motion of multiple joints, as
well as the strength of the lower limb muscles. However, during this period, subjects often
exhibit abnormal gait patterns due to pain from lower limb swelling, lack of muscle strength
and imbalance of the contralateral side<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Treadmill training with partial body-weight support has already been
shown to be effective in neurologic rehabilitation<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Treadmill training with partial body-weight support provides a
safer environment for the recovery of walking ability, gait correction and balance
adjustment than traditional physical therapy. It combines weight-bearing, stepping and
stable balance, known as the three elements of walking, to promote the formation of normal
gait patterns<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, treadmill
training with partial body weight support is beneficial for the restoration of the stability
of positional control and limb coordination.</p><p>Some researchers have reported that early activity training might cause joint laxity, and
encourage joint inflammation and joint effusion<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Treadmill training with partial body weight support reduces the
muscle&#x02019;s contraction load on the lower extremity and promotes the development of lower
extremity muscle strength, as well as activity and weight-bearing capacities with a low
demand on muscle strength<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover,
treadmill training with partial body weight support can also make up for the absence of
closed kinetic chain training in the early stages due to insufficient muscle strength. In
the present research, significant differences were found between the two groups (p&#x0003c;0.05)
at the 12 weeks post-operation in the Holden classifications, 10-meter walking time, the
circumferences of the lower extremities and IKDC scores. Interestingly, the circumference of
the lower extremities, Holden classification and 10-meter walking time (p&#x0003e;0.05) values at
12 weeks post-operation in the treatment group were not significantly different from their
respective values in the control group at 24 weeks post-operation, indicating that treadmill
training with partial body weight support improved walking stability and accelerated the
rehabilitation process by stimulating the coordination and balance functions of each muscle
group<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, researchers have reported that early active rehabilitation may increase the risk
of implant loosening by blocking the revascularization process around the implant<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Closed kinetic chain exercise elicits
good recovery of knee joint function with low implant tension, while open kinetic chain
exercise better elicits muscle strength<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Treadmill training with partial body weight support gait training
can be considered as a semi-open and semi-closed kinetic chain motion because of its low
demand on muscle strength. The tension of the knee joint is largest between 0&#x02013;60 degrees, so
the limiting angle was set to 60 degrees in the training. The results show that treadmill
training with partial body weight support did not increase the risk of implant loosening or
rupture, and was a relatively safe way of moving, but the long-term effects on joint
stability need further observation.</p><p>Treadmill training with partial body weight support varies from person to person depending
on the different features of the subject, and more attention should be paid to strengthening
the gluteal, quadriceps, hamstring and gastrocnemius muscles, in order to facilitate future
gait training<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Throughout the training
process, the principle of slow and accurate, but not fast and unstable should be adhered to.
Special attention should be paid to the relationship between protection and training, and
treadmill training with partial body weight support provides a novel path to successful
rehabilitation in a way that gives the precise attention required. It can improve and
accelerate the improvement of function of a subject&#x02019;s lower extremities without compromising
the stability of the knee joint in a given follow-up period.</p><p>Limitations of this study were small sample size and the short-term follow-up period. The
long-term stability of the knee, lower limb function and gait changes need further
observation. Stability tests relied on a physical examination, not magnetic resonance
examination, therefore, tendon bone healing and bone tunnel expansion could not be observed.
At our hospital, all anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction operations are performed at
the acute stage, so a preoperative evaluation cannot be carried out as accurately as
postoperatively. A further control study is needed involving chronic anterior cruciate
ligament injury patients as subjects.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Brophy</surname><given-names>RH</given-names></name><name><surname>Zeltser</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Wright</surname><given-names>RW</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and concomitant
