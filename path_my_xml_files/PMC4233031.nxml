We compared the immune response to two single doses of the AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted H5N1 pandemic vaccine (3.75&#x02009;&#x003bc;g hemagglutinin of A/Vietnam/1194/2004) with that of two double vaccine doses (7.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g hemagglutinin) in adults aged &#x02265;61&#x02009;years. Here we report the 2-year persistence of the humoral and cellular immune response.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this phase II, open-label study, healthy participants aged 61 to 88&#x02009;years (median 68&#x02009;years) were randomised (3:1:3:1) to receive two single doses of the AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted vaccine (1xH5N1-AS) or the non-adjuvanted vaccine (1xH5N1), or two double doses of the AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted vaccine (2xH5N1-AS) or the non-adjuvanted vaccine (2xH5N1), 21&#x02009;days apart. Serum haemagglutination inhibition antibodies and cellular immune responses against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were measured in all groups at months 12 and 24; neutralising antibodies were assessed in a subset of the adjuvanted groups. Serious adverse events and adverse events of specific interest were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At month 24, haemagglutination inhibition antibody seroprotection rates were 37.2% (95% CI 27.0% to 48.3%) for 1xH5N1-AS, 30.9% (95% CI 21.1% to 42.1%) for 2xH5N1-AS, 16.2% (95% CI 6.2% to 32.0%) for 1xH5N1, and 8.3% (95% CI 1.0% to 27.0%) for 2xH5N1. Haemagglutination inhibition antibody geometric mean titres were 17.6 (95% CI 13.7 to 22.5) for 1xH5N1-AS, 18.4 (95% CI 14.2 to 23.8) for 2xH5N1-AS, 12.3 (95% CI 8.9 to 16.9) for 1xH5N1 and 9.8 (95% CI 6.7 to 14.4) for 2xH5N1. The median frequency of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells per 10<sup>6</sup>&#x02009;T cells (25th quartile; 75th quartile) was 852 (482; 1477) for 1xH5N1-AS, 1147 (662; 1698) for 2xH5N1-AS, 556 (343; 749) for 1x-H5N1 and 673 (465; 1497) for 2xH5N1. Neutralising antibody geometric mean titres were 391.0 (95% CI 295.5 to 517.5) in the 1xH5N1-AS group and 382.8 (95% CI 317.4 to 461.6) in the 2xH5N1-AS group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Antibody levels declined substantially in all groups. Seroprotection rates, geometric mean titres for haemagglutination inhibition antibodies, and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses tended to be higher in the AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted groups. There was no clear benefit, in terms of long-term persistence of the immune response, of doubling the dose of the adjuvanted vaccine. No safety concern was observed up to 24&#x02009;months post-primary vaccination.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00397215">NCT00397215</ext-link> (7 November 2006).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/1745-6215-15-419) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Avian influenza</kwd><kwd>H5N1</kwd><kwd>Pre-pandemic vaccine</kwd><kwd>Persistence</kwd><kwd>Elderly population</kwd><kwd>Cell-mediated immune response</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Outbreaks of avian influenza H5N1 viruses emerged in 1997 and remain a considerable threat. A key strategy for pandemic preparedness involves the development of a pre-pandemic vaccine to prime the immune system against H5 variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Partial cross-protection may have a considerable impact on infection rates during early pandemic stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The induction of long-lasting immune memory by a pre-pandemic vaccine may allow for sufficient protection to be induced by just a single booster vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>An H5N1 pre-pandemic AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted vaccine based on the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 clade 1 strain is licensed for prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation, with a schedule of two injections administered 3&#x02009;weeks apart, from the age of 18&#x02009;years onwards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This vaccine has been shown to induce a cross-reactive immune response against drifted clade 2 H5N1 strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In adults aged 18 to 60&#x02009;years, a formulation of this adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine containing 3.75&#x02009;&#x003bc;g hemagglutinin was sufficient to meet all US Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and European Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) immunologic licensure criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Older persons often experience a reduced immune response to influenza vaccination, which is thought to be, at least partially, due to immunosenescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It is therefore anticipated that these individuals may need higher doses to enhance their immune response after vaccination.</p><p>We previously reported on the immunogenicity and safety of a single (3.75&#x02009;&#x003bc;g) or double (7.50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g) dose of the AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted H5N1 pandemic vaccine in individuals aged &#x02265;61&#x02009;years in a randomised, open-label study (NCT00397215) conducted in Belgium and Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Both the single and the double dose regimens were found to be well tolerated and highly immunogenic when administered as a two-dose schedule 21&#x02009;days apart. Although a double dose elicited a stronger immune response, the single dose was sufficient to meet all CHMP criteria for influenza vaccines in the elderly population. The immune response to both the single and double adjuvanted dose remained high after 6&#x02009;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The current manuscript presents follow-up data from the population in Belgium on the persistence of the humoral and cellular immune responses up to 2&#x02009;years after the first vaccination with the H5N1 vaccine. We assessed the persistence of the immune response against the vaccine-homologous A/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain, as well as against the heterologous A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain. Safety data, in terms of serious adverse events (SAE) and adverse events of specific interest (AESI) up to 24&#x02009;months after the first vaccination, are also presented.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study vaccines</title><p>The H5N1 inactivated, split-virion recombinant vaccine was manufactured by GSK Vaccines (Dresden, Germany), as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

We previously reported that two injections of a double dose of the AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted H5N1 pandemic vaccine induced a stronger immune response than two injections of a single dose in participants (&#x0003e;60&#x02009;years old), although administration of two single vaccine doses was sufficient to meet the licensing criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, we reported that HI and neutralizing antibodies persisted at 6&#x02009;months after vaccination with the AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted H5N1 pandemic vaccine formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Here, we showed that persistence of the antibodies was observed up to 2&#x02009;years after vaccination, although expectedly antibody GMTs decreased considerably over time. Two double-dose vaccinations had no effect on the persistence of the immune response compared to two single-dose injections. This, together with our previous finding that the single-dose regimen was sufficient to meet licensing criteria, further supports the use of the registered adult dose and schedule in the elderly population. This knowledge is valuable in terms of simplification of the vaccination schedule across adulthood with no need for a specific dosage for elderly individuals, and it reduces the strain on the limited global production capacity of influenza antigen in case of a pandemic. A similar pattern in adults and elderly (&#x02265;61&#x02009;years) has also been described for two doses of an MF59-adjuvanted H5N1 pre-pandemic vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Two doses of another AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine were also sufficient to meet licensing criteria in older persons (&#x02265;65&#x02009;years), although GMTs were lower than in younger adults; persistence of the antibody response was observed up to 182&#x02009;days after the first dose in both age groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Higher HI antibody levels were observed in the adjuvanted vaccine groups than in the non-adjuvanted groups up to month 24, although the levels in all groups were low. Addition of the AS03<sub>A</sub> adjuvant thus appears to improve persistence of the immune response.</p><p>The observed neutralizing antibody titres for the vaccine homologous strain tended to be higher at month 24 than at month 12. However, this may most likely be explained by variability between assay runs, as the overall GMT values were low.</p><p>The HI immune response against the heterologous A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain was lower than against the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain in all groups, and GMTs were below the assay cut-off of 10 except for the 2xH5N1-AS group at month 12. Neutralizing antibody GMTs against A/Indonesia/05/2005 decreased compared to the post-vaccination timepoint, but remained well above the assay cut-off and also tended to be higher than the pre-vaccination GMTs (although the 95% CIs were overlapping for the 1xH5N1-AS group).</p><p>The use of antibody titres as a sole indicator for influenza vaccine efficacy is of limited value in older people; indeed, available data suggest that the cell-mediated immune response should also be taken into account in the evaluation of vaccine efficacy in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. T helper 1-cell frequencies have been shown to be a good early predictor of seroprotection after booster vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Similarly, we previously observed higher CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses against the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain for the adjuvanted than non-adjuvanted groups at day 21, which corresponded to higher post-dose two seroprotection rates in the adjuvanted groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Our current results indicated similar patterns of persistence of HI antibodies, neutralising antibodies, and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses, with a trend for improved persistence of the cell-mediated immune response in the adjuvanted vaccine groups. No CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses were observed, in line with our previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>No assessment of memory B-cell response was performed in the current study. However, in a long-term booster study with AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine performed in a younger adult population from Asia, the significant responses observed after one dose of heterologous booster vaccine up to 3&#x02009;years after priming allow to infer that a memory response is induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>During the 2-year follow-up period, antibody levels declined substantially in all groups. Higher GMTs for HI antibodies were observed in the adjuvanted vaccine groups compared to the non-adjuvanted vaccine groups. The CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses also appeared higher in the adjuvanted groups at both month 12 and month 24.
