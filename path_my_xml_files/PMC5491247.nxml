For instance, lower-limb compression garments have been shown to reduce serum creatine kinase (CK) levels, 1.5 and 3.5 days following rugby participation compared to a passive recovery method [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Likewise, compression garments have been shown to lower post-eccentric exercise CK levels, preserve range of motion in the elbow flexors, reduce perceived soreness and swelling, and promote force production recovery [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, other investigations have refuted the use of static compression garments on improving sports performance, post-exercise lactate, and/or post-exercise markers of muscle damage and/or recovery [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180429.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Commercial external pneumatic compression (EPC) devices differ from static compression in that they utilize whole-leg sleeves that operate by inflating and deflating a series of zones using modest inflation pressures (~20&#x02013;100 mm Hg). While it has been posited that EPC can exert localized vasoactive effects [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and improve post-exercise lactate clearance [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], EPC devices are also putatively analogous to a lower-limb massage which has been shown to decrease exercise-induced inflammatory signaling [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Interestingly, investigators have reported that a single 15 min EPC treatment acutely improves flexibility [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and increases the pressure-to-pain threshold (PPT) in the lower limbs following resistance training [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We have also published a series of studies examining how moderate pressure EPC affects transcriptomic and signaling responses in skeletal muscle after one acute treatment [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180429.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and after seven consecutive days of treatment [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in healthy persons. We have reported that a 1 h treatment of EPC increases intramuscular phosphorylated ribosomal protein s6 levels by 31% at 1 h post-treatment, while also increasing interleukin-10 (IL-10) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) mRNA 1 h post-treatment [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180429.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, we have previously reported that seven consecutive days of moderate-pressure EPC increases the mRNA expression of genes related to skeletal muscle hypertrophy (i.e., MHY2, IGFBP5, MYOM1) and oxidative stress resilience (i.e., CAT, SUOX) [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Despite the aforementioned studies suggesting that EPC can potentially modulate post-exercise inflammation and/or skeletal muscle signaling events, little mechanistic research has examined how utilizing EPC as an adjuvant to heavy resistance exercise affects functional recovery and the intramuscular signaling phenomena. We have previously utilized a heavy, voluminous, three consecutive day barbell back squat protocol and demonstrated significant increases in serum markers of muscle damage (i.e. myoglobin) and perceived soreness (i.e. self-reported analog scale) as well as a decrease in strength/performance (i.e. isometric peak knee extensor torque) 48-h following the last back squat session in a control group.[<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Thus, we chose to use the same protocol herein with and without EPC treatment, to examine if: a) EPC treatment after one bout of heavy squat exercise differentially affected mRNA and protein expression patterns related to inflammation, muscle hypertrophy, proteolysis and/or oxidative stress compared to sham, and b) if three consecutive days of EPC treatment immediately after heavy, voluminous barbell back squats and an additional two days of treatment alone affected the aforementioned molecular markers as well as soreness and performance-related variables in comparison to sham.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Participant characteristics</title><p>Prior to initiating this study, the protocol was reviewed and approved by the Auburn University Institutional Review Ethics Committee, and was in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. Apparently healthy males (N = 20) volunteered to take part in this investigation. Subjects gave written consent and completed the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire as well as a health history questionnaire to detect potential risk factors that might be aggravated by strenuous physical activity.

In addition, venipuncture and a <italic>vastus lateralis</italic> biopsy of the left leg was performed for subsequent analyses. Finally, 1-RM back squat values were established for determination of training loads. Participants then reported to the laboratory exactly 1 week later (i.e. Day 2; POST1) and performed 10 sets of 5 reps of the back squat at 80% of their established 1-RM. This was immediately followed by randomization to either the external pneumatic compression (EPC) or sham treatment group. According to group assignment, immediately following resistance training, participants were treated for 1 h. 1 h following treatment a second biopsy of the left <italic>vastus lateralis</italic> was performed. On the next 2 consecutive days (Day 3 and 4) participants completed the same resistance training followed by respective treatment protocol. On these days, venipuncture and muscle soreness and flexibility assessments were performed prior to resistance training. On the next 2 consecutive days (Days 5&#x02013;6) venipuncture and the muscle soreness and flexibility assessments were performed and were followed by treatment according to group assignment (no resistance training was performed). Finally, on Day 7 (i.e., POST2) participants reported to the lab for venipuncture and the muscle soreness and flexibility assessments. Thereafter, a third biopsy of the left <italic>vastus lateralis</italic> was performed and peak isokinetic right knee extensor torque was measured.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0180429.g001"/></fig><sec id="sec009"><title>Day 1 (pre-testing [PRE])</title><p>Participants were requested to report to the laboratory following a 4 h fast to control for any metabolic influence on study outcomes. In addition, participants were asked to forgo any strenuous activity for at least 48 h prior to arrival in order to minimize any residual markers of muscle damage. Baseline venous blood samples were then collected into a 5 mL serum separator tube and a 3 mL EDTA tube (BD Vacutainer, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) for subsequent analysis of serum and plasma markers, respectively, described below. Participants were then instructed to lay in a supine position on a treatment table whereby a baseline (PRE) percutaneous skeletal muscle biopsy was obtained from the left <italic>vastus lateralis</italic> midway between the patella and iliac crest using a 5 gauge needle with suction and sterile laboratory procedures. Briefly, 1.5 mL of 1% Lidocaine was injected subcutaneously above the skeletal muscle fascia prior to making a small pilot incision for needle intrusion. The biopsy needle was then inserted at a depth just beyond the fascia and approximately 100&#x02013;150 mg of skeletal muscle was removed using a double-chop method and applied suction. Extracted tissue was immediately blotted of visible blood using sterile gauze pads and had all visible fat and connective tissue removed. Thereafter, approximately 50 mg tissue was immediately placed in a 1.7 mL polypropylene tube containing 500 &#x003bc;L of cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) with pre-added protease and phosphatase inhibitors and processed for protein analyses as described below. Additionally, 10&#x02013;20 mg of muscle was placed in a 1.7 mL polypropylene tube containing 500 &#x003bc;L of Ribozol (Ameresco, OH, USA) for mRNA analyses as described below, and the remaining tissue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently stored at -80&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Flexibility was assessed by measuring knee range of motion during a modified kneeling lunge similar to the methods described by MacDonald et al [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Briefly, participants were positioned in the modified lunge position (upright and erect torso, left knee in line with left ankle perpendicular to floor, right knee in contact with floor behind the torso to the point of stretch-induced discomfort in the right hip) and the right hip angle was visually confirmed for positioning on all days of flexibility assessment. Thereafter, the subject&#x02019;s right knee was passively flexed by an investigator until the participant verbally noted the point of discomfort. The knee angle, in degrees, at this point of stretch was recorded with a goniometer using the lateral malleolus and lateral epicondyle along with the center of the <italic>vastus lateralis</italic> as landmarks.</p><p>Muscle soreness was measured by applying focal pressure to proximal, medial, and distal targeted areas of the right <italic>vastus lateralis</italic> using an instrumented algometer (Force Ten FDX, Wagner Instruments, Greenwich, CT, USA). The vastus lateralis was visually divided into the three sections (proximal, medial and distal) with markings made for pressure transducer application placed at the center of each section. Markings were made with permanent marker and remained visible throughout the duration of the study for each subject with occasional &#x0201c;touch-up&#x0201d; of the marks when fading was noted. The algometer pressure transducer was applied at a rate of approximately 5 N/s at each site until the subject indicated the point at which the pressure became painful. The point at which the pressure became painful (audibly indicated by participants) was termed the PPT and the value in N was recorded. The PPT was measured sequentially in cycles from the proximal to medial to distal site three times for triplicate measures. The average of the triplicate measures at each site was calculated as the respective PPT. Notably, the digital display of the algometer indicating force of application was blinded to the participants.</p><p>To assess strength/performance in the lower limbs, participants were then seated on the System 4 Pro Biodex isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Medical Inc., New York, NY, USA). Maximal knee extensor isokinetic torque of the right leg was measured across 5 repetitions at 60&#x000b0;/s with a brief rest period (~1&#x02013;2 min) between bouts. We chose an isokinetic speed of 60&#x000b0;/s given the moderately strong correlation between isokinetic knee extension and functional performance previously reported in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, although assessment of strength/performance using a more dynamic movement and/or similarity to the back squat was preferable, we chose to use isokinetic testing to 1) perform unilateral testing in a limb that had not been subjected to percutaneous skeletal muscle biopsies and 2) to better isolate the strength/performance to an area at which EPC was applied (e.g. reducing the influence of the back extensors) and from which molecular analyses would be derived (i.e. <italic>vastus lateralis</italic>).</p><p>A 5&#x02013;10 min recovery period was allowed following isometric/isokinetic dynamometry. Following this recovery period, participants began a one repetition maximum (1RM) back squat protocol. The first set of back squats occurred with the bar only (20 kg) for 5 repetitions. Participants were allowed a 2&#x02013;3 min recovery period if desired (minimum of 1 min.) and then performed 5 repetitions at ~50% of their putative 1RM. Participants were allowed a 2&#x02013;3 min recovery period and then performed 2 repetitions at ~80% of their putative 1RM. Thereafter, participants performed 1 rep whereby ~2&#x02013;5 kg were added until they were unable to achieve a successful lift or consensus between investigator and subject was reached regarding the 1RM value. To ensure that proper depth on each back squat repetition was accomplished, participants were asked to make contact with a box that was behind them without sitting on it entirely. The box was set at a height where the participant&#x02019;s femur was approximately parallel to the ground during the bottom-eccentric portion of the back squat. Following 1RM back squat testing, participants were scheduled for subsequent experimental visits. In addition, they were asked to not perform any strenuous physical activity for at least 48 h prior to their day 2 visit described below.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Day 2 (resistance training &#x00026; treatment bout 1)</title><p>Approximately one week following Day 1 (PRE), participants were requested to report to the laboratory 4 h fasted at approximately the same time of day as the Day 1 testing. Participants performed a back-squat warm up protocol of 10 repetitions with the barbell (i.e., 20 kg), and 10 repetitions at ~50% of their 1RM. Following the warm-up sets, participants performed 10 sets of 5 repetitions at 80% of their back squat 1RM with a 2&#x02013;3 min recovery period between each set. If participants were unable to complete the repetitions, a 5% reduction in weight was employed. Lifting volumes for the exercise bouts were recorded and included dropped weights. Immediately following completion of the exercise bout, participants were randomly assigned to either a 1 h treatment with EPC (NormaTec, Newton, MA, USA) or no compression (sham) whereby the participants had the leg sleeve on but not inflated for 1 h. The EPC device consists of two separate &#x0201c;leg sleeves&#x0201d; which contain five circumferential inflatable chambers (arranged linearly along the limb) encompassing the leg from the feet to the hip/groin. The &#x0201c;leg sleeves&#x0201d; are connected to an automated pneumatic pump at which target inflation pressures for each zone and the duty cycle can be controlled. However, the unit is commercially marketed with pre-programmed defaults for the duty cycle and recommended inflation pressure settings. In this study we chose to use an inflation protocol consisting of target inflation pressures of ~70 mm Hg for each chamber and a duty cycle that included 30 s of compression in each zone followed by a 30 second rest period during which all zones are deflated. We have previously investigated and described this protocol and system [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180429.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and a simple illustration of the compression pattern delivered by the EPC system is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180429.g002">Fig 2</xref>. 1 h following the conclusion of EPC or sham treatments, participants donated a second muscle biopsy from the left <italic>vastus lateralis</italic> (termed POST1) using techniques and processing procedures described above.</p><fig id="pone.0180429.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0180429.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Representative image of the external pneumatic compression (EPC) device utilized herein.</title><p>Pictured is the external pneumatic compression (EPC) device and leg sleeves (right) and an illustration of the peristaltic pulse massage pattern (left).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0180429.g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Days 3&#x02013;4 (resistance training &#x00026; treatment bouts 2 and 3)</title><p>For Days 3&#x02013;4, 24 h following the previous visit, participants reported to the laboratory 4 h fasted.

These changes included decreases in flexibility and the PPT, increases in blood markers of muscle damage and inflammation, alterations in muscle mRNA expression patterns related to proteolysis, ribosome biogenesis, inflammation, and markers of satellite cell activity, and alterations in protein expression patterns related to anabolic and proteolytic signaling, inflammatory signaling and oxidative stress. 2) There were several moderate-to-large effects of EPC relative to sham at various time points including, but not limited to, flexibility and PPT and MuRF-1, poly-ubiquitinated (poly-Ub) and 4HNE protein expression.</p><p>Although controversial data exists regarding causal relationships between a lack of flexibility or &#x0201c;muscle tightness&#x0201d; and injury/performance, some investigations indicate muscle tightness, as a relatively inherent by-product of training and competition, places individuals at a greater risk of injury [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180429.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the effects of EPC on flexibility over the course of several days in conjunction with heavy, voluminous resistance exercise. Other investigators have demonstrated that EPC acutely enhances flexibility, specifically in a forward split [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Importantly, in that study flexibility was only assessed immediately before and after a single EPC treatment independent of any exercise induced muscle damage whereas we assessed flexibility ~22&#x02013;23 h following each EPC treatment bout (and resistance training when applicable). We found that flexibility about the knee joint during a modified forward lunge was significantly lower in the sham group across Days 2&#x02013;7 (i.e. main effect of group) and that there were moderate effect sizes on Days 4&#x02013;7 indicating an attenuation in the increase in knee angle with EPC treatment. Since this resistance exercise intervention was only sub-chronic, the differences in flexibility are not likely explained by significant changes in tissue length. Mechanistically, as proposed by Sands and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], these findings may be related to the thixotropic properties of muscle tissue. This property of muscle is related to the sarcoplasm shifting from a &#x0201c;gel-like&#x0201d; state, which would be more resistant to lengthening, to a more &#x0201c;liquid-like&#x0201d; state that would be less resistant to lengthening [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Given the nature of this EPC treatment, the compression and therefore perturbation of the sarcoplasm of muscle cells could hypothetically reduce the viscosity of the medium through which the sarcomere shortens and lengthens augmenting flexibility.</p><p>The impaired flexibility in sham may also be related to residual cross-bridge attachment resisting stretch, particularly observed in sore muscle [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180429.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180429.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Indeed, other investigators have reported significant reductions in joint range of motion when subjects presented with muscle soreness [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180429.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] which PPT functioned as a proxy of in this investigation. We observed moderate-to-large effect sizes on the PPT on 3 occasions (Days 3, 4 and 7; 60% of non-PRE measurement days) and 5 occasions (Days 3&#x02013;7; 100% of non-PRE measurement days) at the medial and distal sites, respectively, indicating an EPC-mediated attenuation of soreness. These findings would appear to be in agreement with Sands and colleagues who reported that a single 15 min EPC treatment was associated with significantly higher PPT (i.e. lower soreness) immediately following treatment and after a subsequent bout of sport training, though these measurements were all performed in the same day [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Algometry has been widely employed as a more objective means by which the extent of muscle soreness can be quantified and has also proven to be a reliable, valid method so long as consistent, standard operating procedures are implemented [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180429.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, although PPT measurements via algometry functioned as a proxy of muscle soreness in this investigation, neither thixotropic-related changes in pertinent musculature nor residual cross-bridge attachment resisting stretch were directly measured and their role in the observed responses should be investigated further. Regardless, these findings can be simply explained as reductions in <italic>vastus lateralis</italic> muscle soreness via EPC usage when compared to passive recovery/sham alone. Interestingly, soreness did not appear to be differentially affected at the proximal site which we posit could be due to the coverage (or lack thereof) of the compression sleeves.</p><p>Aside from the more applied scientific findings related to flexibility and soreness differences between groups in this investigation, differences between groups also existed for markers of muscle damage, inflammation, proteolytic signaling, and oxidative stress. Specifically, the following findings will be briefly discussed below: 1) increases in serum CK and inflammatory marker levels were more robust at some time points, particularly on Days 2 and/or 3, 2) moderate-to-large effect sizes on atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 mRNA expression at the POST1 time point relative to PRE at which expression was reduced in the EPC group, 3) significantly higher muscle poly-Ub protein concentrations at the POST2 time point in the sham group compared to EPC and significantly higher MuRF-1 protein levels across the POST1 and POST2 time points in the sham group compared to the EPC group, and 4) significantly lower 4HNE levels across the POST1 and POST2 time points in the EPC group compared to sham.</p><p>A number of others have shown significant increases in serum CK levels following damage to skeletal muscle cells at the sarcolemmal and z-disk level [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and CK functioned herein as a gross marker of muscle damage. We observed relatively similar serum CK levels between groups though concentrations were non-significantly more pronounced at some time points in the EPC group. A similar pattern was noted with CRP concentrations in the EPC group and we posit that the compressive stimulus may &#x0201c;mobilize&#x0201d; a greater proportion of metabolites/cellular contents in the context of sarcolemmal injury to the extracellular space. However, Cochrane and colleagues have reported similarity in CK levels when comparing an EPC subject pool to a non-treatment control group after strenuous eccentric exercise [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Given the quantitative and qualitative similarity in this metric, other investigators findings, and the influence of other confounding variables when analyzing serum CK levels (i.e. genotype, training age, time of day, etc.), this finding warrants further targeted research [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] though clearly demonstrates the resistance training protocol employed was sufficient to cause marked skeletal muscle damage.</p><p>While muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle protein breakdown (MPB) rates were not directly measured herein, select molecular targets related to each process were employed to compare any differential responses between groups. Although our elected mRNA and protein targets related to canonical MPS pathways revealed no significant differences between groups (i.e. MGF, IGF-1, p-4EBP1, p-p70s6k), differential effects of EPC and sham on markers of MPB emerged. Each of the MBS-related mRNA and protein targets we examined are components of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Briefly, in muscle tissue, the UPS is a proteolytic system that degrades target proteins that have been poly-ubiquinated with multiple ubiquitin monomers through the coordinated process of three enzymes (&#x0201c;E1&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;E2&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;E3&#x0201d;), [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180429.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Numerous investigators have examined constituents of this system in the context of resistance exercise seeking to offer explanatory mechanisms for the increase in muscle protein breakdown (MPB) observed after bouts of resistance exercise [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and we refer the reader there for a more comprehensive description.</p><p>Atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 are two, muscle-specific E3 ligases catalyzing the conjugation of ubiquitin to a substrate protein and have been shown to be specific to contractile proteins [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180429.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The 20S core protein is the &#x0201c;catalytic&#x0201d; portion of the 26S proteasome and is involved in the degradation of contractile proteins [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Herein we did note moderate-to-large effect sizes for atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 mRNA expression at the POST1 time point suggesting a blunted or decreased response with EPC treatment compared to sham. In addition, there was a significant group (i.e. EPC) effect on poly-Ub and MuRF-1 protein expression with a large effect noted at the POST2 time point, which was approximately 72 hours after the final bout of resistance exercise. Others have shown similar increases in MuRF-1 mRNA, ubiquitin protein, and poly-Ub proteins up to 48h after resistance exercise, but to our knowledge expression of these targets at a time point corresponding to 72 hours after a bout or successive bouts of resistance exercise has not been reported which limits our ability to compare our findings [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180429.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, considering our proteolytic signaling data holistically, EPC appears to down-regulate proteolytic signaling when used concurrently with sub-chronic resistance training. We are unaware of any evidence revealing a concise mechanism whereby EPC may down-regulate proteolytic signaling in muscle tissue. In fact, in contrast to our findings, Siu and colleagues reported an immediate, significant increase in atrogin-1 protein expression following 6 h of static compression at ~100 mmHg in rats [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] suggesting that the dynamic nature (or lack thereof) of the compression stimulus may be critical to the proteolytic signaling response. Thus, more research delineating these aspects of the recovery-adaptation response to resistance training when employing EPC is warranted.</p><p>4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) is a resultant protein by-product of the lipid peroxidation of &#x003c9;6-polyunsaturated fatty acids under conditions of oxidative stress and functioned as a proxy of oxidative stress in this study [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180429.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Local oxidative stress seems to have been significantly reduced by EPC in this protocol as evidenced by the significant decrease in 4HNE levels observed in the EPC group across the POST1 and POST2 time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180429.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). The significant decline in 4HNE levels observed in the EPC group may indicate EPC-mediated oxidative stress resilience in conjunction with resistance exercise. Interestingly, in an earlier investigation examining the effects of a single EPC treatment without exercise we reported that: 1) SOD2 mRNA levels tended to increase 1 h post-treatment, and 2) SOD2 protein levels tended to increase 4 h post-treatment; both of these findings being suggestive that EPC may upregulate SOD2 which, in turn, increases oxidative stress resilience [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, in another investigation employing 1 week of EPC treatment without exercise we reported that 7 consecutive days of EPC treatment increases 4HNE levels in skeletal muscle without affecting SOD2 or catalase protein levels [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, in the latter investigation, the increase in 4HNE was associated with a lower target inflation pressure (~30mmHg) compared to that utilized herein (~70 mmHg). In our current EPC/exercise model, SOD2 or catalase protein levels were unaltered despite decrements in 4HNE levels in the EPC group. While our previous findings are difficult to reconcile with our current findings, it remains possible that EPC induces oxidative stress resilience independent of SOD2 and/or catalase gene regulation. In this regard, we have reported that 7 days of EPC upregulates sulfridoxin-1 mRNA which encodes for a protein that plays a role in oxidative stress protection [<xref rid="pone.0180429.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hence, our data collectively suggests the following: 1) EPC treatments without exercise seemingly upregulates oxidative stress which, in turn, increases the expression of genes related to oxidative stress resilience and 2) EPC with resistance exercise prevents summative increases in oxidative stress and this may be related to the aforementioned upregulation in genes (aside from SOD2 and catalase) that promote oxidative stress resilience while also potentially lowering prolonged muscle proteolysis. Importantly, the current study is a third line of evidence suggesting that there is interplay between EPC and oxidative stress and more mechanistic research is needed in order to continue exploring this relationship.</p><p>In conclusion, this is one of the first studies to our knowledge which has used EPC as an adjuvant to sub-chronic resistance training with the intent of characterizing functional and molecular recovery-related responses. Our data suggest that EPC reduces muscle soreness and attenuates reductions in flexibility, albeit the mechanisms through which this occurs need to be further elucidated. Likewise, the potential EPC-induced reduction in muscle proteolysis as well as oxidative stress warrant further mechanistic research.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the participants for devoting time to this study.
