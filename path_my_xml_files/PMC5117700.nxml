The risks associated with obesity during pregnancy and childbirth have been well-documented, and increase with advancing BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Immediate pregnancy and birth complications include hypertension and pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, need for induction of labour, caesarean section and perinatal death, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] while infants born to women who are obese are more likely to be macrosomic, require admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, be born preterm, have a congenital anomaly, and require treatment for jaundice or hypoglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Increasingly, there is recognition of a longer-term health legacy, maternal obesity being associated with a greatly increased risk of both diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and cardiovascular disease for the woman, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and a significant predictor of obesity in her offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>There is a substantial literature on gestational weight gain during pregnancy summarised by the Institute of Medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. While these recommendations advocate gestational weight gain of 7&#x02013;11.5&#x000a0;kg for women who are overweight, and 5-9&#x000a0;kg for women who are obese, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] a systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and large-scale randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] highlight only modest effects of antenatal dietary and lifestyle interventions in limiting gestational weight gain, with little impact on clinically relevant pregnancy outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Alternative strategies during pregnancy to improve health outcomes for women who are overweight or obese, and their infants, are required.</p><p>Increasing maternal BMI is a well-recognised risk factor for the development of gestational diabetes, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] with the two conditions creating a similar metabolic environment, characterised by insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, and a low-grade state of chronic inflammation, all of which influence nutrient availability for fetal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, women who enter pregnancy overweight or obese have an increased state of insulin resistance when compared with women of normal BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Metformin is an oral biguanide, has insulin sensitising properties, and is used increasingly in the treatment of gestational diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Metformin inhibits both gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, thereby reducing hepatic glucose production, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] while increasing insulin mediated skeletal muscle and adipocyte glucose utilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Metformin also promotes weight loss in non-pregnant individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Given the limited effect of antenatal dietary and lifestyle interventions during pregnancy on both gestational weight gain and clinical pregnancy and birth outcomes, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] there is a need for further evaluation of the role of adjuvant therapies, including metformin, as a strategy to improve health for women who are overweight or obese. The aims of this randomised trial are to evaluate the effects of antenatal metformin and dietary advice among overweight and obese pregnant women on maternal, fetal and infant health outcomes.</p><p>The primary hypothesis is that antenatal metformin and dietary advice in overweight and obese pregnant women will reduce the risk of an infant with birth weight greater than 4000 grams.</p><p>The secondary hypotheses are that antenatal meltformin and dietary and lifestyle advice in overweight and obese pregnant women will<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Reduce the risk of morbidity from other adverse outcomes for the infant;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reduce the risk of maternal morbidity from adverse outcomes;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Improve maternal quality of life and well-being; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reduce the costs of health care.</p></list-item></list>

The intervention has been designed to maximise flexibility and choice for women, while providing advice that can be incorporated into each individual&#x02019;s lifestyle.</p><p>Dietary advice provided will be consistent with current Australian dietary standards, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and based on our experience with the LIMIT randomised trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The dietary intervention will maintain a balance of carbohydrates, fat and protein, while specifically encouraging women to reduce their intake of energy dense and non-core foods high in refined carbohydrates and saturated fats, while increasing their intake of fibre, and promoting consumption of two serves of fruit, five serves of vegetables, and three serves of dairy each day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Tailoring of the intervention will be informed by stage theories of health decision making that propose that individuals progress through a series of cognitive phases when undertaking behavioural change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Initially, there will be a planning session with a research dietitian, in which women will be provided with written dietary and activity information, an individual diet and physical activity plan, recipe book and example menu plans. Women will be encouraged to set achievable goals for dietary and exercise change, supported to make these lifestyle changes and to self-monitor their progress, using a SMART goals approach. Women will be encouraged to involve their partner or significant support person in these sessions. These principles will be reinforced at subsequent face-to-face visits with the dietitian and research assistant, and during the telephone contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>All women will be asked to complete a food frequency questionnaire, exercise diary, and quality of life assessments at trial entry, 28 and 36&#x000a0;weeks gestation, and six months postpartum. Their weight will be recorded at trial entry, at 28&#x000a0;weeks gestation, and at 36&#x000a0;weeks gestation or nearest to birth. All women will be encouraged to attend for a research ultrasound at 28 and 36&#x000a0;weeks gestation that does not constitute routine clinical care, to monitor fetal growth, and in particular the development of small for gestational age infants.</p><p>For women who are diagnosed with gestational diabetes, it will be assumed that they are receiving metformin, and further metformin or insulin will be added as required to maintain appropriate glycaemic control as determined by her health care provider. All other care during pregnancy and birth will be according to the practices of the hospital at which the woman is booked to give birth.</p><p>After birth, information will be obtained relating to birth and infant outcomes from the case notes by the research assistant and the delivery form completed.
