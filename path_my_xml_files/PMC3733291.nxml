MW naturally is hazardous for environment and subsequently for human. Waste minimization (WM) is the latest alternative for risk reduction. All hospital staff generally and nurses specially can play an active role through education and the implementation of measures to reduce medical wastage and their environmental effects.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aims:</title><p>This study is aimed to compare nurses and other staff functions in selected hospitals in Isfahan about waste minimization strategies.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Settings and Design:</title><p>This is a descriptive analytical study. The study tool was a researcher -designed questionnaire in five area of waste minimization based on WHO recommendation.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>There were 90 nurses and other staff from randomized selected public and private hospitals of Isfahan as the sample of this research. This study was done in 2009.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Statistical Analysis Used:</title><p>Data were analyzed by t-test using SPSS<sub>16</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="st6"><title>Results:</title><p>Nurses mean score of WM performance was 58.16 (12), and others was 58.56 (12.18) (of max 100). There was no significant difference between nurses and others mean score of WM performance according to t-test. There was not significant difference between WM performances of two studied groups in public and private hospitals based on t-test.

Many materials are used in health care facilities, such as PVC and mercury, whether incinerated or disposed through other methods such as landfill, can result in the release of hazardous substances into environment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] The hazards to the human health and to the environment, posed by MW justify a high level of concern with its management.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>The problems of MW incineration, improper waste disposal, and general environmental degradation and the effects of these issues on human health eventually were recognized. Organizations such as the EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, American Nurses Association, HealthCare Without Harm (HCWH), and Hospitals for a Healthy Environment (H2E) have looked for ways to reduce the negative effects of health care practices on the environment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Considering all of mentioned problems and according to literature review, the best and most economical way of dealing with waste is to minimize its production.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Waste minimization means The reduction, to the extent feasible, in the amount of hazardous waste generated prior to any treatment, storage, or disposal of the waste. Because waste minimization efforts eliminate waste before it is generated, disposal costs may be reduced, and the impact on the environment may be lessened.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>WM usually benefits the waste producer: costs for both the purchase of goods and for waste treatment and disposal are reduced and the liabilities associated with the disposal of hazardous waste are lessened.</p><p>

</p><p>Waste minimization usually benefits the waste producer: Costs for both the purchase of goods and for waste treatment and disposal are reduced and the liabilities associated with the disposal of hazardous waste are lessened.</p><p>In Iran, as many other countries, environmental impacts and hazards of hospital waste have not received sufficient attention. In fact, the management of MW in Iran is struggling with numerous problems.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] In a study aimed to investigate waste management in primary healthcare centers of Iran in 2009, the mean of solid waste generation was reported 3.8 kg (bed-day)<sup>/1</sup>, respectively.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] In another study Sabour investigated the quality and quantity of hospital wastes in Iran, and based on this research Isfahan MW generation were reported 3.14 kg (bed-day<sup>/1</sup>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] It is obvious that treating this huge quantity of MW explicitly has a variety of unfavorable effects on the environment. Hence, we should be more responsible about healthy environment. As said before hospital staff specially nurses play important role in waste management.</p><p>If we want to improve standards of waste management in hospitals it should be initiated from personnel. In other words all of the hospital personnel are considered as a team for waste management. As WHO said, Good health care waste management in a hospital depends on a dedicated waste management team, good administration, careful planning, sound organization, underpinning legislation, adequate financing, and full participation by trained staff.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>It could be said, using WM strategies is the most appropriate alternative for managing waste anywhere especially in hospitals and all health-service employees, especially nurses, who have direct involvement in a majority of client care, have a role to play in this process. Nurses and other staffs who generate large quantities of hazardous waste in hospitals should therefore be trained in waste minimization and the management of hazardous materials.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Health care personnel should become ecologically sensitive and advocate changes that reduce the quantity of waste generated while maintaining quality patient care and worker safety.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>If the WHO recommended measures implement well by them, it will lead to the proper management of MW and a reduction in the environmental and health problems. So the first step for dealing this issue is, knowing present situation and that how do the hospital personnel act in daily works or to what extent they are sensible about waste reduction? The main objective of the present study was to investigate and regarding critical role of nurses in this process, the waste minimization performance of nurses and other.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This descriptive cross-sectional study aimed to assess the practice associated with waste minimization (WM) among nurses and the other personnel in selected hospitals of Isfahan in 2009. In order to provide comparability between both private and university hospitals in WM performance, study samples were selected from university and private hospitals. Four university and three private hospitals selected through simple random sampling. The sample size calculated as:</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-17-445-g001.jpg"/></p><p>120 person.

[<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. The deficit in both group performances could be attributed to lack of supervision, weakness in education programs, and specifically in nurses, related to unavailability of waste minimization instructions or booklets to be used as a nursing guide.</p><p>This result is consistent with findings of a study aimed to assess the practice related to waste management, among doctors, nurses, and housekeepers in the surgical departments, which stressed that only 18.9% of the nurses, 7.1% of the housekeepers, and none of the doctors had adequate practice.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>As regard to nurses responsibility was defined by ICN: Nurses in clinical care are producers of health care waste and yet are active participants in waste disposal procedures. Nurses in management positions develop policies that deal with the procurement of supplies as well as the production and elimination of health care waste.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] The nurses are expected to act better in this field. They must be equipped with the latest information, skills, and practices in waste management.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Nurses, as professionals, need to be aware of the consequences of the health care waste produced by the health sector. Nursing organizations need to: Define and regulate nursing competencies in environmental health and Facilitate nurses&#x02019; access to continuing education programs on the subject of health care waste.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>Further, same comparison was done in public and private hospitals and revealed.

Management in stores of chemicals and pharmaceuticals products apply to issues such as checking of the expiry date of all products at the time of delivery, use of all the contents of each container, or use of the oldest batch of a product first. Considering the content of this area, it could be attributed to high perception of personnel and due to the prominence of chemicals and pharmaceuticals hazards in people&#x02019;s minds.</p><p>Comparing between two studied groups mean scores by waste minimization areas, <italic>t</italic>-test was performed, and indicated significant difference between their performance in two areas: source reduction (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01) and waste segregation (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01).

Nurses know that a healthy environment impacts the health of people, families, communities, and populations. This knowledge is a foundational element of nursing practice.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] They must be equipped with the latest information, skills, and Nurses can become leaders in their work settings by advocating for the implementation of environmental health principles into both nursing. practice and the overall delivery of health care.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>Also comparing between two studied groups mean scores indicated that the other staffs have acted better in waste segregation. As mentioned above, careful segregation (separation) of waste into different categories helps to minimize the quantities of hazardous waste. Although the nurses have a major role to play about waste minimization but all of health services staff in all departments must be sensitive in this concern. Every one in the institution from the top down must be involved and must share the sponsorship of an environmentally sound and sustainable waste management program.[<xref ref-type="bibr"
