Pain has been defined by the International Association for Study of Pain as &#x0201c;An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage.&#x0201d;<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Long bone fractures are very painful. The definitive management of most fractures is operative intervention. Preoperative analgesia is required to manage distress associated with fracture reduction and traction.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Safe and effective management of fracture-related pain and anxiety will reduce patient's distress during initial evaluation and often allows definitive management of the fracture that is operative intervention.</p><p>In the elderly population, fractures of the femur commonly affect femoral neck, intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric area of femur, which often also involve the hip joint. The spectrum of femoral fractures is wide and ranges from nondisplaced femoral fractures to severe comminuted fractures. These fractures are almost always associated with significant soft-tissue injury, causing severe pain to patients.</p><p>Most of the patients require operative intervention. Regional anesthesia is most frequently given for surgical intervention for fracture femur. Patient positioning to perform a spinal blockade causes severe pain. Adequate pain relief before administrating spinal blockade will increase patient's cooperation. These patients require analgesia for positioning for spinal block.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Analgesia can be provided in the form of systemic analgesics, local anesthesia, or femoral nerve blocks (FNBs).<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) produces a more intense analgesic effect than intravenous (IV) administration of opiates when given to facilitate the sitting position for spinal anesthesia in patients undergoing surgery for femoral neck fractures.</p><p>FICB is devoid of side effects associated with systemic analgesics, such as nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, itching (associated with opiates) and epigastric pain, nausea, headache, dizziness, and rash (associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]). Complications of FICB (i.e., local anesthesia toxicity) are rare.</p><p>A wide range of local anesthetic agents are available for FICB such as lidocaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine. Till date, bupivacaine is the gold standard local anesthetic agent for nerve blocks due to its longer duration of action. Ropivacaine is a newer local anesthetic agent with greater selectivity for sensory blockade. Old-aged patients have also a high incidence of cardiovascular comorbid disease and poorly tolerated hemodynamic fluctuations in comparison to young adults. Ropivacaine has lower cardiovascular and neurological toxicity, so it seems to be an attractive and alternative choice compared to bupivacaine. There are fewer studies available indicating the usefulness of ropivacaine in FICB.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>At our institute, all lower limb fractures are generally managed under spinal anesthesia. Hence, we decided to conduct a prospective, randomized, double-blind, comparative study using ropivacaine in FICB to observe its efficacy to provide analgesia before performing a spinal anesthesia in the sitting position in patients with hip and proximal femur fractures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>We took effect size (<italic>d</italic>) as 1.5 in visual analogue scale (VAS), standard deviation (SD) was 2.5, and power of study was 80%, so sample size was calculated as 44.44 in each group according to the following formula.</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="IJOrtho-52-147-g001.jpg"/></p><p>Considering dropouts, it was decided to take fifty patients in each group.</p><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled prospective study.

</p><p>Each group included fifty patients. FICB was performed while patients were in the supine position with all aseptic precautions. A line connecting anterior superior iliac spine and pubic symphysis was drawn on the skin and trisected. The puncture site was marked 1 cm caudal to the point at which the lateral third met the middle third of the inguinal ligament line [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> After infiltrating local anesthetic agent (2% lignocaine) at the marked site, the block needle (18-gauge Tuohy) was inserted and advanced perpendicular to the skin surface till the &#x0201c;loss of resistance&#x0201d; was felt. The first loss of resistance was felt as the needle's tip crossed the fascia lata. The needle was advanced further at the same angle until the second loss of resistance was felt as the fascia iliaca was pierced [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The local anesthetic solution was injected over a 2-min period with firm pressure applied manually just distal to the puncture site. The local anesthetic solution used for all Group 1 patients in this study was ropivacaine 0.25%. Each patient was injected with 30 mL of the anesthetic solution. If there was swelling in the groin after injection, the region was massaged. Both of these manipulations (Pressure Application below injection site and Massage over local area) were to be performed to encourage the cephalad distribution of the injected solution.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The anatomical landmarks of fascia iliaca block.

Correct positioning during central neuraxial block is the prerequisite for a successful procedure. However, limb immobility and extreme pain are the deterrents for an ideal positioning for this procedure.

A large study, including the postoperative time period, would help validate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of this low-risk and highly effective compartment block. There are specific concerns regarding the elderly in the peri-operative period regarding side effects from medication. One such concern is acute delirium associated with opioid medication.

In summary, the concerns regarding patients with hip fractures include preoperative pain control, side effects from systemic medications, postoperative pain control, and complications.

The possible reason is patients of Group 1 had longer duration of analgesia than patients of Group 2 after cessation of effect of spinal anesthesia. At other durations in postoperative period (i.e., at 0 min, 30 min, 1 h, 12 h, and 24 h), VAS of Group 1 and Group 2 was statistically nonsignificant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). As patients of both the groups were under the effect of spinal anesthesia in the initial hours of postoperative period, this could be the possible reason for nonsignificance of VAS of both the groups before 4 h (i.e., 0 min, 30 min, and 1 h) in postoperative period. As patients of both the groups were given analgesic drug (injection diclofenac sodium 1.5 mg/kg) after their 1<sup>st</sup> demand of analgesia, that could be the possible reason for nonsignificance of VAS of both the groups after 4 h (i.e., 12 h and 24 h) in postoperative period.</p><p>As per this study results, we observed that the mean total duration of analgesia in Group 1 was 428.3 min after spinal anesthesia, whereas in Group 2, the mean total duration of analgesia was 240.1 min.

The FICB technique is associated with minimal risk because the puncture is made at a safe distance from the femoral artery and femoral nerve. Hence, there are less chances of vascular puncture, paresthesia, or intraneural injection of drug. Paria <italic>et al</italic>. also observed that overall FICB is a very low-profile risky procedure to block, and the risk of intravascular injection, toxicity of local anesthetic, and mechanical nerve damage is extremely low.
