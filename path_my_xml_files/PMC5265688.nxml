In the United States, it is estimated that the 5-year incidence of chronic renal failure after liver transplantation is 18.1%.<sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Moreover, patients developing chronic renal failure have an increased mortality risk that is estimated to be more than 4 times greater than those not developing chronic renal failure.<sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The vast majority of patients who undergo liver transplantation are currently placed on a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based immunosuppressive regimen, and this is a factor associated with an increased risk of renal dysfunction.<sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Strategies to reduce CNI-related nephrotoxicity by early CNI minimization/elimination are of particular interest in the field of liver transplantation. Recently, in a 24-month international, randomized, controlled study (H2304) in de novo liver transplant recipients, it was shown that early everolimus (EVR)-facilitated tacrolimus (TAC) dose reduction led to significantly better kidney function versus standard TAC (TAC-C) without compromising efficacy.<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The adjusted change (via an analysis of covariance model) from randomization in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-4 variables (MDRD4) formula,<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> favored EVR + reduced TAC (rTAC) over TAC-C by 8.5 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) at month 12 and 6.7 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002) at month 24.<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>There are notable differences in patients undergoing liver transplantation in North America compared with other regions in the world. For example, in the H2304 study, more participants from North America compared with Europe and rest of world (ROW) had hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.<sup><xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> This difference is not surprising because previous reports have recognized that HCV infection is known to be the most common cause of liver transplantation in the United States.<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In addition, North American participants from Study H2304 had lower eGFR values, and higher model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores at time of transplantation, than those from other regions.<sup><xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> They also had a higher incidence of diabetes and were older when compared with individuals from Europe and ROW.<sup><xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> These factors are known to be associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury.<sup><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Regional variation in patient characteristics after liver transplantation have also previously been reported in the literature.<sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Because geographical disparities in risk factors for posttransplant renal insufficiency could have an impact on study outcomes, it is important to analyze data for specific subpopulations to assess results in comparison to the overall study population.

An initial 30-day (&#x000b1;5 days) posttransplantation run-in period with TAC (&#x000b1; mycophenolate mofetil [MMF]) was stratified by pretransplant HCV status and eGFR (MDRD4).

EVR was initiated at a dose of 1 mg twice daily, with dose adjustment to achieve the target C0. All patients received corticosteroids for a minimum of 180 days. Enrollment in the TAC-WD arm was prematurely terminated, at the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee, due to higher rejection rates. Thereafter, eligible patients completing the run-in period were randomized 1:1 to EVR + rTAC or TAC-C.

AEs of lipid metabolism in the EVR + rTAC and TAC-C groups, respectively, included hypercholesterolemia (5 [7.7%], 2 [2.6%]), hyperlipidemia (5 [7.7%], 2 [2.6%]), and hypertriglyceridemia (5 [7.7%], 1 [1.3%]).</p><p>Wound infections were infrequent during the study, with only 2 (3.1%) AE reports in the EVR + rTAC group compared with 0 in the other treatment groups. Proteinuria was also uncommon: 0 with EVR + rTAC treatment and 1 (1.3%) with TAC-C treatment. A single case of stomatitis was reported in the EVR + rTAC group. AEs of infections/infestations occurred at a similar rate between treatments, with the most common being HCV (23.1% vs 20.5% in the EVR + rTAC vs TAC-C groups, respectively).</p><p>Throughout the study, AEs resulted in the discontinuation of study medication for 20 (30.8%) patients in the EVR + rTAC group and 14 (17.9%) patients in the TAC-C group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The only AEs that led to the discontinuation of more than 1 patient in these treatment groups were hepatitis C infection/acute hepatitis (n = 2) in the EVR + rTAC group and renal failure (n = 3), hepatitis C infection (n = 2), and increased blood creatinine (n = 2) in the TAC-C group. Most discontinuations resulting from AEs occurred within 6 months of randomization.</p><p>In the terminated TAC-WD arm, AEs were reported in 91.2% of North American patients over the course of the study, the most common of which were diarrhea (25.0%), abnormal liver function tests (23.5%), abdominal pain (22.1%), peripheral edema (19.1%), and pyrexia (19.1%).</p><p>In Europe and ROW, overall AE and discontinuation rates were similar to those in North America. The differences in individual AE rates mentioned above were not seen in Europe, with the exception of a higher incidence of leukopenia in the EVR + rTAC group compared with the TAC-C group (8.1% vs 1.5%).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>3-Year Results</title><p>After the 24-month core study, patients who completed 24-month treatment were offered enrollment into the extension study. After informed consent, in the North American subpopulation, 22 patients in the EVR + rTAC group, 15 patients in the TAC-WD group, and 42 patients in the TAC-C group were followed up until month 36; 14 patients in the EVR + rTAC group and 14 patients in the TAC-WD group were followed up to month 48. The mean change in eGFR from randomization to month 36 was +4.3 versus &#x02212;8.1 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (<italic>P</italic> = 0.059) in the EVR + rTAC and TAC-C groups, respectively. Over the same time period, the primary composite efficacy failure occurred in 14.1% of patients in the EVR + rTAC group and 19.3% of patients in the TAC-C group (P = 0.42). Between months 24 and 36, AEs were reported in 90.9% and 78.6% of patients and SAEs were reported in 31.8% and 28.6% of patients, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This report presents important subset analysis data on patients from North America participating in the H2304 randomized trial investigating the role and benefit of EVR for TAC dose reduction compared with standard-dose TAC immunosuppression. The use of EVR with TAC allowed for substantial and safe TAC reduction with resulting comparable efficacy and improved eGFR at month 12 compared with patients treated in the standard TAC control arm. Importantly, the improvement in eGFR was preserved at month 24 and month 36 (albeit the sample size was limited at this latter time point) with EVR + rTAC, in comparison to TAC-C. Thus, North American patients exposed to EVR + rTAC, despite having worse renal function and higher MELD scores at study start, had findings that were consistent with those of European patients and the previously reported overall population.<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>North American patients enrolled in the current study had slightly worse renal function for those randomized to EVR + rTAC compared with the control TAC arm (eGFR: 69.3 vs 76.4 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). These differences can be attributed to this study being a post hoc analysis on a subgroup of the H2304 study, and so the randomization of subjects was not controlled for the North American cohort. Our therapeutic drug monitoring data showed that at month 24 mean trough levels of TAC were 3.6 ng/mL in the EVR + rTAC arm versus 6.7 ng/mL in the TAC-C arm (slightly lower than in the overall population: ~4.0 and ~7.0 ng/mL, respectively).<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This finding indicates that use of EVR was successful in decreasing CNI exposure. Although the TAC-WD arm was prematurely terminated in this study, it should be noted that PROTECT, a separate long-term study assessing the effect of EVR treatment and TAC elimination on renal outcomes in de novo liver transplant recipients, was successfully continued for up to 60 months, and reported significantly better renal function and comparable patient and graft outcomes vs CNI-based immunosuppression.<sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>An important goal of the H2304 study was to establish that EVR for CNI exposure reduction was safe to use after liver transplantation. In this trial, the primary composite efficacy failure rate of tBPAR, graft loss, or death was noninferior with EVR + rTAC versus TAC-C at month 12 (6.7% vs 9.7%) and month 24 (10.3% vs 12.5%).<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The United States Prescribing Information (USPI) states a slightly different composite efficacy failure endpoint in its evaluation of this study (ie, tBPAR, graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up), which also showed noninferiority between the 2 treatment groups (9.0% EVR + rTAC vs 13.6% TAC-C at month 12).<sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In the USPI analysis of the composite efficacy failure endpoint of tBPAR, graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up,<sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> deaths that occurred after study discontinuation or study drug discontinuation were also included in the data analysis. Although this approach was not taken in our intent-to-treat analysis, there were no North American patients who died after study or study drug discontinuation and, thus, our results for this endpoint were identical to those using the USPI definition. A previous study found that the incidence of BPAR was significantly greater with MMF and sirolimus (12.2%) versus MMF and TAC (4.1%) at 12 months posttransplant, and that sirolimus was poorly tolerated.<sup><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> In the current analysis, EVR was well tolerated and tBPAR incidence at month 12 was lower with EVR + rTAC (6.2%) than with TAC-C (11.5%).</p><p>Important demographic differences were identified in North American patients when compared with European and ROW patients. As mentioned previously, patients were older, had higher body mass index and higher MELD scores at transplant, and had higher rates of diabetes and HCV infection associated with their chronic liver disease. Given that the North American patients had higher rates of these comorbidities, it is reassuring that the use of EVR + rTAC allowed for improved renal preservation in this cohort compared with the TAC-C arm of the study.</p><p>There are limitations to the current study. First, the H2304 study was developed as an international trial with no a priori plan to compare results across regions as well as between treatment arms within a given region. Second, the small sample sizes of subpopulations limit the ability to demonstrate significant differences in some of the outcomes; hence, the data are presented for the North American population as a whole. However, this study does demonstrate excellent immunosuppression and renal function outcomes for North American patients, despite the differences in study cohorts that existed at baseline. A follow-up study on a larger cohort of North American patients is warranted. Third, EVR + rTAC is the only approved regimen to lower TAC exposure in liver transplant recipients. Other immunosuppressive regimens are sometimes used to decrease CNI exposure in this population, including TAC + mycophenolic acid; however, the regimen of TAC + mycophenolic acid is not approved in liver transplantation and so was not investigated as part of the current study. The use of EVR with mycophenolic acid derivatives without CNIs may be another renal-protective strategy used in liver transplant recipients.<sup><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Fourth, there were high rates of discontinuation in both the EVR + rTAC and TAC-C groups (49.2% vs 32.1%). The higher discontinuation rate in the EVR + rTAC arm might be attributable to the fact that this is the experimental arm and so clinicians would have been less familiar with this treatment in comparison to the standard treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In summary, this report demonstrates that North American patients enrolled in the H2304 international trial investigating use of EVR to facilitate rTAC for immunosuppression after liver transplant had improved renal function at months 12 and 24 after study enrollment. The North American cohort had higher MELD scores at transplant and higher comorbidities with increased rates of diabetes, HCV, obesity, and MELD score at time of transplant compared with patients enrolled in Europe and ROW. In addition, patients randomized to the EVR + rTAC arm of the trial in North America had worse renal function at baseline compared with patients in the TAC-C arm of the trial. Nevertheless, North American patients randomized to EVR + rTAC maintained significantly better renal function (ie, improved mean change from baseline in eGFR) at month 12 and 24 compared with patients in the standard TAC dosing arm of the trial. Improvement in renal function was maintained at month 36. We believe this treatment strategy may allow for excellent immunosuppression with reduced risks of renal insufficiency after liver transplantation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank Oxford PharmaGenesis, Inc., and Rowan Higgs of Novartis Ireland Limited for providing editorial assistance, the funding for which was provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00622869.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Funding provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors of this article have conflictsof interest to disclose: WCChapman: Speaker's Bureau: Novartis.
