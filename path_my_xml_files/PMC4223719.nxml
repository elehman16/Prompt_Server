Schools are a promising setting within which adolescents can receive interventions aimed at promoting their mental health. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a resilience-based prevention-focused intervention in reducing the risk of mental health problems among adolescents attending secondary school in socio-economically disadvantaged areas.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A cluster randomised control trial will be conducted, with schools as the unit of randomisation. Initially, 32 secondary schools will be randomly allocated to a control or intervention group (12 control and 20 intervention). An intervention focused on improving student internal and external resilience factors will be implemented in intervention schools. A survey of students in Grade 7 in both intervention and control schools will be conducted (baseline) and repeated three years later when the students are in Grade 10. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire will be used to measure the risk of mental health problems. At follow-up, the risk of mental health problems will be compared between Grade 10 students in intervention and control schools to determine intervention effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The study presents an opportunity to determine the effectiveness of a comprehensive resilience-based intervention in reducing the risk of mental health problems in adolescents attending secondary schools. The outcomes of the trial are of importance to youth, schools, mental health clinicians and policymakers.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=343039">ACTRN12611000606987</ext-link>, registered 14 June 2011.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adolescence</kwd><kwd>resilience</kwd><kwd>school</kwd><kwd>mental health</kwd><kwd>risk</kwd><kwd>intervention</kwd><kwd>prevention</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Globally, the mental health of young people has been identified as a major area of health concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], with an estimated 10 to 20% of children and adolescents reported to have mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In Australia, just over a quarter of young people aged 16 to 24 years report to have experienced a mental disorder in the past 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], with the prevalence of such disorders decreasing as age increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>For adolescents, the risk factors for the development of mental health problems include social isolation, academic pressures, low self-esteem and poor body image [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], as well as health risk behaviours such as drug and alcohol use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Research indicates mental health problems may also develop as a result of adversity, such as trauma or a stressful life event, and that childhood adversities can have significant and lasting negative effects on mental health that persist into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Not all young people who experience disadvantage or adversity experience negative mental health outcomes. The concept of resilience provides one possible explanation for the ability of some individuals to maintain positive mental health in the face of adverse life circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Whilst often an inconsistently defined construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the concept involves the ability, when faced with stress or adversity, to actively employ individual traits (internal factors) and wider social, community and environmental supports (external factors) to return to or maintain a positive state of mental health and functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Internal resilience factors include personal strengths and factors such as self-efficacy and problem-solving skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. External resilience factors include meaningful school, home and community participation, and prosocial peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Resilience in the context of adolescence and mental health is defined as a process by which risks are encountered, and assets or resources (internal and external resilience factors) are used to avoid a negative outcome, such as mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Previous research in this area is limited; however, it suggests that high levels of resilience may prevent the development of mental health problems in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In a study of 307 Norwegian adolescents aged 14 to 18 years, higher resilience scores were associated with lower scores for levels of depression, stress, anxiety and obsessive&#x02013;compulsive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Such an association was also found in relation to depressive symptoms in a separate sample of 387 Norwegian adolescents aged 13 to 15 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], supporting the suggestion that fostering resilience may prevent the development of mental health problems in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Schools provide an opportune setting in which interventions to reduce the risk of mental health problems and to promote the resilience of adolescents may take place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Positive outcomes with respect to both participant resilience factors and aspects of mental health have been reported in the limited number of school-based interventions that have to date adopted a resilience approach to target both outcomes. For example, the Penn Resiliency Program, a group cognitive-behavioural intervention delivered in selected schools, has been found to reduce depressive symptoms across early to mid-adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Similarly, the Asia-Pacific Resilience Project, a school-based resilience program, has been found to be effective in reducing mental health problems for younger children in Grades 1 to 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In the authors&#x02019; knowledge, however, no such studies have utilised randomised controlled study designs, included a comprehensive measure of multiple external and internal resilience factors, and additionally assessed the risk of a range of mental health problems.</p><p>Given the identified gaps in research surrounding mental health and resilience in young people, a study is planned to assess the effectiveness of a comprehensive resilience-based prevention-focused intervention. The intervention is designed to improve student resilience factors and reduce the risk of mental health problems of adolescents attending secondary school in socio-economically disadvantaged areas. It is hypothesised that at follow-up, Grade 10 students in intervention schools will have a lower likelihood of being at risk of mental health problems compared to Grade 10 students in control schools.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>A cluster randomised control trial design (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) will be conducted. The unit of randomisation will be the school. Initially, 32 schools in socio-economically disadvantaged areas will be randomly selected to participate in the study and randomly allocated to either the control (12 schools) or intervention group (20 schools). Web-based surveys will be conducted with all consenting Grade 7 students at baseline in 2011.

The district covers an area of approximately 130,000 square km [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], has a large metropolitan centre, large regional areas and many smaller rural and remote communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>The study will be conducted in secondary schools, both Catholic and government, within the study district. To serve as a sampling frame, a list of all schools in the study area will be obtained from the NSW Department of Education and Training and from relevant regional Catholic School Offices. Eligible schools will be located within a disadvantaged Local Government Area (using the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA), which are indexes of relative socio-economic advantage and disadvantage by Local Government Area) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], have a secondary student population of 400 students or more, have enrolments in Grades 7 to 10, and be co-educational. Central schools, boarding schools and schools that are entirely special needs or selective in nature will be ineligible.</p></sec><sec><title>School recruitment</title><p>Briefing meetings will be used to inform principals of eligible schools regarding the study, prior to the issuing of invitations to participate. Following this, eligibility interviews with school principals will be used to ascertain current strategies used to promote resilience within the schools. Schools identified as having implemented strategies across Grades 7 to 10 addressing each domain of the Health Promoting Schools framework (curriculum, teaching and learning; ethos and environment; and partnerships and services) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] will be excluded.</p><p>Using a random number function (in Microsoft Excel), an independent statistician will be employed to order eligible schools. An invitation to participate will be sent to principals of the first 32 randomly selected secondary schools. Invitation letters will be emailed to inform principals of the study and request written consent for school participation. One week from the emailing of the information statements, principals who have not provided a response will be contacted by research staff to discuss any questions related to the study and to prompt a written response. At two weeks from the initial invitation, additional prompts will be made by research staff to principals still to reply. In the event that a school does not respond to the invitation or declines to participate, the school recruitment process described above will be repeated, with the next identified eligible school invited to participate. The process will be continued until 32 schools have been recruited.</p></sec><sec><title>Random allocation of schools</title><p>Following recruitment of the 32 schools, the sample will be stratified by school size (medium-sized schools have 400 to 800 students and large schools &#x0003e;800) and by engagement in a national government funding initiative directed at schools in disadvantaged areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

To maximise parental consent for child participation, a number of strategies will be utilised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. To maximise dissemination of study information, schools will be provided with information to share with the school community through existing school communication channels (i.e. newsletters, staff development days, staff and school bulletin boards, assemblies, community and parent gatherings). Study information packs will be mailed to parents. Packs will contain a cover letter formatted on the school letterhead from the principal, a detailed study statement for parents, a simplified study statement for students, a consent form requiring a parental signature for child participation in the study, and a reply paid envelope for return of the parental consent form. Within the parent study statement, parents will be provided information regarding a free call message service that they can call if they do not wish to have further contact from the research team.</p><p>Two weeks following the initial mailing of the study information packs, school-affiliated staff will telephone non-responding parents. During the call, parents will be asked to provide verbal consent or non-consent for their child to participate. For parents who provide verbal consent, replacement study information (a parent study statement, consent form and reply paid envelope) will be provided by mail. Additionally, informed student consent for participation in the evaluation component of the study, will be required from each participant prior to completion of student surveys at each point of data collection.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><sec><title>Intervention content</title><p>The multi-strategy resilience-based prevention-focused intervention will be implemented at a whole-school level (all students Grades 7 to 10).

The SDQ consists of five subscales: emotional symptoms (five items), conduct problems (five items), hyperactivity/inattention (five items), peer relationship problems (five items) and prosocial behaviour (five items). Statements are rated on a three-point Likert scale: 0 (not true), 1 (somewhat true) and 2 (certainly true); with a small number of items negatively worded and reverse scored. Student scores from the 25 individual questions that are in each of the SDQ subscales will be used to calculate five subscale scores, with 0 to 10 being the possible range of scores for each subscale. High scores on the first four subscales listed indicate difficulties, with high scores in the final subscale (prosocial behaviour) reflecting strengths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Four of the five subscale scores (emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention and peer relationship problems) will be added to determine a total difficulties score (total SDQ) with a range of 0 to 40, with the total SDQ score being the primary trial outcome. The score for the fifth subscale (prosocial behaviour) is excluded from the calculation of the total difficulties score, as the presence or absence of prosocial behaviour is not clearly indicative of the presence or absence of psychological difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Reliability has been demonstrated for the youth self-report version of the SDQ in relation to use of the total SDQ score (Cronbach&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.80 to 0.82) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], and the five SDQ subscales: emotional symptoms (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.66 to 0.75), conduct problems (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.60 to 0.72), hyperactivity/inattention (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.67 to 0.69), peer relationship problems (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.41 to 0.61) and prosocial behaviour (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.65 to 0.68) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Additionally, the youth self-report version of the SDQ has demonstrated validity when used for assessing the risk of mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], and in the comparison of pre- and post-intervention scores, in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcome: resilience</title><p>Student internal and external resilience factors will be measured using the Resilience and Youth Development Module of the California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The survey is one of the few to demonstrate conceptual adequacy by examining resilience using a multi-level approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Items within the survey measure six internal resilience factor subscales and eight external resilience factor subscales, which have demonstrated adequate reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The internal resilience subscales include items addressing co-operation and communication (two items), self-efficacy (four items), empathy (three items), problem-solving (three items), self-awareness (three items) and goals and aspirations (three items). The external resilience subscales include items addressing school support (six items), school meaningful participation (three items), community support (six items), community meaningful participation (three items), home support (six items), home meaningful participation (three items), peer caring relationships (three items) and prosocial peers (three items). Students will be asked to respond to all items using a four-point Likert scale: 1 (never true), 2 (true some of the time), 3 (true most of the time) and 4 (true all of the time). Scores from individual survey items are averaged to calculate scores for each of the 14 resilience subscales. Scores from each of the internal resilience subscales and external resilience subscales are averaged to calculate a total internal resilience score and a total external resilience score. The total internal and total external resilience scores are averaged to obtain an overall resilience score. The possible range for all resilience scores (item scores, resilience subscale scores, total internal and external resilience scores and overall resilience score) is one to four. CHKS subscales have been found to be internally consistent and valid (internal resilience subscales: Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.73 to 0.85; external resilience subscales: Cronbach&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.74 to 0.95) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Results of past research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] indicate that approximately 80% of students will participate in the survey. It is estimated that after accounting for a 25% attrition rate from baseline to follow-up, the cohort sample of interest will be composed of 1,360 Grade 7 students and 1,020 Grade 10 students in the control group, and 2,270 Grade 7 students and 1,700 Grade 10 students in the intervention group.</p><sec><title>Primary outcome: risk of mental health problems</title><p>Using the above participant estimations, a cluster size of approximately 85 students per school is estimated. Based on a one-unit increase in total SDQ scores for control students (based on Australian norms indicating approximately a one-unit increase in score with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]), and a conservative estimate of a two-point reduction in total SDQ scores for intervention students (previous research indicates positive changes following intervention or treatment indicated by a reduction in self-report total SDQ score ranging from 4.93 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] to 7.25 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]), it is estimated that approximately 11.6% more students at Grade 10 will score in the category of unlikely risk of mental health problems for the intervention group compared to the control group. The conversion from scores to percentages of students in the unlikely risk category was made using the SDQ frequency distribution for British 11 to 15 year olds, both sexes combined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Based on an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.037 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], and the conservative assumption of independence of scores within a subject from Grades 7 to 10, the study will have 80% power to detect a difference of 11.6% between the two groups at Grade 10, at a 5% significance level.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec><title>Analysis of demographic characteristics</title><p>To assess non-response bias, chi-squared analysis will be used to compare parental consent rates between intervention and control schools.

Descriptive statistics will be used to report the proportion of students scoring in each risk category.</p><p>Intervention effectiveness will be assessed via the primary trial outcome using mixed models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], under an intention-to-treat framework and using all available data. The primary outcome will be the proportion of students unlikely to be at risk of developing clinically significant mental health problems (total SDQ score &#x0003c;16) between Grade 10 students in intervention and control schools. Secondary outcomes will include analysis of the SDQ total and subscales both as scores and risks, the risks being examined as binary variables. The modelling approach will accommodate school clustering, and adjust for potential confounding effects (e.g. student or school characteristics). Sensitivity analyses will be carried out using pattern-mixture models. Subgroup analysis will be performed by gender. All data analysis will be conducted using the statistical program SAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the authors&#x02019; knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate the effect of a resilience-based prevention-focused intervention in schools, utilising a randomised control study design, inclusive of a comprehensive measure of internal and external resilience factors, and incorporating intervention components into the school curriculum, environment and partnerships, for the proposed length of time, on reducing the risk of mental health problems in adolescents.</p><p>The mental health of young people is linked to many short- and long-term health outcomes. The findings of this research will add significantly to the understanding of the mental health of young people and has the potential to inform universal interventions to increase the positive mental health, resilience and life outcomes of adolescents.
