Written informed parental consent was obtained before the enrollment. This was a prospective block randomized pilot study conducted at the inborn neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Arash Hospital; affiliated with Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Tehran (Iran) from April 2011 to May 2012.</p><p>The sample size was estimated 54 (27 in each group) with a type I error less than 5% and power greater than 80%. Preterm infants with gestational age 28-34 weeks with severe RDS who had needed surfactant replacement therapy within 48 hours after birth were enrolled in this study. Maternal characteristics (e.g. age), medical problems (e.g. diabetes or hypertension during pregnancy, gestational age, mode of delivery, prenatal corticosteroid administrations), and neonatal characteristics (e.g. birth weight, and sex of infants) were included by block randomized pilot study. Otherwise, the differences between the two groups were not significant regarding the maternal and neonatal characteristics.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were RDS, had required surfactant replacement therapy within 48 hours after birth, and extubated in one hour of surfactant replacement therapy. The exclusion criteria were any signs of asphyxia (5 minute Apgar score &#x02264;5), another respiratory disease other than RDS, major congenital anomalies, and had not needed surfactant replacement therapy within 48 hours after birth or had long intubation for more hours. To avoid maldistribution of GA and sex, the patients were blocked on these two variables by using four categories, namely 28-30 weeks males, 28-30 weeks females, 31-34 weeks males, and 31-34 weeks females (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Patients&#x02019; characteristics in HFNC and NCPAP groups</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="100%"><thead><tr style="background-color:#494c9f; color:#231f20;"><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NCPAP (n=27)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HFNC (n=27)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr style="background-color:#f2f2f9; color:#231f20;"><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Girl</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.99</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Boy</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.99</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#f2f2f9; color:#231f20;"><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28-30 weeks</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.99</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31-34 weeks</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.99</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#f2f2f9; color:#231f20;"><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Prenatal corticosteroid</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.27</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Administration of caffeine</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.99</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#f2f2f9; color:#231f20;"><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gestational age</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.33</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.52</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,601</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,642</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.7</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome and RDS score &#x0003e;7 and/or fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) requirement more than 0.4, who were candidate of exogenous surfactant administration by neonatologist,<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> were intubated for surfactant replacement therapy (Survanta, Abbott Comp, USA; 4 ml/kg via endotracheal tube).

They found that HFNC was associated with increases in the number of extubation failures and a higher level of oxygen requirement.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Yoder et al. showed that among infants &#x02265;28 weeks of GA, HHHFNC appeared to have similar efficacy and safety to NCPAP when applied immediately post extubation or as early as initial noninvasive support for respiratory dysfunction.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Shoemaker et al, compared HHFNC with NCPAP for neonatal respiratory disease.

They reported that HFNC can provide CPAP and replace NCPAP in preterm infants with mild respiratory disease.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Collin showed that with a flow rate of 8 L/min, there was no difference in the rates of extubation failure between infants randomly placed on either NCPAP or HFNC in the first 7 days after extubation. However, nasal trauma was significantly less in HHHFNC group compared with NCPAP.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Iranpour and his colleagues compared NCPAP and HFNC in preterm infant (30&#x02013;35 weeks gestation) with RDS, who had received NCPAP for the first 24 hours after birth. They showed HFNC was as effective as NCPAP in the management of RDS in premature neonates more than 30 gestational weeks. In addition, HFNC performed easier than NCPAP by maintaining a normal nasal mucosa.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Holleman-Duray et al. showed that HFNC is a safe and well-tolerated device for extubated neonates and decreased the duration of invasive respiratory therapy, especially in preterm infants. Therefore, it can decrease the rate of ventilator associated with pneumonia and ventilator induced lung injury due to less duration of mechanical ventilation.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Spence et al. studied intrapharyngeal pressure generated by HFNC at varying flow rates.

The ease of use of this device for nurses, better tolerance of infants, and more attachment between infant and parents may justify this replacement. Although, in this short study, the rate of reintubation was higher in the HFNC group, but it seems that higher level of maximum flow rate would be necessary for a better evaluation of this modality. We were more cautious to use higher flow rate as this was a pilot study and we were dealing with a new device in our setting. Therefore, we restricted ourselves to a maximum flow rate of 4 L/min. The pressure generated in infants treated with HFNC is dependent on the flow rate. Consequently, lower flow rates for HFNC were considered as a possible source of extubation failure. Probably, the rate of failure and reintubation would have been lower if we had used a higher flow rate in our study. In addition, as a limitation of this study, the number of infants was too few. Therefore, we recommend further randomized multicenter studies, including larger group of patients and higher level of maximum flow rate for a better evaluation of HFNC as noninvasive device in preterm infants with RDS who received surfactant via INSURE approach instead of NCPAP.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This project was supported by &#x0201c;Maternal, Fetal, and Neonatal&#x0201d; Research Center at Tehran University of Medical Sciences.
