We designed an audio recording device which, when attached to an inhaler, objectively identifies the time and technique of inhaler use, thereby assessing both aspects of adherence. This study will test the hypothesis that feedback on these two aspects of adherence when passed on to patients improves adherence and helps clinicians distinguish refractory from difficult-to-control asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This is a single, blind, prospective, randomised, clinical trial performed at 5 research centres. Patients with partially controlled or uncontrolled severe asthma who have also had at least one severe asthma exacerbation in the prior year are eligible to participate. The effect of two types of nurse-delivered education interventions to promote adherence and inhaler technique will be assessed. The active group will receive feedback on their inhaler technique and adherence from the new device over a 3-month period. The control group will also receive training in inhaler technique and strategies to promote adherence, but no feedback from the device. The primary outcome is the difference in actual adherence, a measure that incorporates time and technique of inhaler use between groups at the end of the third month. Secondary outcomes include the number of patients who remain refractory despite good adherence, and differences in the components of adherence after the intervention. Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat and a per-protocol basis. The sample size is 220 subjects (110 in each group), and loss to follow-up is estimated at 10% which will allow results to show a 10% difference (0.8 power) in adherence between group means with a type I error probability of 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>NCT01529697; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>MEDICAL EDUCATION &#x00026; TRAINING</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Approximately 10% of patients with asthma remain poorly controlled with persisting symptoms and severe exacerbations despite use of combination therapy with long-acting &#x003b2; agonists and inhaled corticosteroids.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This poor control may be due to medication refractory asthma or due to difficult-to-manage asthma from issues such as poor inhaler technique, poor adherence or coexisting comorbid disease.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> In practice, distinguishing refractory from difficult-to-manage asthma is difficult. For example, adherence to medications, a particular problem in patients with severe asthma, is difficult to detect since self-report is unreliable,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and pharmacy refill records only identify if the individual has collected a prescription. Some patients may demonstrate a reasonable inhaler technique when directly observed, but may be careless in their inhaler use on a day-to-day basis.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Hence, without objective longitudinal information on inhaler adherence and technique it is challenging to distinguish a patient with refractory asthma from one who has difficult-to-manage asthma.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>We developed a device, INhaler Compliance Assessment (INCA), which makes a digital audio recording of an inhaler being used.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

The study will comprise patients with severe asthma attending specialist hospital asthma clinics, who remain uncontrolled and have experienced at least one recent severe asthma exacerbation. Basing on information obtained directly from the INCA acoustic recording device, one group (the active arm) will discuss patterns of adherence and training on technique of inhaler use. The second group (the control arm) will be given generalised strategies to improve adherence, while technique errors will be corrected using checklists.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Adherence will be assessed objectively in all participants. Global outcomes will be quantified using the clinical, lung function, adherence and exacerbation data collected during the observation period.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Sponsorship</title><p>This is a researcher-initiated study, funded by the Health Research Board of Ireland (Pro/2011/57), and hosted within the Dublin Centre for Clinical Research clinical trials centres.

The trial is registered as NCT01529697 on Clinicaltrials.gov and a detailed statistical plan has been approved by an independent statistical team.

The study is being conducted at the Clinical Research Centres of five university hospitals within the republic of Ireland (4 in Dublin County, 1 in Cork County). At each centre between one and three nurses have been trained to provide either intervention. The lead clinical nurse was educated by the principal investigator and a respiratory nurse specialist.

This change is made by the physician looking after the patient in the outpatient clinic. Following this, the patient is then referred to the study. The patient may still refuse to enter the study. All other aspects of regular patient care are continued.</p><p>At the initial visit, the participant's age, sex, height, weight, duration of asthma, smoking history, number of courses of steroids in the prior year are recorded (self-reported by the participant). The dose of salmeterol/fluticasone and duration of taking this dose, use and dose of other inhaled therapy including short-acting &#x003b2; agonists, long acting muscarinic antagonist, nasal steroid and antihistamines are recorded. The nurse records the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and an Inhaler Proficiency checklist Score (IPS; see online supplementary appendix 1), a 10-point checklist score.

Additionally, at each of these visits the ACT, AQLQ, PEFR as well as any exacerbations and changes in medications, including new medications are recorded.

Most studies in trials of patients with inhalers report adherence of &#x0003e;0.8. Therefore, we anticipate that there is going to be high adherence in the setting of a clinical trial. However, we also expect that there will be a number of patients with poor inhaler technique which will lead to a lower actual adherence. We shall assume that when this is accounted for then the actual adherence is 0.15 lower, that is, 0.65 adherence at the end of the first month. Our preliminary data in primary care and on the wards indicates an SD of adherence is 0.25.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The primary end point is the rate of adherence at the end of the study period, that is, during the last visit at month 3 between active and control groups. We expect the adherence to improve over the study period in the control group, as they are repeatedly educated in inhaler use by 0.05, and we expect the active group to get closer to the physician-reported ideal rate of 0.8, that is, a 0.15 improvement in actual adherence. Hence, with a power of 0.8 at the 0.05 significance level, with a 0.1 difference in the actual adherence rate, then a sample size of 100 in each limb is required. We expect a 10% dropout; hence the target recruitment sample size is 220 in total.</p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Randomisation and allocation</title><p>Randomisation will use a stratified-by-site random block design, with blocks varying in size of 8&#x02013;12. Allocation ratio is 1:1 with a central computer-generated randomisation. This is a single blind study, the nurse may deliver either intervention and is not blinded to the allocation. The participants are aware which group they are allocated to and aware that data on adherence is being collected for analysis. Patients in the control arm will be blinded to their adherence data from the INCA device.</p></sec><sec id="s2o"><title>Statistical methods</title><sec id="s2o1"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat and a per-protocol basis. Data will be presented as means with SDs, and Student t test will be used to compare differences in mean adherence rates between the groups. Significance will be set at the 5% level. Stratification of patients by new versus previous use with respect to use of the Diskus device (ie, if patient's are using the Diskus device for the first time, or if they have previously used the device), stratification based on severity of disease according to GINA guidelines.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Most management guidelines suggest that for poorly controlled asthma patients that before changing therapy, issues with adherence and inhaler technique need to be addressed.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> However, this is difficult to achieve in clinical practice. The aim of this study is to see if a nurse-delivered educational intervention with repeated education and monitored adherence can improve both aspects of adherence, the time and the technique of inhaler use. We will record when and how well an individual has used their inhaler over time with a device that makes a digital audio recording of an individual using their inhaler. Analysis of the recorded time of use, the interval between use and technique of use provides a measure termed actual adherence. The study's primary outcome will be a comparison of the actual adherence between the two groups at the end of the third month of participation in the study.</p><p>It is expected that over the study period some patients will become fully controlled while others will remain poorly controlled despite being fully adherent over the study period, and others may remain uncontrolled and also poorly adherent. This information may help with clinical decision-making for individual patients, for example, by helping decide who should have their therapy increased, their inhaler device changed or further interventions to promote adherence such as motivational interviewing. Hence, by combining clinical outcomes with the longitudinally collected adherence, asthma control and PEFR data, the composite outcome may assist a clinician in identifying the cause of difficult-to-manage asthma and increase the clinical confidence that the patient has refractory asthma.</p><p>This study has several novel features; this is the first study to use a technology that objectively assesses adherence to inhalers both in terms of technique of use as well as time of use. This technology involves not simply the device but also the automated algorithms, the feedback tools and the content of the feedback delivered by the nurse during the consultation.</p><p>It could be argued that the results of this clinical research study, performed in a research setting, will lead to greatly improved adherence, which is not reflective of clinical practice. Additionally, both control and active patients will be reviewed on a monthly basis for 3&#x02005;months. This approach itself will more than likely also lead to an increase in adherence in the active and control group and may not fully reflect &#x02018;usual care&#x02019;. To add to this, patients in both the active and control arms are aware that their inhaler use is being &#x02018;monitored&#x02019;, and this may lead to increased inhaler adherence. The authors see no alternative way of performing the study, as practical challenges in a more real-world setting may lead to a significant loss of patient follow-up, and hence, less precise information. The benefits of regular visits and PEFR measurements outweigh the disadvantages. Another limitation of the study is that it has a limited follow-up time frame, hence, the long-term effect on clinical outcomes and persistence of the observed benefits will not be established.</p><p>In regard to safety, patients enrolled in this study have to be uncontrolled or partially controlled by GINA guidelines. However, for the duration of the study their regular medical treatment of their asthma will not be changed (ie, their ICS/LABA dose will remain unchanged). The rationale behind this is to see the effect 3&#x02005;months of adherence training would have on asthma control, potentially reducing the need to increase patient medication (step-up), and possibly allowing physicians to reduce asthma treatment (step-down). Patients can withdraw at any time during the study without any impact on their clinical care. Additionally, if the clinician feels there is a clinical indication, patients can be removed from the study in the patient's best interest.</p><p>In summary, this study proposes to assess the impact of a series of consecutive educational visits on adherence and inhaler use by patients with severe asthma. In addition, by combining objective measurement of lung function, clinical outcomes and objectively assessed adherence, this may also provide clinicians greater precision in decision-making for the future care of this group of patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Deidre Hyland, John McCourt and D Kenny, RCSI Centre for Clinical Research; Professor D Kelleher and Professor P Murray from the Dublin Centre for Clinical Research; Professor Eavan Daly and Professor Cheryl Marron from GSK; Professor Frank Keane and Professor Enda Kelly from Vitalograph Ireland; the research staff of the Centres for Clinical Research at St Vincent's Hospital, Adelaide, Meath and National Children's Hospital (AMNCH), St James's Hospital and Cork University Hospital.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold> Professor D Kelleher, Professor P Murray, Professor Eavan Daly, Professor Cheryl Marron, Professor Frank Keane, Professor Enda Kelly, Professor Deirdre Flynn.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> RBR, CH and RWC conceived the INCA device.
