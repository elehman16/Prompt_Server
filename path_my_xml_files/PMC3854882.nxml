In this observer-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II single-center study, children/adolescents (ages 9&#x02013;16 years) were randomized to receive CYD-TDV or placebo at 0, 6, and 12 months. Immunogenicity was assessed using a 50% plaque neutralization test. Overall, 150 participants were enrolled (CYD-TDV: <italic>N</italic> = 100; placebo: <italic>N</italic> = 50). Injection site pain and headache were the most common solicited injection site and systemic reactions. Unsolicited adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were similar between groups. No serious AEs were vaccine-related. Geometric mean titers against all dengue virus serotypes increased with CYD-TDV vaccination and were 267, 544, 741, and 432 1/dil for serotypes 1&#x02013;4, respectively, after dose 3, representing a mean fold increase from baseline of 5, 6, 6, and 20, respectively. CYD-TDV vaccination elicited a neutralizing antibody response against serotypes 1&#x02013;4 and was well-tolerated in children/adolescents in a dengue-endemic region.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes notes-type="disclaimer"><p>Disclaimer: G.H.D., P.G., and F.N. are employed by Sanofi-Pasteur.

One dengue vaccine candidate that shows promise is recombinant, live-attenuated, tetravalent dengue disease vaccine (CYD-TDV; Sanofi-Pasteur, Lyon, France).

Children and adolescents (ages 9&#x02013;16 years at enrollment) who were healthy based on medical history and physical examination at enrollment were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive three subcutaneous injections of CYD-TDV or three subcutaneous placebo injections (NaCl 0.9%) at 0, 6, and 12 months. Randomization was performed by telephone using an interactive voice recognition system and the permuted block method.</p><p>The four major exclusion criteria were (1) any immunodeficiency, chronic illness, or treatment that could interfere with the vaccine immunological response, (2) known systemic hypersensitivity to any components of the trial vaccine, (3) receipt of any other vaccine within 4 weeks of the first vaccination, and (4) pregnancy or breastfeeding. Female participants of child-bearing potential had to use effective contraception or abstain from sexual intercourse for at least 4 weeks before the first vaccination and until at least 4 weeks after the last vaccination.</p><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and compliant with the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. The study protocol was approved by the Independent Ethics Committee and Institutional Review Board of the Universidade Federal do Esp&#x000ed;rito Santo and Comiss&#x000e3;o Nacional de &#x000c9;tica em Pesquisa em Seres Humanos, Brazil's National Institutional Review Board and National Regulatory Agency. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant and their parent or legal guardian.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Safety and reactogenicity.</title><p>Adverse events (AEs) monitored throughout the study included unsolicited systemic AEs within 30 minutes of each vaccination, solicited injection site reactions (pain, erythema, or swelling) up to 7 days after each vaccination, solicited systemic reactions (fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, or asthenia) up to 14 days after each vaccination, unsolicited AEs up to 28 days after each vaccination, and serious AEs (SAEs) throughout the trial. AE data after the initial 30-minute observation period were collected using a diary card. AEs were collected using a diary card with the specific solicited adverse reactions and an open field for unsolicited AEs.</p><p>AEs were graded (one, two, or three) from mild to severe according to a pre-defined intensity scale based on appropriate measurements or observations. SAEs were defined as events that were life-threatening or resulted in death, required in-patient hospitalization or prolonged existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, resulted in a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or were regarded as an important medical event.</p><p>Participants were followed up at 6 months after the last injection for information on AEs occurring since the last visit. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee regularly reviewed the safety data.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Immunogenicity.</title><p>Blood samples for the assessment of immunogenicity were taken before and 28 days after each vaccination (a total of six blood samples per participant). Serum levels of neutralizing antibodies against each of the four parental dengue strains of CYD-TDV (i.e., Dengue virus (DENV)-1 strain PUO-359, DENV-2 strain PUO-218, DENV-3 strain PaH881/88, and DENV-4 strain 1228) were determined before and 28 days after each dose using a 50% plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT<sub>50</sub>) at Sanofi-Pasteur's Global Clinical Immunology Department.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> Briefly, serial twofold dilutions of heat-inactivated serum were mixed with a constant challenge dose of each dengue virus. The mixtures were inoculated into plate wells confluent with Vero cell monolayers. After adsorption, the cell monolayers were incubated for a few days. Plaques in each well, which indicated the presence of cells infected with dengue virus, were fixed, immunostained, and counted. Titers were expressed as the highest reciprocal serum dilution at which the mean number of plaques was reduced by 50% compared with the count obtained from control wells. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) were calculated.</p><p>A PRNT<sub>50</sub> assay was used to assess YF seropositivity in the first blood sample. This assay was also performed in Vero cells, and it used the YF-17D strain with crystal violet staining for enumeration. Seropositivity was defined as antibody titers &#x02265; 10 1/dil.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Detection of symptomatic cases.</title><p>Detection of symptomatic dengue cases was made using passive surveillance of febrile episodes by parents or legally acceptable representatives combined with active detection of febrile episodes based on planned study visits, phone calls/home visits, and school-based detection (such as monitoring absenteeism). Febrile episodes were defined in alignment with the WHO case definition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> (e.g., temperature &#x02265; 38&#x000b0;C on at least 2 consecutive days with a suspicion of dengue disease). In the event of a febrile episode, a blood sample was taken in the acute phase (i.e., as soon as possible but no later than 7 days after the onset of fever). The following tests were performed to virologically confirm dengue cases: quantitative dengue reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against the dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen. In the event of temperature &#x02265; 38&#x000b0;C on at least 2 consecutive days within 28 days after each vaccination, the occurrence and the level of dengue vaccine viruses in serum were measured by quantitative and serotype-specific RT-PCRs.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical methods.</title><p>This study was descriptive and not powered to conclude on vaccine efficacy.

This observation may be related, in part, to cross-neutralizing or cross-reacting antibodies between dengue and YF. Similar findings have been reported in a prior study conducted in areas of Mexico, Honduras, and Puerto Rico that are non-endemic for YF in persons not known to be exposed to YF.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Various FV cross-reactive responses have been shown to occur after exposure to heterologous flaviviruses,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> and antibodies are shown to neutralize all four dengue virus serotypes after a secondary dengue virus infection, regardless of the presumed serotypes responsible for primary and secondary infection,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> This cross-reactivity may explain the presence of baseline serotype 4 neutralizing antibodies, despite this serotype not being in circulation at the time of the study. The biological relevance of measuring DENV neutralization in a system modeled on <italic>in vivo</italic> target cells (e.g., assays in Fc&#x003b3;R cells), therefore, deserves additional study.</p><p>It was expected that a balanced and robust PRNT response to CYD-TDV against all four serotypes, which was shown in this study and other studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> would translate into protection. However, in a phase IIb proof-of-concept efficacy trial conducted in Thailand, CYD-TDV did not provide adequate protection against infection with serotype 2, despite the presence of high antibody levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> It is, thus, clear that the development of robust neutralizing antibodies may not be the only factor involved in the protective response to CYD-TDV vaccination. The possibility also exists that a minimum detectable titer of 1:10 as the threshold for seropositivity may not be indicative of true immunity. The situation is complicated further by the presence of four virus serotypes that cause dengue disease, which exhibit regional and national variations in serotype distribution, genotypic variation, and variable immune responses to vaccination. The prevalence of Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) and other flaviviruses and the use of JEV vaccination are also confounding factors. Clearly, these multiple variables confirm the need for large-scale clinical trials and countenance against drawing conclusions from any one of the many studies in the global program.</p><p>This study provides reassuring information on the tolerability of CYD-TDV in children and adolescents, the age groups most affected by severe dengue disease in Brazil. The present data are also in agreement with the data from other studies in the global development program,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> which also show a trend to a decrease in reactogenicity with successive doses of CYD-TDV.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> There were no remarkable differences in reactogenicity according to FV seropositivity status at baseline. There were no deaths or SAEs that were considered to be related to CYD-TDV or placebo, which underscores the favorable safety profile of the vaccine in this population.</p><p>A total of 3 of 14 participants in the placebo group with suspected dengue disease had virologically confirmed dengue disease compared with 0 of 31 participants with suspected dengue disease in the CYD-TDV group. These observations suggest that CYD-TDV may have afforded some protection, a possibility that is strengthened given the higher numbers receiving CYD-TDV compared with placebo (2:1 randomization). All three cases occurred between doses 1 and 2 and coincided with the dengue peak season in Brazil (Teixeira MG and others, unpublished data). However, firm conclusions cannot be drawn, because the study was not powered to determine the efficacy of CYD-TDV for the prevention of dengue disease. In addition, because this study was a single-center study, it should be noted that the findings may not be applicable to Brazil as a whole.</p><p>In conclusion, this phase II study provides the first data relating to the use of CYD-TDV in a Brazilian cohort. The study confirmed that CYD-TDV vaccination elicited a neutralizing antibody response against all four dengue virus serotypes and was well-tolerated in children and adolescents ages 9&#x02013;16 years in a region of Brazil that is endemic for dengue disease. The findings support observations from other phase I and II trials and the continued development of CYD-TDV. Additional information on the efficacy and safety of CYD-TDV will be provided by ongoing phase III studies in Latin America (NCT01374516) and Asia (NCT01373281).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors take full responsibility for the content of this contribution and thank Graham Joint (supported by Sanofi-Pasteur) for editorial assistance with preparation of this manuscript and input of author comments.
