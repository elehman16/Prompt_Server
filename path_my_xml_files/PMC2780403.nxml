This study aimed to further investigate and clarify the distribution of budesonide and fluticasone in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by measuring the systemic availability and sputum concentration of budesonide and fluticasone, administered via combination inhalers with the respective long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists, formoterol and salmeterol.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, two-way crossover, multicenter study. Following a run-in period, 28 patients with severe COPD (mean age 65 years, mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] 37.5% predicted normal) and 27 healthy subjects (mean age 31 years, FEV<sub>1 </sub>103.3% predicted normal) received two single-dose treatments of budesonide/formoterol (400/12 &#x003bc;g) and salmeterol/fluticasone (50/500 &#x003bc;g), separated by a 4&#x02013;14-day washout period. ICS concentrations were measured over 10 hours post-inhalation in plasma in all subjects, and over 6 hours in spontaneously expectorated sputum in COPD patients. The primary end point was the area under the curve (AUC) of budesonide and fluticasone plasma concentrations in COPD patients relative to healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean plasma AUC values were lower in COPD patients versus healthy subjects for budesonide (3.07 &#x003bc;M&#x000b7;hr versus 6.21 &#x003bc;M&#x000b7;hr) and fluticasone (0.84 &#x003bc;M&#x000b7;hr versus 1.50 &#x003bc;M&#x000b7;hr), and the dose-adjusted AUC (geometric mean) ratios in healthy subjects and patients with severe COPD for plasma budesonide and fluticasone were similar (2.02 versus 1.80; primary end point). In COPD patients, the T<sub>max </sub>and the mean residence time in the systemic circulation were shorter for budesonide versus fluticasone (15.5 min versus 50.8 min and 4.41 hrs versus 12.78 hrs, respectively) and C<sub>max </sub>was higher (1.08 &#x003bc;M versus 0.09 &#x003bc;M). The amount of expectorated fluticasone (percentage of estimated lung-deposited dose) in sputum over 6 hours was significantly higher versus budesonide (ratio 5.21; p = 0.006). Both treatments were well tolerated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The relative systemic availabilities of budesonide and fluticasone between patients with severe COPD and healthy subjects were similar. In patients with COPD, a larger fraction of fluticasone was expectorated in the sputum as compared with budesonide.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><bold>Trial registration number </bold>NCT00379028</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable disease associated with considerable and increasing morbidity and mortality worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It is characterized by progressive airflow limitation that is not fully reversible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) in combination with a long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist (LABA) are recommended for the treatment of patients with severe COPD and a history of repeated exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Two such combinations, budesonide/formoterol and salmeterol/fluticasone, are licensed for use in COPD and a number of randomized, double-blind clinical studies have demonstrated improvements in lung function and reduced numbers of exacerbations with their use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Although these combinations both contain an ICS and a LABA, differences exist with regard to the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of both components, such as the oral bioavailability and clearance, volume of distribution and speed of airway uptake, which may impact on the clinical efficacy and safety of the treatments. The degree of lipophilicity, for example, varies widely. Budesonide is several times less lipophilic than fluticasone and, as a result, dissolves more readily in airway mucus and is more rapidly absorbed into the airway tissue and systemic circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Fluticasone, being more lipophilic and thus less water soluble, is more likely to be retained in the lumen of the airways and therefore, has a greater chance of being removed from the airways by mucociliary clearance and cough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These differences in lipophilicity may be particularly relevant in patients with severe COPD because marked airflow obstruction will lead to greater proximal deposition of inhaled drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and therefore mucociliary clearance. Indeed, previous studies in patients with asthma and airflow obstruction have shown that the systemic exposure of fluticasone is more affected by lung function than budesonide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>This is the first study to investigate and clarify the absorption of the two ICSs, budesonide and fluticasone delivered via ICS/LABA combination products, in patients with severe COPD and healthy subjects. The novel aspect of the study is the assessment of the proportion of ICS that is expectorated in sputum in patients with severe COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study subjects</title><p>Subjects were either healthy, as determined by medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram and clinical laboratory tests, or diagnosed with severe COPD. The inclusion criteria for patients with severe COPD were: aged &#x02265; 40 years, COPD symptoms for &#x02265; 1 year, a smoking history of &#x02265; 10 pack-years, pre-bronchodilatory forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) &#x02264; 55% of predicted normal, FEV<sub>1</sub>/vital capacity (VC) &#x02264; 70%, a productive cough with expectoration at least twice before noon on most days, and stable symptoms with no signs of an infection or COPD exacerbation within 1 month prior to study start.

Healthy subjects had to have never been regular smokers and were excluded if they were judged to have any significant illness or were using any prescribed medication, or over-the-counter remedies (except for oral contraceptives), herbal preparations, vitamins and mineral supplements &#x02264; 2 weeks prior to enrollment.</p><p>All subjects gave written informed consent to the study which was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and approved by independent ethics committees.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, two-way crossover, single-dose, multicenter study (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00379028). Severe COPD patients were enrolled in Germany (one center), the United Kingdom (one center) and Sweden (one center); healthy subjects were enrolled at one center in Sweden. The first subject was enrolled on 4 September 2006 and the last subject completed the study on 22 July 2007.</p><p>COPD patients and healthy subjects attended the clinic at the beginning and end of run-in (visits 1&#x02013;2). Informed consent was obtained at visit 1 and spirometry (FEV<sub>1</sub>) was performed at visit 2, from 2 to 8 days before visit 3 (start of the study drug administration). Forty-eight hours prior to visit 2, and throughout the study from then on, COPD patients using ICS or ICS/LABA combination therapies (budesonide/formoterol or salmeterol/fluticasone) were switched to equivalent doses of beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP). Use of other corticosteroids (including nasal and oral) was not permitted throughout the study. Patients were also not allowed to use long-acting anticholinergics, e.g. tiotropium 48 hours prior to visit 2 and throughout the study. Healthy subjects were instructed that no concomitant medication was permitted, except at the discretion of the study investigator.</p><p>Following run-in, eligible participants were randomized to the treatment sequence. At each treatment visit (visits 3 and 4), study participants received, in random order, one inhalation of either budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Turbuhaler<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, AstraZeneca, Lund, Sweden) 400/12 &#x003bc;g (metered dose) plus placebo by Diskus&#x02122; (GlaxoSmithKline, Middlesex, UK) or salmeterol/fluticasone (Seretide&#x02122; Diskus, GlaxoSmithKline, Middlesex, UK) 50/500 &#x003bc;g plus placebo by Turbuhaler (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). COPD patients were not permitted to use BDP at either treatment visit. All participants were instructed and trained by the study investigator or nurse on the correct inhalation technique, and study drugs were administered at the same time point on both treatment visits &#x000b1; 30 minutes. Each treatment visit was separated by a washout period of 4&#x02013;14 days.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Crossover study design</bold>.

The validated budesonide and fluticasone assays were based on a combined method of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).</p><p>Since the pharmacokinetics of budesonide and fluticasone differ markedly (i.e., the uptake of fluticasone over the lung to the circulation is slower than for budesonide and the volume of distribution higher versus budesonide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]), healthy subjects were used as a control.</p><p>Spontaneously expectorated sputum was collected from severe COPD patients over seven time intervals for up to 6 hours (0&#x02013;10, 10&#x02013;20, 20&#x02013;40, 40&#x02013;60, 60&#x02013;120, 120&#x02013;240, and 240&#x02013;360 min) after study drug inhalation. Samples from each time interval were pooled, frozen immediately and stored at -20&#x000b0;C until further processing. After thawing, the entire expectorate was homogenized using an energetic ultrasonification treatment in combination with 0.1% dithiothreitol, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Analysis of the liquidized sputum was performed using an LC-MS/MS method to measure concentrations of budesonide and fluticasone propionate. The method was validated according to the principles of the FDA Guidance for Industry Bioanalytical Method Validation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The assay had a coefficient of variance at lower limit of quantification of &#x02264; &#x000b1; 20%, in accordance with the FDA Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and lower and upper limits of detection of 5 nM and 10,000 nM respectively for budesonide, and 5 nM and 100 nM respectively for fluticasone.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All hypothesis testing was done using two-sided alternative hypotheses with <italic>P</italic>-values &#x0003c; 5% considered statistically significant. Based on data from previous studies, the inter-individual (between-subject) standard deviation for the ratio of AUC between budesonide and fluticasone in healthy subjects has been estimated to be 0.29 (pooled) on the logarithmic scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Assuming a similar variation among severe COPD patients, a total of 24 patients per group was required to give 90% power to detect a 24% reduction (fluticasone expected to give a lower ratio than budesonide) in the ratio of AUC (analyzed in a multiplicative model) between COPD patients and healthy subjects.</p><p>The primary end point (AUC for budesonide and fluticasone) was assessed by a multiplicative linear mixed-effect model, with subject as a random factor and treatment, period, group (severe COPD patient or healthy subject) and treatment-group interaction as fixed factors, which was fitted to the individual dose-adjusted AUCs of fluticasone and budesonide plasma concentrations.</p><p>The relative systemic bioavailability of each ICS was estimated from this model for patients with severe COPD and healthy subjects, and expressed as the mean AUC ratio (dose-adjusted) between fluticasone and budesonide. To address the primary objective, the systemic exposure of fluticasone and budesonide was estimated from the model as the mean ratio for the dose-adjusted AUC between fluticasone and budesonide in severe COPD patients, and the mean ratio for dose-adjusted AUC between fluticasone and budesonide in healthy subjects. The associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.</p><p>The concentrations of budesonide and fluticasone in the expectorated sputum samples during 6 hours post-inhalation (percentage of the ELDD) were compared in severe COPD patients using a similar model, with treatment, period and patient as fixed factors. The correlation between drug-adjusted AUC and the amount of expectorated sputum for each ICS was investigated using linear regression on log AUCs and log sputum weights. The lung-delivered doses of both steroids were calculated by assuming an ELDD that was 40% of nominal dose for Turbuhaler and 15% of nominal dose for Diskus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Safety outcomes were described using descriptive statistics.

Fluticasone is present in the sputum for longer than budesonide resulting in a higher proportion of the inhaled dose being expectorated in the sputum.</p><p>The study did not demonstrate a difference in the ratio of the relative systemic availabilities of inhaled budesonide and fluticasone between healthy subjects and patients with severe COPD. This finding is counter to previous clinical studies that have reported a lower systemic bioavailability of fluticasone, but not budesonide, among patients with marked airway obstruction due to asthma compared with healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These previous observations have been partly attributed to the more central deposition of ICS in obstructed airways and the higher lipophilicity of fluticasone relative to budesonide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Both drugs are likely to be deposited more proximally in the obstructive airway but being more lipophilic, fluticasone is less soluble in the airway mucus than budesonide and will therefore be present in the proximal airways for longer and thus, is more likely to be cleared from the airways than budesonide.</p><p>Possible reasons for the conflicting results between our study and these previous studies could include the fact that we selected patients with severe COPD (mean 37.5% FEV<sub>1 </sub>predicted normal) and daily sputum production, whereas the aforementioned studies were in subjects with asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This may be of importance given the fact that mucociliary clearance is impaired in COPD due to long-term tobacco smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and the presence of a compensatory cough mechanism. It can be speculated that uptransport of the lung deposited dose via cough is more rapid than via the slow mucociliary mechanism and that the more rapid cough uptransport in COPD would alleviate the differences between budesonide and fluticasone in the degree of mucociliary clearance compared to asthma. The extent to which long-term smoking affects absorption of inhaled steroids over airway epithelium is not known. A further difference between our study and previous studies is that we combined budesonide and fluticasone with a LABA (formoterol and salmeterol, respectively), whereas previous studies have used ICSs alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Studies have shown that LABAs can affect mucociliary beat frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], potentiate the inhibitory effect of ICSs on mucin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and increase mucus hydration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], although we think these effects are not likely to be seen after a single dose of LABA.</p><p>Our data confirmed previously reported differences in the pharmacokinetics of both steroids in the severe COPD population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Budesonide was more rapidly absorbed in the airway tissue compared with the highly lipophilic fluticasone as evidenced by a budesonide T<sub>max </sub>of 15.5 minutes compared with 50.8 minutes for fluticasone, which is consistent with its contribution to a more rapid onset of action, as demonstrated when combined to formoterol, by Cazzola and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>The differences in lung disposition could also have been influenced by differences in inhaler device and particle size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. As reviewed by Newman and Chan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], particle size and mode of inhalation are two important determinants of the proportion of ICS that is deposited in the respiratory tract. A particle with an aerodynamic diameter of &#x0003c; 5 &#x003bc;m is more likely to be deposited in the bronchi and bronchioles compared with a particle &#x0003e; 5 &#x003bc;m, which is deposited to a higher degree in the mouth and throat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies have reported the amount of fine particles (aerodynamic diameter &#x0003c; 5 &#x003bc;m) to be more than double with Turbuhaler compared with Diskus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This may correspond to a higher and more peripheral lung deposition of budesonide (via Turbuhaler) compared with fluticasone (via Diskus) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>A novel observation was the significant difference in the amount of the two ICSs in expectorated sputum. The amount of fluticasone expectorated (percentage of ELDD) was five times higher than for budesonide, supporting our hypothesis that its greater lipophilicity leads to greater airway clearance through mucociliary clearance and/or cough. On average, approximately 6% of ELDD (geometric mean) of inhaled fluticasone was expectorated over the 6 hours after drug administration, whereas most of the 1% of budesonide expectorated was within the first two hours. Whether this finding could result in decreased host defenses and therefore provide an explanation for the increased risk of developing pneumonia, as reported in a number of recent studies with fluticasone alone or in combination with salmeterol, is an intriguing hypothesis and one worthy of further evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>There was a weak inverse relationship between systemic availability, measured as AUC, for fluticasone and the amount expectorated in the sputum; a higher sputum clearance of fluticasone resulted in a lower airway tissue availability. Such a relationship was not observed for budesonide. Spirometry was not conducted directly before each treatment period so as not to affect spontaneous sputum sampling. However, the data suggest that there was a tendency for lower fluticasone AUC relative to budesonide in patients with lower FEV<sub>1 </sub>(% predicted normal), indicating that higher airway obstruction results in lower systemic and lung availability of fluticasone relative to budesonide.</p><p>Certain limitations of this analysis should be acknowledged. These include the relatively small sample size and lack of ICS monocomponent treatment to investigate how ICS is handled with and without LABAs, which can increase mucociliary clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. However, now that combined therapy is recommended for patients with severe COPD, we believe the current study is more clinically relevant. It is also important to note that sputum was collected upon spontaneous expectoration and therefore probably only represents a fraction of the total amount of sputum produced during this period. Thus, the absolute amount of ICS measured in the sputum was likely to be an underestimate, with the remaining sputum being swallowed before expectoration. Nevertheless, differences in expectorated amounts were controlled for through the cross-over study design, and data were reproducible.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study confirmed that plasma levels of both fluticasone and budesonide are lower in subjects with severe COPD but did not demonstrate a difference in the systemic exposure between budesonide and fluticasone in severe COPD patients relative to healthy subjects. In patients with COPD, a larger fraction of fluticasone was recovered in the expectorated sputum than for budesonide, indicating that fluticasone is more extensively cleared from the airways, while budesonide is more rapidly absorbed into the airway tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The study described in this manuscript was supported by AstraZeneca.
