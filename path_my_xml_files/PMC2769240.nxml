All three pilot studies used the same study design, equipment, and application instructions. Studies were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization of Good Clincial Practice. Study protocols were approved by the relevant institutional review boards.</p><p>Subjects provided written informed consent before any study-specific activity was performed. Two hundred ninety-five healthy men and women aged 18 to 45 years were enrolled in the studies. They had to refrain from any strenuous or new physical activities and comply with the respective study protocol while participating in the studies. Moreover, subjects had to be na&#x000ef;ve to the exercise so that they could not have resistance trained or performed work that required similar exercise for six months before enrolling in the study. Exclusion criteria focused on avoiding any untoward risk for the study participants and potential interference with the study objectives. Study procedures were performed at four visits. At Visit 1, subjects&#x02019; eligibility was assessed by medical history and physical examination. Studies used comparable inclusion/exclusion criteria. Within two weeks after Visit 1, subjects completed the exercise regimen (Visit 2) consisting of 50 consecutive maximal eccentric contractions of the elbow flexor muscles of the nondominant arm. For exercise, subjects were seated on a modified preacher&#x02019;s bench with the nondominant upper arm resting on a padded support, the wrist fixed between two padded rollers of the exercise lever and the forearm in a fully flexed position. For each eccentric action, the investigator staff had pulled down on the lever, forcing the subjects forearm into a fully extended position as the subjects exerts maximum resistance. Subjects reporting pre-exercise soreness/pain of &#x02265;10 mm on a visual analogue scale (VAS) at Visit 2 were excluded from the study. The Visit 2 exercise was performed in the evening. Approximately 32 hours later, at Visit 3, following an overnight fast, subjects meeting all continuation criteria and reporting at least 50 mm VAS post-exercise soreness/pain received either topical or oral ketoprofen (25 mg each) and oral or topical placebo, respectively. Subjects were fed a standardized meal and remained at the study center for the entire observation period. Subjects rated their muscle soreness/pain intensity prior to performing the exercise, immediately prior to treatment, and at hourly intervals for 12 hours after treatment. At the end of these assessments, subjects provided an overall rating of the study medication. At the final visit (Visit 4), approximately four days after Visit 3, safety and tolerability of the treatments were assessed.</p><p>No primary efficacy parameters were specified in the protocols due to the exploratory nature of the studies. Muscle soreness/pain intensity was assessed using VAS and categorical scale (CAT) by completing two actions of elbow flexion and relaxation while holding a 2-lb dumbbell (approximately 0.9 kg). Results for categorical pain intensity difference (CATPID) and visual analogue scale pain intensity difference (VASPID) from baseline (immediately prior to treatment at Visit 3) to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 hours after treatment were determined in the same way in all three studies. The 100 mm horizontal VAS line was labeled &#x0201c;no soreness/pain&#x0201d; on the left (corresponding to &#x0201c;0&#x0201d;) and &#x0201c;very, very sore/painful&#x0201d; on the right (corresponding to &#x0201c;100&#x0201d;). Categorical ratings of muscle soreness/pain were obtained on a 10-point ordinal rating scale from 0 = none to 9 = extremely intense.</p><p>The meta-analysis was performed for the intent-to-treat populations, ie, all subjects that received study medication. The overall statistics were obtained from a meta-analysis of CATPID and VASPID scores with treatment and baseline pain as fixed effects, and study as a random effect. Each study was allowed an individual variance component. Homogeneity in mean responses of the studies was assessed by testing the significance of study variance component in the random effect model. In matters of least-squares (LS) means comparison, the interaction terms drug-by-study and drug-by-baseline were not significant (p &#x0003e; 0.05), and subsequently dropped from the final model. P-values are obtained from testing the equality of all three groups. LS means and standard errors are obtained from an analysis of covariance model with treatment and baseline pain as factors. The differences are that of LS means. P-values are unadjusted, and obtained from testing the equality of two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Multiple dose application</title><p>Nineteen subjects were included in this pilot study to investigate the efficacy of multiple dosages of Diractin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (bid over seven days) for the treatment of exercise-induced muscle pain. To induce muscle pain, the subjects walked down stairs using twelve consecutive runs of 18 m difference in total altitude per run (120 stairs with each stair 15 cm high). This corresponds to a total altitude of approximately 200 m.</p><p>Eligible subjects came in at the day after exercise and were randomly allocated to two subgroups which received 100 mg ketoprofen in Diractin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> bid either on the left or right target muscle (thigh). The subjects were asked to apply the product open (nonocclusively) over the entire surface of either the left or the right thigh. The contralateral leg was used as (untreated) control. The primary target area for all subjects was the thigh. If in some subjects the calf became symptomatic, Diractin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was also administered epicutaneously to the entire surface of the left or right calf. Again, the contralateral calf was used as untreated control. Categorical ratings of muscle soreness/pain were recorded on a 10-point ordinal rating scale (0 = none to 9 = extremely) twice daily in a diary, immediately before study drug application. For statistical testing, the sum of categorical pain scores for the treated muscle were compared to the untreated control muscle using the Wilcoxon test. Nonparametric testing was chosen due to the small sample size and since it was assumed prospectively that normal distribution of data is not guaranteed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Single dose application</title><p>The demographic data between the three treatment groups was comparable with an age range of 18 to 45 and the majority of subjects being males (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dddt-3-143">Table 1</xref>).

Mean VASPID for 25 mg ketoprofen in Diractin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> versus placebo increased over time reaching a plateau of significant differences between Diractin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and placebo from five to 12 hours after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1a-dddt-3-143">Figure 1a</xref>). Similar results were determined for mean CATPID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1b-dddt-3-143">Figure 1b</xref>). Mean VASPID for 25 mg ketoprofen in Diractin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> versus oral ketoprofen were significantly different only at 12 hours after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2a-dddt-3-143">Figure 2a</xref>), whereas mean CATPID showed significant difference between Diractin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and oral ketoprofen from seven to 12 hours after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2b-dddt-3-143">Figure 2b</xref>). No significant differences in mean VASPID and CATPID between oral ketoprofen and placebo were determined at any time after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3a-dddt-3-143">Figures 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3b-dddt-3-143">3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Multiple dose application</title><p>Nineteen subjects were included (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dddt-3-143">Table 1</xref>). The calf was treated in nine subjects. The subjects documented higher pain scores for the calf than for the thigh, maximum pain was observed within 24 to 48 hours after exercise (average categorical pain score at time of maximum pain for untreated thigh: 2.6 &#x000b1; 2.2; for untreated calf: 5.1 &#x000b1; 1.9). The average sum of categorical pain scores documented for the treated thighs (n = 19) was 12.4 (range 0 to 29) and 14.8 (range 0 to 42) in the untreated thighs. The sum of pain scores was significantly lower in the treated thighs than in the untreated thighs (Wilcoxon p-value = 0.039; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-dddt-3-143">Table 3</xref>). For the calf (n = 9), the average sum of pain scores documented for the treated calves was 29.4 (range 13 to 55) and in the untreated 32.9 (range 6 to 65). The difference between treated and untreated areas was not statistically significant (Wilcoxon p-value = 0.359) probably due to the small sample size.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion|conclusions"><title>Discussion and conclusions</title><p>Different pain models have been developed for evaluating the efficacy of topical and oral NSAIDs. Besides defined pain situations in patients, eg, after surgery or tooth extraction, additional models were explored that would be more specific to muscular pain.</p><p>Experimental pain resulting from continuous pressure infusion of phosphate-buffered low pH solution (pH 5.2) into the belly of the radial flexor carpi muscle induced a localized dull-aching or stinging muscle pain sensation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dddt-3-143">15</xref> However, it remained unclear whether this experimental induction of muscle pain was predictive for actual muscle pain. Therefore, the induction of muscle soreness/pain by controlled, standardized eccentric contractions producing DOMS was explored. DOMS is defined as skeletal muscle discomfort that peaks 24 to 48 hours after exercise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dddt-3-143">1</xref> At that time, a significant increase in prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> was observed, suggesting that acute inflammation is one of the underlying mechanisms of DOMS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-dddt-3-143">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-dddt-3-143">12</xref> More recent studies indicate that a classical inflammatory reaction might not be the main reason for DOMS, but other mechanisms of muscle adaptation and changes in immunological parameters in the epimysium might contribute to this process.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-dddt-3-143">14</xref> The controversy between several studies might also be related to the effects of muscle biopsies itself.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-dddt-3-143">14</xref></p><p>The effect of NSAIDs on muscle pain induced by eccentric contractions is still controversial. A lack of efficacy of oral NSAID treatment was reported for flurbiprofen and ibuprofen.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-dddt-3-143">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-dddt-3-143">17</xref> The influence of flurbiprofen on subjective soreness was investigated in six healthy young men.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-dddt-3-143">16</xref> The subjects performed one concentric and two eccentric work bouts of 30 min at 80% of the individual maximal work load on the bicycle ergometer. No influence of 50 mg flurbiprofen tid on subjective soreness was reported. The influence of 400 mg ibuprofen tid on active range of motion, perceived pain, and peak concentric torque measurements of the nondominant arm was assessed in 40 subjects in a randomized, double-blinded, repeated measures design.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-dddt-3-143">17</xref> Subjects performed an eccentric exercise protocol of the elbow flexors. No differences among treatments were observed for any of the dependent variables at any time up to 96 hours after the exercise.</p><p>In contrast, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of 200 mg oral naproxen tid for 10 days indicated superiority of naproxen to placebo in improving objective recovery as per magnetic resonance imaging results and effects on thigh soreness in particular during the first four days after exercise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-dddt-3-143">18</xref> Subjects performed 10 sets of 7&#x02013;10 eccentric actions with each quadriceps femoris muscle with a load equal to 85% of the eccentric one repetition maximum. Study drug treatment began immediately after exercise. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group study, the influence of 100 mg ketoprofen in a pluronic lecithin organogel applied tid on DOMS was investigated in 32 young healthy men.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-dddt-3-143">19</xref> Subjects performed a leg extension and flexion exercise program designed to create DOMS in quadriceps muscles. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive any combination of topical ketoprofen or placebo gel to their right and left quadriceps immediately following the exercise. Within-subjects analysis (n = 16) showed a significant reduction in DOMS scores in legs receiving topical ketoprofen compared with legs receiving placebo (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002 at 48 hours, and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 at 24 and 48 hours combined). Between-subjects analysis (n = 16) showed a marginally significant reduction in DOMS scores at 48 hours (<italic>P</italic> = 0.05 in right legs and <italic>P</italic> = 0.053 in left legs).</p><p>The studies published varied not only with respect of the NSAID investigated, but also whether study drug was applied immediately after exercise or at peak of the soreness. We therefore decided to explore the various options in different settings, eg, single and multiple dosing, using oral ketoprofen as an active comparator, or investigating the therapeutic effect of Diractin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> at different muscular regions, ie, elbow flexor muscles or thigh and calf muscles, respectively.</p><p>A single dose of 25 mg ketoprofen in Diractin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was significantly superior to placebo in treating muscle pain induced by eccentric contractions and as expressed by mean VASPID and CATPID from five to 12 hours after treatment and also to 25 mg oral ketoprofen at some time points after treatment. In contrast, a single dose of 25 mg oral ketoprofen was statistically not different to placebo at any time after treatment. Diractin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> application was also effective as compared to untreated controls after multiple applications. The appropriate dose and treatment regimen still needs to be confirmed in a larger randomized, controlled, prospective clinical trial.</p><p>DOMS was shown to be an appropriate pain model for evaluating the therapeutic effect of epicutaneous Diractin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> on acute muscle pain.
