One randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study (1222.6; 296 patients) administered treatment in the morning. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were performed pre-dose (trough) and &#x02264;3&#x000a0;hours post-dose (weeks 1 and 2), and &#x02264;6&#x000a0;hours post-dose after 4&#x000a0;weeks; primary end point was trough forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) response (change from baseline mean FEV<sub>1</sub>) after 4&#x000a0;weeks. A second randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (formoterol 12&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g twice-daily) incomplete-block crossover study (1222.27; 198 patients) administered QD treatments in the evening.

Olodaterol also improved symptoms as measured by a reduction in ACQ scores. Both studies demonstrated or indicated dose&#x02013;response effects of olodaterol to a greater (Study 1222.27) or lesser (Study 1222.6) degree across the 2, 5, 10 and 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g doses used. The outcome variables that indicated olodaterol dose response in the two studies varied, being indicated only by secondary end points of weekly morning and evening PEF in Study 1222.6, and by the primary end point of FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub> response and secondary end points of trough, peak and individual time point FEV<sub>1</sub> responses in Study 1222.27 (as well as other end points studied in 1222.27).</p><p>Potential reasons for the differences in the outcome variables demonstrating dose response between the studies could include the populations and/or the designs used in the two studies. However, the study populations were similar with regards to patient demographics; all patients were taking ICS and both populations demonstrated a dose response to olodaterol in some outcome variables. Therefore, it is unlikely that an important difference in patient characteristics is an adequate explanation. By contrast, the study designs used were very different. Study 1222.6 used a parallel-group design and Study 1222.27 an incomplete-block crossover design, with each patient receiving four out of a possible six treatments and acting as their own controls for the dose&#x02013;response evaluations and an active comparator with formoterol. Another important difference in the design of the studies was the time of administration of olodaterol: in the morning in Study 1222.6 and in the evening in Study 1222.27.</p><p>Another study that examined the dose&#x02013;response characteristics of olodaterol was also a crossover design and included patients with milder asthma, not taking ICS. The primary outcome variable was change in methacholine provocative concentration causing a 20&#x000a0;% fall in FEV<sub>1</sub> (PC<sub>20</sub>). Olodaterol demonstrated a clear dose response for the changes in methacholine PC<sub>20</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>There are challenges in conducting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist dose&#x02013;response studies in asthma. Studies examining the dose response of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists using bronchoprovocation models in asthma are inherently easier to conduct, as they involve mild, stable patients with close to normal baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> values. When indices of bronchodilation are used to measure effect, the patients need to have baseline airflow obstruction in order to demonstrate a response and in most countries such patients would be treated with ICS. These patients may also be previously treated with LABA and washed out from this medication (for a minimum of 2&#x000a0;weeks in Study 1222.6 and 48&#x000a0;h in Study 1222.27).</p><p>Other LABAs with a duration of action of &#x0003e;24&#x000a0;h have been studied in patients with asthma. Beeh <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that indacaterol had a duration of bronchodilation of 24&#x000a0;h for the two highest doses but did not demonstrate a significant dose response for FEV<sub>1</sub> across four doses administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Another study that included patients taking ICS and which evaluated four doses of indacaterol treatment for 7&#x000a0;days also did not demonstrate a dose response when FEV<sub>1</sub> was measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The dose&#x02013;response characteristics of vilanterol, another LABA, have been evaluated in patients with asthma taking ICS measured by treating with five different doses for 28&#x000a0;days and measuring both FEV<sub>1</sub> and PEF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Once again, while prolonged bronchodilation was observed for the three highest doses used, a significant dose response was not seen for either outcome variable. These studies demonstrate the challenges in documenting a clear dose response for a LABA seen in a primary end-point measure (as in Study 1222.27), although evidence for a dose response may be apparent in secondary end-point measures (as in Study 1222.6).</p><p>The safety profile of olodaterol was as expected for all &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists, with tremor and changes in serum potassium and the QT interval in the electrocardiogram at the highest dose. There was no evidence of an increase of severe adverse events with olodaterol when compared to placebo in Study 1222.6 or formoterol in Study 1222.27.</p><p>These studies did have some limitations in that neither study was adequately powered to identify differences between the different doses of active treatments (both studies were powered for comparisons between olodaterol and placebo), though this is not unusual for Phase II dose-finding studies. When taken together, the weight of the evidence from several olodaterol trials in asthma indicates a relevant dose&#x02013;response relationship between a total daily dose of 5 and 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g olodaterol. In addition to the results from these present studies, further evidence has been provided by a study examining the 24-h FEV<sub>1</sub> time profile after 3&#x000a0;weeks of treatment with QD or BID regimens of olodaterol (at the same total daily dose) versus placebo (NCT01311661; 1222.29). Dose responses, although not the primary objective of the studies, were consistently observed for a total daily dose of 5 versus 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g olodaterol (Beeh et al., manuscript in preparation).</p><p>In conclusion, treatment with olodaterol QD for 4&#x000a0;weeks was well tolerated at all doses and no new safety concerns were identified, although some sympathomimetic effects were observed, mainly at the 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g dose. Parallel, as well as incomplete-block crossover, designs may be suitable for Phase II dose-ranging studies and more than one study may be necessary to strengthen the evidence for a dose response.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec7"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12931_2015_249_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Study methodology. <bold>Table S2.</bold> Key inclusion and exclusion criteria. <bold>Table S3.</bold> Adjusted mean (95&#x000a0;% CI) FEV<sub>1</sub> trough and peak responses compared to placebo after 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment in Study 1222.6. <bold>Table S4.</bold> Adjusted mean (95&#x000a0;% CI) FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub> responses compared to placebo after 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment in Study 1222.27. <bold>Table S5.</bold> Adjusted mean (95&#x000a0;% CI) FEV<sub>1</sub> responses compared to placebo after 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment in Study 1222.27. <bold>Table S6.</bold> Adjusted mean (95&#x000a0;% CI) morning and evening PEF compared to placebo after 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment in Study 1222.27. <bold>Table S7.</bold> Adverse events reported in Study 1222.6 occurring in more than one patient in any treatment group. <bold>Table S8.</bold> Adverse events reported in Study 1222.27 with an incidence of &#x0003e;1&#x000a0;% on any treatment on any system class or individual adverse event.</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACQ</term><def><p>Asthma Control Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AQLQ(S)</term><def><p>Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, standardised version</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC<sub>0&#x02013;3</sub></term><def><p>Area under the curve from 0&#x02013;3 hours</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub></term><def><p>Area under the curve from 0&#x02013;24 hours</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BID</term><def><p>Twice daily</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FEV<sub>1</sub></term><def><p>Forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;second</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICS</term><def><p>Inhaled corticosteroids</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LABA</term><def><p>Long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEF</term><def><p>Peak expiratory flow</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PFT</term><def><p>Pulmonary function test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QD</term><def><p>Once daily</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>This work was supported by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH &#x00026; Co.
