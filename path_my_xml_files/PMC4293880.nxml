In this experiment, 10-day-old eggplant seedlings were transplanted in pots and then inoculated with <italic>A. alternata</italic>, DPDP or their combination 1&#x000a0;week later. Leaves of the <italic>A. alternata</italic>-infected eggplant suffered from chlorosis, necrosis and brown spots during the subsequent 5&#x000a0;weeks. Disease intensity was obvious in infected leaves but withdrawn by DPDP. There were relationships between incidence and severity, greater in plant leaves infected <italic>A. alternata</italic> alone and diminished with the presence of DPDP. Moreover, the infection resulted in reductions in growth, decreases in contents of anthocyanins, chlorophylls, carotenoids and thiols as well as inhibitions in activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Nonetheless, the application of DPDP at 50&#x000a0;mg led to a recovery of the infected eggplant; the infection-induced deleterious effects were mostly reversed by DPDP. However, treatment with DPDP alone seemed with no significant impacts.

The disease appears as dark-brown necrotic lesions on leaves and fruits that may coalesce to form large necrotic areas. It is attributed to causing leaf necrosis and leaf drop, also causing fruit spotting and rotting during harvest and postharvest stages. Induction of plant defense reactions enhances protection against different types of pathogens and utilizes the plants own defense mechanisms in controlling plant diseases <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Several mechanisms that mediate the disease protection include blocking of disease cycle, the direct inhibition of pathogen growth <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and the induction of resistance to plant against pathogen infection <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The most common method for controlling these pathogens is the use of fungicides. On the other hand, the development of resistance in pathogenic fungi to common fungicides and increasing residual hazardous effects on human health and environmental pollution has given a thrust to search for new derivatives that can obstruct the fungal pathogenicity. The fungicide-induced delay of senescence was due to an enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity protecting the plants from harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In response to ROS, plants develop an efficient antioxidative protection system against them <xref rid="b0030 b0035" ref-type="bibr">[6,7]</xref>. Antioxidants play a crucial role in plant defense mechanism against reactive oxygen species <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Pyrimidine derivatives exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities depending on type of the substituent <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

Mycelial growth exerted about 79% inhibition by 50&#x000a0;mg relative to 17% by 10&#x000a0;mg. Similarly, DPDP greatly reduced conidial germination; 50&#x000a0;mg resulted in an inhibition of about 92% relative to only 25% caused by 10&#x000a0;mg. The figure clearly indicates that Im50 (effective DPDP concentration that inhibited mycelial growth by about 50%) was less than 33&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> whereas Ic50 (effective DPDP concentration that inhibited conidial germination by about 50%) was about 25&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p><p>At the same time, conidial count was highly reduced by DPDP; greater was the reduction as the concentration increased.

On the other hand, the inhibitory effect of DPDP on <italic>A. alternata</italic> growth was also detected as a clear zone on agar media. The inhibition zone was larger in higher concentrations; the inhibition zone caused by 50&#x000a0;mg was about fourfold that induced by 10&#x000a0;mg.</p><p>The dose&#x02013;response curve shows that there was a proportional relationship between the DPDP concentration and the percentage of conidial germination inhibition (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This curve indicates that as the time elapsed, conidial germination increased sharply in control. In the presence of DPDP, conidial germination showed some increases particularly with low concentrations for a few time followed by a diminution, however the highest concentration mostly induced great retardation with time. According to these findings, the <italic>in vivo</italic> application of DPDP was performed with the concentrations 50&#x000a0;mg due to its effectiveness in growth inhibition of <italic>A. alternata in vitro</italic>.</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, symptoms in the fungus infected plant appeared as leaf chlorosis, necrosis and brown spots (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). However, the application of DPDP at 50&#x000a0;mg to the infected plants resulted in retreatment of these injury symptoms. It is clear from the figure that disease intensity was obvious in infected leaves but withdrawn by DPDP. Disease incidence and severity increased in leaves infected <italic>A. alternata</italic> alone, nonetheless, the presence of DPDP led to great diminution. In addition, there were relationships between incidence and severity, the magnitudes were greater in plant leaves infected <italic>A. alternata</italic> alone and diminished with the presence of DPDP. So plants treated with such combination appeared as healthy as normal control. On the other hand, the application of DPDP alone to control healthy plants did not have any deleterious effects; the leaves looked like normal as control.</p><p>Moreover, growth parameters of eggplant were greatly affected by the fungus. <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> shows that <italic>A. alternata</italic> significantly reduced fresh and dry weights of the infected eggplant over the experimental period. By the end of the 5th week, <italic>A. alternata</italic> reduced shoot fresh weight by about 65% and dry weight by about 30%. Nonetheless, the application of DPDP to the infected eggplant overcame growth reductions. When DPDP was present with <italic>A. alternata</italic>, only about 16% reductions were detected in shoot dry weight, whereas shoot fresh weight was mostly not affected.</p><p>As shown in <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, anthocyanins contents were severely inhibited by the fungus during the whole experiment. There were about 57% decreases in anthocyanins content in shoots after 5&#x000a0;weeks of infection with <italic>A. alternata</italic> while the application of DPDP alone resulted in only about 10% reductions. Nevertheless, the application of DPDP to infected plants resulted in increases in anthocyanins contents to reach the control values. The magnitude of reduction in anthocyanins content was retracted by DPDP to become only 12% in shoots. Similarly, the <italic>A. alternata</italic>-infected eggplant showed significant reductions in chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids pigments. After 5&#x000a0;weeks from infection, <italic>A. alternata</italic> resulted in 69%, 58% and 56% reduction in chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids, respectively. However, application of DPDP to the infected plants increased these contents so that these reductions became 4%, 15% and 11%, respectively. Nonetheless, these contents were mostly alike in plants treated with DPDP alone as in control.</p><p>In addition, the contents of total-, protein- and nonprotein-thiol were significantly decreased in eggplant shoots by <italic>A. alternata</italic> throughout the experimental period as compared with control values (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). About 63%, 67% and 56% reductions in total-, protein- and nonprotein-thiol were induced 5&#x000a0;weeks following infection with <italic>A. alternata</italic>. On the contrary, application of DPDP likely retreated the effects of the fungus. DPDP alone had no effects on thiol contents.</p><p>In <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>, the infection resulted in a consistent significant inhibition in the activities of GST, GPX and SOD in shoots. After 5&#x000a0;weeks of infection, GST was inhibited in shoots by 46% while the inhibition reached about 72% and 68% in GPX and SOD, respectively. The magnitude of inhibition in enzyme activities was most likely similar for the different enzymes. However, application of DPDP to the infected plants seemed to overcome the great inhibitions of each enzyme and appeared to reach mostly those of the untreated control. Nevertheless, the application of DPDP alone appeared to cause some inductions in GST and SOD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s0055"><title>Discussion</title><p>Mycelial growth of <italic>A. alternata</italic> was greatly inhibited <italic>in vitro</italic> following DPDP application at all concentrations (10&#x02013;50&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>); 50&#x000a0;mg was the most efficient concentration. It caused the greatest inhibition to mycelial growth and conidial germination. Moreover, it completely prevented the spore formation (conidial count was inhibited by 100%) and induced the greatest inhibition zone. Therefore, it was used <italic>in vivo</italic> as a foliar spray for the protection of eggplant from spot disease caused by <italic>A. alternata</italic>. Time course curve confirmed the efficiency of this concentration upon conidial germination. On the other hand, the symptoms of infection with <italic>A. alternata</italic> appeared as chlorosis, necrosis and brown spots in leaves. Disease intensity was obvious in infected leaves but withdrawn by DPDP. There was an increase in disease incidence and severity by <italic>A. alternata</italic>, however, the presence of DPDP led to great diminution. The relationships between incidence and severity were indicated. Relationships between disease incidence and severity for several plant diseases have been established <xref rid="b0060 b0105 b0110" ref-type="bibr">[12,21,22]</xref>. However, these symptoms seemed to be overcome when DPDP was combined with <italic>A. alternata</italic>. Raja et al. <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> recorded leaf spot disease of infected eggplant as small, circular and brown necrotic spots all over the foliage. The spots gradually enlarged in size and later became irregular in shape or remained circular with concentric rings or zones. In the later stage of infection, these spots coalesced resulting in withering, extensive drying and shedding of leaves. The effects of DPDP of the fungus provoked great inhibition in all features of the pathogen growth. These findings could reveal that DPDP led to a recovery of eggplant from spot disease caused by <italic>A. alternata</italic>. On the other hand, the application of DPDP alone to healthy control plants had no injurious effects. As the retreatment of the infection was not accompanied with negative impacts to host plant, DPDP could be considered as a safe fungicide to protect eggplant from <italic>A. alternata</italic>. Chaerani and Voorrips <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> indicated that <italic>A. alternata</italic> causes diseases to tomato, eggplant and pepper. This disease can be very destructive if left uncontrolled, often resulting complete defoliation.</p><p>The present results show that fresh and dry weights of the infected eggplant were reduced by <italic>A. alternata</italic>; however, DPDP appeared to alleviate these reductions. On the other hand, the infection led to significant reductions in chlorophylls, carotenoids and anthocyanins contents in eggplant, nevertheless, such reductions were nullified by DPDP. The decreases in photosynthetic pigments and/or in anthocyanins would result in reduction of plant growth might be due to malfunction of the photosynthetic machinery and/or changes in secondary metabolites used in plant defense against stress. Therefore, DPDP could be used to control <italic>A. alternata</italic> through elevating host resistance and/or inhibiting the pathogen virulence. Nonetheless, the DPDP elevated pigment levels in the infected plants but caused little, if any, changes in control concluding that it is not a stress elicitor.</p><p>Plants can defend themselves against diseases caused by different pathogens through a wide variety of mechanisms that may be local or systemic, inducible or constitutive <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Antioxidants play a crucial role in plant defense mechanism. Thiols are the supply reserves of glutathione (GSH) which is considered as the most important non-enzymatic antioxidant. It is regarded as a key component of antioxidant defenses in most aerobic organisms <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. May et al. <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> affirmed that GSH is an abundant and ubiquitous thiol with proposed roles in the storage and transport of reduced sulfur, the synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids and as a modulator of enzyme activity. They concluded that GSH correlates with the tolerance of plants to xenobiotics and to biotic and abiotic stresses. The decreases in thiol pool were obvious in infected plants; nevertheless, DPDP most likely alleviated these effects. In confirmation, thiol-pool functions as a stress indicator and plays several roles in oxidative stress <xref rid="b0135 b0140" ref-type="bibr">[27,28]</xref>. These results support the importance of thiol for protection of eggplant from oxidative stress induced from infection with <italic>A. alternata.</italic> GSH and GST are very efficient in counteracting the destructive effects of ROS and so retard the programmed cell death. GSH, mediated by GST, conjugates with some xenobiotics leading to their inactivation <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The antioxidant metabolism is important in determining the ability of plants to survive under stress conditions and the up regulation of these enzymes would help to reduce the buildup of ROS <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Some pesticides can induce increases in antioxidant while some others cannot. In this context, Wang et al. <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> found that chlorothalonil resulted in increases in GSH content, activities of GST and glutathione reductase but such increases were not observed in leaves exposed to carbendazim. In addition, they detected that GST and peroxidase activities were induced by chlorothalonil. They suggest that GSH-dependent pathway plays an important role in the chlorothalonil detoxification but not in the carbendazim detoxification in tomato leaves.</p><p>The inhibitions of GST, GPX and SOD activities by <italic>A. alternata</italic> were nullified as DPDP was applied to the infected plants. This would confirm that DPDP overcame the <italic>A. alternata</italic>-induced oxidative stress status. Greenberg <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> stated that during plant&#x02013;microbe interactions, the production of ROS would lead to programmed cell death and cellular defense against pathogen attack. When produced in excess, ROS can also serve as secondary messengers in the pathogen-response signal transduction pathway <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Several mechanisms that mediate the disease protection include blocking of disease cycle, the direct inhibition of pathogen growth <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and the induction of resistance to plant against pathogen infection <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In the present results, the inhibition of mycelial growth of <italic>A. alternata</italic> as well as the count and germination of conidia by DPDP would conclude that both growth and reproduction of the pathogen were greatly affected. Meanwhile, the growth of the host was not negatively influenced by DPDP. Both actions could point to conclude that DPDP might cause an elevation in host resistance and diminution in the pathogen virulence.</p><p>Increased resistance could result from secondary metabolites, the phytoalexin precursors, and the non-enzymatic or the enzymatic antioxidants such as SOD, GPX and GST. SOD catalyses the dismutation of <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1" altimg="si1.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> with great efficiency in the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>
<xref rid="b0030 b0125 b0145" ref-type="bibr">[6,25,29]</xref>. The decrease in SOD activity could impair the <inline-formula><mml:math id="M2" altimg="si2.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> scavenging system of cells; however, increased activity would enhance the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> which in turn becomes very harmful if left without scavenging <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, peroxidase uses H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for regeneration of GSH in its reduced form and therefore is efficient in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> breakdown <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In addition, GPX appear to play an essential protective role in the scavenging processes when coordinated with SOD activity <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> through scavenging H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generated primarily by SOD action. In the present results, SOD was declined by the infection concluding that the host may suffer from oxidative stress with an accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> which, in turn, is used by peroxidase. So, the application of DPDP increased SOD, GPX and GST activities with a consequence of augmenting the production of antioxidants to increase ROS scavenging. As a whole, it is obvious that eggplant was greatly affected by <italic>A. alternata</italic>. The infection resulted in reductions in growth and led to decreases in contents of anthocyanins, photosynthetic pigments and thiols as well as activities of GST, GPX and SOD, the effects augmented with the elapse of time and appeared significant in the 5th week (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). On the contrary, the application of DPDP seemed safe to healthy plants and moreover, overcame the effects of the infection.</p><p>In conclusion DPDP inhibited <italic>A. alternata</italic> growth <italic>in vitro</italic> suggesting that this compound might be an efficient fungicide. <italic>In vivo</italic>, leaves of <italic>A. alternata</italic>-infected eggplant suffered from chlorosis, necrosis and brown spots. These symptoms were accompanied with physiological parameters. Disease intensity was obvious due to infection but retracted by DPDP. Both incidence and severity were increased by <italic>A. alternata</italic> but diminished by DPDP. The deleterious effects were overcome by DPDP which seemed to inhibit the pathogen virulence and/or to elevate host resistance. The safety use to eggplant in addition to the inhibition of the pathogen could suggest that it is an efficient fungicide for protection of eggplant from <italic>A. alternata.</italic> Further studies have to be performed for understanding some important issues such as the fungicide selectivity, the exact target site, the recommended field dose, the application time, its biochemical mode of action and its fate in the environment.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0005"><person-group
