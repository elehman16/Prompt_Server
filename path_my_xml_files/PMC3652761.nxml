This study aimed to record symptoms produced by a homeopathic drug compared with placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 trial consisted of a 7-day run-in period, a 5-day intervention period and a 16-day post-intervention observation period. Subjects, investigators and statisticians were blinded for intervention groups and identity of the homeopathic drug. Subjects in the intervention group received <italic>Okoubaka aubrevillei</italic> (potency C12) and subjects in the placebo group received the optically identical sucrose globules. Dosage in both groups was five globules taken five times per day over a maximum period of 5&#x000a0;days. Subjects documented the symptoms they experienced in a semistructured online diary. The primary outcome parameter was the number of characteristic proving symptoms compared with placebo after a period of 3&#x000a0;weeks. Characteristic symptoms were categorised using content analysis. Secondary outcome parameters were the qualitative differences in profiles of characteristic and proving symptoms and the total number of all proving symptoms. The number of symptoms was quantitatively analysed on an intention-to-treat basis using analyses of covariance with the subject&#x02019;s expectation and baseline values as covariates.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Thirty-one subjects were included (19 Okoubaka and 12 placebo). Data for 29 participants could be analysed. No significant differences in number of characteristic symptoms in both groups were observed between Okoubaka (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation 5.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.0) and placebo (4.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.6). The odds ratio for observation of a characteristic symptom was 1.11 (95% confidence interval 0.4 to 3.05, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.843). Females and subjects expecting a higher number of symptoms at baseline or feeling more sensitive to homeopathic drugs experienced more characteristic symptoms regardless of allocation. The qualitative analysis showed an inter-coder reliability of 0.69 (95% confidence interval 0.62 to 0.76). The qualitative comparison of symptom profiles was inconclusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Combined results of qualitative and quantitative methods did not result in a significant difference of characteristic proving symptoms between <italic>O. aubrevillei</italic> C12 and placebo. The qualitative comparison of the symptom profiles leaves some open questions. The nocebo effect might be a plausible explanation for most of the phenomena observed in this trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01061229?term=homeopathic+drug+proving&#x00026;rank=2">NCT01061229</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Homeopathic drug proving</kwd><kwd>Homeopathic pathogenetic trial</kwd><kwd><italic>Okoubaka aubrevillei</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Homeopathic drug proving (HDP) trials, also known as homeopathic pathogenetic trials, are at the foundation of homeopathy and have been conducted for more than 200&#x000a0;years
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition to exposing the toxic effects of the drug and clinical experience, HDPs serve as a key source of information for the homeopathic <italic>Materia Medica</italic>. The purpose of such trials is to test nontoxic levels of a specific substance in healthy volunteers to determine the symptoms this substance stimulates and the types of individuals who may be sensitive to it. The profile of symptoms recorded in an HDP by a group of healthy volunteers serves as a basis for information to find indicators of the drug in sick patients. In HDP, the drug under investigation is administered and the individual response of every volunteer to the application of the substance is described. According to the law of similars, the substance is then used to treat patients with similar symptoms. The clinical experience subsequently shapes the homeopathic drug profile. For 200&#x000a0;years HDPs have been conducted by homeopathic practitioners in the traditional qualitative and explorative HDP design that was described in Hahnemann&#x02019;s nineteenth-century <italic>Organon der Heilkunst</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and other homeopathic classics. In recent years the need to adapt to modern research designs has been realised and an innovative new study methodology for HDP has been developed and tested
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Within this study we developed a study design methodology and a study protocol that fulfils the criteria of the Good Clinical Practice, Declaration of Helsinki and German drug regulations and also tests its applicability and feasibility in practice
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. German drug regulation authorities classified this HDP as a phase 1 trial, which can be misleading and has been discussed as controversial
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>&#x02018;Characteristic symptom&#x02019; is a very important homeopathic concept to identify the precise homeopathic drug action in homeopathic provings and to find the right homeopathic drug for a patient according to the law of similars (<italic>Organon der Heilkunst</italic> &#x000a7; 153
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]). Generally, it is considered that a good homeopathic prescription matches the characteristic symptoms of a patient/disease with the characteristic symptoms of a homeopathic drug as derived from a HDP. Homeopaths categorise symptoms as characteristic when they show a high degree of individualising signs. In homeopathy it is believed that the characteristic symptoms in a HDP are specific for the homeopathic action of a drug. Categorising symptoms into characteristic and noncharacteristic is an essential part of homeopathic case-taking and analysis. For a further definition of characteristic symptoms, refer to Table&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The primary aim of the study was to determine whether the homeopathic drug <italic>Okoubaka aubrevillei</italic> of potency C12 provokes more characteristic homeopathic proving symptoms after 3&#x000a0;weeks compared with a placebo in healthy volunteers.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Criteria for proving symptoms and characteristic symptoms</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Criteria for proving symptoms</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Criteria for characteristic symptoms</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Characteristic symptoms are defined as proving symptoms with a strongly individualistic character:<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02022; New symptoms: the symptom is unfamiliar and has not been observed within the last year or during the run-in period<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02022; Symptoms affecting the whole organism of one or more study participant<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02022; Study participant or study physician classifies the symptom as new or unusual<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02022; Symptoms affecting different organs or organ systems of one or more study participant<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02022; The study physician classifies the symptom as new in his final evaluation<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02022; Symptoms accompanying a variety of other symptoms<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02022; A strong aggravation or modification of present (familiar) symptoms<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02022; Symptoms that occur during the trial that appear strange, peculiar or unique to one or more study participants<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02022; Present familiar symptoms that have disappeared during the proving (cure)</td><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02022; Familiar symptoms from the past or present that have been cured or strongly alleviated</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Secondary aims were to develop and to test a qualitative analysis methodology on which to base a definition for drug-specific (characteristic) symptoms and to compile a profile of characteristic homeopathic proving symptoms of the drug being trialled for therapeutic purposes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The HDP trial was conducted as a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 trial.

After having given informed consent, subjects received an initial physical examination, a full-length homeopathic interview of 60 to 120&#x000a0;minutes&#x02019; duration and a short instruction on formal and technical aspects of documentation.</p><p>The following items were assessed at baseline: age, sex, education (medical student or doctor), history of former chronic disease, former homeopathic treatment, and former participation in an HDP.

The subjects were supervised by the investigators via telephone in short intervals, as is common in HDP.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation and treatment allocation</title><p>The random list (block randomisation stratified by centre/investigator) was based on the &#x02018;ranuni&#x02019; random number generator of the SAS/STAT&#x000ae; software, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, US. Both the centres and subjects were coded by simple numbers unidentifiable by subjects, investigators and other persons. The randomised list was sent to the Charit&#x000e9; central pharmacy, which prepared sealed, sequentially numbered boxes containing the study medication and sent them to the centres. When a subject agreed to participate, the investigator opened the lowest numbered box and gave him/her the study medication. Each centre kept a log file of all randomised subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Subjects in the intervention group were instructed to take five globules of the trial drug (potency C12), five times per day for a maximum of 5&#x000a0;days (5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;5). The study medication was obtained from DHU (Karlsruhe, Germany), produced according to the Hahnemannian method
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Subjects were asked to stop taking the medication, in agreement with their investigator, if they experienced any of a predefined set of proving symptoms (see Table&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Placebo consisted of pure sucrose globules (DHU) that were not potentiated nor impregnated with alcohol. The administration scheme in the placebo control group was identical to that of the intervention group.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome parameters</title><p>In our trial we decided to base our hypothesis testing strongly on homeopathic rules and decided to use the peculiar, strange and strongly individual (= characteristic) symptoms as the primary outcome parameter.</p><p>The primary outcome parameter was the number of characteristic proving symptoms per subject, derived from the qualitative data analysis of the homeopathic proving drug compared with placebo within 3&#x000a0;weeks after the initial dose of the drug or the placebo is administered. Definitions of characteristic symptoms are given in Table&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.</p><p>Secondary outcome parameters were the total number of proving symptoms, irrespective of whether they were characteristic or not, and the number of serious adverse events.</p><p>Qualitative differences in the profiles of characteristic proving symptoms from the homeopathic drug and the placebo were compared and the inter-coder reliability of the qualitative evaluation of characteristic proving symptoms was calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>In this study, an unpaired <italic>t</italic> test with a two-sided level of 5% has a power of 80% to detect a group difference of 20&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4 versus 15&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4 (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation) characteristic proving symptoms. Assuming a dropout rate of 20%, 24 subjects have to be available for analysis. As the sample size calculation was based on an estimation of experts, we decided to include up to 30 subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>The qualitative analysis of the textual data of the diaries was carried out by two experienced homeopathic doctors using content analysis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Homeopathic definitions for proving symptoms and characteristic symptoms (Table&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) served as predefined categories for the deductive coding processes. For more details and discussion of the analysis process we refer to the publication of our study protocol
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The quantitative analysis was carried out by a statistician.</p><p>Our main hypotheses to test were as follows:H0: There is no difference between the number of characteristic symptoms provoked by a homeopathic drug in the potency C12 compared with placebo.; H1: There is a difference between the number of characteristic symptoms provoked by a homeopathic drug in the potency C12 compared with placebo.</p><p>The main outcome was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis by univariate analyses of covariance, which includes the group (two levels), subject&#x02019;s expectations (ordinal with four levels) and the respective baseline value (linear) as covariates. From these models we estimated the baseline-adjusted treatment effect and its 95% confidence interval (CI). The reported <italic>P</italic> value was based on a two-sided <italic>t</italic> test within this model, and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant. Missing values were multiply imputed according to Rubin&#x02019;s suggestions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In detail, 20 multiple copies of the original dataset were generated, replacing missing values by a randomly generated value according to the MCMC algorithm. Each copy was analysed as a complete dataset with the abovementioned analyses of covariance model and the results combined appropriately. Sensitivity analyses included some extensions of the statistical model, in this way modelling the centre as a random factor and adding the centre&#x02019;s expectation (ordinal with four levels) as an additional fixed factor.</p><p>Analyses of the secondary outcome parameters relied on the same statistical models, hereby replacing the baseline value of the main outcome parameters by the baseline value of the parameter under consideration.

A mean of 2.3 (placebo: &#x000b1; 3.2; Okoubaka: &#x000b1; 2.8) characteristic symptoms were observed in men of both groups, while in women the mean number of characteristic symptoms was much larger with 5.9 (&#x000b1; 6.2) symptoms for placebo and 7.5 (&#x000b1; 6.7) for Okoubaka (Table&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Generally, subjects expecting a higher number of symptoms at baseline or who felt more sensitive to homeopathic drugs experienced more characteristic symptoms, regardless of group allocation (Table&#x000a0;

Table&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref> shows the qualitative symptom profiles of Okoubaka and placebo for comparison. In the third row, only symptoms of Okoubaka that were not observed under placebo are listed. These can be compared with a former HDP of <italic>O. aubrevillei</italic> and the clinical homeopathic use in the fourth and fifth rows. The qualitative analysis showed characteristic (highly individual, specific or peculiar) symptoms in both groups. In summary, frequently observed overlapping characteristic symptoms between Okoubaka and placebo were difficulties in concentration, tiredness, headaches, pain in extremities and gastrointestinal disturbances. In the Okoubaka group alone there were general feelings of dryness and burning in multiple parts of the body and feelings of soreness in mucosal membranes and muscles. One subject in the Okoubaka group developed a chronic pharyngitis with vesicular eruptions in the intervention period that lasted for 6 months after the trial. Another subject in the Okoubaka group developed multiple warts. In the placebo group, no symptoms with objective physical and stable pathological changes were observed. Overall there is a high degree of concordance between Okoubaka and placebo and many of these symptoms also show similarities to the symptoms of a former proving and the clinical profile.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Qualitative symptom profiles of intervention and control groups, former homeopathic drug proving and clinical use</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th><th align="left"><bold>Placebo (control)</bold></th><th align="left"><bold><italic>Okoubaka aubrevillei </italic></bold><bold>C12 (intervention)</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Symptoms only observed in Okoubaka group</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Profile of </bold><bold><italic>O. aubrevillei </italic></bold><bold>from former homeopathic drug proving </bold>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]</th><th align="left"><bold>Profile of clinical use of </bold><bold><italic>O. aubrevillei </italic></bold>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td rowspan="5" align="left" valign="bottom">Mind<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tranquillity and calmness, feels content although being in trouble, ability to reflect on things from a different perspective.<hr/></td><td rowspan="2" align="left" valign="bottom">Concentration deficiency, confusion, disorientation, feeling as if &#x02018;head like in cotton&#x02019;, &#x02018;like under a bell&#x02019;, &#x02018;as if drunk&#x02019;, helplessness, sadness.

Statistically significant group differences in the numbers of characteristic symptoms could not be detected. A subgroup analysis showed that women and individuals expecting to be sensitive to homeopathic drugs experienced more characteristic symptoms, independent of their group allocation. The qualitative analysis of the characteristic symptoms showed a mixed result: there was a wide range of overlapping symptoms for both groups, but also qualitative reporting of symptoms distinguishing Okoubaka from placebo.</p><p>In this study we combined high standards of quantitative trial methodology with qualitative methods. We thus combined deductive qualitative analysis methods (coding of characteristic symptoms and proving symptoms) with modern quantitative statistical analyses to investigate differences in a HDP between the homeopathic remedy <italic>O. aubrevillei</italic> C12 and placebo. We used only highly individual (characteristic) symptoms as the primary outcome parameter.</p><p>The strength but also a potential limitation of this study is the combination of a qualitative with a quantitative analysis. It discriminates characteristic symptoms from more usual symptoms, allowing a more precise quantitative analysis, but its quality has, on the contrary, a strong impact on the quantitative results. In our trial the results depended on the coding of two homeopaths, both of them with long-term experience in HDPs. The inter-coder reliability showed a Cohen&#x02019;s kappa of 0.69. The common standard for a good quality of coding is 0.7. This is the first time inter-coder reliability was calculated in an HDP, and resulted in an acceptable level of concordance between the two coding homeopaths.</p><p>Another limitation is the unbalanced randomisation allocation, resulting in a significant difference in numbers of included subjects between Okoubaka and control. This imbalance was due to the block-randomisation design stratified by the centre and to some centres only including one or two subjects. This presents a problem for the qualitative analysis, because the range of potential characteristic symptoms in the placebo can be estimated to be smaller in 12 subjects compared with 19 subjects in the Okoubaka group: more individuals could show a wider range of individual symptoms.</p><p>The bark of the West African rainforest tree <italic>O. aubrevillei</italic> was introduced into homeopathy in the 1970s by the homeopathic physician Magdalena Kunst and the pharmacist Wilmar Schwabe, who discovered that Okoubaka bark was used by native African healers against food poisoning. <italic>O. aubrevillei</italic> is a registered homeopathic drug in Germany and is mainly used for the treatment of symptoms of gastrointestinal disturbances, food poisoning and food allergies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. A former HDP of <italic>O. aubrevillei</italic> was conducted by David Riley
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The comparison of the symptom profiles of Okoubaka and placebo groups with the results of the former proving and the clinical use remains inconclusive: there is a high overlap of symptoms throughout all groups but there are also symptoms overlapping only between the Okoubaka group and the results of the earlier proving and the clinical profile (compare Table&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>).</p><p>In our trial there is a notably high number of characteristic symptoms in both groups. Characteristic symptoms are by definition symptoms individualising the complaints or disease; for example, those symptoms that stand out to the subjects both in quality and intensity, and have not been experienced in quality or intensity by subjects before. Most of our subjects observed pathological symptoms that were different from their usual complaints.</p><p>Interestingly, female subjects described characteristic symptoms much more frequently than male subjects. Gender differences in HDP have been highlighted previously. In the 1980s, St&#x000fc;bler observed in his scientific HDP that female subjects had more proving symptoms than males
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In our opinion, the results must be interpreted with care and we want to discuss hypothetical explanations.</p><p>The profiles of symptoms in both groups show a surprisingly high number of characteristic symptoms. One might argue that these cannot be explained by nonspecific effects alone. In our trial, the characteristic symptoms in both groups were compared qualitatively and subsequently compared with the clinical profile of <italic>O. aubrevillei</italic>. A range of similarities was observed. Similarities in symptom profiles between groups proving homeopathic drug and placebo have already been reported by homeopaths in the past. Jeremy Sherr, who actively re-established HDPs in the 1980s and 1990s, writes in his manual <italic>The Dynamics and Methodology of Homeopathic Provings</italic>: &#x02018;&#x02026; Furthermore it is interesting to note that placebo proving occasionally seem to produce similar symptoms to the proving symptoms, thus casting further doubt on the use of this medium in proving&#x02019;
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Walach observed in two more recent HDPs (<italic>Atropa belladonna</italic>, and Cantharis) symptoms that were considered highly specific for the homeopathic drug also in the placebo group
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, these results were in contrast to another homeopathic proving, where a specific effect was observed
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It is plausible that the results of this trial may be explained by the nocebo effect. The nocebo effect is by definition the induction of a symptom perceived as negative by sham treatment and/or by the suggestion of negative expectations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A nocebo response is induced by the subject&#x02019;s own negative expectations and/or negative suggestions from therapists/clinical staff in the absence of any treatment. Nocebo phenomena are generally explained by Pavlovian conditioning and expectations induced by verbal information and suggestions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In our trial this would mean that there were no specific drug effects at all: subjects experienced nonspecific nocebo symptoms regardless of group allocation. The specific, individual and new symptoms in the qualitative analysis might be explained by expectation, suggestion and conditioning of the subjects or just by chance. The observation that subjects with a high expectation of being sensitive to homeopathic drugs experienced more characteristic symptoms regardless of group allocation would fit this hypothesis. Expectation, former experiences and intensified awareness would explain the development of characteristic symptoms in both groups. Nocebo has only recently received wider attention from scientists and clinicians and the available data are sparse compared with research about placebo phenomena
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Sex has recently being discussed as a predictor for nocebo response. In a study with healthy subjects measuring symptoms of nausea caused by a spinning chair, gender differences were found: nausea could be conditioned to a significantly higher degree in women, whereas the effects of expectancy were more prominent in men, but to a lesser degree
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It is also known from nocebo research that patients specify more adverse effects of their medication when checking off a standardised list of symptoms compared with being asked to report spontaneously
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Moreover, the way in which trials record adverse events influences the rate of adverse reactions substantially. This might have been the case in our trial, which used semistructured head-to-feet documentation online to be filled with free text symptom descriptions by subjects. The phenomenon of developing homeopathic proving symptoms under placebo has already been described. Bayr stated in 1986 in <italic>The British Homeopathic Journal</italic>: &#x02018;The type of change observed during homeopathic drug trials can also be noted following exhibition of placebo. This makes it more difficult to evaluate the results of homeopathic drug tests&#x02019;
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Bayr proposed to weight symptoms for the statistical analysis according to their homeopathic symptom characteristics. In our analysis we did not follow Bayr&#x02019;s advice but we used qualitative methods to eliminate noncharacteristic symptoms for the primary statistical analysis. Therefore our outcome parameter is highly concordant with the homeopathic philosophy. However, we found no statistical group differences.</p><p>Another explanation might be that the nocebo response is so prominent that potentially specific symptoms of the drug are difficult to observe and are hidden behind a strong background noise. If this hypothesis was true, the nocebo response as background noise would strongly disturb any HDP and would make it extremely difficult to identify specific symptoms. However, by using a qualitative approach to identify only homeopathic characteristic symptoms, our analysis attempted to filter out such background noise.</p><p>Nocebo responses are also frequently observed as adverse events in the placebo arm of randomised controlled drug trials and are known to be a confounding factor in clinical drug trials. In migraine trials, for example, they are observed in 20% of patients after placebo treatment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. They also account substantially for adverse events in drug trials for fibromyalgia syndrome and painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Surprisingly, the observed adverse events in placebo arms of trials with anti-migraine medication corresponded to those of the anti-migraine medication against which the placebo was compared; the same is the case with nocebo symptoms in antidepressant trials
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Nocebo symptoms reflect the typical side effects pattern expected in the drug group, being in accordance with the expectation theory of placebo and nocebo effects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Link and colleagues reported a sham herbal trial where 36 healthy college students were informed they would be given either a herbal supplement or a placebo and were provided with an information sheet with a mock list of possible beneficial (for example, cognitive enhancement) and adverse effects of the supplement, but in fact all participants received placebo
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Thirty-two of the 36 participants (88.9%) reported symptoms following ingestion of the pill (50% placebo symptoms, 27.8% placebo and nocebo symptoms, 11.1% only nocebo symptoms). The most frequently observed placebo symptoms were clearer thinking (61.1%) and increased mental alertness (52.8%), and the most frequently observed nocebo symptoms were dry mouth (22.2%), fatigue (16.7%) and headaches (8.3%). In our trial the expectation to observe proving symptoms might have been high, as the subjects were all homeopathic experts and familiar with the concept of HDP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Combining qualitative and quantitative methods for the primary outcome did not result in a significant difference of characteristic symptoms between <italic>O. aubrevillei</italic> C12 and placebo. The qualitative comparison of the symptom profiles leaves some open questions. The nocebo effect might be a plausible explanation for most of the phenomena observed in this trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>HDP: Homeopathic drug proving.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>Study concept and design: MT, JD, UH, CMW.
