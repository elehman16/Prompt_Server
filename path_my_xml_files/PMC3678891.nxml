Balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) is a percutaneous surgical option that aims to reduce pain and disability and correct vertebral body deformity using orthopedic balloons. Within the current literature, there are well over 300 unique cohorts of at least 10 patients or more with vertebral compression fracture due to osteoporosis or cancer treated with kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty. Importantly, within the current literature, several studies have demonstrated that kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty provide better clinical outcomes to NSM in randomized controlled studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2 R3 R4 R5 R6">2&#x02013;6</xref>; however, surgical parameters and radiographical outcomes have either been limited or not collected or reported.

A few of the back pain AEs (3 BKP and 2 NSM) were considered related to treatment received.

Four hematomas occurred in the BKP group; 2 were considered procedure-related and 2 device-related (1 of these was a serious AE). Two nonserious AEs were related to intubation, hypersensitivity to atracurium besilate and damage to dental bridge (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>); the latter was the only AE noted to have occurred on the operative case report form. Nine nonserious AEs were possibly related to prone positioning on the operating room table (rib fracture, chest/rib/sternum pain, leg pain, hematoma, headache, facial decubitus ulcer). Five patients who underwent BKP had new vertebral fractures (4 were serious) considered possibly related to cement by the treating physician; however, there was no difference in the number of radiographical fractures observed at 3 months (27/123 for BKP <italic>vs</italic>. 27/100 for NSM; <italic>P</italic> = 0.43 for difference).</p><table-wrap id="T7" position="float"><label>TABLE 7.</label><caption><title>Adverse Events Within 30 Days of Surgery/Enrollment</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="spne-38-971-g010"/><graphic xlink:href="spne-38-971-g011"/><graphic xlink:href="spne-38-971-g012"/></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>To provide a context of this research, in September 2012, a thorough evaluation of the kyphoplasty literature was conducted using PubMed. For clinical studies consisting of at least 10 patients with vertebral compression fracture due to osteoporosis or cancer treated with kyphoplasty, we found what seemed to be 140 unique cohorts and a total of 8250 patients treated with kyphoplasty, most reporting similar improvements in pain, function, and QOL. The literature also contains several meta-analyses on kyphoplasty and/or vertebroplasty<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15 R16 R17 R18 R19 R20 R21 R22 R23 R24">15&#x02013;24</xref> and a few comparing these surgical therapies to NSM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> Several very large retrospective studies using Medicare data have also been conducted investigating kyphoplasty, vertebroplasty, and nonsurgical therapies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27 R28 R29 R30">27&#x02013;30</xref></p><p>Within the current literature we have found several randomized clinical trials comparing either kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty to nonsurgical management (NSM),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2 R3 R4">2&#x02013;4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31 R32 R33 R34">31&#x02013;34</xref> and several reports that compare the cost-effectiveness of these procedures compared with NSM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35 R36 R37">35&#x02013;37</xref> Thus, mounting evidence document the benefits of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty over standard NSM.</p><p>Although 2 randomized trials concluded that vertebroplasty was no different than a &#x0201c;sham&#x0201d; intervention in back pain and disability,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> it is important to note that several limitations make it hard to draw definitive conclusions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> Further trials comparing sham with kyphoplasty and/or vertebroplasty, designed to address these limitations, are needed. However, it is important to note in this study, for most criteria, maximal benefit, and stabilization for each group occurs between 3 and 12 months, and we have demonstrated better pain and EQ-5D QOL outcomes compared with NSM throughout 2 years,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> an outcome not consistent with placebo effects.</p><p>To date none of the major RCTs for kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty have described detailed radiographical outcomes. Therefore, we have extended our previous results to describe the surgical parameters, vertebral body kyphosis correction and height restoration, the objective TUG test results, and intraoperative safety and analyses exploring the link between vertebral body anatomy correction and QOL.</p><p>The postoperative mean change from baseline showed an average improvement of 3.33&#x000b0; in the BKP that was statistically significantly different from the baseline measurement (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001); across all follow-up time points, differences in index fracture kyphotic angulation correction were not statistically significantly different (<italic>P</italic> = 0.284), indicating that postoperative deformity correction is maintained during the 24 months of follow-up. The correction was, not surprisingly, better in the BKP group compared with the NSM group at all time points through 24 months. Overall, the final kyphosis correction/vertebral body height restoration in our study is lesser to some extent when compared with other results such as that by Voggenreiter <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>; this may be due to the multicenter nature of our study, larger sample size, and the independent radiographical core lab assessments, which minimizes reader bias. In this study the mean preoperative anterior vertebral height in the BKP group was approximately 63% of the predicted height, with a mean postoperative gain of 10%, representing an estimated 27% of lost height restored; this result is similar to other published studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref> It will be of interest in future studies to understand deformity correction outcomes with new inflatable bone tamp technologies that are made of less compliant materials.</p><p>The difference between the treatment groups met the 0.08-point minimally clinically important difference (MCID) for EQ-5D at all time points (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref> Similarly for pain, the 0.83 point difference at 24 months is a 29% difference; a 25% to 30% difference is also considered clinically relevant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref> The objective TUG test matched fairly well with the subjective RMDQ; improvement in the clinically relevant TUG categories<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> was significant through 6 months and the categories themselves were marginally significant at 12 months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). For RMDQ, using 2 to 3 points as the MCID,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref> results were statistically and clinically significant through 12 months and marginally statistically significant at 24 months. For PCS, using the MCID of 3.5 points, the results were both statistically and clinically relevant through 6 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref> In our study, in multivariable backward elimination regression, it was clear that treatment assignment (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004) and the number of baseline prevalent fractures (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0003) were the best predictors of PCS outcome. A few studies have demonstrated a possible connection between angulation and pulmonary function,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref> but few studies have demonstrated a clinical benefit of height restoration. To our knowledge, no MCID has been established for kyphosis correction and the clinical relevance of the average 2.3&#x000b0;-treatment effect of BKP over NSM at 24 months is dubious. However, we observed a relatively weak correlation between PCS and kyphosis correction in the BKP group (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.201; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0341) and kyphosis correction remained in the multivariable backward elimination regression (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0727). Moreover, patients with the highest amount of kyphosis correction had approximately 6 points more PCS improvement at 3 months; putting this in a clinical perspective, 3.5 points is the MCID for PCS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref> Furthermore, when comparing the upper and lower quarts for PCS, EQ-5D and back pain, those with greater clinical improvement had more kyphosis correction at the treated vertebrae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Fracture mobility, fracture age, patient positioning (bolstering), IBT use and possibly anesthesia type are important parameters that may influence fracture reduction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref> Techniques of vertebroplasty, primarily attributed to postural reduction, may also yield height restoration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref> but nonetheless, 1 small vertebroplasty <italic>versus</italic> kyphoplasty RCT showed similar pain outcomes for the 2 procedures but better height in BKP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref> Taken all together, our results suggest that BKP treatment and fewer prevalent fractures at baseline are the most important predictors for providing better PCS QOL outcomes. However, our data also suggest, to a lesser extent, that treating physicians should also consider all parameters in achieving maximal vertebral anatomy correction when performing vertebral augmentation which is in line with orthopedic principles.</p><p>We previously reported and discussed the long-term serious AEs and those related to device or procedure (1 patient with UTI and subsequent spondylitis, 1 patient with a hematoma and 1 with anterior cement migration).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> With regard to AEs that occurred within 30 days, the most common were nausea, back pain, and UTIs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>). A few of these were considered related to treatment received; nausea, mostly attributed to anesthesia, is not surprising because 94% of patients who underwent BKP were treated using general anesthesia. Recently, there is a trend toward more local anesthesia use, likely due to more interventional radiologists performing BKP, but this is a challenge in elderly patients with scoliosis and facet arthritis. Similarly, a few of the UTIs, common in the elderly, were exacerbated by catheterization. There were 9 nonserious AEs possibly related to prone positioning in the operating room; this safety data suggest the need for extreme care in preparing these elderly patients for surgery. A few new fractures were considered possibly related to bone cement; however, there was no statistically significant difference in the number of patients with new fractures or adjacent fractures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Finally, regarding cement leakages, those into the venous system or within posterior elements are typically of most concern. A few such patients in our study were regarded as asymptomatic because no intraoperative AEs were noted by investigators and in reviewing all AEs throughout the study for these patients, only a new fracture AE was considered cement related. Thus, we have found, similar to those of several meta-analyses,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref> that such leakages occur least often (<italic>e.g.</italic>, compared with intradiscal leakages) and that clinically symptomatic leakages are relatively rare. It is thought that creation of a void with the IBT with a known volume for cement fill and the compaction of cancellous bone along with use of radiopaque, viscous, cement and fluoroscopy use during cementation can help reduce such leakages.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></p><p>This is the largest randomized trial of surgical treatment for vertebral fractures, with relatively high rates of follow-up for 2 years and assessment of multiple clinical and radiographical endpoints compared with standard practice; however, our study has several limitations. Knowledge of treatment assignment may have influenced patient responses or radiologist assessments. The study, powered to detect differences between groups in SF-36 PCS at 1 month, may not be adequately powered to detect differences in other radiographical, clinical, or safety outcomes. The radiographical data collection and therefore, the analysis, had several limitations. Due to the multicenter nature of the trial, the quality of the films and use of standard markers to control magnification error was variable despite the use of a detailed radiographical protocol and training. Therefore, for height restoration, we had to rely on normal adjacent vertebrae to estimate height. We used standard thoracic and lumbar films to capture all vertebral bodies from T5&#x02013;L5; because most fractures occur in the transition zone, these areas are often on the extreme ends of the films where parallax is maximized and the next normal vertebrae may not be captured on the same film. Adjacent prevalent fractures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) also diminished these evaluations. As a result, compared with vertebral body height restoration data, there was more evaluable radiographical data for kyphotic angulation of index fractures; this is because this measurement does not necessitate controlling for magnification error and does not depend on including normal adjacent vertebrae. Finally, the analyses of clinical outcomes and radiographical results (kyphotic angulation correction) suggest a link but were exploratory in nature and less predictive than other variables such as baseline prevalent fracture; more studies are required where the study design is appropriately focused to confirm this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We conclude that, compared with NSM, BKP rapidly reduces pain and improves function, disability, and QOL during the course of 2 years and the reduction in pain, EQ-5D QOL, patient satisfaction, and kyphotic angulation remain statistically significant at all time points.
