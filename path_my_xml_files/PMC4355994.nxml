There is an urgent need to develop effective interventions to prevent childhood obesity. Limited rigid data regarding children and adolescent overweight prevention in China are available. A national random controlled school-based obesity intervention program was developed in the mainland of China.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study was designed as a national multi-centered cluster randomized controlled trial involving more than 70,000 children and adolescents aged 7&#x02013;18 years from 7 provinces in China. In each center, about 12&#x02013;16 primary and secondary schools, with totally at least 10000 participants were randomly selected (Primary: Secondary&#x02009;=&#x02009;1:1). All of the selected schools were randomly allocated to either intervention or control group (Intervention: Control&#x02009;=&#x02009;1:1).The multi-components school-based and family-involved scheme was conducted within the intervention group for 9&#x000a0;month, while students in the control group followed their usual health practice. The intervention consisted of four components: a) Create supportive school and family environment, b) Health lifestyles education and related compulsory physical activities, c) Instruct and promote school physical education, d) Self-monitor obesity related behaviors. Four types of outcomes including anthropometric, behavioral, blood chemical and physical fitness were measured to assess the effectiveness of the intervention program.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first and largest multi-centered school-based obesity intervention program with the consideration of geographical and social-demographic characteristics of the rapidly increased obesity prevalence of Chinese children and adolescent. The intervention is based on Social Cognitive Theory and Social-Ecological Model of Health, and follows a stepwise approach guided by PRECEDE-PROCEED (P-P) Model and Intervention Map. The results of and lesson learned from this study will help guide future school-based national childhood obesity prevention programs in Mainland China.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>January 22, 2015; Registration number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT02343588">NCT02343588</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Chinese children and adolescent</kwd><kwd>School-based obesity intervention</kwd><kwd>Multi-centered randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Childhood obesity has become a global epidemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. During the past couple of decades, China has experienced rapid socio-economic and nutritional transitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Along with these lifestyle changes, the prevalence of overweight among children and adolescent rose from 6.3% in 1991 to 8.8% in 2000, and to 17.1% in 2011; besides, younger cohorts are now experiencing comparatively higher body mass index (BMI) at earlier ages than ever before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Overweight and obese youth are more likely to suffer from a variety of physical and psychosocial problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A latest review suggested that obesity youth are more likely than non-obesity peer to be a target of metabolic disease, internalizing disorders and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, overweight in early childhood has been shown to track to adulthood in one-third to one half of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], where it becomes associated with an increased prevalence of chronic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore it is urgent to do effective interventions to reduce childhood overweight and obesity.</p><p>Since the 1990s, a number of intervention studies for the prevention or treatment of overweight among children and adolescents has been conducted in China. The results of a systematic review have revealed that most of these studies addressing obesity prevention are of low methodological rigor. Although many of the studies stated that the intervention and control of allocation were randomized, no description of the method of randomization was reported. Neither was there any evidence that assessors were blinded to the study intervention. Most of the studies didn&#x02019;t report that they sought informed consent prior to commencement of the trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Interventions focusing on only overweight/obesity children limit their conclusions to be deduced to common population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, the evaluation of the efficacy of the study interventions was limited by the lack of information on loss to follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In terms of the type of intervention, besides physical activity and diet health education, little research included the modification of school and family environment, which are key factors influence the intervention effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In spite of the limited good quality data on which to draw conclusions about obesity prevention in children and adolescents in China, recent findings from primary school-based intervention programs have delivered some encouraging findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Schools are potentially important channels of intervention because they offer access to large populations of children, often with mixed socioeconomic background, and provide the opportunity to institutionalize programs in communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, limited number of school-based intervention programs for teenagers and whether the intervention programs would be successful when expand in large scale (from more regions to national-wide) remains unclear in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, we were conducting a school-based intervention study in 7 provinces with more than 70,000 students in China from the September of 2013 to the June of 2014.</p><p>The Health Lifestyles Interventions is a multi-center random controlled school-based intervention for children and adolescent in China, which includes nutrition, physical activity (PA) and school environment intervention as well as providing several opportunities for parental engagement. We hypothesized that the comprehensive interventions will lead to improvements in diet and PA information, motivation and behaviors, further preventing children and adolescent obesity and related cardiovascular risk factors.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this multi-centered cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Health Lifestyles Interventions in preventing overweight and obesity in Chinese school children and adolescent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Specific objectives</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To assess the effectiveness of the Health Lifestyles Interventions, in children and adolescent aged 7&#x02013;18 years, by comparing in intervention and control schools:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><label/><p><bold>Primary outcomes:</bold> Change in the prevalence of overweight and obesity</p></list-item><list-item><label/><p><bold>Secondary outcomes:</bold><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Anthropometric outcomes: waist circumference, hip circumference, blood pressure and skin fold thickness;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Behavioral outcomes: dietary, sedentary or PA behaviors and their determents (e.g. children&#x02019;s or parental knowledge, beliefs and attitudes, parental BMI, PA and eating behaviors, school environment);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Blood chemical outcomes: fasting plasma glucose, fasting triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Physical fitness outcomes: standing-board jump, 50 meters speed run, 50 meters&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;8 shuttle run (primary students) and run 800/1000 meters (secondary school students).</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>2.</label><p>To conduct a process evaluating by qualitative interviews and other methods to explore the way the interventions worked (that is, how it was delivered, taken up and experienced, and what the behavioral mediators of change are).</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Design</title><p>The study is designed as a national multi-centered cluster randomized controlled trial involving more than 70,000 participants from Liaoning, Tianjin, Ningxia, Shanghai, Chongqing, Hunan, and Guangdong to determine the effectiveness of the Health Lifestyles Interventions in preventing Chinese children and adolescent obesity at 9&#x000a0;month.

Moreover, it also aimed to assess the factors that may have influenced its effectiveness and to record stakeholders&#x02019; suggestions for future improvements. Based on the steps and principles described in the conceptual framework by Saunders et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], we identified and assessed the process evaluation elements as following: (1) Recruitment/Reach: the recruitment procedure was monitored against the standardized protocol of the study, the proportions and the characteristics of school/teachers/families agreeing to participate in the intervention and completing or dropping out from the intervention were recorded; (2) Dose delivered (completeness): the intensity of actual implementation of the program was assessed; (3) Fidelity: the extent to intervention was implemented as initially planned was assessed;(4) Dose received (exposure and satisfaction): the extent to which children/parents/caregivers/teachers were exposed to the intervention, as well as the degree of their satisfaction with the intervention and material were assessed; (5) Context: several physical (e.g. weather conditions, school infrastructure and curriculum), social (e.g. socioeconomic status of the family, teachers&#x02019; health-related behaviors) and contextual (e.g. policies) factors that may have acted as barriers or facilitators to the implementation of the intervention were recorded. Based on the targeted assess element and practical issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the process evaluation methods were designed to include mainly quantitative methods for researchers, teachers and parents: (1) Look up Teachers&#x02019; monthly logbooks; (2) Direct regular observation during the implementation of the classroom activities; (3) Regular qualitative interviews of focus groups.

Should the study produce comprehensive results, the intervention strategies would justify a national school-based program to prevent childhood obesity in China.</p><p>Data from the 2010 Chinese National Survey on Students&#x02019; Constitution and Health (CNSSCH) showed that the overall prevalence for overweight in 2010 was 9.9% and 5.1% for obesity in Chinese school-aged children, with large regional disparities. Besides the greatest increased rates of the epidemic in large coastal cities, similar increases were found in all other regions, including the once poverty stricken rural west. The epidemic in most of the rural areas began after 2000, but has spread swiftly over the last decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Given the differences in obesity prevalence, food culture (e.g. different appetites, food selection of people living in south and north of China) and environment (e.g. warm temperature enabling more outdoor PA), it is urgent to create obesity intervention in a national level. The Health Lifestyles Interventions was a national health promotion program being designed to benefit and educate all students irrespective of their weight status and socio-demographic backgrounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Both major and western cities, urban and rural schools were included in this study. They are geographically located in the north, middle and south of China. The participants that enrolled in this project are likely to be largely representative of Chinese children and adolescents.</p><p>Health Lifestyles Interventions is based on Social Cognitive Theory and Social-Ecological Model of Health, which emphasizes a dynamic interaction among biological, cultural, and environmental factors over the life course of individuals, families, and communities contributing to the health of populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It also follow a stepwise approach guided by Precede-Proceed (P-P) Model and Intervention Map (IM), which has been considered to be the best among 10 planning models on usefulness for research and usefulness for practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and initially carries out a systematic review of prospective studies and a secondary data analysis of existing data to identify key behaviors related to obesity in children and adolescent. It then executes focus groups and experts&#x02019; seminar to identify the determinants of energy balance-related behaviors. Pilot study of the newly formed interventions involving 4000 students were conducted in 12 schools (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Based on systematic development and evaluation process, a multi-components (environment, PA, dietary) school-based and family-involved scheme was formed (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The intervention is designed to instigate change at different levels. Creative delivery methods were used to regulate supportive school and family environment. The importance of PA intensity and dose has been emphasized in several systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Students were asked to do moderate to vigorous intensity, age- and space-appropriate exercises at least one hour at each school day. The form of exercises was game, dance or rhythmic gymnastics. Students were also encouraged to develop more forms of exercises they like. Health lifestyle education was mainly involved in dietary intervention. An easy to remember slogan named &#x0201c;52110&#x0201d;, incorporating all the key recommendations about PA and dietary behaviors, has been emphasized throughout health education. In order to dynamically monitor and increase the effectiveness of the interventions, PA and dietary behavioral log was recorded by the focus intervention group students weekly.</p><p>School children and adolescent spend a significant amount of their time in school settings. Although formal physical education classes are not the only opportunity for students to engage in PA, such classes offer a regular schedule and structured format both for engaging in PA and for establishing habitual activity early in life. Such a setting provides an ideal and easily accessible environment and has the potential to offer benefits to all children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], particularly those with no or limited access to play areas outside school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. There is good evidence that school-based PA interventions built primarily around promotion of PA are effective in promoting an increase in PA levels and fitness but the evidence for a beneficial effect on obesity levels and cardio-metabolic outcomes remains inconsistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Four types of outcomes as indicated above were comprehensively measured in our research. Anthropometric outcome, especially BMI, is the most reported measurement of body composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, the evidence for school-based intervention programs in reducing skin-fold thickness is consistent than BMI and percent body fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Research results showed that PA interventions can improve HDL cholesterol levels and blood pressure in the short term but the evidence for triglycerides, LDL&#x02013;C and total cholesterol levels remains inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Few studies reported on behavioral outcomes (e.g. PA, eating and sedentary behaviors, teachers&#x02019; or parental knowledge, beliefs and attitudes, school environment), valid and reliable tools are needed for the measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Measurements of physical fitness were varied among studies, standing-board jump, 50 meters speed run, 50 meters&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;8 shuttle run and run 800/1000 meters were measured in our study. Results from several reviews showed that large, higher quality RCTs showed an effectiveness of the intervention on improving fitness and the effectiveness may be determined by the cumulative amount of physical activity performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. As no single intervention will fit all schools and populations and the inconsistent outcomes of different studies, further high-quality research needs to focus on identifying specific program characteristics predictive of success.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PA</term><def><p>Physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized Controlled Trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HDL-C</term><def><p>High-density lipoprotein cholesterol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDL-C</term><def><p>Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CNSSCH</term><def><p>Chinese National Survey on tudents&#x02019; Constitution and Health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>P-P</term><def><p>Precede-Proceed</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IM</term><def><p>Model and Intervention Map</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>Yajun Chen and Lu Ma contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>JM is the principle investigator and YM is the main coordinator of the project.
