Patients were assigned to control, suggestion and dreamfilm groups according to the psychological method used. According to the anesthetic protocol there were also three subgroups: etomidate &#x00026; sevoflurane, propofol &#x00026; sevoflurane, propofol &#x00026; propofol groups. Primary outcome measure was the incidence of postoperative dreams in the non-intervention group and in the three groups receiving different psychological interventions. Secondary endpoint was to test the effect of perioperative suggestions and dreamfilm-formation training on the occurrance of dreams and recallable dreams in different general anesthesiological techniques.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Dream incidence rates measured in the control group did not differ significantly (etomidate &#x00026; sevoflurane: 40%, propofol &#x00026; sevoflurane: 26%, propofol &#x00026; propofol: 39%). A significant increase could be observed in the incidence rate of dreams between the control and suggestion groups in the propofol &#x00026; sevoflurane (26%-52%) group (p = 0.023). There was a significant difference in the incidence of dreams between the control and dreamfilm subgroup in the propofol &#x00026; sevoflurane (26% vs. 57%), and in the propofol &#x00026; propofol group (39% vs.70%) (p = 0.010, and p = 0.009, respectively). Similar to this, there was a significant difference in dream incidence between the dreamfilm and the suggestion subgroups (44% vs. 70%) in the propofol &#x00026; propofol group (p = 0.019). Propofol as an induction agent contributed most to dream formation and recalls (&#x003c7;2-test p value: 0.005). The content of images and dreams evoked using suggestions showed great agreement using all three anesthetic protocols.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The psychological method influenced dreaming during anesthesia.

Perioperatively used hypnosis and suggestions may be employed, in addition to local, or general anesthesia as complementer techniques for anxiolysis, sedation, relaxation, pain alleviation, and amnesia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Previous reports showed that suggestions administered in the preoprative period may shorten hospital lenght of stay, may result in decreased pain intensity and reduced opioid requirements in the postoperative setting
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>In recent decades it has beeen proven that despite the use of depth of anesthesia monitors the occurrance of perioperative dreams cannot be avoided
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Unpleasant perioperative dreams or dream recalls may lead to decreased patient satisfaction related to the surgical/anesthesiological event and thus should be reduced.</p><p>It seems that imagination guided by suggestions before induction of anesthesia may modify dream recalls after recovery. The main goal of suggestive techniques in the perioperative phase is to turn the content of dreams toward a favourable direction that is considered a pleasant event by the patient. So far little attention has been paid to the administration of perioperative psychological methods that may meet these requirements.</p><p>Along these lines, in the present study we intended to assess whether dream recalls can be infuenced by two different psychological methods administered in the preoperative setting.</p><p>We intended to answer the following study questions:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>What is the incidence of spontaneous dreams and recallable dreams while using different general anesthesiological methods?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What is the effect of perioperative suggestions and dreamfilm-formation training on the occurrance of dreams and recallable dreams in different general anesthesiological techniques?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What is the influence of induction and maintenance agents on the psychological methods?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Finally we intended to assess whether a relationship exists between the content of the preoperatively administered psycholotherapeutical method and the postoperatively recalled dreams.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The investigations were carried out between 2009 and 2012 by the anaesthesia team of the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care at the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery ward of the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Debrecen, in a prospective, randomized fashion.</p><p>Ethics: Ethical approval for this study (Ethical Committee N&#x000b0; DEOEC RKEB/IKEB 2830&#x02013;2008) was provided by the Ethical Committee University of Debrecen, Hungary (Chairperson J&#x000f3;zsef Szentmikl&#x000f3;si MD, Nagyerdei krt. 98. Debrecen. Phone: +3652411600).</p><p>Adult patients undergoing elective maxillofacial surgery were included, with whom verbal communication was possible. After an informed consent, written agreement was obtained from all patients. Exclusion criteria were: mental retardation, tracheotomy, and inability to communicate (See CONSORT checklist in Additional file

As we intended to exclude the possibility that patients of dreamfilm groups might communicate during the preoperative day and therewith might influence the results of the psychological method, in the first phase only control, (no suggestions were administered) and suggestion group patients (suggestions administered in the OR) were included. Randomisation in this first phase meant main grouping and selecting the anesthesiological subgroup. In this phase of the study 60 patients were allocated per every anesthetic method. Envelope randomisation was carried out in the operating theatre, immediately before induction, the patients were allocated to the suggestion and the control groups, respectively (a total of 180 patients). Investigations in phase two were separated from phase one in time. The people taking part in the study were not selected, all patients presenting at the department in the given time period were included in the dreamfilm group provided that they met the selection criteria and who did not refuse participation. Again, envelope randomisation occurred in the operating theatre to chose the general anesthetic technique. Using three anaesthetic protocols, this amounted to 3&#x000d7;30 subjects. Arrangement of the experiments is summarized in Figure&#x000a0;

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p><italic>The "favourite place" technique"</italic> describes guided imagination of life events with the help of positive suggestions immediately before induction of anesthesia. In the operating theatre the patient was informed about what was going to happen, what sensation the induction agent would cause and was also told that the waking stimulus would be their name. We asked the patient not to pay attention to noises, only to what the anesthetist said. The suggestion technique itself starts with a relaxation exercise, using suggestions promoting calm, deep breathing and muscle relaxation. The patient is not simply asked to remember an event, the aim is to produce a feeling that they are "virtually" in their favourite place. Meanwhile the patient is involved in the imagination process in a dialogue form.</p><p><italic>"Dreamfilm method"</italic>: Patients were met one day prior to surgery and were asked to imagine a film that they would like to "watch" during the anesthesia. Thus, in this case a "favourite place" is produced by the patients, featuring in the prepared dreamfilm. This film is prepared one day prior to surgical anesthesia. Anesthesiologists evoke the previously prepared dreamfilms with suggestions administered at the time of anesthetic induction.</p><p>The main difference between the "favourite place" and the "dreamfilm" group was that in the latter group patients were working on elaborating the dreamfilm one day before surgery. In both groups, the favourite place and the dreamfilm that was produced by the patient were recorded prior to anesthesia by the physician for the sake of further analysis, i.e. patients were asked to recall them verbally. All suggestions and anesthesias were performed by the same person (JGY), who is a certified and experienced anesthetist and psychotherapeutist.</p><p><italic>Postanaesthetic management in the OR:</italic> After the patients were awakened, they were called by their names, and were informed where they were and that the operation had been finished. Thereafter they received amnesia-lifting suggestions, they were asked, before recovery of full consciousness, to retain their dreams and recall them so that later in the ward they could report them to the independent assistants. At this phase, all events related to the recovery period were recorded, including the patient&#x02019;s first reactions during the early recovery phase.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Gathering data</title><p>The patients were interviewed about their dreams and the postoperative questionnaires were filled by the department&#x02019;s assistants, 10 and 60 minutes after recovery, respectively. They were pretrained, independent (blind) staff personnel who were not aware of the grouping status of the patients. The postoperative questionnaire contained parameters of the patients&#x02019; general condition: blood pressure, pulse, complications, and communication. A pivotal part of this questionnaire were questions about the dream report in the postoperative setting. One section of the questionnaire concerned the assessment of the relationship between the anesthetist and the patient (rapport) as well as of the team&#x02019;s work and the patient&#x02019;s anxiety level related to the procedure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Anesthetic and monitoring techniques</title><p>General anesthesia as well as the suggestion techniques for patients in groups 2 and 3 were applied by a single physician (JGy). Midazolam (7,5- 15 mg) and atropin (0,5-1 mg) were administered per os one hour before anesthetic induction as premedication in all patients. Induction and maintenance of anesthesia was performed depending on the grouping status of the patients, as decribed above. In all three anesthetic protocols, pain relief was achived with fentanyl (0,02-0,05 mg/kg boluses), muscle relaxation with atracurium (0,5 mg/kg bolus, 0, 15mg/kg rep.), or with mivacurium (0,2 mg/kg), depending on the length of surgery. Intratracheal intubation was performed in all cases, followed by a pressure controlled ventilation tecnhnique, using oxygen-air mixture, with Dr&#x000e4;ger Primus anaesthetic device. Monitoring was secured using an Infinity Kappa XLT monitor: as part of standard monitoring, non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oxymetry, capnograpy, ECG, and relaxometry were performed. Anesthesia was managed to ensure that hypnotic depth measured by BIS monitoring was between 40 and 60 throughout the entire time elapsed between intubation and wound closure. Monitoring started at the time point before induction of anesthesia and ended after total recovery of the patient, awake state of consciousness and return of adequate communication were reached. <italic>Postoperative analgesia:</italic> Tramadol (4&#x000d7;1 mg/kg) and metamizole (4x0,5-1 g) were used to reduce postoperative pain as was necessary for proper pain relief. Analgesia and anxiolysis measurements: The efficiency of analgesia was graded every hour by the patients based on the rating scale used in the Hungarian school assessments (5 being the best grade&#x02009;=&#x02009;no pain, 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;mild pain, 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;moderate pain, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;strong pain, and 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;worst, intolerable pain).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 11.5.

For this purpose we merged propofol &#x00026; propofol and propofol &#x00026; sevoflurane into one group and reran the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test for homogeneity of the dreaming distributions among the three psychological method groups. The p-value of Pearson chi-square tests was p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.005. If we make a comparison with the etomidate/sevoflurane group, where the Pearson chi-square tests p-value was p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.883, one may conclude that propofol as an induction drug significantly advances the effect of our psychological methods compared to etomidate. For the sake of consistency we repeated the previous test to investigate the role of the maintenance drug. We merged the first and third anesthetic protocol groups (etomidate &#x00026; sevoflurane and propofol &#x00026; sevoflurane) into one group, and repeated the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test. The p-value of the Pearson chi-square test for etomidate &#x00026; sevoflurane was p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.107, while it was 0,038 in propofol &#x00026; propofol group. Hence, propofol, also as a maintenance drug, significantly advances the effect of our psychological methods, while sevoflurane does not.</p><p>In all fairness, comparison of the p-values p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.005 and p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.038 also shows that the change is more significant in the case propofol is taken into account as an induction agent. We may also conclude that for the effectivity of our psychological methods the induction drug is a more important factor than the maintenance drug.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Relationship between the content of preoperative imaginations and perioperative dreams</title><p>In the final analysis the independent observer made a comparison of the preoperative imaginations and the postoperatively reported content of the dreams. The connection of the content of the suggested image and that of the dream were 94.7% in the suggestion group and 83% in the dreamfilm group across the three anesthetic protocols. When we estimated the probability of connection separately for each narcotic protocol, but merging the suggestion and the dreamfilm groups into one group, we found that in the etomidate &#x00026; sevoflurane group 86%, in the propofol &#x00026; sevoflurane group 90%, in the propofol &#x00026; propofol group 88% of preoperative imaginations and postoperatively reported dreams corresponded to each other.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study we found that sponaneous dreams may be observed in approximately one third of patients undergoing general anesthesia, independent of the anesthetic method. The second finding of our observations is that the incidence of dreams and dream recalls are more frequent in those patients in whom preoperative suggestions are applied before and during induction. Furthermore, formation of dreams and dream recalls are dependent on the anesthetic technique. Finally, we observed that the content of dreams recalls can be guided by psychological methods with a probability of at least 90% and they increase recallable dream ratio independently from anesthetic method used.</p><p>The mode of action of the psychological methods demonstrated in our study corresponds to the "Tetris phenomenon" described previously by Stickgold et al. While studying the effect of practising the Tetris game on NREM dreams, Stickgold et al. found that the Tetris game appeared in about 60% of the subjects&#x02019; dreams during the next two nights
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The anesthetic state may have similarities compared to NREM sleep and the neural correlates of the two states show great similarities
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus, it can be assumed that, via a similar mechanism, consolidation of episodic memory and dream formation may occur during anesthesia, too.</p><p>Perioperative dreams and dream recalls are regular and unavoidable events of general anesthesia. According to the literature, the incidence of perioperative dreams varies between 1% to 57%
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There are data to support that the occurrance of dreams depends on the anesthetic drug used
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and there are some studies which do not
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the present study we could not prove any difference between the rates of spontaneous dreams while using different general anesthetic combinations (etomidate/sevoflurane; propofol/sevoflurane; propofol/propofol). It has to be mentioned that this was also true for dream recalls in the anesthetic subgroups without psychological intervention. In contrast to this, the use of different psychological methods contributed to an increase of dreaming incidence that was dependent on the anesthetic protocol employed, predominantly if propofol was used as an induction agent.</p><p>It has been suggested that during NREM sleep memory consolidation takes place simultaneously with the appearance of fast sleep spindles
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It is highly remarkable that during the induction of propofol anesthesia several authors have demonstrated sleep spindle activity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Murphy et al. found that, in propofol induction, gamma- power almost doubled at loss of consciousness, indicating lively cognitive activity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Moreover, Breshears detected the presence of coupled theta-gamma oscillations during propofol induction and recovery alike
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. All this may explain why propofol induction allows good memory consolidation from before induction. During anesthesia if hypnotic depth decreases temporarily, the events potentially perceived by the patients may be incorporated into their dream in a new context
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, if intraoperative hypnosis is managed properly, perioperative dreams may be the result of episodic memory consolidation of events immediately preceding anesthesia.</p><p>Based on our results two sets of clinically important considerations can be drawn. First: environmental stimuli in the operating theatre may be incorporated into perioperative dreams during general anesthesia. One has to remember that due to their altered state of consciousness, patients are capable of producing very vivid imagery while suggestibility increases
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, care should be taken especially during the induction phase to reduce annoying and unpleasant acoustic or visual stimuli. It is the whole OR team&#x02019;s responsibility to provide a quiet environment around the patient in order to avoid unpleasant dream formations. The second important consideration is rather methodological. For a long time, perioperative dreams were considered as events that are indicators of inappropriate depth of anesthesia that should be reduced to a minimum during daily clinical practice
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The present study has allowed us to form a significantly different point of view. As we have proved, similarly to others, perioperative dreams cannot be avoided during clinical practice, they can even be increased by administering preoperative suggestions. We are of the opinion that dreams occurring during anesthesia should, in fact, be turned in a favourable direction by choosing proper induction agents and through the administration of pleasant suggestions during induction of anesthesia. Our voice, our gestures and behaviour are all suggestions that unwittingly evoke images, emotions, which may influence the patient&#x02019;s dreams during anesthesia and their experiences at recovery. In a recent systematic review Wobst stated that even patients wo do not reach the stage of hypnotic trance may benefit from hypnotic suggestions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Thus, anesthetists should in some way act as a psychotherapists during the induction phase of general anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We strongly believe that, besides providing a calm environment in the OR, all anaesthetists should work out a method that provides pleasant suggestions to the patients because favourable perioperative dreams may contribute to patient satisfaction related to the anesthetric event and therefore efforts should be made to do it. In a previous meta-analysis it has been suggested that hypnosis may function via changes in patients&#x02019;expectancies for outcomes and adjunctive hypnosis is beneficial in 89% of surgical patients
