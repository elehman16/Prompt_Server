training on the static balance and walking ability of patients who had suffered a stroke.
[Subjects] Forty patients with hemiplegia resulting from a stroke were divided into an
action observation gait training group (AOGT group, n=20) and a general gait training
group (GGT group, n=20). [Methods] The AOGT group watched a training video on flatland
gait, slope gait, and stair gait. The GGT group watched a video on nature. Both groups
watched their respective video for 10 minutes and then had gait training for 20 minutes
per day, five times per week, for eight weeks. [Results] The static balance and gait
ability of both groups significantly improved. Although there were significant differences
between the groups, the AOTG group showed greater improvements in sway speed, limit of
stability, and gait ability. [Conclusion] We recommend action observation training over
general gait training for patients with hemiplegia. Action observational training had a
positive effect on static balance and gait ability in stroke patients&#x02019; static balance and
gait ability. Further research is needed to generalize the results of this study.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Hemiplegia</kwd><kwd>Action observation training</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Independent walking is an ultimate treatment goal of stroke patients and an important
indicator for evaluating the recovery of motor skills<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Methods of improving walking ability in stroke patients include
gait training using functional electronic stimulation (FES) intended to improve walking
ability through electrical stimulation of paralyzed muscles<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, progressive resistive exercises that improve walking ability by
gradually increasing the amount of resistance to the lower extremities<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, virtual reality systems that create situations that are
similar to reality to make subjects feel as if they are being trained in such
situations<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> and task-oriented training
for repeated practices of walking and stair walking<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>; the utility of these methods has been verified by many previous
researchers<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Gait training programs
focus on improving motor skills through activation of the brain region using direct/indirect
stimulation of the brain including cognitive treatments. Methods of activating the
plasticity of the brain region include cognitive rehabilitation training programs utilizing
motor nerves and sensory nerve stimulation<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among them, action observation training, which improves functional
movements by stimulating the nerve cells in the cerebral cortex, has been actively studied
recently.</p><p>Action observation training is a training method that brings about improvements in actual
skills through the activation of the brain region obtained by observing, imitating, and
practicing others&#x02019; actions<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
neurologic mechanism of this action observation training is based on the discovery of the
mirror neuron system, in which regions similar to the premotor area and the parietal lobe in
the brain region are known to be activated not only when actions are conducted firsthand,
but also when the same actions are observed while they are being conducted<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. While observing the behaviors of others,
the nerves in the observer&#x02019;s brain involved in such behaviors are activated. Based on this,
clinical studies are being continuously conducted in the area of nerve rehabilitation. In
one study conducted with healthy adults based on this mirror neuron system, action
observation training groups that observed actual actions and repeatedly practiced the same
physical actions as they had observed actions showed significantly larger training effects
than groups that repeated simple actions without observing actions<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. These results suggest that action observation training
can be a more useful intervention method than task-oriented training for improving the motor
skills of patients with impaired motor skills due to damage to the brain region such as that
resulting from a stroke<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently,
evidence has been presented supporting the effects of action observation training in the
process of relearning functional tasks after a stroke<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, and proposals indicating that larger improvements in skills can be
expected if action observation training is applied to patients in combination with the
training currently used in interventions for rehabilitation have been raised<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, although many studies on action observation training have been conducted recently,
most of them have been related to upper extremity functions, and studies that have examined
the effects of action observation training on balance and walking ability, which are basic
elements for actual independent life, are quite insufficient. Therefore, this study intended
to apply action observation training to stroke patients to examine the effects of action
observation training on balance and walking ability of patients in order to help in applying
action observation training as a method of rehabilitation training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 40 patients diagnosed with hemiplegia resulting from a
stroke by a rehabilitation doctor practicing at N Hospital located in Daegu, South Korea.
They were randomly and equally assigned to a action observational gait training group (AOGT:
10 males, 10 females) and a general gait training group (GGT: 11 males, 9 females). The mean
&#x000b1; SD age, height, and weight of the AOGT were 51.15&#x000b1;14.81&#x02005;years, 163.45&#x000b1;8.53&#x02005;cm, and
64.1&#x000b1;13.1&#x02005;kg, respectively. Eleven of the patients had right hemiplegia, and nine had left
hemiplegia. The onset period was 14.8&#x000b1;6.1 months. The mean &#x000b1; SD age, height, and weight of
the GGT were 48.65&#x000b1;12.81&#x02005;years, 165.9&#x000b1;8.6&#x02005;cm, and 63.80&#x000b1;9.26&#x02005;kg, respectively. Nine of the
patients had right hemiplegia, and 11 had left hemiplegia. The onset period was 13.4&#x000b1;8.2
months.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: no visual field defect, no abnormality in the
vestibular organs, no orthopedic disease, an unrestricted range of motion, an ability to
understand and perform the exercise as instructed by the researcher, and a score of 24 or
higher on the Mini-Mental State Examination-Korean version. All of the subjects understood
the purpose of this study and provided their written informed consent prior to their
participation in the study in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p><p>Prior to each training, the participants in both groups received 30 minutes of general
physical therapy that consisted of a joint exercise, muscle strengthening exercise, and a
stretching exercise.</p><p>The action observational gait training group watched a video that consisted of three-minute
videos each for walking on a flat land, on a slope, and on steps, all executed by a healthy
person, and took a one-minute break afterwards. Then, the group went through walking
training for five minutes each on the same flat land, slope, and steps as in the video.
Between each set of training, they took a 1&#x02013;2 minute break, and in total, the walking
training took 20 minutes. The general gait training group watched a video that showed images
of nature unrelated with walking for the same amount of time, and went through the same
walking training with the experimental group for 20 minutes. The experiment was conducted
over the course of 30 minutes each time, five times per week, for a total of eight weeks. In
the present study, a balance ability measuring and training system (analysis system using
biofeedback, AP1153 BioRescue, France) was used to measure the balance ability of the
subjects. The balance ability measuring and training system is suitable for static and
dynamic measurement of the balance ability of patients, general people, and athletes. This
system can be used to observe the moving path line of the center of pressure during certain
movements to determine the length (mm) of the moving path line, the average speed of the
movements (cm/s), and the area of the movements. In the present study, the patient was
instructed to spread his/her legs to around 30&#x000b0; in an upright standing position and look
forward. The measuring method was explained via a monitor and demonstrated before
measurement.</p><p>The patient was instructed to keep his/her balance for one minute while looking forward.
The distribution of weight bearing on the paretic and nonparetic sides, the total distance
of movements of the center point of the body, and the area of the movements were then
measured. To compare the patient&#x02019;s static balance, the limit of stability in a static
standing position within which the patient could maximally move his/her center of gravity
while keeping balance in the direction instructed by the monitor using the ankle strategy in
an upright standing position was measured. For the measurement of gait ability, we used the
Timed Up and Go Test and the 10 Meter Walking Test.</p><p>The experimental results were statistically analyzed using SPSS 20.0 KO (IBM, Armomk, NY,
USA). After the general characteristics of the subjects were determined, a paired t-test was
used to measure the sway area, sway speed, and limit of stability in a static standing
position. Tests were done before and after the intervention for each group. The significance
of the differences between the two groups was investigated using an independent t-test.
Statistical significance was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>With regard to changes in the sway area, sway speed, and limit of stability, both groups

considered an important element for improving their quality of life through their
participation in social life and daily life and for increasing their social
interactions<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The aim of this study was to examine the effects of action observation training on balance
and walking in stroke patients. According to the results, after gait training for eight
weeks including walking action observation, the center of gravity sway areas, sway speeds,
and movement distance of their stability limit in standing positions of the subjects were
significantly improved, and significant improvement was also shown in the Timed Up and Go
Test and the 10 Meter Walking Test after training. In comparison with the GGT group,
statistically significant improvements were shown in all measured variables except for sway
areas.</p><p>In a study conducted by Maloui et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>
in which 12 stroke patients underwent physical training combined with imaginary training,
the researchers reported that the weight bearing ratio of the paretic lower extremity
increased after the intervention, and this effect was maintained even after 24 hours; in a
study conducted by Choi and Park<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, the
time spent on weight-shifting tasks, the movement distance of the center of pressure, and
the Timed Up and Go Test scored decreased significantly in the group that underwent actual
training combined with motor imagery. Dunsky et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported improved walking functions with increases in walking
speed, paretic side stride length, cadence, and single-support time and decreases in
double-support time.</p><p>As with the abovementioned previous studies, in this study too, static and dynamic balance
elements and walking elements were improved after patients underwent action observation
training. Based on a previous study indicating that the same motor projection area is
activated when observing actions as when actually performing the actions<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, action observation is considered to have
activated the neural networks in their cerebrum and cerebellum of the stroke patients,
leading to the reorganization of their brain and bring about improvements in skills<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. This fact shows that action observation
training can affect improvements in balance and walking ability. However, this study has
limitations in that it could not be compared with other studies because few studies have
been conducted in which action observation training has been implemented in stroke patients
to examine changes in balance and walking ability, the long-term effects of action
observation training could not be judged through this study, and the persistence of the
effects are unknown, as the patients were not followed up.</p><p>With the indicators measured using the elements of walking in this study, only functional
walking performance improvements could be judged. Hereafter, not only evaluation of the
effects of action observation training on the functional aspects of walking but also
temporal/spatial and kinematic evaluation and evaluation of effects in terms of neurology
should be conducted more, and more diverse action observation programs and tasks should be
implemented.</p><p>Based on the results of this study, action observation training is considered an effective
method that can be used clinically because it can be easily implemented by stroke patients
who are motivated with respect to rehabilitation, since it is composed of processes
consisting of observation of movement task videos and practice of observed tasks; it can
also be useful in terms of economic efficiency, as patients can continue training using
videos even after they leave the hospital. Action observation training may be effective for
improving skills if it is utilized in combination with traditional treatment methods as a
preparation process before training in stroke rehabilitation. However, this training could
only be continued when patients had high levels of concentration and were strongly motivated
with respect to rehabilitation while they were observing actions. Moreover, the video
contents were insufficient. Hereafter, studies to provide standardized frameworks should be
continued so that clinical therapists can more clearly design action observation training
program.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>SW</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Gait analysis using accelerometer in stroke
