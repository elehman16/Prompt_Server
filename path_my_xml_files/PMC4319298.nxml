Chemomechanical preparation is an essential and indispensable step for disinfection of the root canal system.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] During endodontic treatment, roots are susceptible to have dentinal damage. Quantity of dentinal damages can be effected by various factors like physical properties of teeth,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] preparation technique or various endodontic instruments that used, etc., Thus, each preparation technique can damage root dentin.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Besides stainless steel hand files, several rotary nickel-titanium (Ni-Ti) file systems have been introduced for the preparation of root canals. Ni-Ti instruments provide many advantages compared to conventional files. Increased flexibility, and shortened working time are the major advantages of Ni-Ti files,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] due to the different tip design, taper, and cutting blade configuration of these systems, stress on the root canal walls may arise[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and these can result as microcracks or craze lines,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] because of the repeated stress application by occlusal forces these microcracks and craze lines may develop into fractures.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>It is claimed that when using Reciproc (VDW, Munich, Germany) Ni-Ti files, complete preparation and cleaning of root canals can be accomplished with only one instrument. These files are used in a reciprocating movement that requires special automated devices.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The reciprocating movement relieves stress on the instrument,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and it is conceivable that they could relieve stress on root canal walls as well. It is stated that the reciprocating root canal preparation is an evolution of a balanced force technique.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>A different approach to the use of the ProTaper F2 instrument (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) in a reciprocating movement has been reported.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The advantages of using a single Ni-Ti instrument are: Simple preparation of the entire root canal, greater cost-effectiveness than the conventional multi-file Ni-Ti rotary systems, reduction of instrument fatigue and possible cross-contamination, and they are less time-consuming than rotational movement with multiple instruments[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>ProTaper Next (Dentsply Tulsa Dental Specialties, Johnson City, TN, USA) is a newly introduced Ni-Ti rotary system manufactured using M-wire Ni-Ti alloy (Sportswire, Langley, OK). The ProTaper Next system has variable tapers and an off-centered rectangular cross section design and requires working with a rotational movement. This off-centered rectangular cross section design is intended to reduce torsional stress on the instrument (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tulsadentalspecialities.com">www.tulsadentalspecialities.com</ext-link>).</p><p>This study investigated the incidence of dentinal microcracks that may occur during preparation of root canals, using different preparation techniques with different systems. The tested the null hypothesis that there are no significant differences among the groups in dentinal microcrack formations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Selection of the specimens</title><p>For this <italic>in vitro</italic> investigation, 200 human mandibular incisor teeth with straight roots (&#x0003c;5&#x000b0;) that had been extracted for periodontal reasons were selected. Teeth were stored in purified water. Teeth with approximately the same root length were chosen and inspected with an operating microscope (Zeiss Opmi Pico; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) at &#x000d7;10 to detect visible cracks or fractures on the teeth. 24 teeth were excluded from the study. The remaining 176 teeth were adjusted to 16 mm in length from the apex to standardize the specimens, and the access cavities were prepared. Subsequently, teeth were re-evaluated with an operating microscope at &#x000d7;10 magnification for detection of cracks or fractures, and 7 teeth with crack lines were eliminated from the study. Teeth with single canals were selected, and mesiodistal radiographs were taken to verify the canal configuration. Teeth with accessory canals were excluded, and finally, 120 teeth that met the conditions were included in this study. Each root was wrapped with a single layer of aluminum foil and embedded in acrylic resin (Imicryl, Konya, Turkey) set in an acrylic tube. The root was then removed from the tube, and the aluminum foil peeled off. A hydrophilic vinyl polysiloxane impression material (Oranwash; Zhermack SpA, Rovigo, Italy) that replaced the space created by the foil represented a simulated periodontal ligament, and the root was immediately repositioned.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Root canal preparation</title><p>The patency and working length (WL) of each canal was determined by passing the size 8 K-file (Mani, Inc., Tochigi, Japan) to the anatomic foramen. This length was recorded, and the final WL was established 0.5 mm short. Before root canal instrumentation procedures, all root canals were prepared with #8 and #10 K-files to establish a glide path. Between the use of each instrument, root canals were irrigated with 2 ml of 2.5% NaOCl. Then, the specimens were divided into the following five experimental groups (<italic>n</italic> = 20) according to the root canal shaping procedure:</p><p>Group 1: Stainless steel hand K-files (2% taper) (Mani, Inc., Tochigi, Japan) were used to enlarge the root canals to size 25 using the Balanced Force technique.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Files were inserted by a quarter-turn clockwise (CW) rotation of 90&#x000b0; with no apical pressure and cutting was accomplished by counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation of 120&#x000b0; applying sufficient apical pressure. Then WL was incrementally reduced by 1 mm beginning from #30 to #60 K-file instrument. Irrigation was performed with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite. For each canal, a new set of K-file was used.</p><p>Group 2: Root canals were prepared with the ProTaper F2 instrument using an endodontic micromotor (ATR Technika Digital motor Motor, Pistoia, Italy) that allows the user to modify and set the reciprocating angles in both CW and CCW directions with a 16:1 reduction handpiece. The CW and the CCW rotations are set on the motor at ~1310&#x000b0; and ~578&#x000b0;, respectively.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The rotational speed is set at 400 rpm.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The instruments were used with slow in-and-out pecking motions (3&#x02013;4 motions) until it reach the WL. For each root canal, a new ProTaper F2 instrument was used.</p><p>Group 3: Root canals were prepared with the Reciproc R25 instrument in a reciprocating movement with 3 slow in-and-out pecking motions. The instrument was used with &#x0201c;Reciproc all&#x0201d; mode of the endodontic micromotor (VDW Silver, Munich, Germany). For each root canal, a new Reciproc instrument was used.</p><p>Group 4: Root canals were prepared with ProTaper instruments in a rotary movement with slow in-and-out pecking motions using an endodontic micromotor which has adjusted ProTaper Universal (PTU) mode for instruments (VDW Silver, Munich, Germany) according to manufacturer rpm (revolutions/min) and torque instructions. All instruments were used with 300 rpm rotational speed and recommended torque values (1.5 Ncm for S2; 2.0 Ncm for F1; 3.0 Ncm for SX, S1, F2, and F3; respectively). The instrument sequence was: (1) SX instrument at two-thirds of the WL, (2) S1, S2, F1, F2 instruments at WL. For each root canal, a new set of ProTaper instruments was used.</p><p>Group 5: Root canals were prepared with ProTaper Next instruments in a rotary movement with three slow in-and-out pecking motions using an endodontic micromotor (VDW Silver, Munich, Germany), at 300 rpm and 2 N/cm torque settings. The instrument sequence was: X1 instrument at WL and X2 instrument at WL. For each root canal, a new set of ProTaper Next instruments was used.</p><p>Control group: No procedure was applied to the 20 roots in this group.</p><p>Composite resin was used to fix rubber stoppers of instruments to control the instrumentation length.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] During the instrumentation, 2.5% sodium hypochlorite was used. In total, 10 ml of NaOCl was used for irrigation of root canals in all experimental groups. The root canals were then dried with paper points.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Microscopic evaluation</title><p>After preparation, only the crowns of the teeth were embedded in resin (Technovit; Heraeus-Kulzer, Wehrheim, Germany) so that no shrinking forces influenced the roots. All roots were sectioned horizontally at 3, 6, and 9 mm from the apex with a low-speed saw under water cooling (Minitom, Struer, Denmark). To prevent artifacts from dehydration in the samples, the teeth were kept moist in distilled water throughout all experimental procedures. The slices were then examined through a stereomicroscope (Leica DM750, Germany), and pictures were taken with a digital camera (Leica D-Lu &#x000d7; 3, Germany) attached to the stereomicroscope at a magnification of 8x. Two experienced investigators controlled and scored each image until there was consensus between them. Defects were classified according to three types:[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>

In the present study, there were no significant differences among the systems in terms of microcrack formations. The instruments used in the present study were at smaller sizes (Reciproc R25, ProTaper F2). Furthermore, B&#x000fc;rklein <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] did not use a method that simulate the periodontal ligament. Therefore, different results could be related to different methodologies. Liu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] stated that Reciproc R25 files created fewer microcrack formations than the full sequence ProTaper (up to F2) system, but they observed the apical surface at 2, 4 and 6 mm sections. In the present study, we observed 3, 6, and 9 mm surfaces. Also Liu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] used Gates Glidden no. 2 instruments to enlarge all root canal orifices and this might have reduced the stresses occurred on the root canal walls. In the present study, no coronal flaring procedure was applied to the roots. The differences of methodologies could create different results.</p><p>Kansal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] investigated the dentinal microcrack formations occurred in mandibular premolars during the use of full sequence ProTaper (up to F2), Waveone 25 and ProTaper F2 with reciprocal movement. They found that full sequence ProTaper created more microcracks than the other systems. The methodology used in the study of Kansal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] was similar to the methodology used in the present study except the teeth selection. Mandibular incisors were used in the present study, and there were no significant differences among the systems. The root canals of the mandibular incisors vary greatly in their cross-sectional anatomy,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and the microcrack formations may be influenced by the root canal morphology.</p><p>&#x000c7;apar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] investigated the effects of ProTaper next, PTU and HyFlex instruments on crack formation in dentin and found that ProTaper Next and Hyflex instruments caused less microcracks than PTU. They used mandibular premolar teeth and instrumented up to ProTaper F4, ProTaper Next X4, HyFle &#x000d7; 40/04. In the present study, mandibular incisors were selected, and instrumentations were performed with full sequence ProTaper and ProTaper Next instruments up to F2, X2 instruments, and also ProTaper F2 instruments were used in reciprocation motion. The differences of results could be related to different methodologies and teeth selections.</p><p>Versluis <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] stated that during the instrumentation procedure, the stresses generated at the middle, and coronal thirds were three times more prevalent than at the apical level.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In the present study, the occurrence of microcrack formations in the coronal thirds was 10.7%, 11.7% in the middle thirds, and 1.9% in the apical thirds. Our findings could be related to the study of Versluis <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] in terms of stress related to microcrack formations. In the present study, only the control and hand file instrumentation groups showed no microcrack formations and our findings were similar with Bier <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] who reported that they did not observe any microcrack formations in the hand file group.</p><p>Fewer microcrack formations occurred in apical thirds than middle and coronal thirds. All rotary systems used in the study have a similar apical taper design (25/08 for ProTaper F2 and Reciproc R25 and 25/06 for ProTaper Next X2), and this could be the reason for the similar results in apical thirds. Furthermore, lack of microcrack formation in apical thirds could be associated with the size of the final apical instruments.</p><p>Cracks after canal instrumentation were detected either in horizontal sections at different levels along the roots[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or the apical root surface.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] As in the studies of many other authors,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] we investigated the microcrack formations via horizontal sectioning along the different lengths of the root to see the entire condition of the root at different root thirds. The sawing action and forces applied during the extraction could also result in dentinal microcracks.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, no microcrack formations were observed in the control group. Therefore, the observed microcracks were likely a result of the preparation procedures.</p><p>One of the most important limitation of previous studies is there is no chance of evaluating preexisting defects by current methodology. (root sectioning and direct observation by optical microscopy) micro-computed tomography (CT) imaging has a much higher definition than stereomicroscopy, and a large number of sections can be analyzed per tooth without creating defects. De-Deus <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] reported that micro-CT image technology was accurate and a nondestructive method that allows the assessment of specimens before instrumentation.</p><p>Within the limitations of the present study, with the exception of the hand file and control groups, all experimental groups showed microcrack formations. Although, ProTaper Next files showed more crack formations, there was no significant statistical difference, and all systems and motions did not affect the microcrack formations.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nill.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
