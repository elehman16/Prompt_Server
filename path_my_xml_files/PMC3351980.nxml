Patients receiving calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) are at increased risk to develop impaired renal function. Early CNI reduction and concomitant use of mycophenolat mofetil (MMF) has been shown to improve renal function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The aim of this trial was to compare dose-reduced CNI/MMF versus CNI-free MMF/prednisone-based treatment in stable patients after OLT with respect to glomerular filtration rate (GFR). 21 patients [GFR 44.9 &#x000b1; 9.9 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2 </sup>measured by 99m-Tc-DTPA-clearance, serum creatinine (SCr) 1.5 &#x000b1; 0.42 mg/dL] were randomized either to exchange CNI for 10 mg prednisone (group 1; n = 8) or to receive CNI at 25% of the initial dose (group 2; n = 13) each in combination with 1000 mg MMF b.i.d.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At month 12 mean SCr (-0.3 &#x000b1; 0.4 mg/dL, p = 0.031) and GFR improved (8.6 &#x000b1; 13.1 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.015) in group 2 but remained unchanged in group 1.

Up to 18% of patients after OLT have been shown to suffer from end stage renal disease (ESRD) within 10 years after engraftment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Apart from preoperative GFR, diabetes and chronic hepatitis C infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], the use of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) based immunosuppression has been shown to put the patient at particular risk to develop chronic kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, both CNI-sparing and CNI free regimens should offer an opportunity to treat liver transplant recipients with impaired renal function.

We found, that conversion to MMF in combination with CNI-dose reduction was able to significantly improve GFR, whereas the CNI-free regimen in combination with steroids did not ameliorate renal function.</p><p>Previous studies have already demonstrated a positive effect of CNI-dose reduction on renal function in liver transplant recipients with chronic kidney disease. The following various approaches have been studied: de novo immunosuppression with MMF combined with delayed introduction of CNI's [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], reduced dose CNIs either de novo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] or reduction after more than one year after engraftment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, in these studies assessment of renal function had been based on indirect methods such as serum creatinine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], creatinine clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] or creatinine based estimated GFR (eGFR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In contrast, we applied 99m-Tc-DTPA-clearance - a radioisotope gold standard method to measure glomerular function - to evaluate the course of renal function after conversion, since it has meanwhile been well established that serum creatinine and creatinine based equations, e.g. MDRD, only insufficiently reflect true GFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In contrast to the work of Schlitt, Reich and Cr&#x000e9;put [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], CNI-free immunosuppression did not reveal any improvement of renal function in our patients. However, since we used an ITT analysis, the number of drop-outs may have influenced our assessment of outcomes.</p><p>In our study, CNI-free immunosuppression comprised MMF in combination with corticosteroids, which had been chosen, because a high number of rejections had been reported in patients with MMF monotherapy. Although only a low dose of 10 mg prednisone was administered, this type of treatment was associated with an increment of 11 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. This unexpected effect may have counterbalanced the potentially positive effects of CNI withdrawal in our patients in group 1. On the other hand, both MMF in combination with reduced dose CNI and MMF in combination with corticosteroids proved to be relatively safe, taking into account that acute rejection occurred in only 10% (2/21) of patients. Of note, all rejection episodes responded well to corticosteroid pulse therapy, so that normal hepatic function was restored in all patients with rejection. Both rejection episodes occurred in a "stable phase" of immunsuppression 4.6 and 7.5 months after conversion, so that the causal relationship to the treatment protocol remains unclear. In our study the frequency of BPR was similar to that reported by Reich et al. (9-14%) but higher than in the trials of Pageaux and Creput (0%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>As expected, gastrointestinal intolerance was the most frequent side effect, which required treatment discontinuation in 2 of 3 patients with this complication. Otherwise, the spectrum of side effects was similar to other studies. Herpes infection is a complication which had already been previously attributed to MMF treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In contrast, myoclonia, which was observed in a single patient of group 2 has not yet been reported under MMF medication. Finally, polyserositis which was observed also in a patient must most likely not be attributed to MMF medication, because the syndrome re-occurred 17 months after MMF had been discontinued.</p><p>This study had been planned as a pilot trial to provide data for a larger multicentre trial. Thus the low number of patients and the single centre design may limit interpretation of our results. Nevertheless, we obtained a clear result not favouring CNI-free immunosuppression in liver transplant recipients with impaired renal function. Of note this result is based on direct measurement of GFR with a gold standard method rather than indirect assessments of renal function by serum creatinine or eGFR which may be invalid in patients after liver transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] or with impaired liver function.</p><p>Thus, the obligate use of corticosteroids with their potentially hypertensive effect cannot be generally recommended in a CNI-free regimen of MMF-based immunosuppression. In addition, our trial adds evidence to the existing data using a GFR gold standard meaesurement, that CNI-reduction in combination with MMF is a safe and effective method to treat liver transplant recipients with an impairment of renal function.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CNI: calcineurin inhibitor; GFR: glomerular filtration rate; eGFR: estimated GFR; MMF: mycophenolate
