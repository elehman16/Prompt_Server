Experienced oncologists will be randomized to receive the LoMoS or not. To minimize contamination, LoMoS are removed from the medical charts after visits. Primary endpoint is the difference in global quality of life (items 29 &#x00026; 30 of EORTC-QlQ-C30) between baseline and last study visit at week 6, with a 10 point between-arm difference considered to be clinically relevant. 20 clusters (=oncologists) per treatment arm with 4&#x02013;8 patients each are aimed for to achieve a significance level of 5% and a power of 80% in a mixed model approach. Selected co- variables are included in the model for adjustment. Secondary endpoints include patient-perceived patient-physician communication symptom burden over time, and oncologists&#x02019; symptom management performance (predefined thresholds of symptoms compared to oncologists&#x02019; pharmacological, diagnostic or counselling actions [structured chart review]).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial will contribute to the research question, whether structured, longitudinal monitoring of patients&#x02019; multidimensional symptoms, indicators for symptom management, and clinical benefit outcomes can influence patients&#x02019; quality of life and symptom distress, in a setting of routine oncology practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials NCT00477919</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In patients with advanced, incurable cancer, anticancer treatment may alleviate patients&#x02019; cancer-related symptoms and cancer-associated complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These beneficial effects may occur even in the absence of a tumor response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In contrast, reduction of tumor size does not necessarily imply a benefit to patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Chemotherapy may cause physical and psychosocial side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. An important focus of treatment is therefore to have a beneficial impact on health-related quality of life (HRQL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. HRQL was reported by health care professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and medical oncologists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] to be the most important outcome in assessing the effect of palliative chemotherapy. However, HRQL considerations rated by physicians after consultation were poorly associated with decisions regarding modification of palliative chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>While both monitoring of tumor response and toxicity are defined by gold standards (i.e., RECIST, CTCAE v3.0), symptoms and syndromes, also conceptualized as patient-reported outcomes (PROs), are yet only partially incorporated in routine oncology care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Symptoms, which are subjective perceptions of patients, cannot be measured by currently used toxicity scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Syndromes are mainly clinically described patterns, a combination of symptoms and clinical signs. Cachexia for instance is the combination of the sign weight loss and the symptom anorexia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>It is often assumed that an oncologist can estimate the symptoms of the patient accurately using a regular history. However, oncologists&#x02019; perceptions may differ from patients&#x02019; reported physical and psychosocial experiences. In patients with advanced cancer, the assessment of relevant psychological domains, but also of pain, asthenia/fatigue, or nutritional problems are often underestimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. They may not be detected (lack of screening), not be quantified by the patient or by a professional (lack of measuring individuals&#x02019; symptom distress) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] or their impact on patients&#x02019; everyday functioning is not taken into account (lack of estimation of the magnitude of the problem). Physicians&#x02019; concerns about time constraints arising from dealing with unexpected or complex symptoms may contribute to underestimation of symptoms, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In Switzerland, an average of 15&#x02009;minutes of consultation time is general practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>For the monitoring of anticancer treatment, the palliative effect of chemotherapy on disease-related symptoms and syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] has been operationalized by defining a clinical benefit criterion. In pancreatic cancer, the endpoint of clinical benefit response (a composite assessment of pain, performance status and weight) was created to provide a way in which the impact of therapy on tumor-related symptoms could be assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and has become a well-accepted outcome parameter. However, outside of clinical studies its application in routine care is limited. It can therefore be hypothesized, that monitoring of both symptoms, clinical benefit parameters (as objective indicators of effect of management) and selected interventions may result in a quality of life benefit for patients.</p><p>There are several approaches pursued to bring patients&#x02019; experiences and wishes to the oncology routine care including collection of patients&#x02019; symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], palliative care needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], review of systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], or general concerns and questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], immediately before the visits with physicians and/or nurses. These studies document the proof of concept, that such monitoring can be applied in clinical practice. Looking at the three elements, i.e. symptoms, clinical benefit and treatments, reveals selected documented effects. Monitoring of patients&#x02019; symptoms alone increases professionals&#x02019; awareness, patient and caregiver&#x02019;s satisfaction about communication, but rarely effectiveness of symptom management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Monitoring of indicators of patients&#x02019; needs, such as declining physical function, distress, repeated hospitalizations, or pre-defined thresholds of symptoms alone will trigger &#x0201c;only&#x0201d; further assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Monitoring of current treatments (e.g. pain medications) is only effective, or general concerns and questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], immediately before the visits with physicians and/or nurses. These studies document the proof of concept that such monitoring can be applied in clinical practice.

Therefore, we decided to select and group the most important symptoms and syndromes into clusters, aiming to maintain an adequate coverage of all important items. This approach should guide the treating physician in a replicable and structured way to monitor relevant (physical and psychological) symptoms and syndromes.</p><p>The E-MOSAIC intervention was developed based on pilot work monitoring both symptoms and clinical benefit parameter in oncology care, using paper and pencil to color bars from zero to ten. For symptom assessment, the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) is used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The ESAS is a validated nine-item patient-rated symptom visual analogue scale developed for use in assessing the symptoms of patients receiving palliative care.

Several patients allocated to the same physicians can hardly be considered independent. In particular, a physician familiar to the LoMoS intervention would probably treat his patients in a similar way, even if they were randomized to different interventions. To prevent this contamination, physicians are chosen as clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

Each physician has to be informed about the study procedures and has to sign informed consent prior to his randomization. There will be no specific training on symptom management, because the E-MOSAIC intervention in this study includes simply the monitoring sheet.

Symptom Distress Score, the summation of the nine ESAS items is used as in the original publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. All ESAS symptoms are individually investigated, to test the hypothesis, that the E-MOSAIC intervention may influence only specific symptoms (e.g., only anxiety and depression, but not pain, or vice versa). As syndromes, pre-defined selected items, the KPS, weight and weight loss, nutritional intake, and use of medical interventions for symptoms (e.g. MEDD) are compared. Several of these items have been conceptualized as clinical benefit criteria.</p><p>Number of visits with a symptom load above defined threshold for 5 symptoms without immediate intervention and all interventions performed by the oncologist to alleviate multidimensional suffering of patients and family members will be calculated and oncologists&#x02019; routine work will be collected.

A predominant symptom is defined as the symptom with the highest ranking and all other symptoms are&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;=2 / 10 lower ranked. Complexity is defined as&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;=3 symptoms with&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;=6/10, with the exception of fatigue and anorexia (threshold&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;=9/10).</p><p>To explore patients&#x02019; subjective adaptation to illness and burden of treatment two linear analogue self-assessment (LASA) indicators are included, assessing perceived adjustment to chronic illness (PACIS); [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] (&#x02018;no effort at all&#x02019; &#x02013; &#x02018;a great deal of effort) and overall treatment burden (&#x02018;not at all&#x02019; &#x02013; &#x02019;severely&#x02019;). The indicator for PACIS was confirmed to be responsive to cytotoxic side-effects, mental distress, and psychosocial dysfunction in patients with early breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. It is suitable to describe patients&#x02019; adaptation over time. The instruments are validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The indicator for overall treatment burden has been validated regarding side-effects of antiemetic and cytotoxic therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>As indicator for decision-making preferences, the difference in number of mismatched decision-making preferences between week 3 and 6 will be compared between the two arms.</p><p>Patients&#x02019; preferences for involvement in decision making will be assessed by a measure adapted from previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The patient chooses from among five categories ranging from &#x02018;the doctor should make the decision using all that he/she knows about the treatment&#x02019; to &#x02018;I should make the decision using all that I know and learn about the treatment&#x02019;. In addition the physician is asked to choose from among the same five categories how he/she estimates the patients&#x02019; preferences.</p><p>A mismatch is defined as follows: the patient ranks #1 or #2 and the physician #4 or #5 or vice versa. For neutral patients or physicians no mismatch is possible per definition.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Sample sizes are calculated for an inequality test for two means of change in QoL in a cluster randomized design using the software package NCSS 2004 - PASS 2002, according to the formulation of Donner and Klar, assuming a two-sided significance level of 0.05, and a statistical power of 0.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Further assumptions on design parameters are an overall variance (s2) of 400, an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC, estimated by the ratio of between-cluster variation to overall variance) of 0.05 , an effect size (between-arm difference in G-QoL to be detected) of 10, and the cluster size (the number of evaluable patients per physician) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. For the cluster size several options are considered, but it is expected to stop the trial at a cluster size of 8 with 12 physicians per arm, yielding a total sample size of 192 evaluable patients.</p><p>Since the initial estimate of the ICC might not be appropriate, an interim analysis to adjust the sample size as suggested in Lake et al. is foreseen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Once data for the first 100 patients are available, estimates of within-cluster variation and between-cluster variation are obtained. If the resulting ICC has to be at least 1.5 times larger than the value taken for the initial sample size estimation, then the sample size would be adjusted using the new estimate of ICC, without alteration on other design parameters. The feasibility of patient accrual is evaluated at the same time. The recommended cluster size might be adjusted accordingly.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Due to the cluster structure, comparisons of different outcomes between treatment arms will be analyzed by mixed models. For endpoints with continuous values, linear mixed model may be applied. For endpoints with categorical or binary values, nonlinear mixed model or generalized estimating equations may be applied.</p><p>The data will be stored and analyzed at the SAKK Coordinating Center using SAS software, Version 9.2 of the SAS System for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and the open source R statistical software package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>). All statistical tests will be done two-sided at a significance level of 0.05.

Categorical data will be reported using absolute and relative frequencies.</p><p>For the <italic>primary endpoint</italic>, selected influential variables (education, tumor type, predominant symptom, anxiety, complexity, hospitalisations) and the baseline G-QoL value will be included in the analysis model as covariates. For the primary analysis, only evaluable patients will be used. As a sensitivity analysis, non-evaluable patients will be included if possible. For instance, the difference between baseline and 3&#x02009;weeks will be analyzed including patients who are evaluable at week 3 but non-evaluable at week 6.</p><p>Several pre-defined subgroup analyses are foreseen: The difference in G-QoL will be compared between both arms in sub-groups of patients having</p><p>a) a tumor size response (SD, PR, CR) or not (PD),</p><p>b) basic education or additional education</p><p>c) one of the main tumor types defined as composing&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;= 20% of the evaluable study patients.</p><p>d) a predominant symptom, if composing&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;= 20% of the evaluable study patients (expected based on symptom epidemiology data: pain, anorexia and/or fatigue [both predominant vs. other symptoms or alone vs. other symptoms], anxiety and/or depression [both predominant vs. other symptoms or alone vs. other symptoms], nausea, shortness of breath).</p><p>e) anxiety &#x0003c;6/10 or&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;=6/10</p><p>f) complexity less than 3 symptoms above threshold vs. &#x0003e;&#x02009;=&#x02009;3 symptoms above threshold (fatigue and anorexia&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;=9/10, other symptoms&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;=6/10).</p><p>All subgroup analyses will include baseline G-QoL as covariate.</p><p>The study population will be described separately by institution (study center)-, oncologist-, and patient-related factors.</p><p>The study center will be described with regards to actual procedures of symptom and syndrome assessment at the participating institution and local available interventions for multidimensional symptom and syndrome management.</p><p>From the participating oncologists following data are collected: Gender, age, mother language, living&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;=6&#x02009;months in the language region and Board certification oncology.</p><p>The patients included will be characterized with respect to socio-demographic variables, cognition, and disease and treatment-related variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>This protocol was written, and the study is to be performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practice issued by ICH. The study has been approved by the local ethics committees of the cantons of all participating centers (Aarau, Basel, Bern, Zuerich, Fribourg, Graubuenden, St.Gallen, Ticino).

Of those, the data from 8 patients could not be used, since they were assigned to physicians who enrolled only one patient, i.e. they cannot be used to estimate within cluster correlation. At that time already 160 patients allocated to 47 physicians had been accrued. Unexpectedly a negative ICC was found. A literature search on negative ICCs only revealed that this appears in case of very similar but rather small clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. This translates to a negligible between-cluster variation and a dominant within-cluster variation which in turn is the case for very small ICCs. Then a simulation study using the design parameters of this trial and a SAS macro for power calculations (fpower.sas) was performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It seemed that an increasingly negative ICC does not diminish the power, but rather that the power increases further. Hence the sample size was not adapted for this reason.</p><p>However, during the interim analysis three problems arose regarding the sample size:</p><p>a) None of the predefined scenarios met the reality of cluster sizes accumulated in the first three years: instead, the vast majority of clusters were smaller than expected.</p><p>b) An unexpectedly high number of patients were not evaluable for primary endpoint according to the requirements specified in and implied by the protocol. Although the original protocol focused on evaluable patients, it did not foresee additional patients to be accrued to account for non-evaluable patients.</p><p>c) There were many clusters with only one or two or even no patients. These are problematic because they do not allow to properly calculating the within-cluster correlation required for the interim and final analysis. In fact, this renders patients who are evaluable of limited value for the analysis. While the trial design allows for varying and even small cluster sizes it is not clear how these very small clusters will affect the final results. Moreover, while there are approximate formulae to adjust the final sample size for varying cluster sizes, these only apply to approximate calculations which were not used during the trial development. These problems revealed from the interim analysis led to the following conclusions which were documented in a note to file:</p><p>1) 160 patients will be required, distributed to four patients per cluster with twenty clusters per treatment arm.</p><p>2) An additional five per cent, i.e. eight patients, will be accrued to account for varying cluster sizes.</p><p>3) That is, in total 168 evaluable patients will be accrued to meet the design specifications of the protocol (alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;5%, power&#x02009;=&#x02009;80%).</p><p>Because of the problems described in b) and c) even 240 accrued patients (the maximum foreseen in the protocol although there only evaluable patients were mentioned) would not have been sufficient to obtain 168 evaluable patients. Hence, it was decided by the trial team members at the SAKK CC on April 20, 2011 to accrue an additional 10 percent, i.e. 24 patients, resulting in a total of 264 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Context</title><p>Several studies assessed whether the provision of HRQL data to oncologists, using touch pad symptom assessment devices, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] by using prompt sheets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] or summaries of HRQL, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] improve communication between oncologist and patient and symptom control. The provision of a summary of HRQL (EORTC-QLQ-C30) to patients and oncologists in a randomized crossover trial resulted in more frequent discussion of HRQL issues and detection of unexpected psychosocial topics and symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Longitudinal symptom assessment by means of computers is feasible in the multicenter setting even for a long time span. In a recently published study patients were invited to report symptoms (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events CTCAE) on an online platform. Of 125 invited, 105 participated for the mean length of one year and showed a high compliance and high satisfaction with the system, however there was only a marginal effect on communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Randomized controlled trials focused mainly on improvement of communication and symptom distress. A palm based interactive tailored patient assessment, containing a selection of symptoms, problems and concerns, rating of this items from 1&#x02013;4 and prioritization for support was tested in 145 lymphoma and leukemia patients in a single centre in Norway. The assessment output was immediately delivered to treating physicians and nurses in the intervention group. The outcomes measured were the same assessments: Numbers of symptom problems and concerns addressed, change in symptom distress and need for support. In the intervention group there were more symptoms addressed, less symptom distress measured and patient were less in need for symptom management support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>A second randomized controlled trial investigated the effect of the ESRA-C (electronic self-report assessment cancer) on in 660 cancer patients at two institutions. The output from the ESRA-C was displayed to the treatment team in the intervention group. The primary outcome was the likelihood of discussion of symptoms and quality of life issues (SQLIs) between clinicians and patients and the secondary endpoints the visit duration and the perceived usefulness by clinicians. When the SQLIs were considered as problematic, they were more frequently discussed during the visit in the intervention group; the length of visit time was equal between the two groups. The clinicians perceived the output as useful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths</title><p>The strength of our approach, is the defined clinical setting, chemotherapy in palliative intention, where disease related symptoms, treatment related toxicities and clinical benefit parameters guide treatment.</p><p>In contrast to the previous studies which aimed at a general improvement of communication our study aims to improve symptom control due to more in depth symptom assessment and adaption of chemotherapy due to better monitoring of toxicity and clinical benefit parameters.</p><p>A second strength is the multicenter setting which tests the intervention in a real life environment and differences between centers can be further studied.</p><p>The main focus on specific and generic patient reported outcomes (quality of life, and symptoms) reflects patient centered care in the oncological setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>E-MO<italic><underline>S</underline></italic>AIC intervention may be effective on several levels (i.e., awareness of patient, awareness of physician, coping, symptom control, communication), this study tests the hypothesis to overall improve the quality of palliative cancer care, rather than focusing on specific outcomes only. Global single-item QoL indicators are similarly efficient as multi-item scales for overall treatment comparisons and changes over time because they reflect the summation of the individual meaning and importance of various factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The use of a single-item tool to appropriately obtain a measure of overall QoL was reported from a cooperative multicenter study setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>Patient-rated QoL may be influenced by many factors. Disease and treatment-related as well as social and cultural factors are essential for any individuals&#x02019; estimation or judgment of their QoL. Therefore we correct for known influential factors in the analysis.</p><p>The differences between the randomised physicians may have a bigger influence than the intervention, especially on communication. Patient-physician communication can affect the psychological distress and quality of life of cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Informativeness, interpersonal sensitivity, and partnership building, three dimensions of communication, are related to patient satisfaction, compliance, and medical information recall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Several elements of the patient-physician communication have been emphasized, such as recognition of patients&#x02019; main concerns related to physical but also emotional dimensions, fulfilling the patients&#x02019; individual and general information needs, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] a physician-communication style reflecting empathy, care, compassion, and understanding of patient&#x02019;s difficulties to cope, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] physicians&#x02019; ability to break bad news [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] and recognition of patients decision-making preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].</p><p>The management of common symptoms is part of oncologists&#x02019; professional skills. The Global Core Curriculum for Medical Oncology (ASCO/ESMO) includes supportive and palliative care items and the Quality Cancer Care statement of ASCO and ESMO includes pain management, supportive and palliative care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>].</p><p>A large body of evidence builds the foundation for practice guidelines in symptom management of advanced cancer patients, allowing agreed-on classifications of various types of symptom control interventions and thresholds of symptom expression. However, as in other medical disciplines, variability in symptom management practice is common, driving academic exchanges including research and scholar literature.
