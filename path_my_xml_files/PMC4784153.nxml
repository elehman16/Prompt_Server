Ariji <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] investigated the ultrasonographic features of 32 patients with inflammatory change in the masseteric region and concluded that ultrasound is an accurate modality for measuring the thickness of masseter muscle and may provide information useful in diagnosis and treatment, especially in follow-up examination. Kubota <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] investigated the thickness of the masseter muscle related to the maxillofacial morphology, including the thickness of alveolar process in the mandibular incisor region, and the thickness of the mandibular symphysis suggesting that masticatory functions influence the morphology of the mandible. Reimers <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] investigated the sonographic features of inflammatory myopathies with reference to histologic findings and confirmed that the thickness of edematous muscle was greater than that of nonedematous muscle.</p><p>An increase in masseter muscle thickness has been reported in patients with TMD,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] although the cause of thickening is not well known. In general, two possible causes are considered for increased thickness. When a muscle contracts, there occur sliding of the muscle fiber filament and an increase in the fiber diameter. Another cause would be an edematous change in the muscle.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] TMD patients usually suffer from muscle pain for a relatively long time before visiting a dental clinic or hospital. They may hold a long-term low-level contraction, which is suggested to be caused by psychologic stress or prolonged work.

This reduction in muscle pain can be attributed to the effect of TENS therapy on the electrical stimuli, pressure and touch impulses which arrive faster at the levels of the spinal cord in the substantia gelatinosa of the dorsal horn and in the higher levels of the central nervous system than the pain impulses and &#x0201c;close the gate&#x0201d; for pain impulses, resulting in a suppression of pain signals, and TENS also causes activation of endogenous analgesic systems involving opiate-like peptides, such as endorphins, thereby increasing their plasma levels.

Esposito <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] concluded that ultrasound is most successful in alleviating muscle symptoms and less effective in reducing symptoms associated with the disk. Esenyel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] concluded that the effectiveness of ultrasound therapy is comparable to trigger point injections but is considered to be noninvasive treatment of choice. Majlesi and Unalan[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] observed high-power ultrasound applied to the trigger points before stretching the muscle were more effective (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) than conventional ultrasound. The main reason is mainly due to thermal effects of Th US.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</p><p>The masseter muscle thickness significantly decreased after treatment on symptomatic sides in both the groups with no significant difference found when compared between two modalities of treatment (Th US and TENS) before and after treatment (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). The decrease in thickness suggested that the imbalance in the masticatory muscles has improved by massage treatment of Th US. Mild rhythmic muscle movements by TENS causes increased blood and lymph circulation which results in reduced interstitial edema and accumulation of noxious tissue metabolites, thereby improving the physiological state of muscle which, in turn, leads to significant reduction in muscle spasm and pain.</p><p>All these results can be due to the combined effects of TENS therapy which includes neurologic, pharmacologic, physiologic, and psychologic effects.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The anechoic areas were found to disappear or reduced in 95.6% Th US group and 74.4% in TENS group after treatment. Ariji <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] investigated the sonographic features of the masseter muscle as indices for judging the efficacy of massage treatment with an oral rehabilitation robot and reported that the thickness was significantly decreased after treatment (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), which was in accordance to our study. They concluded that the presence of anechoic area can be attributed to the thickening of the masseter muscle and the disappearance or reduction is mainly due to its action on arterial and venous blood flow, the blood clotting process, and the properties of the connective tissue and muscle. It also improves lymph drainage, restores the normal osmotic pressure of the interstitial fluid, thus reducing muscle edema.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] The internal sonographic features of the muscles would be an indicator of the pathologic state of the muscles.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>A study carried out by Ariji <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] evaluated the intramuscular echogenic band and assessed the muscle appearance into various types and found that significant difference in distribution between healthy and TMD groups existed.</p><p>Few patients in our study showed no change in anechoic area, but there was a considerable reduction on VAS score of muscle pain, impediment to daily life, and massage impression. This could be hypothesized by the fact that the muscle consists of transverse and short bands as suggested by Ariji <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] which might response to therapy in a different manner. Thus, a detailed and in-depth analysis of the study of arrangement of internal bands in the muscle should be done.</p><p>Wessberg <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] evaluated the efficacy of TENS therapy, splint, and occlusal adjustments in myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome (MPDS) patients and found 95% success rate immediately after posttreatment and 86% success rate after 1 year with TENS therapy combined with splint and occlusal therapy. Similar study reported by M&#x000f8;ystad <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] concluded that TENS is a simple, noninvasive treatment method that can be recommended to patients with rheumatic disease in periods of pain in the stomatognathic system. A study conducted by Moger <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] concluded that the TENS therapy appears to be useful in relieving pain, especially muscular and chronic pain and along with TENS therapy, placebo should also be considered as a potent and independent therapeutic modality in its own right. The observation of Rajpurohit <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] showed that MENS could be used as an effective pain-relieving adjunct to TENS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Diagnostic ultrasonography was found to be an effective means of diagnosing TMDs by using masseter muscle thickness and intramuscular sonographic appearances. Both Th US and TENS group found significantly decreased thickness in the masseter muscle after treatment on symptomatic sides and no statistically significant difference between the two groups, and improvement in intramuscular sonographic appearance (reduced or disappeared anechoic areas) after treatment was more in Th US (95.6%) as compared to TENS therapy (74.4%).</p><p>Both therapies were effective in the reduction of muscle pain after treatment, but Th US therapy showed better results with a statistically significant difference when compared with TENS therapy. The subjective improvement in the form of impediment to daily life and massage impression was effective in both therapies, but Th US appeared to be a better modality with statistically significant difference between these two therapies. There was statistically highly significant improvement in the mouth opening in both when compared between Th US and TENS groups that it showed no statistically significant difference. Thus, results from our study justify the use of Th US therapy as well as TENS therapy in the management of TMD. However, Th US therapy was subjectively better on the basis of VAS score of muscle pain, VAS score of impediment to daily life, VAS score of massage impression, and on the basis of intramuscular sonographic appearance of the masseter muscle.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no
