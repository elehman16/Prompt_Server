We report for the first time the long-term efficacy of the exercise program for patients with advanced COPD in Thailand. Here, we describe the feasibility and benefits of the intensive ergometer training program called the Suandok Exercise Training (SET) program. The aim of the present study was to determine the long-term efficacy of the SET program on various clinical parameters (respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, exercise capacity, dyspnea severity, health-related QoL [HRQoL], and survival status) of patients with advanced COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>Patients diagnosed with moderate, severe, or very severe COPD (GOLD stages II&#x02013;IV)<xref rid="b11-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> in a stable clinical condition (no exacerbation during the previous 6 weeks before being included in the study) and attending an outpatient chest clinic were enrolled. The inclusion criteria were patients aged over 40 years, ex-smokers with smoking history of &#x0003e;10 pack-years, history of exacerbation at least one time in the previous year, and willingness to follow the full course of exercise training program. Patients were excluded if they had long-term oxygen therapy, pneumonia during the previous 3 months, and cardiac disease or any other co-morbidities that limited exercise training. The study was approved by the Ethics Committees of the Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, and written informed consents were obtained from all the patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>The patients were divided into SET or control group based on their preferences. All patients had been prescribed standard medical treatment for their COPD before and throughout the study period without any changes in the regular inhaled and/or oral bronchodilator and/or inhaled corticosteroid use. Patients underwent assessments at baseline, each month during the first 3 months, and then every 3 months till 24 months post intervention. Pulmonary function tests were determined by standard spirometer (Vmax series22, Sensormedics) and reference values for a Knudson 1983. Spirometry parameters included forced vital capacity, FEV<sub>1</sub>, and the ratio of FEV<sub>1</sub> to forced vital capacity. All tests were performed post bronchodilator according to ATS/ERS guidelines.<xref rid="b12-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Exercise capacities were determined by the longest distance walk in 6 minutes (6-MWD) tested by a standard 6-minute walk test<xref rid="b13-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and endurance time measured by the longest duration self-paced walk on the treadmill. We measured patients&#x02019; HRQoL using the St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)<xref rid="b14-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and dyspnea severity using both modified Medical Research Council (mMRC)<xref rid="b15-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and baseline/transition dyspnea index (BDI/TDI).<xref rid="b16-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> We measured patients&#x02019; upper limb muscle strength using the stationary cycle ergometer (Monark, Rehab trainer 881 E, Varberg, Sweden) and lower limb muscle strength using the stationary bicycle (Monark, Ergomedic 828 E, Sweden). Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) as an indicator of inspiratory muscle strength<xref rid="b17-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> was measured by Vmax series 22, Sensormedics. Patients completed pulmonary function tests, SGRQ, mMRC, BDI/TDI, upper limb and lower limb muscle strength, MIP, and 6-MWD at baseline and every month for the first 3 months, and then every 3 months until they completed the 24-month follow-up with the exception of the endurance time test, which was performed till the 12-month follow-up.</p><p>The SET program consisted of intensive and maintenance phases. The intensive phase was fully supervised by physiotherapists and nurses who conducted 16 sessions (2 sessions per week for 8 weeks). Each session included upper and lower limb cycle ergometer exercise training. Patients were trained on both stationary arm and leg ergometers. A brief warm up period of 10&#x02013;15 minutes was performed before each training session. Instructions on correct stretching techniques and supervision of the patients throughout the entire training period were given. Exercise training during the first 2 weeks included arm and leg cycling trained for 30&#x02013;40 minutes per session at mild intensity (30%&#x02013;35% of heart rate reserve [HRR])<xref rid="b18-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and was evaluated weekly. Patients were instructed to pedal at a rate of 45&#x02013;55 revolutions per minute and were encouraged to push themselves to the limits of their dyspnea, without exceeding a scale of 6 in the rating of perceived exertion (RPE).<xref rid="b19-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Exercise sessions were increased in duration and intensity by 5 minutes and 5% of HRR alternately every 2 weeks to reach a maximum of 50&#x02013;60 minutes duration and 50%&#x02013;55% of HRR during the last 2 weeks. Heart rate and finger pulse oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were monitored continuously throughout the training period and brief pause periods were determined according to the dyspnea level (RPE =6). Patients with de-saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;90%) were trained using supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula. A cool down period of 5&#x02013;10 minutes was allowed after each training session. The maintenance phase lasted from months 3 to 24, and all patients in SET group were encouraged to continue doing their exercises at home without monitoring compliance. The control group was just encouraged to do self-exercise at home throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Study tests were performed by all patients at baseline and at month 1&#x02013;3 and then every 3 months till they completed the 24-month follow-up except for the endurance test, which was performed until the 12-month follow-up.</p><p>Upper and lower limb muscle strengths were tested by progressive incremental tests performed on a station cycle ergometer. Each patient sat on the chair in front of the arm ergometer (Monark, Rehab trainer 881 E, Sweden) or on the bicycle (Monark, Ergomedic 828 E, Sweden). Work rate was then increased by 5 watts till the patient was unable to continue cycling by arms or legs. The heaviest load was recorded.</p><p>MIP was measured as an indicator of inspiratory muscle strength using techniques described by Black and Hyatt.<xref rid="b17-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> MIP was defined as the largest negative (vacuum) sustained for 1 second against an occluded airway. Measurements were taken from residual volume. A minimum of ten maneuvers were performed for each measurement, with rest periods between maneuvers.

In our pilot study, the response within each subject group was normally distributed with standard deviation 19. The mean difference in the experimental and control groups was 22.6; we need to study 12 experimental and 12 control subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal with probability (power) 0.8. The type I error probability associated with this null hypothesis is 0.05, and anticipating a dropout rate of 20%, we planned to randomly assign 14 per group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We analyzed the results of the program in terms of changes in muscle strength, exercise capacity, degree of dyspnea, and QoL during and following the program.

Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used to compare baseline mean differences between the groups. Repeated measure analysis was applied to determine the progress of all parameters during the entire follow-up period. Mean incase imputation method was applied to estimate the missing case parameters. MCIDs were set for 6-MWD, SGRQ score, mMRC, and BDI/TDI scores.

In the follow-up period, there were 13 and 9 dropouts in the SET and control groups, respectively. The reasons for the dropout cases were that seven patients died from acute exacerbation and 15 patients dropped out from lack of motivation on follow-up visits. In the SET group, there were three fatal cases (resulting from acute exacerbation with septic shock at 15 months, with respiratory failure at 21 and 24 months) and ten cases dropped out due to lack of motivation (each one at months 3, 6, 12, 15, 18, and 21, and two cases at months 9 and 24). In the control group, there were four fatal cases (resulting from acute exacerbation with respiratory failure: two patients in month 2 and the other two patients at months 6 and 9) and five patients dropped out due to lack of motivation (each one at months 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24).

Exercise training represents the cornerstone of every pulmonary rehabilitation program.<xref rid="b24-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This study indicates definite benefits of intensive ergometer exercise training for patients with advanced COPD as compared to the patients who participated in the control group. Our study reveals that ergometer exercise training produced both clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, exercise capacity, degree of dyspnea (by BDI/TDI), and HRQoL, even though no significant effect was observed on survival outcome. Exercise intensities were started from mild-to-moderate (30%&#x02013;35% to 50%&#x02013;55% of HRR) and duration of exercise was increased from 30&#x02013;40 minutes to 50&#x02013;60 minutes per session. The guidelines of American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommended that the training intensity should be targeted at 50%&#x02013;80% of the maximal oxygen uptake or HRR for endurance exercise.<xref rid="b25-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The ACSM also advised to sustain intensity for 20&#x02013;45 minutes and to stop cycling for 2&#x02013;3 minutes during cycle ergometry when the breathlessness reaches 5&#x02013;6 RPE because interval training is well accepted and shows similar improvements in patients with severe COPD.<xref rid="b26-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Few studies have been able to demonstrate the long-term maintenance of benefits beyond 2 years<xref rid="b5-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b27-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b30-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> but our study has confirmed that most of the benefits of the SET program were well maintained throughout the 24-month follow-up.</p><p>In our study, there were statistically significant improvements in respiratory muscle, upper and lower limb muscle strengths, endurance time, and clinically and statistically significant improvements in BDI/TDI, and QoL since the first month after SET was started, except the 6-MWD, which improved one month later. Some parameters (respiratory, upper and lower limb muscle strength, BDI/TDI, and QoL) were improved throughout the study period (24-month follow-up). In addition, these parameters were continually improved for quite a long period after SET ended. Although there was clinically significant improvement in the severity of dyspnea in the patients in the SET group measured by TDI, the dyspnea score measured by mMRC did not show clinically significant improvement. Therefore, we could conclude that the change in TDI is more sensitive than mMRC for measuring the dyspnea severity. For exercise capacities, we measured both 6-MWD and endurance time. The 6-MWD started to improve clinically from month 2 and persistentally improved up to month 9. The endurance time started to significantly improve from month 1 (one month earlier than 6-MWD) and persistently improved throughout the one-year testing period (at least 3 months longer than 6-MWD). The earlier and persistently longer improvement of endurance time than the 6-MWD might indirectly reflect that endurance time is a more sensitive parameter than 6-MWD for measuring change of exercise capacity in COPD. The severity of dyspnea significantly improved both clinically and statistically as indicated by the mean change in the TDI score but not by mMRC score. Other studies have suggested that the latter, by using a rougher scale, is not sensitive enough to detect changes in patients with advanced COPD.<xref rid="b31-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> For the QoL, the patients in the SET group showed persistent improvement throughout all visits over the 2-year period. Varying results on survival were reported in previous retrospective, non-randomized survival analyses.<xref rid="b1-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b32-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Our results indicated that there was a slight but not significant difference in survival rate between the SET (89%) and the control (71%) groups. The absence of significant difference in survival rate between the SET and the control groups might be due to a small sample size, significant dropout rate, and only a 2-year follow-up. As expected, FEV<sub>1</sub> was the most significant predictor of survival. Our SET program did not affect the measures of pulmonary function that were shown in previous studies to be significant predictors of survival in patients with COPD.<xref rid="b33-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>ATS/ERS had suggested that the exercise training program should offer at least three sessions per week to achieve any physiologic benefits.<xref rid="b35-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> This was modified later to twice weekly supervised plus one unsupervised home session. Our results were contrary to those of Ringbaek et al<xref rid="b36-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> who did not find any improvement in exercise capacity while exercising twice a week for 8 weeks. The reason could be that our SET exercise program was more intensified and the patients were more deconditioned.</p><p>Although our study had benefits of training on 2-year follow-up, all outcome measurements showed peak response at month 9. These benefits, which were similar to other studies, suggested that after 9 months, the rehabilitation program should have some reinforcements after the core phase in the form of supervised periods of exercise, group sessions to discuss progress and problems, and the introduction of maintenance techniques.<xref rid="b32-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Our study had some limitations. First, the study was conducted in a single university-based center and it might not be applicable to large-scale practices, especially those that do not have specialized physiotherapists and nurses. Second, the study was not designed as a double-blinded randomized control trial with sham exercise in the control group; we had divided the patients following their preferences. The patients in SET group might have had more motivation for coping with their COPD than the control group and might have been more enthusiastic about continuing their self-exercise program after the first 2 months of the intensive supervised one. Third, our study had significantly high dropout rates in both groups. There were 19.5% versus 50% and 49.1% versus 64.3% of patients dropped out from the study by 12 months and 24 months in the SET group versus the control group, respectively. The proportion of respondents declining rehabilitation appears similar to other studies (9%&#x02013;50%).<xref rid="b37-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b40-copd-10-133" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results confirm that the SET program, as an intensive ergometer exercise, is effective for patients with advanced COPD. This program proved to be a feasible approach for improving peripheral and respiratory muscle strengths, dyspnea, and QoL up to 2 years and exercise capacity up to at least the 9-month follow-up. These promising results should encourage the health care professionals to promote exercise training for patients with advanced COPD who are prone to limit most of their daily activities despite optimal medication control.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank the patients who kindly took part in this study and to acknowledge the staff members of the Division of Pulmonary Critical Care and Allergy, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University for their contribution to this trial.
