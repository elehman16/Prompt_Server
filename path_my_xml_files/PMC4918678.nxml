However, no study has used standardized tests to determine the potential advantages of the dynamic soundfield system for normally hearing students and for the teacher's voice. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of using dynamic soundfield system on the noise of the classroom, teacher's voice and students&#x02019; academic performance. This was a prospective cohort study in which 20 student participants enrolled in the third year of basic education were divided into two groups (i.e., control and experimental); their teacher participated. The experimental group was exposed to the dynamic soundfield system for 3 consecutive months. The groups were assessed using standardized tests to evaluate their academic performance. Further, questionnaires and statements were collected on the participants&#x02019; experience of using the soundfield system. We statistically analyzed the results to compare the academic performance of the control group with that of the experimental group. In all cases, a significance level of <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05 was adopted. Use of the dynamic soundfield system was effective for improving the students&#x02019; academic performance on standardized tests for reading, improving the teacher's speech intelligibility, and reducing the teacher's vocal strain. The dynamic soundfield system minimizes the impact of noise in the classroom as demonstrated by the mensuration of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and pupil performance on standardized tests for reading and student and teacher ratings of amplification system effectiveness.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Acoustics</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>child</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>schools</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In school, children spend most of their time engaged in activities where the teacher's speech predominates. Children require more audibility and intelligible speech signal, and a quieter environment than adults to be able to discriminate words. This is because the child's brain is maturing, and it does not perform automatic cognitive tasks such as auditory closure in the same manner that an adult brain does. Therefore, in order to develop an environment conducive to learning, classrooms need acoustic management and a favorable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Proper classroom acoustics and a favorable SNR are essential for all students and for the teacher's voice. However, classroom noise levels vary according to the school and classroom.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Further, noise is considered a risk factor for alterations in the teacher's voice[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and studies suggest that the addition of noise inhibits auditory working memory processes in real time for school-age children.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Various strategies are used to improve the SNR in order to encourage the recognition of speech through noise, including the fitting of frequency modulation (FM) systems for a more in-depth reading of indications for FM systems and classroom audio distribution systems (CADSs) in the classroom.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Although originally developed for hearing-impaired children, FM systems have also been used for children with normal peripheral hearing. For this population, a favorable SNR seems to facilitate their attention to tasks as well as improve their response time; this is because when a teacher's speech becomes clearer, children exhibit a longer focus time and greater concentration on relevant sound stimuli, and ignore competitive stimuli.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The literature describes improvements in academic performance, speech recognition, learning, and increased self-esteem as the benefits of using soundfield FM equipment by children with normal hearing.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Benefits for teachers include a reduction in effort and vocal fatigue, and greater ease in teaching.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] For schools, maintaining a teacher's vocal health also means sustaining the quality of their teaching as well as reducing costs related to substitutions and treatments.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The Acoustical Society of America (ASA)[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] affirms that classrooms shall meet the noise and reverberation levels specified in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard S12.60. Further, provided that soundfield amplification systems are used in conjunction with ANSI S12.60, the ASA recognizes their usefulness for core classrooms to augment teachers&#x02019; voices as multimedia sound distribution systems. In case of moderate activity noise, the soundfield amplification system can be employed to augment the teacher's voice, especially for a quiet topic. Amplification systems should not be used in an attempt to substitute for good acoustics. To ensure their success, the ASA advocates that classroom noise levels and reverberation times be documented prior to installing soundfield amplification systems. Acoustical consultants or credentialed school audiologists properly trained and equipped may screen and document classrooms for soundfield systems.</p><p>Studies reporting on the use of FM systems in educational settings have typically used questionnaires or checklists to evaluate academic performance and the teacher's voice although a few have used standardized tests.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>The literature pointed that additional research is needed in several areas pertaining to classroom acoustics and amplification including comparisons among various soundfield technologies currently available to educators.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>This study evaluates the impact of using the digital dynamic soundfield system (that automatically increases the gain if the noise increases in the classroom) on the teacher's voice and academic performance of students&#x02019; normally hearing through standardized tests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee under protocol no. 90.685/2012. Upon having understood and agreed to the study objectives, all participants signed a free and informed consent form, granting permission for their participation in the work and the publication of any data obtained.</p><p>This study was conducted in a classroom at a private school. To determine the control and experimental groups, we considered the following inclusion and exclusion criteria for the students and the teacher: Students must be enrolled in the third year of basic education, present normal peripheral hearing, and not have any cognitive impairment. The teacher must be responsible for both shifts (i.e., morning and afternoon) for students in their third year of basic education and teach different groups of students in the same room.</p><p>Were invited to participate this study 18 students of the morning period and 19 students of the afternoon period who were regularly enrolled in the in the third year of basic education. However, 24 students&#x02019; parents gave permission for their children and 1 child did not meet the inclusion criteria; 23 children were initially included in the study but three did not perform the second assessment for personal reasons. The final sample was of 20 students.</p><p>The study included one teacher as well as 20 children of both genders with normal peripheral hearing and without cognitive impairment who were in the third year of basic education in the morning and afternoon shifts. This study included one teacher who was responsible for two different student groups, both in their third year of basic education in the morning and afternoon shifts. The teacher was 44 years of age, with a degree in Education. She has been teaching for 23 years.</p><p>All 20 children underwent a hearing evaluation involving transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions from the Otoport Lite machine (Otodynamics Ltd), and ipsilateral acoustic reflex testing by using Interacoustics Titan (Interacoustics A/S). All students presented transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions and ipsilateral acoustic reflexes that were bilaterally present. We evaluated the cognitive aspects by using the Raven Scale,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and we considered the score obtained on the test to be in accordance with the age and score for private schools. All of the children achieved a score equal to the mean scores of 27.0 and 4.5 standard derivation, or above &#x0201c;intellectually average.&#x0201d;</p><p>They were divided into the following two groups: The experimental group (morning shift) comprised 10 children with a mean age of 8 years, and their room was equipped with the dynamic soundfield system. The control group (afternoon shift) comprised 10 children with a mean age of 8 years. They were in the same school year and in the same room as the experimental group although conversely they did not use the dynamic soundfield system in the classroom.</p><p>Having the same teacher teach different classes of third year students during the morning and afternoon shifts in a single room was an optional criterion in order to minimize the variables involving acoustic and structural characteristics. The classroom was measured (3.20 m &#x000d7; 8.00 m &#x000d7; 6.50 m), and we calculated the reverberation time (Sabine RT) by using the &#x0201c;C&#x000e1;lculo do Tempo de Reverbera&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o (T60) de um ambiente [calculating the reverberation time (T60) of an environment]&#x0201d; program.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] The measurements were based on those of an office because it was the option most similar to a classroom; without acoustic treatment, the RT was 0.8 s.</p><p>The measurement of the SNR in the classroom in the experimental group was performed by a recording of three points (front, middle, and bottom), the remaining 5 min in each position, totaling 15 min. The analysis of the acoustic characteristics of the recorded material was based on the methodology called &#x0201c;sound assurance technique.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>The Phonak DigiMaster 5000 soundfield system (Phonak do Brasil &#x02013; Sistema Audiol&#x000f3;gicos LTDA) was installed in the classroom; it consists of a portable DigiMaster speaker (available with a floor stand or wall mount), an Inspiro transmitter (dynamic technology), and a microphone. Dynamic SoundField is a new generation soundfield technology with automated settings, i.e., it increases the gain if the noise increases in the classroom, and a specially designed loudspeaker array for an even distribution of the teacher's voice in the classroom.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Students&#x02019; academic performance</title><p>To evaluate reading, writing, and arithmetic skills with the academic performance test [teste de desempenho escolar (TDE)],[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and reading comprehension skills using reading comprehension here after referred to as the reading comprehension test.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] The professionals who administered the standardized tests to the children did not know if the children were in the test group or the control group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Academic performance test (teste de desempenho escolar)</title><p>The academic performance test (i.e., TDE) was designed to evaluate the basic academic skills of students from the first year through the sixth year of basic education, and comprises three subtests:</p><p>

This study evaluated the impact of soundfield systems in classrooms on abilities related to the academic performance of individuals with normal peripheral hearing.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Students&#x02019; academic performance</title><p>In this study, the mean age of the 20 participating children was 8 years; classrooms from the third year of basic education were selected because at this age children should already be literate[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and able to perform the tests proposed for assessing skills related to academic performance.</p><p>This study evaluated the repertory of basic skills, which allow the students learning of school performances expected for their series; learning of school subjects taught during the study period was not evaluated. The reasoning, which based the evaluation proposal was that for academic performance to occur, basic skills are required (writing, reading, arithmetic, reading comprehension), which can be classified more effectively through standardized tests, which allow the comparison of performances in these skills before and after the intervention.</p><p>The evaluations of abilities related to reading, writing, arithmetic, and reading comprehension were applied to basic education students in a private school. Both groups had already reached the score &#x0201c;ceiling&#x0201d; or were close to it on the first evaluation, which was performed before use of the dynamic soundfield system.</p><p>For the academic performance test (i.e., TDE), the experimental group showed a significant improvement in reading between the first and second evaluations, and in comparison the evaluations was statistically significant in both groups for TDE (arithmetic and total), and no significant difference emerged in the comparison between the groups for the values obtained on TDE (writing, arithmetic, reading and total; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This may have been a factor influencing the nonoccurrence of significant differences between the groups evaluations, with the exception of the TDE results on the reading subtest.</p><p>In the reading comprehension test, before the reading, the students showed interest but only partial concentration, asking few questions. They showed interest during silent reading, and they occasionally requested clarifications regarding the pronunciation. Most of the students neither made any comments on what they were reading and nor did they ask any question. During oral reading, they generally complied with the rules of punctuation. All of the children showed an adequate understanding of the text before and after use of the dynamic soundfield system.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows a significant difference only for the time of oral reading between the first and second evaluations on the reading comprehension test for both the groups, corroborating the findings of another study.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] There was no statistically significant difference between the groups but numerically analyzing the time spent by both groups on the two evaluations shows that the experimental group reduced, on an average, the time of their silent reading by 18.9 s and the time of their oral reading by 26.6 s. The control group reduced the two tasks by 19.2 s and 22.1 s, respectively [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><p>In this study, it was possible to observe an improvement in reading by student groups in an amplified classroom, which does not occur with the control group. In previous studies, the academic progress of students was compared in grade four through grade six in the classroom amplified and unamplified. The results indicated that the greatest academic improvements were demonstrated by the students with amplification in classrooms, and these students were also achieving a faster rate on the reading assessment.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] In other study that compared the results of standardized tests of students in first grade through fifth grade, and in classrooms with amplification, the students had better scores on the reading assessment test and in reading fluency than students who did not use the amplified system in classrooms.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>It is noteworthy that the learning process is a multifactorial phenomenon (that depends on factors such as nutrition, sleep, motivation, family support, pedagogical method, extracurricular tasks, and activities, teacher-student relationship) and longitudinal. So it is expected that during the school years, the student acquires an increasingly wider academic repertoire. Although some studies suggest the importance of these factors in learning, it would be valuable to investigate some other variables, which are rare or do not appear in the literature; one example could be the influence of the period in which the child attends school in the learning performance. For a better understanding of this subject, future research should verify the correlation between these factors with and without the use of the amplification system in the classroom.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Questionnaires and statements</title><p>The latest ANSI S12.60[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] international standard on the optimal values &#x0200b;&#x0200b;of noise and reverberation for schools recommends an RT of up to 0.6 s for a classroom of up to 283 m<sup>3</sup>, and 35 dB for the noise level. In the classroom chosen for this study, these values were higher with an RT of 0.8 s.

The second application of the questionnaire causes decreases in the Hawthorne effect (when subjects are observed by researchers, they could temporarily change behavior) because the teacher did not have have access to the answers of the first questionnaire, as well as students of their questionnaires. In addition, teachers and students did not know what the expected &#x0201c;correct&#x0201d; answer was to improve their results.</p><p>In the present study, the portable DigiMaster speaker (i.e., the transmitter) was attached to the wall at the front of the room in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions for the proper distribution of sound. However, the American Academy of Audiology (AAA) Clinical Practice Guidelines: Remote Microphone Hearing Assistance Technologies for Children and Youth from Birth to 21 Years states that whereas the benefits of listening within the critical distance of the sound source have already been well-established, research showing the impact of hearing at shorter distances is still required.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</p><p>In a pilot study, the author evaluated the number of words recorded through language environment analysis (LENA) during 1 schoolday, with and without the use of a soundfield system, and he found that the number of intelligible words spoken by an adult (teacher) increased by 5,000 units with an amplified classroom compared with 1 day when the machine was switched off, and he noted that whereas the teacher did not speak 5,000 additional words, the students were exposed to 5,000 additional intelligible words.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> presents the results of the questionnaire on the teacher's experience with the dynamic soundfield system.
