GIP also reportedly increased glucose uptake and inhibition of lipolysis in adipocytes after inhibition of the intracellular cortisone-cortisol shuttle 11&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11&#x003b2;-HSD1). We here analyzed whether GIP modifies lipid metabolism and further elucidated the relation between GIP, 11&#x003b2;-HSD1, and fatty acid metabolism. GIP reduced activity of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 promoter constructs and the expression and activity of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. This was paralleled by a reduction of free fatty acid (FFA) release and a reduced expression of key enzymes regulating lipolysis in adipose tissue. Preinhibition of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 completely abolished GIP-induced effects on FFA release. To investigate the acute effects of GIP in humans, a randomized clinical trial was performed. GIP lowered circulating FFAs compared with saline control and reduced expression and ex vivo activity of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 and adipose triglyceride lipase expression in subcutaneous fat biopsies. Our data suggest that GIP reduces FFA release from adipose tissue by inhibition of lipolysis or by increased reesterification. This process appears to depend on a modification of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 activity. In general, the presented data support that GIP has direct and insulin-independent effects on adipose tissue.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Postprandial metabolism is characterized by increased glucose uptake and inhibition of lipolysis. Both traits are predominantly mediated by peripheral effects of insulin. Numerous trials have established that incretins, namely, glucagon-like polypeptide 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), improve glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. However, recent studies also describe regulatory functions in many extrapancreatic tissues as insulin-independent effects of those hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Thus, long-term inactivation of GIP signaling in GIP receptor (GIPR) knockout mice resulted in animals resistant to high fat diet&#x02013;induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), and GIPR antagonism reversed obesity, insulin resistance, and associated metabolic disturbances in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). An upregulation of the GIPR has been demonstrated during differentiation of adipocytes, and an improved glucose uptake in GIP-treated adipocytes has been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In comparison, an inhibition of lipolysis was demonstrated in vitro in adipocytes after exposure to GIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), and very recent human in vivo data support this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Asmar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) have suggested that GIP enhanced reesterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) under hyperinsulinemic, high-glycemic conditions in eight healthy and lean male subjects. Of interest, some reports demonstrate that obese individuals have elevated GIP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). We therefore speculated that GIP might affect the basal lipolysis in obese individuals. Although not yet understood in detail, existing results suggest that peripheral GIP effects may contribute to the switch to anabolic metabolism in the postprandial situation independent of its insulinotropic effects. Although GIP-induced intracellular mechanisms in &#x003b2;-cells are increasingly well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), the mechanisms of GIP-induced inhibition of lipolysis under basal conditions are less clear.</p><p>11&#x003b2;-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11&#x003b2;-HSD1) has been identified as a central hormonal mechanism in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The enzyme is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue and hepatocytes and converts inactive 11-ketoglucocorticoids to the functionally active 11&#x003b2;-hydroxy derivates. Very similar to GIPR KO mice, 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 gene knockout mice exhibited improved glucose tolerance, reduced weight gain, and reduced fat accumulation in visceral fat depots under a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Selective 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 inhibitors lowered blood glucose levels and improved insulin sensitivity in mouse models of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In contrast, the fat-specific overexpression of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 resulted in a phenotype comparable to metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that the insulin-independent effects of GIP might contribute to the postprandial fine-tuning of metabolism via an acute suppression of fat-specific 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 activity.</p><sec id="s2"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3"><title>Cell culture and promoter constructs.</title><p>Procedures inducing differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and luciferase reporter plasmids containing the human 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 gene promoter were published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).

An inhibition of FFA release was demonstrated in vitro in primary rat adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). This and another study demonstrated an increased glycerol release under GIP exposure, suggesting that an increased reesterification of FFAs rather than an inhibition of lipolysis may be induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). This finding is supported by in vivo studies, which reveal reduced circulating FFAs during GIP treatment in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Glucocorticoids and increased 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 activity have been shown to increase lipolysis in subcutaneous adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Vice versa, an inhibition of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 reduced lipolysis, suggesting that the GIP-induced inhibition of FFA release may be mediated by a reduction of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 activity.</p><p>We found a GIP-induced inhibition of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 promoter constructs in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. The data were consistent with a model of at least one element within the proximal 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 promoter being responsive to GIP-mediated repression, although additional GIP response elements in more distal regions upstream of the transcription start may exist. In silico analysis of the 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 promoter revealed putative CREB2 and C/EBP binding sites in the proximal 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 promoter region, and recent data support that CREB2 is involved in GIP-induced lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Mutation of these binding sites abolished GIP effects, suggesting that these transcription factors may be involved in GIP-induced suppression of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 expression. It is notable that the promoter constructs used here contain the human promoter, whereas the experiments were performed in a murine cell line, which may have influenced results.</p><p>We next found a GIP-induced decrease of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 gene expression and enzyme activity in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. GIP and both a pharmacological and an siRNA-induced inhibition of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 reduced FFA release in vitro in 3T3-L1 cells, whereas the intake of FFAs was not affected. These findings would be consistent with an inhibition of lipolysis or an increased reesterification rate of intracellular FFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Our data cannot conclusively differentiate between those mechanisms. Although the changes of enzymes involved in lipolysis (ATGL and HSL) in 3T3-L1 and subcutaneous fat biopsies may support a changed rate of lipolysis (but not directly demonstrate it), the unchanged circulating glycerol levels may argue against this and support more pronounced effects on reesterification. Of note, two previous studies demonstrate an increased glycerol release under GIP exposure, which, however, was found only at supraphysiological GIP concentrations, whereas no effect on glycerol release was described at concentrations comparable to those used in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). ATGL and HSL, two central enzymes regulating lipolytic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), were reduced by both GIP and inhibition of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1, supporting that GIP and 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 directly interfere with lipolytic pathways. We next analyzed whether those two pathways are functionally linked. Pharmacological preinhibition and siRNA-based knockdown of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 abolished further effects of GIP on lipolysis. These data provide evidence that the GIP-induced inhibition of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 has physiological relevance by mediating the inhibitory effects of GIP on FFA release in adipose tissue. 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 has been shown to affect the conversion of cortisone to cortisol, and intracellular cortisol availability is therefore likely to contribute to the described effects. However, we did not directly measure the intracellular cortisol concentration and, therefore, cannot completely exclude that other 11&#x003b2;-HSD1&#x02013;associated effects may contribute to our observations. Although a widely used model of adipocyte biology, 3T3-L1 cells are functionally not directly comparable to the functionality of human adipocytes, which may also limit interpretation of our results. It is notable that all observed findings occurred relatively quickly. In fact, we believe that our results do not demonstrate that the downregulation of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 mRNA is mandatory for the fast effects on FFA release, whereas reduced HSD1 activity appears to be crucial. The rather fast changes may be induced by protein modification or by regulation of cofactor availability and potentially prolonged changes based on the observed mRNA changes. A second model might explain the fast response by fast mRNA changes and a high protein turnover, although this was not investigated in our study. Finally, early changes of other hormones (i.e., insulin secretion) might also contribute to the post-GIP changes of lipolysis within the clinical trial. Although we found no formally significant early insulin changes, we cannot exclude such a mechanism, considering that we did not measure insulin at very early time points. Although not depicted in our study, such changes may influence subsequent FFA release.</p><p>To support the existence of the effects in humans presented herein, a controlled crossover trial investigating the effects of an acute elevation of GIP on fatty acid metabolism and adipose tissue gene expression was used. This trial was performed under euglycemic and normoinsulinemic conditions. Thus, this study did not aim to mirror the postprandial situation, which is characterized by changes of various hormones, making the identification of GIP-specific effects difficult. Nevertheless, the circulating GIP concentrations induced by GIP infusion and the time period of infusion (4 h) were comparable to conditions found in a postprandial situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Indeed, FFAs were time-dependently reduced during GIP infusion compared with saline. This clinical finding directly supports the in vitro data from our and other groups and recent results from other human trials. Specifically, the elegant studies by Asmar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) are supported by the findings presented here, although the studies differ to some extent; Asmar et al. did not describe differences in fatty acid metabolism under euglycemia, which may be partially explained by different patient&#x02019;s characteristics. Obese or older individuals may show different responses to circulating GIP-respective adipose tissue metabolism, and we recently described that metabolic actions of GIP in mice vary significantly with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The data of Asmar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) support that reesterification may be a relevant mechanism linking GIP and fatty acid metabolism. Accordingly, no significant differences of glycerol were found in our human trial. We nevertheless show that ATGL and HSL expression is modified by GIP. Although changes at the protein level may not be realistic within the time frame analyzed here, we also found a GIP-induced reduction of a Ser565 phosphorylation of HSL under rather high GIP concentrations in 3T3-L1 cells. Therefore, a differential phosphorylation mechanism may potentially link GIP and regulation of lipolysis. These data suggest that both mechanisms, reesterification and lipolytic pathways, may be relevant in the GIP-dependent regulation of fatty acid metabolism.</p><p>Given the in vitro data presented herein, which suggests a functional link between GIP and 11&#x003b2;-HSD1, we next analyzed potential effects on 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 in subcutaneous fat tissue biopsies. GIP induced a reduction of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 expression and enzyme activity ex vivo, which supports that the mechanism demonstrated in vitro may be comparably relevant in humans in vivo. These findings add novel perspectives to the potential value of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 inhibition because this is, to our knowledge, the first set of data directly linking the incretin-based regulation of peripheral tissue metabolism and 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 under basal conditions.</p><p>Although the comparable data of in vitro studies and a human randomized controlled trial strengthen the presented results, some limitations need to be considered. The physiological relevance of our data in the postprandial situation was not analyzed in our study. A previous report demonstrates that obese individuals have elevated GIP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), which supports that our findings are likely to have physiological relevance in the fasting situation. Only obese males were investigated, and it is unclear whether the findings can be transferred to women or lean individuals. Other hormonal systems (e.g., estrogens) may have considerable effects on the regulation of lipolysis, making a generalization of the presented results difficult. A reduced 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 expression and activity was found ex vivo in subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies of the clinical trial. However, the biopsies were not further separated into adipocytes and a stromal vascular fraction. Although the finding of comparable modifications in 3T3-L1 adipocytes supports that the demonstrated effects in human biopsies are likely to result from changes in adipocytes, effects on other cell types, such as vasculature or macrophages, cannot be excluded. Some of the mentioned limitations may be sufficiently addressed in rodent experiments (e.g., with mice having a fat-specific 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 knockout), which therefore would be highly desirable to further improve our understanding of GIP-dependent peripheral effects. Finally, all of our data are based on short-term exposure to GIP. There is considerable evidence that hormonal short-term effects may affect physiological end points, which are opposing those later observed in long-term trials. Therefore, a definitive answer to the question of whether GIP should be enhanced or blocked to prevent or treat metabolic syndrome remains elusive and cannot be answered by the data presented.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate within a randomized controlled human crossover trial that the incretin hormone GIP lowers circulating FFAs in obese men and has direct effects on 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 and ATGL expression and 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 enzyme activity in human adipose tissue. Considering the provided in vitro data, the observed effects most likely reflect a GIP-induced modification of fatty acid metabolism in an 11&#x003b2;-HSD1&#x02013;dependent fashion.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
