The midshaft is the most frequently affected site, encompassing 69&#x02013;82% of all clavicle fractures, and most fractures that occur in the midshaft are displaced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Midshaft clavicle fractures (MSCFs) in adults have traditionally been treated nonoperatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, displaced or comminuted fractures carry a risk of symptomatic malunion, nonunion, and poor functional outcome with cosmetic deformity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Recent studies have reported a rate of nonunion of 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] following nonsurgical intervention. Early surgical intervention of MSCFs has resulted in improved outcomes and a decreased rate of nonunion and symptomatic malunion compared with nonoperative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the optimal treatment for isolated acute displaced MSCF remains controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Operative treatment of displaced MSCFs can be achieved successfully using plates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] or intramedullary (IM) implants like Rush pins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], Kirschner wires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], or nails [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, the use of the later rigid IM implants resulted in serious complications, such as intrathoracic migration and damage to the underlying structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Recently, Jubel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] introduced a new IM nailing technique in which a single titanium elastic nail (TEN) is inserted in an antegrade manner from the sternal end of the clavicle to fix those fractures. He reported fewer complications and a higher rate of fracture healing than those previously reported with the use of rigid IM implants. Rehm et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] treated 136 displaced MSCFs successfully using the same antegrade fixation technique with a single TEN. However, a risk of iatrogenic perforation of the lateral cortex in 5 patients was reported.</p><p>This prospective randomized study was designed to assess the effectiveness of minimally invasive retrograde titanium elastic nailing (RTEN) for the treatment of displaced MSCFs, and to compare its outcome with that of a standard anteroinferior plating technique.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study was approved by the local ethical committee and performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2000.

A minimal amount of soft tissue and periosteum is then released. The medial fragment is grasped with small bone holding forceps and lifted out of the wound. A drill bit with a diameter that is similar to that of the proposed nail diameter is inserted inside the medullary canal of the medial fragment, pointing slightly anteriorly to penetrate the anterior cortex. When the tip of the drill bit is felt beneath the skin, another tiny skin incision is made over it (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The nail, which is fixed to a universal chuck with a T-handle, is passed retrograde across the fracture into the predrilled medullary canal under fluoroscopic control and allowed to exit from the medial incision (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). The protruded end is grasped again by a universal chuck and the nail is pulled medially until clear of the fracture, which is then reduced (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c).

Therefore, a selective surgical treatment for a midclavicular fracture is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>In a recent randomized, prospective study in which nonoperative treatment of displaced midshaft clavicular fractures was compared with plate fixation, patients in the operative fixation group had significantly better functional outcomes, a lower rate of nonunion, and a lower incidence of symptomatic malunion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Most complications in the operative fixation group were hardware related.</p><p>Currently, plate fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and IM titanium elastic nailing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] are the available methods for the treatment of severely displaced MSCFs. The options for plate location are anteroinferior and superior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The theoretical advantages of anteroinferior plating include less hardware prominence and the ability of the surgeon to direct instrumentation away from infraclavicular neurovascular structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In this study, anteroinferior plating was compared with retrograde IM nailing for displaced MSCFs in adults.</p><p>The reported 31% risk of unsatisfactory results following nonoperative treatment in the Hill et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] was reduced in this study to 2/38 (5.3%) as a result of surgical intervention. The 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] risk of nonunion in that study was also reduced to 2.6% in ours as a result of surgical intervention in both groups in this study.</p><p>Comparing the results of plating in this study with those reported in the literature, infection was found in one (5.5%), while the reported rates in the literature range from 0 to 18% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, infection was eventually controlled after plate removal in the eleventh month when X-rays showed evidence of bone union.</p><p>The results of plating compared favorably with those reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Satisfactory results were obtained in 17 patients (89.5%) and unsatisfactory results in 2 (10.5%); nonunion was observed in one, and persistence of infection with implant loosening in another one. In the former, bone grafting was carried out in the presence of the implant, and in the latter, removal of the implant and surgical wound debridement was required to control infection. In both cases, bone union was achieved 3&#x000a0;months later.</p><p>The reported incidence of refracture following plate removal ranged from 0 to 8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In this study, after the final follow-up, refracture occurred in one female obese patient who fell following plate removal. Fortunately, the fracture was undisplaced and no surgical intervention was required until the fracture had healed.</p><p>The use of the anteroinferior site for the 3.5&#x000a0;mm reconstruction plating allowed adequate fixation of the lateral fragment. This was facilitated by its easier contouring to fit the S shape of the clavicle than for other plates, thereby providing maximum fracture stability. The technique provides stable fixation, avoids risk to the vital structures below the clavicle, and has a low rate of implant prominence and low incidences of nonunion and implant failure.</p><p>The large wound size and extensive soft tissue stripping required for plate fixation and removal are disadvantages of plating techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In this study, the removal of plates necessitated new admissions, general anesthesia, and another large-sized incision, while nail removal was performed as an OPD under local anesthesia with minimal sedation and a tiny incision over the tip of the nail.</p><p>Intramedullary fixation is an attractive alternative that is much less invasive and avoids most of the problems encountered with plating. The clavicle, which is similar to other long bones, is usually best treated with IM methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Because of anatomic features of the clavicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], devices for IM fixation need to be flexible. Aside from the need for flexibility, the implant diameter needs to be small enough to enable its passage through the medullary space, which is narrow, especially in the middle third of the clavicle. Both its elasticity and small diameter mean that IM positioning is ideal and provides good stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In this study, the nail diameters required for fixation were the 2.5&#x000a0;mm and the 3&#x000a0;mm, and these resulted in perfect adaptation to the complex anatomical shape of the clavicle with good stability. It has been clearly shown that RTEN fixation provides stable fixation and allows an earlier return to normal activities, as well as complete bone healing in all cases without major complications, in contrast with plate fixation. The present RTEN technique allowed the tip of the bent cut end of the nail to migrate only subcutaneously during the course of bone healing. Prominence of the tip of the nail occurred in 3 cases after the bone had healed, and the nails were removed under local infiltration anesthesia as an OPD procedure. This minimally invasive technique provides less soft tissue stripping than the plating technique and results in good biological fracture healing.</p><p>Both the anteroinferior plating and IM RTEN fixation techniques are equally effective for the treatment of acute displaced mid-shaft clavicular fractures. However, the present RTEN technique is simpler and quicker, is minimally invasive with less soft tissue injury, requires a shorter operating time, involves less blood loss, results in a shorter hospital stay, leads to faster bone union with 100% union rate, allows an earlier return to normal activities, and produces an excellent cosmetic outcome. In addition, if the implant needs to be removed, this is done under local anesthesia, with a tiny skin incision made over the tip of the nail.</p><p>The RTEN technique is recommended for the fixation of displaced mid-shaft clavicular fractures, especially for young active individuals or heavy manual laborers. It can be used as an alternative to conservative treatment or plate fixation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None.</p><p><bold>Open Access</bold> This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits any use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ali</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name><name><surname>Lucas</surname><given-names>HK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Plating of fractures of the middle third of the clavicle</article-title><source>Injury</source><year>1978</year><volume>9</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>263</fpage><lpage>267</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">649185</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bostman</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Manninen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Pihlajam&#x000e4;ki</surname><given-names>HH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Complications of plate fixation in fresh displaced midclavicular fractures</article-title><source>J Trauma</source><year>1997</year><volume>43</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>778</fpage><lpage>783</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1097/00005373-199711000-00008</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9390489</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Canadian Orthopaedic Trauma Society (2007) Nonoperative treatment compared with plate fixation of displaced midshaft clavicular fractures.
