Short effect lipid-soluble opioids such as fentanyl and sufentanil lead to anesthesia and painless during operation and morphine can create postsurgery painless; however, administration of intrathecal opioids have some effects that in case of lack of treatment can be unpleasant for patient. Its three prevalent effects are urinary retention, pruritus, nausea, and vomiting. Pruritus happens in 60&#x02013;100% of cases[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and is the most prevalent effect of intrathecal opioids[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and usually it happens in the middle part of face and nose and above breast.</p><p>Various drugs have been recommended for control of pruritus and have been investigated in various studies. Naloxone is the most effective treatment for pruritus even in severe cases, but it can reverse the analgesic effect of opioid.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Hence, treatment with most effective drugs with no effect on the analgesic effect is more practical and safe to use.</p><p>Since one of the reasons for pruritus is activation of central receptor of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor type 3 (5-HT<sub>3</sub>). Ondansetron that is selective and strong controller of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor can be effective in removing pruritus. Although the reason of pruritus due to intrathecal opioids is unknown, it seems that it is independent of release of histamine.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Some researchers have concluded that pruritus is due to disturbance of the sensational receptors due to dispersion of opioids in cerebrospinal fluid and effect on the nucleus of trigeminal or sub-nucleus caudalis.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Neural pathways of pruritus interfere with pain pathways. Thus, when the pain is controlled, pruritus also would disappear. Serotoninergic system plays some modification role in neuron network. Spinal cord dorsal horn and the trigeminal nerve of spinal cord are controlled by 5-HT<sub>3</sub>. On the other hand, it is proved that intrathecal morphine leads to pruritus by activation of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors through the mechanism independent on opioids receptors. Thus, by prescription of antagonist of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor, it is possible to control pruritus.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In addition, propofol leads to depression of anterior and posterior spinal cord in animal studies. Thus, it seems that propofol applies its anti-pruritus effect through depression of anterior and posterior spinal cord.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>George <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] have considered the use of antagonists of receptor 5-HT<sub>3</sub> as prophylactic in control of pruritus and this has been proved in Ben-David <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] studies. In Ben-David <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] the therapeutic effect of 4 mg and 8 mg ondansetron in control of pruritus due to intrathecal opioids has been proved.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] On the other hand, Borgeat <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] explained that sub-hypnotic propofol dose is effective in control and treatment of pruritus due to intrathecal opioids; however, there is no study comparing the effect of these two drugs, that is, ondansetron (antagonist of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor) and propofol. Thus, we conducted this prospective, double-blind, randomized study to compare the effect of these two drugs on pruritus in pregnant women under elective cesarean surgery with spinal anesthesia with intrathecal sufentanil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This randomized, double-blind trial study was approved by an Institutional Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.

The severity of pruritus was divided into 4 degrees (without pruritus, and mild, moderate, and severe pruritus), whereas 3 and 4 were treated.</p><p>The incidence of pruritus was evaluated by the anesthesiologist every 15 min until discharging from recovery unit. The ondansetrone group was treated by 8 mg ondansetron, and the propofol group was treated by 10 mg propofol, and if the itching was not disappeared, two doses of the drug repeated again. If we had no responding to the above drugs, it was defined as unsuccessful treatment and divided doses of naloxone (40 &#x003bc;g) was administered.</p><p>In cases of any side effect after injection of the drug, the required actions were taken and registered. Furthermore, in case of hypotension &#x0003c;20% of base limit after spinal anesthesia, 5 mg ephedrine was injected and in case of bradycardia &#x0003c;25% of base limit after performing spinal anesthesia, 0.5 mg atropine was injected.</p><p>Data were analyzed by SPSS version 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Unfortunately, naloxone as the most effective treatment for this disturbed symptom can remove the analgesic effect of intrathecal opioids.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>This study demonstrated the incidence of pruritus 69.3% with peak time of 30&#x02013;75 min after spinal anesthesia that consistent with other studies.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] They showed the incidence of pruritus with intrathecal sufentanil was 45&#x02013;95% intraoperative and in the postoperative period; however, no significant difference was observed generally between two groups. Although other studies[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] indicate the effect of ondansetron in the prevention of pruritus, in our study, ondansetron had treating effect the same as propofol. In Ronald's study, the positive effect of ondansetron and in Borgeat's <italic>et al</italic>., study, the positive effect of propofol in treatment of pruritus has been supported.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Thus, concerning the obtained results, it can be concluded that both ondansetron and propofol had a similar effect in the treatment of pruritus in patients under intrathecal sufentanil. In the clinical condition, both of these drugs are safe and well-tolerated.</p><p>In Beilin <italic>et al</italic>., study,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] they showed that sub-hypnotic dose of propofol do not relieve the intrathecal opioids induced pruritus, but we investigated that it had the same efficacy in treatment of pruritus with ondansetron as the other investigations.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>There were several limitations in this study design and conclusions. First, pruritus is a subjective symptom, so the sensation of severity can be different between individuals. Second, we have not studied the dose-response of antipruritic activity of two drugs to determine the optimal dose. Third, our results can only be applied to postpartum women.</p><p>Moreover, the incidence of pruritus in parturient likely depends on factors such as high dose of sufentanil and lower dose of ondansetron and propofol in patients. Since the incidence of pruritus during operation and after it, is a disturbing symptom for patients, it is required to carry out wider studies with higher sample size and different doses of ondansetron proportionate to the sufentanil to be used. Furthermore, the probability of combined use of ondansetron and propofol and the effect of their synergy should be investigated.</p><p>In conclusion, intravenous ondansetron and propofol are both effective in the treatment of moderate to severe pruritus-induced intrathecal sufentanil in obstetric patients. Side effects after treatment are too mild that are negligible. Therefore, instead of naloxone, in clinical practice especially for parturient undergone cesarean delivery, propofol and ondansetron can use for pruritus due to intrathecal sufentanil.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>Dr. Hirmanpour has selected the title, cooperated in preparing proposal and collected the samples and written the manuscript.
