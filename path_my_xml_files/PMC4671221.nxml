This paper presents the rationale and methods of an intervention program focused on promoting active and healthy lifestyles (especially physical activity [PA] practice and reducing screen time) among Brazilian students-the <italic>Fortale&#x000e7;a sua Sa&#x000fa;de</italic> program (Portuguese for &#x0201c;strengthen your health&#x0201d;).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a school-based cluster-randomized controlled trial. Three intervention and three control (no intervention) full-time public schools were randomly selected in Fortaleza, northeastern Brazil. Students (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,272) from classes in Grades 7&#x02013;9 were eligible, and 1,085 (548 in the intervention and 537 in control schools) completed the baseline and follow-up measures. The program duration was approximately four months and took place in 2014. Intervention strategies focused on teacher training, activities on health in the curriculum, active opportunities in the school environment (the availability of equipment for PA), and health education (health materials for students and parents). Data collection was undertaken before and immediately after the intervention. The primary variables included the practice of PA (weekly PA volume, PA behavior change stage and preference for PA during leisure-time) and screen time (TV and computer/video games). Potential intrapersonal, interpersonal and environmental mediators of PA and screen time were evaluated by a standardized questionnaire. Other lifestyle components (e.g., eating habits, substance use), psychological (e.g., self-rated health, body satisfaction) and biological (general and abdominal obesity) aspects, as well as academic performance were also evaluated in the total sample. Depressive symptoms, eating disorders, sleep quality, objectively-measured PA, and sedentary time were evaluated in obese students.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>If effective, this program will contribute to the development of public policies for the promotion of active and healthy lifestyles in youth, especially those from low- and middle-income countries. The main intrapersonal, interpersonal and/or environmental mediators of PA and screen time may also be indicated. Finally, we anticipate that the proposed strategies may be adaptable to public schools and may even be extended to the entire school system.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.Gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02439827?term=NCT02439827&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02439827</ext-link>.

However, a focus on the early years has been employed due to the potential present and future health impact on the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Although the benefits of active and healthy lifestyles are widely reported, few young people lead an active lifestyle. International data estimates that only two out of ten adolescents meet the PA recommendations (300&#x000a0;min or more of moderate to vigorous PA per week) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In Brazil, the proportion of students who met this recommendation fell from 43.1&#x000a0;% in 2009 to 30.1&#x000a0;% in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Additionally, other unhealthy lifestyle factors are common among young people (e.g., excessive screen time and inadequate eating) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, interventions focused on promoting active and healthy lifestyles in young people are a public health priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Systematic reviews have summarized the evidence of interventions that aimed to promote PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and reduce sedentary behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] among young people. Important implications can be identified from these reviews. First, in general, interventions had modest effect on behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Second, multicomponent programs (i.e., strategies focused on different settings and individuals from the school, the family and/or the community) had more promising results on the promotion of active lifestyles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Third, the school seems to be an appropriate setting for many of the intervention strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Finally, the effectiveness of programs on PA and on sedentary behavior-related variables (e.g., risks and benefits, self-efficacy, social support, environmental perceptions), and how these variables (i.e., mediating variables) explain active lifestyle changes among adolescents has been little explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Specifically, systematic reviews have highlighted that interventions focused on mediating variables and how they work are still scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For example, Van Stralen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] found 18 interventions on mediators of PA, but most of the potential intrapersonal (e.g., knowledge, self-efficacy), interpersonal (e.g., social support, peer and family model) and environmental (e.g., perception and environmental characteristics) mediators associated with PA remained largely unexplored. Evidence on the mediators of reducing sedentary behavior among young people is even more limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>An intervention program that sought to fill the gaps was the Transform-Us! program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This intervention was carried out in 2011 and 2012 for a period of 18&#x000a0;months and involved almost six hundred 8 to 9&#x000a0;year-old children from Melbourne, Australia. The intervention activities were multicomponent, including changes in physical education (PE) classes, reducing uninterrupted sedentary time and promoting health education in school. Intrapersonal, interpersonal and environmental factors related to PA and screen time were measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Results from the Transform-Us! program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] revealed important evidence of the role played by the perceived school environment and perceived social support from teachers as mediators of PA changes among children over time. However, it is questionable whether such results would similarly occur among adolescents given the fact that they have physical, psychological and social peculiarities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Additionally, the Transform-Us! program and most of the evidence from systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] are of high-income countries. Sociocultural and structural distinctions between countries allow exploration of whether the effectiveness of interventions promoting active lifestyle and their mediators occur similarly among low-and middle-income youth populations, such as in Brazil. Considering that most of the world&#x02019;s population lives in these types of countries (see the World Bank&#x02019;s population estimates at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldbank.org/depweb">www.worldbank.org/depweb</ext-link>), interventions in these contexts are essential in order to know what adjustments and variables are necessary for an effective promotion of active and healthy lifestyles among young people in these sociocultural situations.</p><p>Based on these assumptions, this paper presents the rationale and methods of a cluster-randomized controlled trial aiming to promote active and healthy lifestyles among Brazilian students. This program was entitled <italic>Fortale&#x000e7;a sua Sa&#x000fa;de</italic> (Portuguese for &#x0201c;strengthen your health&#x0201d;) and included students from elementary full-time public schools (Grades 7&#x02013;9) from a municipality in northeastern Brazil.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Rationale</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Why investigate adolescents?</title><p>Adolescence &#x02014; a life stage that includes those aged from 10 to 19 &#x02014; makes an outstanding contribution to the individual&#x02019;s current and future health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. During this period significant biological change that can affect an individual&#x02019;s health status occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], as well as psychological and social formation related to the adoption of risk or healthy behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Four main reasons explain why adolescence is a period of great interest for lifestyle studies. First, although cardiovascular disease is more common in later stages of life, the internal processes of these diseases may begin in childhood and adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Second, this life stage is characterized by great vulnerability to environmental factors such as the influence of the media, friends, school and the community, impacting positively or negatively on options for health behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Third, many of the behaviors established during adolescence tend to be retained in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Finally, some behaviors in adolescence potentially impact on health in the early stages of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and contribute to further health problems in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Despite the importance of a healthy lifestyle and the dissemination of such messages in the community and wider media, data from 105 countries shows that eight out of ten 13 to 15&#x000a0;year-old students do not meet the PA recommendations and seven out of ten students spend two hours or more each day watching television [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In Brazil, the proportion of adolescents who fail to meet the PA recommendations and who watch television for two or more hours each day is about 70&#x000a0;% and 80&#x000a0;%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, regional and national strategies that seek to promote an active and healthy lifestyle at this life stage are critical.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Why investigate full-time schools in Brazil?</title><p>In general, the length of the school day in the Brazilian school model is based on classes that take place during a single period (morning, afternoon or evening separately). In terms of the curricular structure, the disciplines are based on national curriculum guidelines that include, for example, Portuguese, mathematics, science, physical education, foreign languages, and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In 2007, the Health and Education Ministries created a national program entitled <italic>Programa Sa&#x000fa;de na Escola (</italic>PSE, Federal Decree No. 6286) that aims to provide comprehensive (i.e., extending the time and educational support) prevention, health promotion, and care for children and adolescents who attend schools in the public education system.</p><p>Some schools with the PSE are full-time schools. In these schools, the day begins at 7.30&#x000a0;am and closes at 4.00&#x000a0;pm, with two 20-min breaks and a lunchtime (from 11.30&#x000a0;am to 12.55&#x000a0;pm). Within the school curriculum, there is a mixture of previously mentioned disciplines from the national curricular base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and full-time school-specific disciplines (e.g., &#x0201c;Youth Protagonism&#x0201d; and the &#x0201c;Life Project&#x0201d;). In addition to these, &#x0201c;unstandardized&#x0201d; disciplines are offered based on the needs of the school community (i.e., teachers and students vote for disciplines that would be interesting for their school). One of the goals of the Brazilian Education Plan (Law 13,005/2014) is that a full-time education system should be offered in at least 50&#x000a0;% of government schools by 2024 (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pne.mec.gov.br/images/pdf/pne_conhecendo_20_metas.pdf">www.pne.mec.gov.br/images/pdf/pne_conhecendo_20_metas.pdf</ext-link>).</p><p>In 2014, 165 municipal schools undertook the PSE in Fortaleza-Ceara, the fifth largest city in Brazil; 40 of these had elementary school classes (Grades 6&#x02013;9). Of these 40 schools, only six were full-time. However, by 2016, the projection is that 30 of the 40 schools with PSE will be full-time (see information in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sme.fortaleza.ce.gov.br/mapeamentoescolar">www.sme.fortaleza.ce.gov.br/mapeamentoescolar</ext-link>).</p><p>The involvement of multicomponent and intersectoral strategies to promote healthier individuals and environments is one of the priorities of the PSE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], as well as staff training (i.e., teachers and coordinators) to meet the health demands of Brazilian schools and communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Additionally, the PSE was intended to become a comprehensive public and education policy in Brazil. Based on this, we decided to consider schools with PSE and a full-time education model as ideal environments to conduct a multicomponent program focusing on active and healthy lifestyles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Why is the program called Fortale&#x000e7;a sua Sa&#x000fa;de?</title><p>The intervention program is called <italic>Fortale&#x000e7;a sua Sa&#x000fa;de</italic> for the following reasons. First, due to the similarity between the city&#x02019;s name (Fortaleza) and the verb <italic>Fortale&#x000e7;a</italic> (to strengthen) in its imperative form, it conveys the concept of encouragement, stimulation and excitement for students, thus corresponding with the purposes of an active lifestyle program. Second, the inclusion of the word &#x0201c;health&#x0201d; in the program&#x02019;s name allows the students to identify the general purpose of the intervention program on the different aspects of a healthier lifestyle.</p><p>With regard to the program&#x02019;s logo, the symbol for <italic>Fortale&#x000e7;a sua Sa&#x000fa;de</italic> was represented by a square, symbolizing something that transmits strength as a synonym for force. As students are the population of interest, a heart was used as a widely recognized symbol of health.

This is a cluster-randomized controlled trial and the school was the sample selection unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The primary objective of the <italic>Fortale&#x000e7;a sua Sa&#x000fa;de</italic> program was to determine whether a multicomponent program (teacher training and activities on how to discuss health topics in the general curriculum and PE classes, active opportunities in the school environment and health education in the school community) would increase PA practice and reduce screen time among full-time elementary students (Grades 7&#x02013;9) in Fortaleza, northeastern Brazil. A further primary objective was to identify the effectiveness of the program on intrapersonal, interpersonal and environmental variables related to PA and screen time, and to determine which of these variables mediate active lifestyle changes. The program&#x02019;s secondary objectives included: (i) to determine whether the program is also effective for different health factors (e.g., nutritional status, health behavior, quality of life, and others); (ii) to identify its effectiveness for addressing eating disorders, sleep quality and objectively-measured PA and sedentary time among obese students; and (iii) to evaluate the program execution, including indicators of the implementation, maintenance, and costs of this program.</p><p>The participation of the students involved in this study was authorized by the parent/guardian, by signing the informed consent form. The National Research Ethics System (protocol No. 17366313.9.0000.0121) approved this research project and it follows resolutions 196 and 251 of the National Health Council. Each school will receive a final report containing the program results and practical recommendations for application in schools.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Setting and population</title><p>Fortaleza is the capital of the state of Ceara, northeastern Brazil, and has a population of 2,452,185 inhabitants (the fifth largest city in Brazil in terms of population) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This municipality has an area of 314&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup> and a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.754 &#x02014; it is the 19<sup>th</sup> HDI among the 27 Brazilian state capitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The city of Fortaleza is geographically divided into six administrative regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>According to the Municipal Education Department, Fortaleza had 464 municipal schools in 2014 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sme.fortaleza.ce.gov.br/mapeamentoescolar">www.sme.fortaleza.ce.gov.br/mapeamentoescolar</ext-link>). Of these, 161 schools included classes from Grades 6&#x02013;9 (34.7&#x000a0;%) and 165 schools included the PSE (35.5&#x000a0;%). Forty schools included Grades 6&#x02013;9 and PSE, and six out of these schools had a full-time education model. Approximately 2,500 students were enrolled in these six full-time schools, of which 1,272 were enrolled in classes from Grades 7 to 9 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p>Grade six classes were substantially composed of students aged 10 and 11&#x000a0;years old.

Additionally, age groups considered appropriate by the World Health Organization (WHO) for studies on health behaviors are primarily 13&#x02013;15 year olds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and these would be included in successive series, therefore, 6<sup>th</sup> Grade students were not included.</p><p>Thus, all six full-time schools with PSE were eligible. Three schools were in the intervention condition and three additional schools received no intervention (control). The inclusion criteria were students of both genders, aged 12&#x02013;15 years who were enrolled in Grades 7&#x02013;9, attending full-time public schools in Fortaleza, northeastern Brazil (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Recruitment of schools and students</title><p>The six schools had similar characteristics (e.g., size, target audience, curriculum, etc.) and were located in different administrative regions (geographically dispersed).

All directors agreed to participate without being informed which treatment group the schools would be assigned to in the study. Thus, we performed the random selection of three schools to each condition (intervention or control). Schools were visited to explain the objectives of the study and the program logistics during the semester. The neighborhood-HDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] where the six schools were located was similar between groups (neighborhood-HDIs of 0.215, 0.341 and 0.443 for intervention schools, and 0.170, 0.377 and 0.491 for control schools).</p><p>Of the 1,272 eligible students (639 in intervention and 633 in control schools), 1,182 students filled out the baseline measures (92.0&#x000a0;% and 93.8&#x000a0;% of eligible students from intervention and control schools, respectively). The main reason for non-participation at baseline was being absent from school on data collection days. Post-intervention data collection included 1,085 students (response rate of 93.2&#x000a0;% and 90.4&#x000a0;% in intervention and control schools, respectively).

Following this step, the development of program material (e.g., flyers, games, banners) was undertaken.</p><p>In 2014, a pilot study was conducted in a public school. In general, we noted that many of the actions were suitable for the school environment. However, some strategies, such as the distribution of school equipment to students, needed adjustment. For this strategy, the use of a control chart was needed to prevent loss or damage to equipment. Furthermore, the rules of the games needed to be simplified and to be feasible. Finally, we noted that the activities proposed in the manuals needed tailoring to the reality and characteristics of each class and school.

These sessions were composed of physical (e.g., stretching, located exercises) or dynamic (e.g., games and rhythmic activities) activities in small and large groups in order to involve young people in PA during free-time at school. A member of staff conducted these sessions in a variety of open spaces in the school (e.g., school entrance, courtyard, court).</p><p>Space and equipment were structured and made available to play games in free-time during the school day.

In each school, two small courts were painted on the school courtyard to be used for different games (e.g., foot- /volleyball and other popular games). Additionally, markings were made in the school gymnasium for use in games with several groups of students at the same time. A game called &#x0201c;Squash for Health&#x0201d; was created with positive and negative pictures of PA and screen time (e.g., cycling or watching television). During this game, points were gained on positive images and lost on negative images. A game called &#x0201c;Active Board&#x0201d; was set on a school wall because this game needs to be played on foot (i.e., to reduce the sitting time) during breaks. In groups of 4 to 6 participants, students threw a large die and would have to perform the corresponding activities indicated on the board (e.g., spend 20&#x000a0;s jumping on one leg) to complete the game.</p><p>An inventory of sports equipment (balls, rackets, nets, etc.) at each school was undertaken and the school coordinator was consulted about enabling students to have access to the equipment during their free-time at school.

A control sheet was used to record the equipment used by the students.</p><p>Staff implemented these strategies in the first two weeks of the semester in order to guide the execution, access to facilities, and understanding of the rules of the games. During the semester, some PE classes and Gym in School sessions incorporated these games in order to encourage students to play them during free-time at school. Explanatory banners were displayed in schools explaining game rules and access to equipment. Motivational messages, for example, &#x0201c;Let&#x02019;s play with friends!&#x0201d; and health messages, for example, &#x0201c;Practicing PA with friends is very good for the health!&#x0201d;, were also included on the banners.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Fourth component: health education in the school community</title><p>Some of the previous strategies had an additional focus on promoting awareness about the benefits of an active and healthy lifestyle; principally, the materials produced in the classroom in general and PE classes and the banners exposed in schools (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, pamphlets with messages about active and healthy lifestyle were distributed in intervention schools.

A further data collection that incorporated the intervention phase took place immediately after the semester (two weeks in November and December 2014). Data collection occurred over two or three days in each school in order to include eligible students. Evaluators who had previously been trained in theoretical explanations and practical simulations administered the questionnaires. Some evaluators knew which schools were in the intervention and control treatments because they were enrolled in the intervention implementation; training was focused on the standardization of data collection independent of the condition to which the schools had been assigned in the trial. The questionnaire was administered to students in the classroom, without the presence of teachers. During administration the evaluators provided instructions and read each question aloud. The students then answered the questions. Other evaluators helped the students to answer the questions. Health professionals (PE and nursing) took anthropometric measures (weight, height and waist circumference).</p><p>Instruments validated for, or adapted to Brazilian young people were used to measure the study variables. Reliability of the self-reported measures was evaluated using Kappa&#x02019;s index for dichotomous variables (e.g., gender), intra-class correlation coefficient for ordinal variables (e.g., economic class), and Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha for scales (e.g., attitude scales).

One of the strengths of this program was considering strategies specific to PA and screen time. Sedentary behavior and physical inactivity may have independent detrimental effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and few interventions have targeted reductions in screen time in schools, especially in Brazil. A further strength of the program was including strategies that focused on different school contexts and members, an element that is valued in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In particular, PE classes have been a constant (and sometimes the only) focus in interventions and, despite its importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], the theoretical aspects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] of this program warn of a more complex and comprehensive understanding of PA and screen time in young people. Finally, strategies were chosen and structured in order to focus on PA and screen time mediators (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This may contribute to the understanding of how the use of different theoretical models of human behavior, including socioecological theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], can contribute to active and healthy lifestyle promotion among youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>Fortale&#x000e7;a sua Sa&#x000fa;de</italic> program was a cluster randomized controlled trial that had a sample size with sufficient statistical power to find the expected moderate effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] on the active lifestyle variables, as well as to identify the mediators of these behaviors. The inclusion of students in adolescence was also a strength of the study because similar analyses had only included children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and there is a worrying estimate of inactive and unhealthy lifestyles among adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], including in Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Other strengths of this program were the measurement of potential mediators of PA and screen time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and the analysis of whether PA and screen time were predictors of other health factors (e.g., diet and quality of life) and academic performance. A specific evaluation of obese students may indicate the health benefits of this program for a high-risk subgroup of biological, behavioral (objectively-measured), and psychological health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Finally, the evaluation of the acceptance, implementation and maintenance of this program may indicate how the <italic>Fortale&#x000e7;a sua Sa&#x000fa;de</italic> program strategies may be extended and adapted to the school context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>The study&#x02019;s weaknesses include the relatively short duration of the intervention (one semester, around four months). Although some reviews indicate that short-term interventions can obtain favorable effects on young lifestyles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], they may not be sufficient to influence all variables. The full-time model is not a comprehensive system in Brazilian schools and this makes it difficult to extrapolate the findings to several schools at this time. Some teachers were aware of which condition in the program the school had been assigned to as a result of the constant communication between the Municipal Education Department and schools. Some staff involved in data collection was also aware of the school&#x02019;s condition in the program, and the training was focused on minimizing this measurement bias. The lack of blinding can affect the outcomes of the participants in the trial, due to a lack of expectations in a control group or overestimation of results in intervention groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Finally, despite the use of validated instruments, self-reported measures have measurement bias (e.g., precision, memory, etc.), especially in relation to PA and screen time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The operational and funding conditions of this program made it impracticable to use accelerometers for measuring PA and sedentary time for the whole of the study sample.</p><p>We hope the <italic>Fortale&#x000e7;a sua Sa&#x000fa;de</italic> program is effective in promoting active and healthy lifestyles and that this represents a program that is well received, implemented, and maintained in the school context.
