Informed and written consent was obtained from each patient. The study was a prospective, randomized comparative study. Patients previously unoperated with symptoms and radiological features of lumbar spinal canal stenosis (primary and secondary spinal canal stenosis) were included in the study. A total of 30 patients were enrolled in the study. Fifteen patients were randomized to Group A (free fat graft), and 15 patients were placed in Group B (Gelfoam group). Postoperatively, clinical outcome and EF were assessed on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CEMRI) at 3 and 6 months postoperatively.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Randomization technique</title><p>Block randomization with sealed envelope system was used (In this, ten randomly generated treatment allocations within sealed opaque envelopes were prepared, assigning A and B in 5 envelopes each, where A represented Group A receiving free fat graft and B represented Group B receiving epidural gel foam). Once a patient gave consent for the study, an envelope was opened, and the patient was then offered the allocated group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Procedure</title><p>All patients were operated under general anesthesia. The patient was made to lie supine on table and then rolled over to the prone position. Operative field was cleaned and draped. The skin incision was made. Length of incision depended on how many laminectomies had to be performed. Back muscles were split down the middle and subperiosteal dissection was done. Muscles were moved to either side exposing the lamina of each vertebrae. After localization using C arm, bony spinous process and lamina were removed with bone biting tool; thickened ligamentum flavum was also removed. The facet joints are directly over the nerve roots and were undercut to give the nerve roots more room in case of nerve root compression. Discectomy was done in case of herniated disc causing compression. Gelfoam or free fat graft taken from same incision site was placed over the dura mater after laminectomy. Four layer closure (muscle, fascia, subcutaneous tissue and skin) was done with vicryl and nylon.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Clinical outcome assessment</title><p>It was done at 3 and 6 months. Activity related pain, backache and radicular pain and straight leg raising (SLR) examinations and assessments were done. Pain intensity, assessed both pre-and post-operatively, was evaluated by the numeric verbal rating (NVR) scale, with 0 meaning no pain while 10 meaning worst possible pain and patients were categorized as 1 - pain free (0); 2 - improved pain (1&#x02013;4); 3 - fair (5&#x02013;7); and 4 - bad (8&#x02013;10). Significant pain relief group included patients in pain free and improved pain categories, i.e. pain relief of 50% or greater. Nonsignificant pain relief group included patients in the fair and bad categories, i.e., pain relief &#x0003c;50%. The patient's functional clinical outcome was measured according to the clinical improvements in SLR test.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Radiologic evaluation assessment</title><p>Contrast MRI evaluation was done at 3 months and 6 months period postoperatively, for the extent and incidence of EF. Epidural granulation or scar tissue categorization was done for three cuts per disc level, four quadrants per level (a-d). The main assessment was done at the level passing through the neural exit foramina.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Axial images covered at least one level above the operative site to one level below the site (except for L5-S1, where the caudal-most slices were to the mid S1 body). Criteria for EF identification included iso- to hypointense signal relative to intervertebral discs on T1-weighted MR images, replacing the epidural fat signal intensity. EF was fairly homogeneous. Both EF and disc protrusions may show mass effect, especially in early stages of granulation tissue formation. Aging of the EF may result in retraction of the dura toward the side of the scar. EF enhanced immediately after the injection of gadolinium, in contrast to recurrent herniation, which may need up to 20 min after contrast injection.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Epidural fibrosis grading: scale of 0&#x02013;4 for each quadrant</title><p>Quadrants a&#x02013;d for levels 1, 2, and 3; Grade 0 = no to trace scar; Grade 1 = trace to 25%; Grade 2 = 50%; Grade 3 = 75%; and Grade 4 = 100% [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>].

LaRocca and Macnab [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] described EF as the &#x0201c;postlaminectomy membrane&#x0201d; in a canine model in 1974. In 1980, Mayfield [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported that fat grafts could prevent &#x0201c;constricting cicatrix&#x0201d; and can also act as space-occupying lesion leading to neural compression.</p><p>Lumbar EF has been proved to be an important cause of FBS. FBS usually occurs in 15%&#x02013;60% of operated cases.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] EF is reported in 10%&#x02013;24% of FBS cases. The postoperative recurrence of pain after an initial pain-free period was often attributed to EF.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The rate of EF increases to more than 60% in reoperations with a possible worse outcome.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The fibrosis makes nerve root more susceptible to compression due to the tethering effect of the scar tissue. EF makes reoperations risky and more difficult. EF increases the risk of dural tear during reoperation.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>EF forms even in minimally invasive procedures.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Most synthetic materials lead to more scarring and more complications compared with control groups. Autogenous barriers had better results.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Preservation of the natural epidural fat is an effective barrier to reduce the occurrence of EF. It prevents the fibrous tissue invasion from the surrounding tissues. Application of a drug locally, which is known to decrease scar tissue formation, may be theoretically accepted, provided that it does not cause any harm to the patient.</p><p>Postoperative lumbar EF occurs as a result of normal wound healing. Fibroblasts infiltrate and replace the epidural hematoma and lead to granulation tissue formation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Granulation tissue leads to the formation of dense fibrous tissue which in turn leads to irritation of dura and nerve root irritation, entrapment, and compression and thus makes them more susceptible to injury.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>EF formation usually takes about 6 weeks to 6 months postoperatively. EF is clearly identified on MRI by at least 3 months, stabilized by 6 months, with no further changes at 12 months.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Hence, in this study, the MRI evaluation follow-up time was 6 months. EF on MRI is visualized as relatively low-signal intensity, as compared to the high-signal intensity epidural fat, and as the very low-signal intensity cerebrospinal fluid on T1-weighted images. EF usually enhances homogeneously following contrast administration.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>Regarding EF and clinical recovery, Coskun <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] did not find a relation between EF and pain scores. However, in our study, we have found a good correlation between scores for the NVR scale and the grade of EF by MRI. In our study, EF was evaluated using axial MR images, with interpretation of its extent. This helped us to study the relation between the extent of EF, patient's symptoms, and surgical outcomes. In contrast to the grading system described by Ross <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] we have utilized three levels evaluation, centered on the level of the neural exit foramina as advised by Mohi Eldin and Abdel Razek.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Rate and grade of EF were first described by Cervellini <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Cervellini <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and Sen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] found Grade II (moderate) EF predominantly. In a study done by Cinotti <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] no correlation was found between the amount of EF, as seen intraoperatively and on MR, and FBS. In this study, we have evaluated the occurrence rate and EF grades in our patients in both groups. Mohi Eldin and Abdel Razek studied the use of suction drains at operative sites to prevent EF.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In a study done by Ross,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] patients with extensive EF were 3.2-fold more likely to experience recurrent radicular pain than those patients with less extensive EF. They found a significant association between the presence of extensive EF and the recurrence of radicular pain. In our study, we found that patients in Group A (free fat graft) developed less EF and had more relief/decrease in pain as compared to patients in Group B (Gelfoam). Our results regarding EF and its correlation to pain matched with the previous studies.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrated the fact that the use of fat grafts over Gelfoam application significantly improved patient outcome with respect to short-term and late pain relief and SLR. In addition, the same tools significantly reduced EF as measured by an MRI.
