This <italic>preliminary</italic> randomized controlled open trial with a parallel design developed two group interventions for adults with autism spectrum disorders and intelligence within the normal range: cognitive behavioural therapy and recreational activity. Both interventions comprised 36 weekly 3-h sessions led by two therapists in groups of 6&#x02013;8 patients. A total of 68 psychiatric patients with autism spectrum disorders participated in the study. Outcome measures were Quality of Life Inventory, Sense of Coherence Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and <italic>an exploratory analysis on</italic> measures of psychiatric health. Participants in both treatment conditions reported an increased quality of life at post-treatment (<italic>d</italic> = 0.39, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), with no difference between interventions. No amelioration of psychiatric symptoms was observed. The dropout rate was lower with cognitive behavioural therapy than with recreational activity, and participants in cognitive behavioural therapy rated themselves as more generally improved, as well as more improved regarding expression of needs and understanding of difficulties. Both interventions appear to be promising treatment options for adults with autism spectrum disorder. The interventions&#x02019; similar efficacy may be due to the common elements, structure and group setting. Cognitive behavioural therapy may be additionally beneficial in terms of increasing specific skills and minimizing dropout.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adult</kwd><kwd>Asperger disorder</kwd><kwd>autism</kwd><kwd>cognitive behaviour therapy</kwd><kwd>group</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1362361313493681"><title>Introduction</title><p>The main characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD; i.e. Asperger syndrome, autistic disorder or pervasive developmental disorder&#x02013;not otherwise specified) are qualitative impairment of social interaction, qualitative impairments in communication and restricted and repetitive stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests and activities (<xref rid="bibr1-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). Individuals with ASDs also seem to be vulnerable to a number of psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit disorder, developmental coordination disorder, epilepsy, sleep disturbances and anxiety (<xref rid="bibr25-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Kopp et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr32-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Myers and Plauch&#x000e9; Johnson, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr47-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Wink et al., 2010</xref>).

As adults, they are single to a much greater extent than psychiatric controls (<xref rid="bibr37-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Ryd&#x000e9;n and Bejerot, 2008</xref>), and less than 16% report having friends (<xref rid="bibr38-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Shattuck et al., 2007</xref>). Although the educational level in this population is comparable to that of other psychiatric populations, patients with ASDs have significantly lower employment rates (<xref rid="bibr37-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Ryd&#x000e9;n and Bejerot, 2008</xref>). In addition, unfulfilled needs regarding privacy, choice making and independency may affect quality of life negatively (<xref rid="bibr19-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Gaus, 2011</xref>). Due to severe executive problems, daily life activities can be experienced as chaotic (<xref rid="bibr15-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Frith, 2004</xref>). As a result of these psychiatric and social difficulties, quality of life is often impaired in patients with ASDs (<xref rid="bibr23-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Jennes-Coussens et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Although the prevalence of ASDs among psychiatric patients is reported to be low (<xref rid="bibr33-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Nylander and Gillberg, 2001</xref>), these patients are not uncommon at specialized psychiatric outpatient settings. The intensity of care needed and the relative difficulty in treating this group lead to a high frequency of office visits, evaluations and therapeutic contacts. Knowledge and recognition of ASDs have increased enormously in recent years. According to the Stockholm psychiatric patient registry, during the last 20 years, less than 20 adults were diagnosed with Asperger syndrome each year until 2004. In 2008, almost 500 were diagnosed, and in 2010, the number of new cases reached almost 700. As this new patient population has emerged in clinical practice during the last decade, there is an urgent need to identify suitable treatment options.</p><sec id="section2-1362361313493681"><title>Available treatment options for adults with ASDs</title><p>The Stockholm municipality guideline for treatment of adults with ASDs lists housing support or professional advice, psycho-education, cognitive aides and financial support as suitable interventions (<xref rid="bibr5-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Ax&#x000e9;n et al., 2010</xref>). Psychotherapeutic and social interventions are not mentioned, possibly due to lack of clinical studies investigating their efficacy. Psychological methods designed to treat children with ASDs are difficult to adapt to adult patients because they either involve parental participation or are too time-consuming and authoritative, for example, applied behaviour analysis (<xref rid="bibr42-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Viru&#x000e9;s-Ortega, 2010</xref>). Alternative treatment options to psycho-therapeutical interventions are social training programmes. These target peer relationships and provide instruction and rehearsal of social skills (<xref rid="bibr13-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Frankel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr22-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Hillier et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, a brief social training programme was adapted to suit young adults, and a pilot study showed promising results (<xref rid="bibr16-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Gantman et al., 2012</xref>). Another treatment option is training in planning and engaging in recreational activities (<xref rid="bibr34-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Palmen et al., 2011</xref>). In adults with ASDs and intellectual disability, quality of life has been positively associated with engagement in regular recreational activities (<xref rid="bibr10-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Billstedt et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, for children with ASDs, recreational activity has been shown to be equally influential as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in reducing anxiety (<xref rid="bibr39-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Sung et al., 2011</xref>). Social training or recreational programmes do not, however, target the psychiatric symptoms often linked to ASDs, or the multitude of social difficulties common in this group.</p><p>To date, apart from social training and symptom-specific programmes, such as CBT treatment of anxiety for individuals with ASDs (<xref rid="bibr26-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2010</xref>), there are very limited treatment options for adults with ASDs. Much of the published literature is clinical or anecdotal, or purely based on theory. A few publications target the specific difficulties of providing psychotherapy for this patient population (<xref rid="bibr18-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Gaus, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bibr19-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Munro, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr44-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Weiss and Lunsky, 2010</xref>). There are a number of challenges, some of which include social withdrawal making it difficult for patients to enter psychotherapy (<xref rid="bibr31-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Munro, 2010</xref>), a sense of being misunderstood leading to low expectations of getting help (<xref rid="bibr18-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Gaus, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Munro, 2010</xref>) and insufficiently trained and experienced therapists (<xref rid="bibr4-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Attwood, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr19-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Gaus, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Munro, 2010</xref>).</p><p>There is undoubtedly a need for the development of treatment options for adult psychiatric patients with ASDs. Group settings enable social interaction and sharing experiences with others, thereby reducing social isolation (<xref rid="bibr4-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Attwood, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Munro, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr44-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Weiss and Lunsky, 2010</xref>). In addition, the need for structure and predictability makes CBT an attractive treatment option (<xref rid="bibr18-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Gaus, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bibr19-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Within CBT, psycho-education on ASDs and related psychiatric symptoms and social training are recommended (<xref rid="bibr16-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Gantman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr20-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Gerhardt and Lainer, 2010</xref>). Specific CBT techniques that are suitable include setting goals, home assignments and practising social skills for everyday life (<xref rid="bibr18-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Gaus, 2007</xref>). In summary, five elements of interventions that seem beneficial to adults with ASDs are group setting, structure and predictability, psycho-education, social training and ASD-suitable CBT techniques. It is, however, unclear whether the positive effects of CBT extend beyond the influence of social interaction gained by any type of group intervention.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to develop and compare two group interventions for psychiatric patients with ASDs and normal intellectual ability. The first intervention was CBT developed to suit adults with ASDs, and the second intervention was recreational activity enabling social interaction. The recreational activity was designed to control for social interaction effects. We hypothesized that both interventions would lead to improvement in primary measures of quality of life, sense of coherence and self-esteem, as well as in the exploratory analysis of the secondary measures of psychiatric symptoms. A greater effect in the CBT intervention compared to recreational activity was also expected, due to patients in the CBT intervention receiving a wider range of psychotherapeutic techniques.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section3-1362361313493681"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was an open randomized controlled trial, of parallel design, comparing group CBT with group recreational activity, in adult psychiatric patients with ASDs.

Each intervention group was divided into five subgroups consisting of 6&#x02013;8 patients and two therapists. All subgroups were provided with the same frequency and number of sessions: 36 weekly 3-h sessions during the course of two semesters. In both conditions, subgroups were lead by two collaborating therapists. All therapists received qualified supervision once or twice monthly by trained supervisors during the first 3 years of the project.</p><p>A psychiatrist and a clinical psychologist, both trained in CBT, led the CBT intervention. They treated 30 and 26 patients, respectively, corresponding to 86% and 74% of allocated patients. The co-therapists were four licensed psychologists, three of whom had special training in CBT.</p><p>A psychiatric nurse assistant and a social worker, both with more than 20 years of experience in the field, led the recreational activity intervention.

The setting was tailored to accommodate patients&#x02019; poor executive functioning and minimize the requirement of social skills. All psychotherapeutic interventions aim at inducing change. However, if symptoms are longstanding, pervasive change tends to be more difficult to achieve (<xref rid="bibr17-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Garety et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, acceptance of and insight into the dysfunction is essential for severely ill patients to gain improvements. Techniques for introducing <italic>acceptance</italic> and <italic>change</italic> to participants were drawn from psychotherapeutic techniques developed to treat psychiatric patients with severe symptoms, such as Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT; <xref rid="bibr27-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Linehan, 1984</xref>). However, some DBT-techniques, such as metaphors, exposure and limit setting, poorly suited adults with ASDs and so were only partially used in this study. Generally, the therapists focused on being clear, sincere and open to the impairments associated with ASDs, with the goal to keep patients in treatment.</p><p>Based on available literature, the CBT intervention consisted of five elements: (a) structure, (b) group setting, (c) psycho-education (e.g. lectures and discussions on ASD and psychiatric symptoms, including learning to identify and reappraise maladaptive thoughts), (d) social training (e.g. skill building such as practising phone calls and asking for help) and (e) cognitive behavioural techniques (e.g. setting goals, role-playing, exposure exercises and conducting behaviour analysis). Furthermore, the treatment was divided into three thematic modules: (a) self-esteem and ASD awareness, (b) social contacts and everyday life and (c) psychological and physical health. A manual describing the 36 individual sessions was created prior to starting the treatment (<xref rid="bibr8-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Bejerot and Bj&#x000f6;rnstierna, 2011</xref>), see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1362361313493681">Appendix 1</xref> for full session plan.</p><p>Each session followed a strict agenda: (a) introduction and presentation of the agenda of the day, (b) review of homework assignments from the previous session, (c) psycho-educative lecture and discussions on the session topic, (d) coffee break with buns or sandwiches and social interaction, (e) relaxation or mindfulness exercise, (f) discussions and exercises on the session topic, (g) distribution of homework and (h) evaluation and end of session. A written contract regarding confidentiality and respect for other participants was signed prior to treatment. In each subgroup, 3&#x02013;4 community support-workers participated in the group as a part of their professional training. This provided an opportunity for both patients and support-workers to exchange experiences by taking on roles of peer tutors in the social training segments of the CBT intervention (<xref rid="bibr45-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 2010</xref>). The support-workers were not previously known to the participants.</p></sec><sec id="section8-1362361313493681"><title>Recreational activity intervention</title><p>The purpose of the recreational activity intervention was to facilitate social interaction and to break social isolation. The therapists did not provide any deliberate techniques, such as psycho-education, social training or CBT. Instead, this intervention relied on structure and group setting only. During the first session, participants were asked to write down group activities they would like to engage in. The therapists created a list of the suggested activities, such as visiting museums, playing board games, cooking, restaurant visits, boating, cinema and taking walks. Each week, participants voted for the next session&#x02019;s activity. All entrance fees and additional costs were paid for by the project, with a budget for each session of &#x000a3;45.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section9-1362361313493681"><title>Assessments and gathering of data</title><p>Demographic data were collected during the intake interview. Then, psychiatric diagnoses of ASDs were collected from medical records, as were data on co-morbidities and use of psychotropic medications. Baseline assessment was made after randomization, hence not blinded to intervention type. The post-treatment assessment was completed during the last intervention session.</p><p>In the baseline and post-treatment assessments, many patients showed difficulty in completing assessments, which resulted in missing data. Reasons for not completing assessment included fear of being misinterpreted, difficulty with responding to questions, difficulty with quantifying experience (e.g. choosing between a &#x02018;3&#x02019; and a &#x02018;4&#x02019;), procrastination and lack of motivation.</p><p>A long-term follow-up was conducted, regardless of patient participation year, between July and September 2011 (ranging from 8 to 57 months after treatment termination). To minimize missing data, the follow-up survey was shortened in consideration of patients&#x02019; limited capabilities. In order to encourage involvement, participants could complete either a paper- or web-based questionnaire, and a telephone interview was performed with those who did not respond to the questionnaire. Participation was gratified with two cinema tickets.</p></sec><sec id="section10-1362361313493681"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="section11-1362361313493681"><title>Primary outcome measures</title><p>Primary outcomes consisted of the three following self-rated questionnaires.

The hypotheses that <italic>both interventions would lead to improvements</italic> and that <italic>CBT would have a stronger effect</italic> were both partially supported. The group CBT and group recreational activity interventions were equally beneficial to participants in increasing their quality of life. Psychiatric symptoms, SoC and self-esteem were not affected by either intervention. CBT resulted in less attrition than recreational activity, and in addition, participants who received CBT rated themselves as more improved at post-treatment. At follow-up, CBT participants reported better well-being, greater understanding of their own difficulties and improved ability to express needs, compared to participants in the recreational activity intervention. However, findings should be considered preliminary, due to the small sample size and the lack of a non-treated control group.</p><sec id="section21-1362361313493681"><title>The value of the group setting</title><p>The group setting of both interventions enabled social interaction and sharing experiences. This may have promoted participants&#x02019; self-acceptance by allowing them to gain insight into both the impairments and the strengths that characterize the disorder, and to recognize that others share similar challenges. As increases in self-acceptance and quality of life were observed for both intervention groups, such benefits may be due to the group setting itself as opposed to the specific treatment techniques. Although people with ASDs often have social anxiety and may be reluctant to participate in group settings, the current findings indicate that group settings may be beneficial for their quality of life and self-acceptance. However, the range in time passed between treatment termination and follow-up (8&#x02013;57 months) means that the specific long-term effect on quality of life is unclear. Future research could apply standardized point of assessments for follow-up investigation of longitudinal treatment effects on quality of life in more detail.</p></sec><sec id="section22-1362361313493681"><title>Strengths of the CBT intervention</title><p>The recreation activity involved only the intervention elements of structure and group setting, whereas the CBT intervention also included the elements of psycho-education, social training and CBT techniques. Thus, participants in CBT may have developed greater understanding of their own difficulties and improved ability to express needs and receive support because the aim of psycho-education and social training is to enhance these capacities. Plausibly, the difference in well-being scores at follow-up also represents greater insight gained from CBT rather than recreational activity. However, as no group differences were observed in other indicators of well-being (such as the QOLI), the links between CBT, greater insight and increased well-being need further investigation. The inclusion of support-workers was not specifically evaluated. Although the support-workers were active in the social training segments of the CBT intervention, they are not necessary to conduct social training. Therefore, the effects of support-workers are probably negligible.</p></sec><sec id="section23-1362361313493681"><title>Quality of life of participants</title><p>At baseline, participants&#x02019; ratings of quality of life (mean = &#x02212;0.19, SD = 1.8) indicated a general dissatisfaction of life, which is similar to scores of untreated post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients (mean = 0.3, SD = 3.2) and very low when compared to findings with non-clinical controls (mean = 2.8, SD = 2.3) observed in other studies (<xref rid="bibr35-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Paunovi&#x00107; and &#x000d6;st, 2004</xref>). Although the change in QOLI at follow-up was moderate (<italic>d</italic> = 0.48) and scores at follow-up were still very low (mean = 0.43, SD = 1.73), responses progressed into the &#x02018;satisfied&#x02019; range of QOLI. This may indicate an important positive clinical change in quality of life.</p><p>As neither of the interventions resulted in improvement of psychiatric symptoms or autistic traits, two observations were made. First, the increase in quality of life probably reflects a meaningful change. It is possible that the increase in quality of life represents spontaneous remission where patients seeking help at crisis point tend to inevitably improve to some extent because they cannot become worse. However, as there was no change in measures of psychiatric health, this explanation is unlikely. In addition, given the different longitudinal findings for the psychiatric measures and the QOLI, improvement in quality of life may not necessarily be connected to a reduction of psychiatric symptoms in patients with ASDs. It is also possible that the lack of effect on psychiatric measures could be caused by low power due to multiple co-morbidities, since not all patients received high scores on each measure. The patient group with a specific psychiatric problem (e.g. depressed, with high scores on BDI) was most likely too small for obtaining satisfactory statistical power. Future studies on treatment of psychiatric symptoms in ASDs should include larger samples to differentiate between patients with specific psychiatric problems in order to increase detectability of treatment effects. Notably, previous studies aimed at specific anxiety symptoms have succeeded in reducing psychiatric symptoms in children and young adults with ASDs with the use of CBT (<xref rid="bibr26-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr48-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Woods et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section24-1362361313493681"><title>Factors related to dropout</title><p>The total attrition rate (28%) in this study was low, especially considering the length of the treatment (<xref rid="bibr41-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Villeneuve et al., 2010</xref>). Lower SoC was associated with a greater likelihood of dropout in both interventions, which is consistent with findings in other patient populations (<xref rid="bibr2-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Andersen and Berg, 2001</xref>). Interestingly, the CBT intervention had significantly less dropouts than recreational activity. The requirement of the recreational activity intervention to visit public places may have been perceived as stressful by participants and thereby contributed to the higher attrition rate in this group. When participants needed inpatient care, they could continue attending CBT sessions at the clinic, whereas recreational activities in public were not practical. This was an unexpected advantage of the CBT intervention, which may have lessened the risk of dropout further. In light of this, it is advisable in clinical practice to consider a patients&#x02019; likely need for inpatient care when selecting appropriate interventions.</p></sec><sec id="section25-1362361313493681"><title>Generalizability of the results</title><p>The psychiatric vulnerability of adult psychiatric patients with ASDs was illustrated in this sample by the high prevalence of previous suicide attempts (35%), current psychotropic medication (79%) and previous need of inpatient care (31%). These rates are high when compared to prevalence rates in the general ASD population (<xref rid="bibr29-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Lugneg&#x000e5;rd et al., 2011</xref>). Due to participants&#x02019; psychiatric co-morbidities, these findings may not be generalizable to a general ASD population. It is, however, unclear whether adults with ASDs with better general psychiatric health than this sample would benefit less from the interventions. Furthermore, in order for a participant to enter treatment, he or she had to agree to a group setting, possibly excluding those disinterested in social contact (<xref rid="bibr46-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Wing, 1981</xref>). Nevertheless, the current sample represents an important psychiatric population who require high-quality, flexible and frequent care.</p><p>The limited significant differences observed between the two interventions may have several explanations. Factors common to both treatment conditions (e.g. structure and group setting) are presumed to be beneficial to adults with ASDs. The initial power calculation proved to be too optimistic, since the observed effect sizes were much lower than expected. Thus, there may be differences between groups not detected in this study. To increase power of between-group effects, an untreated waiting-list group or larger sample could have been used. However, waiting-list design was considered unsuitable because the treatment length (two semesters) meant that severely ill patients would be left untreated for too long. Sample size was defined at the beginning of the study based on the initial power calculation and could not be altered in retrospect.</p><p>The use of manual randomization and primary assessment not being blind to randomization may have increased the risk of falsely identifying between group effects. However, no difference was found between groups regarding baseline measures or demographic data, hence a type I error is unlikely.</p></sec><sec id="section26-1362361313493681"><title>Methodological discussion</title><p>This study&#x02019;s main strength is the development and evaluation of two interventions suitable for a patient group who have very few treatment options, and yet have a great need for diverse and high-quality interventions. The study&#x02019;s limitations were largely due to the naturalistic setting and the specific difficulties of measuring psychiatric health in patients with multiple and complex symptoms.</p><p>The exclusive use of self-reports as outcome measures is a limitation. However, alternative methods to self-reports were not used because they were considered unsuitable for the current study. For example, therapist ratings were unsuitable because tone of voice, facial expression or body language may not provide any clues of how a person with ASD feels (<xref rid="bibr46-1362361313493681" ref-type="bibr">Wing, 1981</xref>). Another approach for assessing intervention effects could have been to collect information from family members or caregivers. However, for adults living independently and suffering from social impairment, family members or caregivers are not always available, and furthermore, adult participants could view such involvement as intrusive. Using multiple outcome methods, such as blind clinician raters, would strengthen future research.</p><p>The ability to complete self-assessments was not a requirement for inclusion, which resulted in a considerable amount of missing data. Also, the measurements at baseline and post-treatment were not adapted to the patient population. In consideration of these limitations, the follow-up questionnaire was constructed to reduce the likelihood of missing data and better suit the ASD population, with fewer items to answer and more direct questions. As a result of the follow-up questionnaire being constructed and distributed after intervention termination, there is a possibility that question-bias may have affected the validity of the follow-up. However, due to participants&#x02019; impairment in communication and need for direct questions, rather than lengthy questionnaires, this was deemed appropriate.</p><p>In order to ensure intervention adherence and quality, this study used professional supervision and overlapping therapists. Furthermore, the CBT intervention was defined by a very detailed treatment manual. The recreational activity intervention was designed to be a low impact and easily organized intervention, and minimal instructions were given to therapists. Although this study lacks a general measurement of treatment adherence, the above measures were taken to maximize treatment quality and adherence.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section27-1362361313493681"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study addressed the shortage of treatment options for adults with ASDs, showing that group CBT and group recreational activity interventions are beneficial treatment options. Both interventions are suggested to be beneficial for this patient group because each intervention was associated with a sustained improvement in quality of life. This highlights the benefits of structure and group setting in treating this population. Due to the range of ASD-suitable techniques available in CBT, this method may be additionally beneficial in terms of increasing specific skills and minimizing dropout. Clinicians may find a combination of these interventions useful, depending on individual patients&#x02019; preferences and challenges. Social isolation is common in this population, and for patients reluctant to enter psychotherapy, a recreational activity group may be a possible treatment option.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that adults with ASDs can attend group interventions and that this may improve their self-perceived quality of life and psychological well-being. It contributes towards the development of treatment options for adults with ASD, widening the range of appropriate treatment alternatives currently available to clinicians and patients. Further research using larger population samples and multi-method outcome measures are needed to further assess the validity and efficacy of both methods presented in this preliminary study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Collaborators responsible for the content in the treatment sessions were Susanne Bejerot, Eva Bj&#x000f6;rnstjerna, Susanna Bitter, Anna Martin, Maritta Reijonen and Gunilla Bj&#x000f6;rk.
