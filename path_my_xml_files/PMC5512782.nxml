A total of 340 participants enrolled at 2 study sites in India were randomized (1:1:1:1) in 4 groups to receive a 5-dose Essen regimen with either 1 of the 3 Indian batches (PCECV-I) or the German batch (PCECV-G), administered on Days (D) 0, 3, 7, 14 and 30. The lot-to-lot consistency of PCECV-I batches in terms of induced immune response at D14 was demonstrated. The immune response elicited by PCECV-I was shown to be non-inferior to that induced by PCECV-G, as the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the ratio (PCECV-I/PCECV-G) of rabies virus neutralising antibody (RVNA) geometric mean concentrations was higher than 0.5 at D14. At least 96% of participants developed adequate RVNA concentrations (&#x02265; 0.5&#x000a0;IU/mL) by D14 and all achieved RVNA concentrations &#x02265; 0.5&#x000a0;IU/mL by D90. RVNA levels were comparable across all groups throughout the entire study. Solicited local and general symptoms had a similar incidence in all groups. Unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were reported by 11% of participants. Only 1 serious AE (leg fracture) was reported and was not related to vaccination. No deaths and no rabies cases were recorded during the 90 days of observation. The study showed that the 3 PCECV-I and the PCECV-G batches induced a similar immune response and had a comparable safety profile when administered according to a 5-dose schedule.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>immunogenicity</kwd><kwd>lot-to-lot consistency</kwd><kwd>PCEC vaccine</kwd><kwd>rabies</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="24"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rabies is an acute viral disease, caused by viruses belonging to the <italic>Lyssavirus</italic> genus within the <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> family. In infected humans, the period of incubation is commonly from 2 weeks to 3&#x000a0;months, and the spreading of the virus to the central nervous system eventually leads to progressive fatal encephalomyelitis, followed by cardiorespiratory arrest within a few days.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p><p>Although rabies is almost eliminated in industrialised countries, this disease is still estimated to cause 59,000 to 60,000 deaths each year in endemic regions, especially in Asia and Africa.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Due to incomplete reporting, lack of access to medical facilities and misdiagnosis, this figure is likely to be an underestimate of the real burden of rabies. Around 40% of people bitten by animals suspected of having rabies are under 15&#x000a0;years of age,<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> and most are male and reside in rural communities.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><p>Post exposure prophylaxis, including vaccination, is highly effective when administered promptly after contact with the suspected rabid animal. In addition, pre-exposure prophylaxis is also available to prime an immune response against rabies and simplify the post-exposure treatment. Cell culture and embryonated egg-based rabies vaccines (CCEVs), which comply with the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended potency of &#x02265; 2.5 International Units (IU) per intramuscular dose, are currently used worldwide.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Post-exposure, vaccines are usually administered according to a 5-dose (Essen) or 4-dose (Zagreb) regimen, and together with correct wound treatment and concomitant administration of rabies immunoglobulins (RIG), they lead to the prevention of the disease. Other post-exposure 4-dose regimens, with intramuscular or intradermal administration of the vaccine, have also been approved by WHO.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p>The purified chick embryo cell rabies vaccine (PCECV, <italic>Rabipur&#x02122;</italic>, GSK Vaccines) was licensed more than 30&#x000a0;years ago and is currently produced in 2 WHO pre-qualified manufacturing facilities: Marburg, Germany and Ankleshwar, India.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> An almost identical production process is used for both vaccines.</p><p>The current study investigated the non-inferiority of 3 PCECV lots manufactured in India (PCECV-I) over a lot manufactured in Germany (PCECV-G) and assessed the consistency of the 3 PCECV-I lots.

Participants were between 9 and 75&#x000a0;years of age, and most of them were male (80%). No statistically significant difference in demographic characteristics was found between vaccinees who received PCECV-I and those receiving PCECV-G. Participants from the 2 trial sites in India differed in terms of prior history of bites from animals with unknown rabies status: 72% of participants vaccinated at trial site 1 and 98% of participants at trial site 2 had been bitten prior to vaccination. One participant in group PCECV-I499 and one in group PCECV-G received equine RIG at the time of the first vaccination, through local infiltration around the wound and injected intramuscularly in the gluteal region.

Furthermore, consistency of the 3 Indian batches was shown. Although the study was conducted more than 15&#x000a0;years ago, full dissemination of the results remains of major importance, seeing that the trial demonstrated equivalence of PCECV batches manufactured in India and Germany, and contributed to the WHO granting of the pre-qualification title to the 2 facilities, in the year 2002.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Moreover, this is the first study to assess non-inferiority of PCECV batches produced in India to those manufactured in Germany.

The reasons for the delayed acquisition of adequate RVNA levels in this study were not clear in the present study. One of them did not develop RVNA levels &#x02265;&#x000a0;0.5&#x000a0;IU/mL until D90, while 5 had adequate RVNA concentrations by the next blood draw timepoint at D30. A review of PCECV immunogenicity and safety data covering the last 30&#x000a0;years showed that in almost all clinical trials evaluating the post-exposure Essen schedule in healthy individuals, 100% of participants had RVNA levels &#x02265;&#x000a0;0.5&#x000a0;IU/mL by D14.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Recently, 2 studies reported delayed immune responses in populations of healthy Chinese males and females after the first 3 out of 5 doses of purified Vero cell rabies vaccines as post-exposure prophylaxis measure.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11,12</sup></xref> In previous studies, immunogenicity of PCECV-I has been shown to be impacted in immunocompromised individuals,<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> with lower RVNA GMCs and percentages of participants achieving adequate concentrations at D14.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> A possible explanation for the unexpected number of the slow-responders is that some of them were unknowingly immunocompromised, and this could not be recognized in the anamnesis, although no evidence of this was documented during the study. In our study, no participants were non-responders, as all achieved RVNA concentrations &#x02265; 0.5&#x000a0;IU/mL by D90 at the latest. Although a defined RVNA concentration at D14 is recommended as a marker of an adequate immune response to vaccination, there is no formal correlate of protection for rabies in humans. Studies demonstrating effectiveness, especially after exposure to a laboratory-confirmed rabid animal, remain of significant value for current and future vaccines. PCECV administered according to different post-exposure intramuscular schedules has demonstrated 100% survival over 7 effectiveness studies which included 1539 patients, of whom 432 had exposure to an animal with confirmed rabies.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p><p>All participants included in the immunogenicity analyses had RVNA concentrations &#x0003c; 0.5&#x000a0;IU/mL at D0; however, RVNA GMCs at D14 tended to be higher at study site 2, which also had the highest exposure in terms of recorded bites for all groups. Of note, 12 study participants with detectable baseline RVNA concentrations were enrolled at this site, and they were likely to achieve higher RVNA levels post-immunisation. The trend of higher RVNA GMCs was not observed beyond the D14 timepoint, and no clear correlation between these findings and the study site was established.</p><p>The detection of pre-existing rabies virus neutralising antibodies in the study population was unexpected, seeing that previous rabies vaccination was an exclusion criterion. However, it has already been hypothesized that rare cases of sub-clinical rabies may occur in humans, as RVNAs in unvaccinated populations have been detected in remote communities with no access to medical care or facilities.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15,16</sup></xref> Although not demonstrated, any of the 12 study participants could have been previously exposed to rabid animals, and had not followed correct post-exposure prophylaxis measures. It is also possible that some of them had already been vaccinated against rabies, and had no recollection of it. A community-based study conducted in Delhi at the time of our study determined that only 44% of persons bitten by a potentially rabid dog would receive a complete rabies vaccination dose, and even basic measures like washing the wound were not applied,<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> despite official recommendations.

The number of individuals excluded from the PP cohort was higher than expected, leading to a slightly smaller number of participants than needed to meet the primary objective with a power of 90%, and this could be a potential limitation of the study.
