The aims of this study were to determine the efficacy of three classes of antiemetic drugs in a novel low dose cisplatin model of nausea and vomiting and measure change in potential nausea biomarkers arginine vasopressin (AVP) and cortisol. A four period cross-over blinded study was conducted in eight healthy beagle dogs of both genders. Dogs were administered 18&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> cisplatin intravenously, followed 45&#x000a0;min later by a 15&#x000a0;min infusion of either placebo (saline) or antiemetic treatment with ondansetron (0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg; 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist), maropitant (1&#x000a0;mg/kg; NK<sub>1</sub> antagonist) or metoclopramide (0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg; D<sub>2</sub> antagonist). The number of vomits and nausea associated behaviours, scored on a visual analogue scale, were recorded every 15&#x000a0;min for 8&#x000a0;h following cisplatin administration. Plasma samples were collected to measure AVP, cortisol and antiemetic drug concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">The placebo treated group vomited an average number of 7 times (range 2&#x02013;13). None of the dogs in either the ondansetron or maropitant treated groups vomited during the observation period. The onset of nausea-like behaviour in the placebo-treated group occurred at t<sub>3.5h</sub> and peaked at t<sub>4.75h</sub> with nausea behaviour score of 58.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4.6&#x000a0;mm. Ondansetron and maropitant reduced overall the area under the curve of nausea behaviour score by 90% and 25%, respectively. Metoclopramide had no effect on either vomiting or nausea.</p><p id="Par3">Cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting caused concomitant increases in AVP and cortisol. In the placebo-treated group, AVP and cortisol increased from t<sub>2.5h</sub>, peaked at t<sub>5h</sub> (11.3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.9&#x000a0;pmol L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 334.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;46.7&#x000a0;nmol/L, respectively) and returned to baseline by t<sub>8h</sub>. AVP and cortisol increases were completely prevented by ondansetron and only partially by maropitant, while metoclopramide had no effect.

Nausea is a graded response with a dynamic threshold influenced by a variety of factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], unlike emesis, which is an all or nothing event occurring when emetic stimuli surpass the threshold required to activate the emetic reflex. Defining nausea in animals is inherently problematic due to its subjective nature and the inability of an animal to verbalise the sensation that they experience. Whether or not animals experience the sensation of nausea in the same way as people do is a contentious issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, for the purposes of this article the term nausea will be used to denote the aversive state and prodromal response induced by the administration of a known emetogenic substance. Nausea-like behaviour refers to observable behaviours in animals that occur during the aversive state.</p><p id="Par6">Antiemetic drugs work by blocking the emetic pathway at various points preventing the emetic reflex. Three major classes of anti-emetics are currently available for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: 5-hydroxytryptamine<sub>3</sub> (5-HT<sub>3</sub>), neurokinin<sub>1</sub> (NK<sub>1</sub>) and dopamine<sub>2</sub> (D<sub>2</sub>) receptor antagonists. All classes of antiemetic drugs have some anti-nausea efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] but are generally less efficacious for the treatment of nausea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Human patients now report that nausea rather than emesis is the most distressing side effect of cancer chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The sensation of nausea stems from complex mechanisms involving cortical structures in the forebrain responsible for conscious perception, these mechanisms are thus far poorly characterised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This has hindered the development of anti-nausea drugs.</p><p id="Par7">Cisplatin is a platinum based cytotoxic drug used for the treatment of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is highly emetogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and has been widely used experimentally to induce nausea and emesis in a variety of species including <italic>Suncus murinus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], ferret [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and the dog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The low dose cisplatin model of nausea and emesis in the dog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] induces significantly less emesis than previous models which utilise clinical doses of cisplatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The reduced emesis in the low dose model facilitates recognition of the behavioral signs of nausea and grading of its severity without the bias of frequent emetic events. Therefore, it is a good model for the assessment of the anti-nausea effects of currently available anti-emetic drugs and to relate the concentration of nausea biomarkers to the observed signs of nausea behaviour.</p><p id="Par8">Potential nausea biomarkers, arginine vasopressin (AVP) and cortisol, have been identified as correlates of nausea behaviour in the dog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Increased AVP has been positively correlated to self-reported nausea scores by volunteers, in which, motion sickness is induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. To date, these biomarkers have not been used in experimental intervention studies to assist in objective assessment of nausea.</p><p id="Par9">The principal aim of the current study was to determine the relative efficacy of the representatives of three classes of antiemetic (ondansetron, maropitant, metoclopramide) in the prevention of nausea and emesis in the low dose cisplatin model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par10">Animal procedures undertaken were approved by the UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA), Project license 70/7269 with ethical approval of the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) Ethics and Welfare Committee.

Ondansetron inhibited both emesis and all behavioural signs of nausea completely. Maropitant inhibited emesis completely but only partially reduced the behavioural signs of nausea at the early time points. Metoclopramide had no significant effects on the number of episodes of vomiting and very little effect on the behavioural signs of nausea. These results support the hypothesis that emesis is easier to prevent than nausea by reducing the neuronal signals to below the threshold required to trigger emesis. By contrast, nausea, being a graded phenomenon, persisted in the presence of concentrations of maropitant which prevented dogs vomiting. The objective biomarkers of nausea, plasma AVP and cortisol identified by our previous characterisation of this low dose cisplatin model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] add weight to the conclusions made based on subjective behavioural observations of nausea.</p><p id="Par37">Cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting has a biphasic time-course in human subjects. The &#x02018;acute&#x02019; phase of nausea and vomiting occurs in the first 24&#x000a0;h following treatment. Nausea and vomiting occurring more than 24&#x000a0;h following treatment is referred to as the &#x02018;delayed phase&#x02019; and can persist for 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The present study focused on the initial &#x02018;acute&#x02019; phase of cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting which is thought to be predominantly peripherally mediated. Cisplatin causes the release of 5-HT from the gut which stimulates abdominal vagal afferent neurons that project to the &#x02018;vomiting centre&#x02019; in the brainstem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Cisplatin emesis can be abolished in dogs by abdominal vagotomy or the systemic administration of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists but not by the central administration of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists into the cerebral ventricles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The &#x02018;delayed&#x02019; phase is mediated mainly by a central mechanism of action. The area postrema (commonly referred to as the chemoreceptor trigger zone) located in the brainstem is thought to be stimulated by cisplatin, its metabolites, or gut peptides released in response to the effects of cisplatin on the intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Ablation of the area postrema in ferrets abolished the delayed emetic response to cisplatin but bilateral vagotomy did not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Nausea, unlike emesis, is a multi-dimensional experience incorporating emotional and affective components in addition to the physiological response. The sensation of nausea is thought to arise from activation of cortical structures involved in conscious perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The mechanisms by which cisplatin induces nausea are less clear. If nausea was solely induced by stimulation of the emetic pathways then it would be expected that abolition of emesis would also abolish nausea, however, this is not the case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The results of the present study show, in the maropitant treated group, that nausea-like behaviour can be detected in the absence of an emetic response.</p><p id="Par39">The low dose cisplatin model used in the present study has greater utility for the investigation of nausea in the dog without the large number of emetic events induced by a clinical dose of cisplatin. A high number of emetic events may bias the observer when judging the severity of nausea as a function of the emesis observed rather than as a distinct sensation with specific associated behaviours, which may be obscured by frequent vomiting and retching. The behavioural assessment in the present study judged the maximum VAS score as the &#x02018;worst possible nausea&#x02019; for the low dose model of cisplatin gained from previous experience with the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This adjustment of the behavioural scale means it is possible for a maximum VAS score to be given and allows for the greatest differentiation of the anti-nausea effects of the anti-emetic drugs tested in the model. Careful habituation of the dogs to the context of the experiment was necessary in order for the main investigator to learn what their normal individual behaviour was within that situation in the absence of cisplatin treatment.</p><p id="Par40">AVP and cortisol have been previously found to be correlates of the behavioural signs of nausea induced by cisplatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] but it was not clear if the emetic response also contributed to the change in these biomarkers. The results of the present study support AVP and cortisol as specific biomarkers of nausea rather than emesis. Complete inhibition of the behavioural signs of nausea in the ondansetron treated group results in reduction of AVP and cortisol to baseline levels whereas complete inhibition of emesis and only partial inhibition of the behavioural aspects of the nausea in the maropitant treated group led to only partial inhibition of AVP and no inhibition of cortisol. AVP appears to provide the more sensitive marker of nausea-like behaviour as partial inhibition of nausea-like behaviour by maropitant was identified through a significantly reduced AVP compared to placebo at t<sub>4.5h</sub>, which was not evident in the cortisol response. The relationship between these nausea biomarkers and the nausea-like behavioural response requires further characterisation in a study using a range of doses of ondansetron and maropitant that describe the full concentration anti-nausea effect relationship of these two drugs more completely than is possible from the data generated by the present study.</p><p id="Par41">D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists, such as metoclopramide, have both central and peripheral mechanisms. They act centrally on D<sub>2</sub> receptors in emetic brainstem regions, such as the area postrema and dorsal vagal complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Peripherally, they are prokinetic, resolving gastric dysrhythmias which are associated with nausea and emesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Metoclopramide also has a weak 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist action providing some of its anti-emetic efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Metoclopramide has previously demonstrated some anti-nausea efficacy in humans receiving cisplatin treatment. Allan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] found that metoclopramide abolished or achieved major control in 26% and 46% of cisplatin treated patients respectively. Metoclopramide also completely controlled nausea in 24% of patients and achieved major control of nausea in 47% of patients; this was increased to 32% and 62% respectively when combined with dexamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Metoclopramide was also found to significantly reduce the duration of nausea induced by cisplatin chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Metoclopramide is used frequently in veterinary medicine to control nausea and vomiting. A dose of 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;mg/kg of metoclopramide administered by subcutaneous injection has been found to reduce cisplatin-induced emesis in the dog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, in the current study metoclopramide did not exhibit any anti-emetic or anti-nausea efficacy and nausea-like behaviours actually had a higher peak compared to placebo. One explanation for this observation could be the extra-pyramidal side effects of the drug increasing restlessness which increased the nausea-like behavior score above that of placebo. Metoclopramide was cleared the fastest of the all three antiemetic drugs. It is possible a higher doses of metoclopramide may have produced a greater anti-emetic and anti-nausea efficacy, however the administered dose of 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg was at the highest end of the recommended dose for dogs which is 0.25&#x02013;0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg every 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and worsening extra-pyamidal side effects are seen in dogs given high doses of metoclopramide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Ondansetron was the first-in-class 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist acting via both central and peripheral mechanisms.

Centrally, blockade of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors on the terminals of vagal inputs into emetic brain stem regions prevents emetic stimuli from reaching the vomiting centre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Ondansetron significantly reduced the number of episodes of emesis, increased the latency to emesis and decreased nausea VAS scores compared to placebo in patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The level of control of nausea and emesis was significantly greater with ondansetron compared to metoclopramide and ondansetron treatment was preferred by patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Ondansetron provided greatest efficacy in the control of acute nausea following cisplatin treatment, whereas metoclopramide was found to be significantly more efficacious at controlling delayed nausea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The combination of ondansetron with dexamethasone further improved the level of control of nausea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Ondansetron also exhibits anti-emetic and anti-nausea efficacy in animal models of nausea and vomiting. Ondansetron significantly inhibits emesis induced by cisplatin in ferrets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and by methotrexate in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In a lycorine model of nausea and vomiting in beagle dogs, ondansetron significantly reduced emesis and also exhibited significant anti-nausea activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">NK<sub>1</sub> antagonists are the most recent class of antiemetic drugs, aprepitant being approved by the FDA in 2003 for use in humans and maropitant being approved in 2007 for use in the dog. The anti-emetic properties are thought to occur as a result of the blockade of NK<sub>1</sub> receptors in emetic brainstem regions, including the area postrema and the nucleus tractus solitarius [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The addition of aprepitant to standard antiemetic therapy with dexamethasone and a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist improved the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting especially in the delayed phase. Aprepitant significantly reduced emesis overall and in both the acute and delayed phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Nausea was significantly reduced overall and in the delayed phase but not the acute phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In a clinical dose (70&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) cisplatin model of nausea and vomiting in the dog, maropitant significantly reduced emesis and had anti-nausea efficacy suppressing nausea-like behaviours across the full time-course and significantly decreasing the peak nausea response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In the present study, maropitant exhibited less anti-nausea efficacy than reported by de la Puente Redondo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It is possible that maropitant may have greater efficacy against the more severe nausea induced by the higher dose of cisplatin. For this explanation to be correct would require severe nausea to be induced by different mechanisms at higher doses of cisplatin which seems unlikely. An alternative explanation is that the significant reduction of emesis induced by maropitant treatment may have caused a bias towards reduced nausea scores in the high dose cisplatin study, a bias that is not so much of a problem in the low dose cisplatin model used in the present study. Another difference between the present study and that of de la Puente Redondo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] is the route of administration of maropitant. In the present study maropitant was administered by i.v. infusion whereas it was given subcutaneously in the study by de la Puente Redondo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The alternative route of administration used in the present study leads to a higher initial concentration of maropitant and a shorter half-life compared to s.c. administration. Maropitant plasma concentrations could have been at sub-therapeutic concentrations during the nausea response in the present study. However, this is improbable as an antiemetic and anti-nausea effect demonstrated 19&#x000a0;h following administration 1&#x000a0;mg/kg maropitant s.c. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] when plasma concentrations would certainly be lower than those during the nausea response in the present study.</p><p id="Par44">The results of the present study suggest that both 5-HT<sub>3</sub> and NK<sub>1</sub> receptors are an integral part of the emetic pathway activated by cisplatin which results in activation of the emetic reflex. The sensation of nausea is produced in cortical forebrain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], increased activity was recorded in the left amygdala, the ventral putamen and the putative locus coeruleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Nausiogenic signals travel from the vomiting centre via rostrally projecting pathways to the forebrain and nuclei controlling the physiological response to nausea sensation (e.g. salivating, restlessness). The ability of ondansetron to reduce cisplatin-induced nausea would suggest that 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors have a role in transmitting nausea stimuli, either from the brainstem, the periphery or both, whereas NK<sub>1</sub> receptors are limited to a central emetic triggering mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par45">In a low dose cisplatin model of nausea and emesis in the dog, NK<sub>1</sub> antagonist demonstrated good anti-emetic activity but limited anti-nausea effect. The 5-HT<sub>3</sub>receptor antagonist ondansetron was most effective at treating both cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting with associated reductions in nausea biomarkers AVP and cortisol. Further study using escalating doses of anti-emetics as interventions to inhibit nausea induced by different stimuli would be beneficial to determine the full PK/PD relationship of the anti-nausea effects of anti-emetics and explore the utility of nausea biomarkers in studying the pathways that can give rise to nausea.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Yu-Mei Chang for her assistance with statistical tests and Frances Benstead, Abbe Martyn and Kate Thirgood for their excellent technical assistance.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par46">Financial support was provided by the Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council (BBSRC Industrial Case&#x000a0;Partnership Studentship&#x000a0;number BB/I53237X/1) and Zoetis Ltd.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par47">The datasets used and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>HK, LP and JE designed the research study.
