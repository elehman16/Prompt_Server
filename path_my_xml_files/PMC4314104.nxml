Post-hoc analyses were carried out using data from an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vilazodone 40&#x02009;mg/day in adults with major depressive disorder (NCT01473394). The primary efficacy endpoint was a mean change in the Montgomery&#x02013;&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score; additional measures included the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA) scores. In addition to treatment response (MADRS&#x02265;50% improvement), post-hoc analyses were carried out for remission of depressive symptoms [MADRS score&#x02264;10; MADRS&#x02264;5 (complete remission)], anxiety symptoms (HAMA&#x02264;7), and combined depression and anxiety symptoms (MADRS/HAMA&#x02264;10/&#x02264;7), as well as for overall symptom severity (CGI-S=1). Odds ratios (ORs) and numbers needed to treat (NNTs) were also calculated. Significant outcomes were obtained with vilazodone versus placebo for MADRS response (50.6 vs. 33.3%, OR=2.04, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, NNT=6), remission (34.0 vs. 21.8%, OR=1.82, <italic>P</italic>=0.003, NNT=9), and complete remission (18.2 vs. 8.3%, OR=2.42, <italic>P</italic>=0.002, NNT=11). More patients receiving vilazodone rather than placebo also met remission criteria for HAMA (48.8 vs. 35.2%, OR=1.82, <italic>P</italic>=0.002, NNT=8), MADRS/HAMA (32.1 vs. 20.4%, OR=1.83, <italic>P</italic>=0.004, NNT=9), and CGI-S (24.1 vs. 11.5%, OR=2.41, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, NNT=8). Treatment with vilazodone 40&#x02009;mg/day may help adult patients with major depressive disorder achieve remission of depression and/or anxiety symptoms.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>major depressive disorder</kwd><kwd>remission</kwd><kwd>serotonin reuptake inhibitor</kwd><kwd>vilazodone</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often recommended as first-line therapies in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD; <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 2010</xref>). It has been postulated, however, that the acute and long-term effects of these drugs may be limited due to autoregulatory feedback mechanisms involving the 5-HT<sub>1</sub> class of serotonergic receptors (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Dawson, 2013</xref>). One approach to this issue has been the investigation of augmentation therapies, such as the addition of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> or 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> agonists to SSRIs in patients with MDD (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Ruf and Bhagwagar, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Kato and Chang, 2013</xref>). Another approach has been the development of medications with additional mechanisms of action, such as vilazodone, an SSRI and partial 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor agonist that is currently approved for the treatment of MDD in adults (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Forest Laboratories Inc., 2014</xref>). In addition to potentially improving the antidepressant effects, targeting 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors may help reduce the anxiety symptoms that are often associated with MDD (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Rao and Zisook, 2009</xref>). Therefore, the role of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor in the treatment of depression and anxiety symptoms associated with mood disorders continues to be explored (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Popova and Naumenko, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The efficacy of vilazodone in the treatment of MDD was established in two 8-week, phase III pivotal trials (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Rickels <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Khan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), both of which used change from baseline in the Montgomery&#x02013;&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score as the primary efficacy outcome. Both studies showed a significant mean decreases with vilazodone in this primary outcome measure, indicating improvements in depressive symptomatology. Significant improvements in depression-related anxiety symptoms and overall disease severity were also found, on the basis of the mean change in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA) total score and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) score, respectively. These findings from the pivotal studies were further supported by the results from a more recent phase IV clinical trial (NCT01473394; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Croft <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) in which patients were randomized to 40&#x02009;mg/day vilazodone or placebo for 8 weeks of double-blind treatment. Compared with placebo, vilazodone-treated patients in this trial also experienced significantly greater mean improvements from baseline in MADRS total, HAMA total, and CGI-S scores.</p><p>Although significantly greater reductions compared with placebo on depression rating scales is an important criterion for establishing antidepressant efficacy, the goal of treatment is for patients to achieve clinically meaningful outcomes. Symptom remission is an important outcome in depression treatment and is associated with improved psychosocial functioning, lower risk of relapse and recurrence, and reduced healthcare utilization among patients with MDD (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Thase <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Rush <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Remission is generally considered a fundamental goal of treatment, and several months of antidepressant therapy may be needed for a patient to achieve remission (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Sobocki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, longitudinal studies with standard-of-care antidepressant treatment have found that early remission (i.e. 6&#x02013;8 weeks) in MDD patients is associated with greater reduction in overall symptom severity, fewer residual symptoms, and greater likelihood of long-term remission (6&#x02013;12 months; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Roca <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Ciudad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Previous pooled analyses of the data from the two pivotal phase III trials showed that vilazodone-treated patients had significantly higher rates of remission, defined as MADRS total score &#x0003c;10 (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Citrome, 2012</xref>) or &#x02264;10 (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Khan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) at week 8 relative to placebo-treated patients. A post-hoc analysis of data from the phase IV vilazodone trial was conducted to further evaluate symptom remission. Several different measures were used in this post-hoc analysis, guided by the concept of no or minimal disease-related symptoms typically used to define remission in MDD clinical trials (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Rush <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Sobocki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). On the basis of the efficacy assessments included in the phase IV trial, the outcomes evaluated in this post-hoc analysis were remission of depressive symptoms (MADRS, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery and Asberg, 1979</xref>), anxiety symptoms (HAMA, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton, 1959</xref>), or a combination of both (MADRS/HAMA), as well as the overall disease burden (CGI-S). The results of this report are intended to provide additional information about the effects of vilazodone in adult patients with MDD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was conducted in full compliance with the Food and Drug Administration guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by institutional review boards; all patients provided written informed consent. Detailed methods for this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study have been published previously (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Croft <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Key highlights of these methods are summarized below.</p><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study was conducted at 14 centers in the USA. It included male and female outpatients, between 18 and 70 years of age, who met the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, 4th ed. &#x02013; text revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for MDD. Patients were required to have an ongoing major depressive episode (&#x02265;8 to &#x02264;12 months), a BMI between 18 and 40&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and a MADRS total score of at least 26. Typical exclusion criteria for antidepressant clinical trials were applied, including the presence of DSM-IV-TR Axis I disorders other than MDD, significant psychiatric diagnoses (e.g. bipolar, obsessive&#x02013;compulsive, psychotic, or cognitive disorder), substance abuse/dependence, and suicide risk. Patients with secondary comorbid generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder, and/or specific phobias were allowed to participate in the study. Treatment-related exclusion criteria were: nonresponse to at least two antidepressants, intolerance or hypersensitivity to vilazodone, serotonin&#x02013;norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, use of psychoactive drugs (e.g. antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines), and recent substance abuse or dependence.</p><p>After a no-drug screening period (1&#x02013;4 weeks), eligible patients were randomized (1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1) to receive 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with placebo or vilazodone 40&#x02009;mg/day, followed by a 1-week double-blind down-taper period. Vilazodone was initiated at 10&#x02009;mg/day (week 1), increased to 20&#x02009;mg/day (week 2), and then increased to a final stable dose of 40&#x02009;mg/day (weeks 3&#x02013;8). Patients were instructed to take all study drugs once daily with food. Blinding was established using computer-generated randomization codes. All investigators and patients remained blind during the treatment and taper periods.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy assessments</title><p>The prospectively defined primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the change from baseline in MADRS total score. Other predefined efficacy outcomes in this study included changes from baseline to week 8 in the CGI-S score (secondary endpoint) and the HAMA total score. MDD symptom response, defined as at least 50% improvement from baseline in MADRS total score, was also included as an efficacy outcome.</p><p>The effects of vilazodone on remission were evaluated in post-hoc analyses. Remission of depressive symptoms was defined as a MADRS total score of 10 or less, with &#x02018;complete remission&#x02019; defined as a MADRS total score of 5 or less. Remission of anxiety symptoms was defined as a HAMA total score of 7 or less; the number of patients meeting the criteria for both MADRS and HAMA remission (MADRS total score &#x02264;10 and HAMA total score &#x02264;7, respectively) was also measured. Global disease remission was defined by a CGI-S score of 1 (normal, not at all ill) at week 8.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Efficacy analyses were based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all randomized patients who received one or more dose of the study drug and had at least one postbaseline assessment (MADRS, HAMA, or CGI-S, depending on the analysis). Changes from baseline to the end of double-blind treatment were analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures with treatment group, study center, visit, and the treatment-group-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline value and the baseline-value-by-visit interaction as covariates.</p><p>Response and remission rates at the end of treatment were analyzed through a logistic regression model with treatment group and baseline value as explanatory variables, with missing values imput using last observation carried forward. Response and remission by study visit were analyzed on the basis of observed cases and a generalized linear mixed model based on a logit link function, with a random intercept and fixed terms of treatment group, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and baseline value. If the generalized linear mixed model did not converge, a logistic regression model with treatment group and baseline value as explanatory variables was used on the basis of the last observation carried forward approach. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs are presented for response and remission. Numbers needed to treat (NNTs) to observe one additional favorable response or remission outcome (at end of treatment and at each study visit) were calculated on the basis of the observed risk differences between vilazodone and placebo, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) reported if the boundaries were finite.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 505 patients were included in the ITT population; demographics were similar between treatment groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

However, as these average score changes do not necessarily indicate whether response or remission took place, analyzing the proportion of individual patients who achieve remission may provide a more comprehensive clinical context for the effects of antidepressant treatment. Therefore, post-hoc analyses of data from this phase IV trial were carried out using several definitions of remission. Overall, the results of these analyses showed that vilazodone-treated patients experienced remission, with significant differences from placebo in outcomes that measured depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and overall disease severity (all <italic>P</italic>s&#x0003c;0.01).</p><p>Depression symptom remission was defined as a MADRS total score of up to 10 at week 8, which, like the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD, cutoff of&#x02264;7), represents 1&#x02009;SD from the mean score in healthy controls (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Zimmerman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). As defined in other MDD studies (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Wade <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), a more stringent cutoff MADRS total score of up to 5 was also used to identify patients with complete remission. The HAMA total score of up to 7 has been used as a definition of remission for anxiety disorders (e.g. GAD) to indicate no or minimal levels of anxiety symptoms (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Doyle and Pollack, 2003</xref>). The CGI-S is a global measure that allows clinicians to take into account various factors that may affect overall disease severity, including symptom intensity, quality of life, comorbidities, patient distress, and functional impairment. As a single-item measure that uses simple responses, the CGI-S may be a more efficient instrument to use in clinical settings compared with either MADRS or HAMA. A CGI-S score of 1 is defined as &#x02018;normal, not ill at all&#x02019; and is commonly used as a threshold of remission in depression (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Riedel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). On the basis of the percentage of patients in both treatment arms who met these different criteria, the most stringent outcome measures appear to have been MADRS complete remission (vilazodone, 18.2%; placebo, 8.3%; <italic>P</italic>=0.002) and CGI-S remission (vilazodone, 24.1%; placebo, 11.5%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Notably, however, these two measures also had the highest ORs for vilazodone versus placebo (2.4 each), suggesting that, although the remission rates may have been numerically low, the treatment effects of vilazodone on symptom resolution were robust. These results also suggest that placebo effects may be smaller when such stringent measures are used.</p><p>In this analysis, the NNT represents the number of patients who would require treatment with vilazodone to observe one additional responder/remitter compared with placebo. An NNT of up to 10, which represents an absolute risk difference of 10% or greater between treatment groups, is generally considered to indicate a clinically relevant advantage for an antidepressant therapy (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery and Moller, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Citrome and Ketter, 2013</xref>). For MADRS response (&#x02265;50% improvement) and remission (total score&#x02264;10), the risk differences between vilazodone and placebo were 17.3 and 12.2%, respectively, which corresponded to NNTs of 6 and 9. The NNTs for the remaining remission outcomes ranged from 8 (CGI-S, HAMA) to 11 (MADRS complete remission), suggesting that there were clinically relevant treatment effects across these measures.</p><p>The results presented in this report are consistent with those of earlier post-hoc pooled analyses of the two pivotal trials that showed statistically significant response and remission rates in vilazodone patients relative to placebo patients (Citrome, 2012; Khan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014). Pooling data increases the statistical power, which enhances sensitivity to detect treatment effects, but may also overpower an analysis and yield results that are statistically significant because of a larger sample size rather than a greater magnitude of treatment effect. This post-hoc analysis of data from the phase IV vilazodone trial supports the results of the pooled analyses from those two trials; the NNTs for response and remission in this study were comparable, albeit better than those seen in the previous pooled analyses (response NNTs, 8&#x02013;9; remission NNTs, 14&#x02013;15; <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Citrome, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Khan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). No definitive explanation can be given for this discrepancy among the trials without further analyses of factors that might affect response or remission, such as socioeconomic status, symptom type and severity, and/or comorbid medical conditions (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Papakostas and Fava, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Jain <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Although study designs were generally similar across the trials, there are some differences that may be notable. For example, this trial only allowed patients with a secondary diagnosis of GAD, whereas the pivotal trials allowed patients with comorbid primary GAD.</p><p>Statistically significant between-group differences were detected by week 6 for response (placebo, 30.5%; vilazodone 50.0%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001; NNT=6) and remission (placebo, 15.5%; vilazodone, 29.9%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001; NNT=7). Although it is generally acknowledged that remission may require prolonged therapy and that higher remission rates can be achieved with a longer treatment duration (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Schatzberg, 1999</xref>), the 8-week outcomes found with vilazodone may also have important clinical implications. In a prospective, longitudinal, multicenter study of adult outpatients with MDD who were treated with antidepressants, 38.2% had an early response (&#x02265;50% improvement in HAMD total score at week 6) and 20.5% had early remission (HAMD total score&#x02264;7 at week 6) (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Ciudad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). A &#x02018;good outcome&#x02019; in this longitudinal study, defined as remission that was achieved by 6 months of treatment and was sustained until 12 months, was found in 76.1% of early responders (OR=4.14 vs. nonearly responders) and 81.1% of early remitters (OR=4.72 vs. nonearly remitters). Early response and remission in this study were also associated with active employment, absence of physical comorbidities, and improved functioning. In another prospective, clinic-based study that defined remission on the basis of the Self-Rated Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Roca <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), outpatients with MDD who remitted after 6&#x02013;8 weeks of treatment had significantly fewer residual symptoms and significantly greater improvement in global severity than patients who required 16&#x02013;20 weeks of treatment to achieve remission.</p><p>Findings from these observational studies cannot be directly translated to the current study population in which significant rates of response and remission were found in vilazodone-treated patients after 6 weeks of treatment. However, they do suggest that with ongoing vilazodone treatment, these patients may have continued to experience favorable clinical outcomes. Moreover, the results of post-hoc analyses of the data from this phase IV trial are consistent with the results for sustained response, which was included as a secondary efficacy measure along with change in CGI-S score (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Croft <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Sustained response was defined as MADRS total score of 12 or less for at least the last two consecutive visits during the double-blind treatment period. The percentage of patients who had a sustained response (placebo, 17.1%; vilazodone, 27.3%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) was similar to the remission rates at week 6 (MADRS total score&#x02264;10: placebo, 15.5%; vilazodone, 29.9%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>A limitation of this post-hoc analysis is that it is based on data from an 8-week clinical trial that was not designed nor statistically powered to evaluate remission. Because vilazodone was titrated, exposure to the full therapeutic dose was limited to 6 weeks, making this study difficult to indirectly compare with studies on antidepressants in which exposure times could be longer (and thus with more opportunities for response and remission to occur). In addition, although safety and tolerability were not analyzed for this report, these issues should also be considered when evaluating the potential merits of vilazodone treatment. However, details on the number needed to harm, which can be used to describe key tolerability outcomes, have been published elsewhere (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Citrome, 2012</xref>). Finally, although this phase IV trial was useful for supporting the results of the prior pivotal studies, it did not include any active comparators that could further clarify the clinical relevance of this medication.</p><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Remission of depression and anxiety symptoms is an important treatment goal in patients with MDD. On the basis of post-hoc analyses of data from a recent phase IV trial using several different remission measures, statistically significant outcomes were found for vilazodone 40&#x02009;mg/day versus placebo. The NNTs for these measures ranged from 8 to 11, indicating clinically meaningful treatment effects for symptoms of depression and MDD-associated anxiety, as well as for improving overall disease burden.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Adam Ruth at Prescott Medical Communications Group (Chicago, Illinois, USA) for assistance in designing the post-hoc analyses, and Mildred Bahn for writing and editorial assistance.
