The 6-month <italic>PULSE Program</italic> intervention focused on weight loss, diet, and exercise for T2DM prevention. A process evaluation questionnaire was administered at 6 months to examine recruitment and selection processes, and acceptability of the intervention&#x02019;s delivery and content. Associations between self-monitoring and selected outcomes were assessed using Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation. <bold>Results:</bold> A pragmatic recruitment and online screening process was effective in identifying men at high risk of T2DM (prediabetes prevalence 70%). Men reported the trial was appealing because it targeted weight loss, T2DM prevention, and getting fit, and because it was perceived as &#x0201c;doable&#x0201d; and tailored for men. The intervention was considered acceptable, with men reporting high overall satisfaction (83%) and engagement with the various components. Adherence to self-monitoring was poor, with only 13% meeting requisite criteria. However, significant associations were observed between weekly self-monitoring of weight and change in weight (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = &#x02212;.47, <italic>p</italic> = .004) and waist circumference (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = &#x02212;.38, <italic>p</italic> = .026). Men reported they would have preferred more intervention contact, for example, by phone or email. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Gender-targeted, self-administered lifestyle interventions are feasible, appealing, and satisfying for men. Future studies should explore the effects of additional non-face-to-face contact on motivation, accountability, self-monitoring adherence, and program efficacy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>prevention</kwd><kwd>diet</kwd><kwd>physical activity</kwd><kwd>process evaluation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-1557988317701783"><funding-source id="funding1-1557988317701783"><institution-wrap><institution>Hunter Medical Research Institute</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001081</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-1557988317701783">HMRI 11-12</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Diabetes is a global health concern (<xref rid="bibr17-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Guariguata et al., 2014</xref>). In 2014, the prevalence of diabetes was estimated at 382 million people (8.3% of the world&#x02019;s population) and expected to rise to 592 million people (10.1% of the world&#x02019;s population) by 2035 (<xref rid="bibr17-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Guariguata et al., 2014</xref>). Several high-quality trials have demonstrated that lifestyle interventions are able to substantially lower type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) incidence over the medium (3&#x02013;6 years; <xref rid="bibr25-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Knowler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr47-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Tuomilehto et al., 2001</xref>) and long term (10 years; <xref rid="bibr26-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Knowler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr27-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Lindstrom et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, among these seminal trials and more generally in the wider T2DM prevention (<xref rid="bibr16-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Glechner et al., 2014</xref>) and weight loss (<xref rid="bibr39-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Pagoto et al., 2012</xref>) literature, men are a consistently underrepresented group. This is of great concern given that men appear to be at greater risk of developing T2DM (<xref rid="bibr12-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) and display higher overall prevalence (<xref rid="bibr24-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">International Diabetes Federation, 2013</xref>), particularly during middle age (<xref rid="bibr46-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">The DECODE Study Group, 2003</xref>), when compared to women. Effective strategies to improve the recruitment and acceptability of lifestyle interventions for men are required. Previous research has indicated that designing weight loss interventions to specifically cater for the needs and preferences of men may improve recruitment, engagement, and satisfaction (<xref rid="bibr21-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Hunt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr35-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bibr36-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">2011a</xref>, <xref rid="bibr37-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>, <xref rid="bibr32-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, <xref rid="bibr38-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr42-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Robertson et al., 2014</xref>). To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, there are no previous studies investigating gender-targeted (men only) and tailored lifestyle interventions for T2DM prevention.</p><p>In addition, concern exists about the cost of delivery, scalability, and sustainability of lifestyle interventions when translated into community settings (<xref rid="bibr14-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Dunkley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Schwarz et al., 2012</xref>). T2DM prevention programs have commonly involved intensive face-to-face approaches, which create substantial participant burden (time and travel), and require significant resourcing (staffing and facility use; <xref rid="bibr43-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Schwarz et al., 2012</xref>). Effective programs that employ less time and resource intensive approaches are needed (<xref rid="bibr14-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Dunkley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Schwarz et al., 2012</xref>). Self-administered (self-directed) online or print-based intervention delivery modes are suggested as alternatives to intensive face-to-face approaches, as they have great potential to overcome the aforementioned concerns (<xref rid="bibr14-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Dunkley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Schwarz et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, research also suggests men may prefer lifestyle programs that are self-administered (<xref rid="bibr39-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Pagoto et al., 2012</xref>), as they are perceived to be more flexible and less time-consuming (<xref rid="bibr37-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al., 2011b</xref>). To date, there is limited evidence regarding self-administered lifestyle interventions for T2DM prevention (<xref rid="bibr43-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Schwarz et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Given the paucity of information regarding gender-targeted and self-administered lifestyle interventions for T2DM prevention, process evaluation of trials exploring these approaches could provide valuable insights to inform future research and translation. Process evaluation may address aspects of trial design (e.g., recruitment and retention) and intervention design (e.g., acceptability, engagement, adherence, and satisfaction; <xref rid="bibr31-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr38-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al., 2014</xref>). When paired with outcome data, process information may provide a more comprehensive understanding of complex lifestyle intervention trials (<xref rid="bibr31-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2015</xref>). We recently conducted a 6-month randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the efficacy of the T2DM <italic>Prevention Using LifeStyle Education (PULSE) Program</italic> (<xref rid="bibr2-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Aguiar et al., 2014b</xref>, <xref rid="bibr4-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), a gender-targeted, self-administered, multicomponent (weight loss, diet modification, physical activity) lifestyle intervention for men at high risk of developing T2DM. Detailed efficacy data are reported elsewhere (<xref rid="bibr4-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Aguiar et al., 2016</xref>) and summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1557988317701783">Table 1</xref>. At 6 months, significant intervention effects were observed for weight (primary outcome; &#x02212;5.50 kg, 95% CI [&#x02212;7.40, &#x02212;3.61], <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; &#x02212;0.2%, 95% CI [&#x02212;0.3, &#x02212;0.1], &#x02212;2.2 mmol/mol, 95% CI [&#x02212;3.3, &#x02212;1.1], <italic>p</italic> = .002), and several secondary outcomes. The aims of this process evaluation were to examine (a) the effectiveness of the recruitment and selection processes, reasons why men chose to enroll in the trial, and the characteristics of men who enrolled; and (b) the acceptability of the intervention program&#x02019;s delivery and content in regards to the perceptions, engagement, adherence, retention, and satisfaction of men completing the intervention.</p><table-wrap id="table1-1557988317701783" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Summary of <italic>PULSE Program</italic> Intervention Components and Qualitative and Quantitative Outcomes.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1557988317701783-table1"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention component</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Content delivery or self-monitoring</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Qualitative evaluation</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Objective measure (<xref rid="bibr4-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Aguiar et al., 2016</xref>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">15-min program orientation (face-to-face)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Content</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" rowspan="1">The <italic>SHED-IT Weight Loss Program</italic></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;The <italic>SHED-IT Weight Loss DVD for Men</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Content</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Questionnaire</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table-fn2-1557988317701783">**</xref>, waist<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table-fn2-1557988317701783">**</xref></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;The <italic>SHED-IT Weight Loss Handbook for Men</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Content</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Questionnaire</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table-fn2-1557988317701783">**</xref>, waist<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table-fn2-1557988317701783">**</xref></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;The <italic>SHED-IT Weight Loss Logbook for Men</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Self-monitoring</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Questionnaire, adherence data</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table-fn2-1557988317701783">**</xref>, waist<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table-fn2-1557988317701783">**</xref></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Tape measure</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Self-monitoring</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Not evaluated</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Waist<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table-fn2-1557988317701783">**</xref></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Calorieking<sup>TM</sup> self-monitoring tool user guide</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Content/self-monitoring</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Questionnaire</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Calorieking<sup>TM</sup> &#x0201c;Calorie Fat and Carbohydrate Counter&#x0201d;

This was a pragmatic choice to reduce the time and cost burden of using diagnostic blood tests to screen for prediabetes prior to study entry.

Participants were required to provide written informed consent. The recruitment target was 94 men (37 per group for 80% power to detect a 4-kg difference in mean weight change at 6 months and allowing for 20% loss to follow-up). The retention target was 80% at 6 months, a commonly used target for assessing methodological quality of lifestyle intervention RCTs (<xref rid="bibr1-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Aguiar et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref rid="bibr50-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Men from the Hunter region, New South Wales, Australia, were recruited from August 2012 to March 2013.

This information supports previous studies that suggest men prefer programs that are self-administered (<xref rid="bibr37-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref rid="bibr39-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Pagoto et al., 2012</xref>) and gender targeted (<xref rid="bibr37-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al., 2011b</xref>), and value credible sources of information (<xref rid="bibr44-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2008</xref>).

Additional support for the appeal of the trial is reflected by the very high retention (88%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1557988317701783">Figure 1</xref>) in the wait-list control group who were provided with the <italic>PULSE Program</italic> on completion of the 6-month control period.</p></sec><sec id="section11-1557988317701783"><title>Effectiveness of obtaining the target population</title><p>The required study sample size was achieved, with an appropriate sample of men (<italic>N</italic> = 101) at high risk for developing T2DM commencing the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1557988317701783">Figure 1</xref>). Recruitment was considerably slower than anticipated, with men recruited in four separate cohorts over a 7-month period to achieve the target sample size. Slow recruitment was partly due to the large proportion of men who were screened as ineligible for the trial.

Just over half the men thought the website was easy to use (58% agree/strongly agree); the remainder either disagreed (25%) or held a neutral position (17%). Dissatisfaction was likely due to the time it took to record diet and exercise behaviors, with most men reporting that using the website for self-monitoring was time-consuming (67% agree/strongly agree).</p><p>Part of the variation in satisfaction level and reports of excessive time burden by men could potentially be explained by varying levels of computer/internet competency, as observed by <xref rid="bibr29-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">McConnon, Kirk, and Ransley (2009)</xref>. Additionally, the provision of multiple self-monitoring components (<italic>SHED-IT Weight Loss Handbook for Men, PULSE Exercise Support Book for Men</italic>, Calorieking<sup>TM</sup> online) may have contributed to these mixed findings. Based on this feedback, future studies might consider individually tailoring self-monitoring options for the participant&#x02019;s preferences (e.g., paper-based, website, mobile phone app). Further, diet and exercise self-monitoring websites/apps that include integration with commercially available physical activity monitors might offer timesaving benefits, providing they are appropriate for the target group (e.g., age, cognitive ability, computer/mobile competency, and ethnic/cultural background). Also, while usability is one consideration, it is also important that self-monitoring tools utilize high-quality food and exercise databases, and provide high-quality information and feedback.</p></sec><sec id="section19-1557988317701783"><title>Self-administration versus face-to-face or additional contact</title><p>The only face-to-face component of the <italic>PULSE Program</italic> was the initial 15 min orientation describing the program and the resources. There was no other contact (phone, email, text) with participants other than scheduling assessments. There were no reminders, encouragement, opportunity to ask questions, or support. Slightly more than half of the men (55% agree/strongly) reported that they would have preferred more face-to-face contact (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1557988317701783">Table 3</xref>).

This finding is consistent with previous evaluations of the <italic>SHED-IT Weight Loss Program</italic> (<xref rid="bibr36-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref rid="bibr37-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref rid="bibr38-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al., 2014</xref>;).

</p><p>Common strategies used to foster social (peer) support in online weight loss programs include discussion forums and chat groups. These features are purported to offer a source of encouragement, accountability, motivation, information, and shared experience that may assist individuals in successful weight loss (<xref rid="bibr22-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Hwang et al., 2010</xref>).

Interestingly, their study population was predominately female (93.8%). In contrast, previous studies by our group have found online forums to be underutilized (<xref rid="bibr36-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al., 2011a</xref>), with men reporting that they viewed their weight loss as a personal journey (<xref rid="bibr36-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al., 2011a</xref>). Future research might investigate the influence of gender on social support use (e.g., discussion forums, chat groups) in online weight loss programs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section20-1557988317701783"><title>Strengths and Limitations of This Process Evaluation</title><p>This study has several strengths, including a quantitative and qualitative process evaluation exploring the reasons why men, an understudied population in the diabetes and weight loss literatures, enrolled in lifestyle intervention, and their perceptions, engagement, and satisfaction with a gender-targeted, self-administered lifestyle intervention. A limitation of the current process evaluation is that adherence and process data were only collected from men who returned for follow-up at 6 months, resulting in small sample size. Further, the results are not representative of men who withdrew from the study. In addition, logbook reporting of exercise behaviors was poor; therefore, associations between self-monitoring compliance and change in outcomes should be interpreted with caution. Another limitation was that the perceptions, engagement, and satisfaction of men were assessed using a questionnaire that included Likert scale items and open-ended questions. The process evaluation could have been strengthened by inclusion of semistructured qualitative face-to-face interviews, focus group discussions, or telephone interviews.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section21-1557988317701783"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The aim of this process evaluation of the <italic>PULSE Program</italic> RCT was to assess the effectiveness of the trial&#x02019;s recruitment and selection procedures, and the acceptability of the intervention&#x02019;s content and delivery. The pragmatic approach for the screening of men, which included the AUSDRISK screening tool (<xref rid="bibr12-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2010</xref>), was effective in identifying men at high risk for developing T2DM (<xref rid="bibr3-1557988317701783" ref-type="bibr">Aguiar et al., 2015</xref>), but also identified men who were at lower risk and interested in enrolling in a lifestyle intervention. This approach could be readily adopted in community settings to identify men who might benefit from lifestyle intervention, while reducing costs associated with blood biomarker screening for prediabetes. Further, the gender-targeted approach was successful, with men reporting the study was appealing because it focused on weight loss, T2DM prevention, and getting fit, and because the intervention itself was tailored for men and self-administered. Future lifestyle intervention trials targeting men should consider a gender-targeted approach to maximize program appeal.</p><p>The intervention program&#x02019;s delivery and content were considered acceptable based on men&#x02019;s perceptions, engagement, retention, and satisfaction. Overall, men enjoyed the <italic>PULSE Program</italic> intervention and believed their health was improved as a result of their participation. The program&#x02019;s diet and physical activity messages were generally well implemented; however, adherence to paper-based self-monitoring was poor, with men reporting that self-monitoring tasks were time-consuming. Future studies should consider the use of mobile phone apps for self-monitoring of diet and physical activity, provided they are appropriate for the target audience. Also, apps that integrate with wearable physical activity monitors might be preferred, as they may reduce the time burden of self-monitoring and improve adherence. Further, men reported they would have liked more intervention contact, including non-face-to-face communication&#x02014;for example, SMS, email, and video messaging&#x02014;to supplement the self-administered program. These low-cost strategies may assist with engagement, motivation, and accountability, while maintaining the advantages of a self-administered delivery mode, such as scalability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Additional_783.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e2357" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the Hunter Medical Research Institute (HMRI), Lions Club District 201N3 Diabetes Foundation, and Aurizon Holdings Limited for supporting this project.
