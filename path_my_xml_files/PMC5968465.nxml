Despite global evidence of educational interventions in improving teachers&#x02019; knowledge and attitudes regarding mental health, this area remains under researched in Pakistan. This paper presents a study protocol of a pilot randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a teacher training intervention for improving mental health literacy and self-efficacy among school teachers in urban Lahore, Pakistan.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The randomized controlled trial will follow the CONSORT guidelines. Participants will be allocated to the Intervention group (receiving the World Health Organization, Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO-EMRO) School Mental Health Manual-based intervention in three 6-h, face-to-face sessions) or a waitlist control group (not receiving training during the study period). Participants will be teachers of private schools with similar broad demographic characteristics in an inner city area of Lahore. The primary outcome measures for the trial is teachers&#x02019; mental health literacy. It will be assessed by using the previously applied (during WHO training of Master Trainers) self-administered questionnaire in both groups pre and post training and at 3&#x000a0;months&#x02019; follow-up. Secondary outcomes include: for teachers: Teachers&#x02019; self-efficacy (assessed by the Teachers&#x02019; Sense of Self Efficacy Scale (TSES) short form.); for students (11&#x02013;16&#x000a0;years): socio-emotional skills and psychological problems measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (assessed at baseline and 3&#x000a0;months post intervention); for schools: the WHO School Psychosocial Profile Questionnaire (baseline and 3&#x000a0;months post intervention).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Given the high prevalence of child mental health problems, stigma and lack of services, it is important to consider alternate avenues for promoting positive mental health among youth. This pilot study should establish the effectiveness of the WHO-EMRO School Mental Health Manual-based Intervention improving teacher&#x02019;s mental health literacy and helping them to learn practical steps that can be implemented at low cost in school settings.

Almost 35% of population is under the age of 14 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Child and adolescent mental health thus needs to be considered and emphasized as an integral component of overall health and growth of this young population. The high prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] along with stigma of psychiatric problems and limited child and adolescent mental health services in the country, makes schools a natural platform for mental health promotion. The World Health Organization (WHO) also identifies the promotion of emotional health and well-being as a core feature of their health-promoting school initiative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Schools can play an important role in promoting positive mental health, reducing stigma, raising awareness among teachers, parents and children about mental health issues as well as identifying and supporting youth experiencing mental health difficulties.</p><p id="Par10">Teachers&#x02019; role in the school mental health initiatives cannot be overemphasized. Teachers&#x02019; own knowledge and beliefs regarding mental health influence the way that they respond to students&#x02019; mental health crises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Studies suggest that teachers feel overwhelmed and incompetent to address mental health needs of their student due to their incompetence and lack of knowledge and skills in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Teachers&#x02019; education is identified as an effective mental health intervention in school settings promoting positive mental health and a sense of connectedness among stakeholders and facilitating student learning, thus improving the overall school atmosphere. Educational interventions involving teachers have shown significant improvement in teachers&#x02019; knowledge and attitudes regarding mental health and better accuracy of teacher identification of children and adolescents with mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Knowledge improvement, reduction of stigma, and confidence in providing support to students as well as indirect positive effects on students were observed in a cluster randomized trial of mental health first-aid training of high school teachers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, mental health initiatives in schools help teachers to feel less stressed and be more satisfied with their role, and to save costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Although the importance of school for mental health promotion and early identification of mental health problems and teachers&#x02019; training in mental health has been evident for quite some time and has gained significant momentum in the West, it is almost non-existent in developing countries including Pakistan. Research from Pakistan on school mental health is very limited. In one study done in 1998 in rural Rawalpindi, a school-based programme succeeded in improving mental health awareness in school children, their parents, friends and neighbors; however, teachers&#x02019; awareness was not assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Knowledge of school teachers regarding attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptomatology improved in a teacher training programme for ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. School mental health initiatives including steps to improve teacher&#x02019;s mental health literacy, their professional development and training, encouraging teaching styles that promote mutual respect, and positive classroom strategies are almost non-existent in the country. Child mental health is considered a priority in the WHO&#x02019;s Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO-EMRO). Recognizing the need for wider implementation of evidence-based school mental health interventions in the region and to help in addressing the mental health literacy of educators in resource-constrained settings, a pilot study of a teachers&#x02019; training intervention based on the WHO-EMRO Manual of School Mental Health in Urban Lahore was planned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Training aims for improving teacher&#x02019;s mental health literacy and helping them to take practical steps that can be implemented at low costs in school settings. The intervention will be evaluated in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), with teachers on a waitlist as the control group, to assess its effectiveness in improving teachers&#x02019; mental health literacy and self-efficacy in dealing with students&#x02019; mental health issues. It will also enable us to test the feasibility of key aspects of the trial design. The aim of this paper is to describe the study protocol of the pilot RCT.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims and objectives of the study</title><p id="Par12">This pilot RCT seeks to demonstrate the effectiveness of a teacher training programme based on the WHO-EMRO Manual of School Mental Health in improving teacher&#x02019;s mental health literacy as compared to a waitlist control group.

The study will also determine if mental health training of teachers may lead to an indirect improvement in a students&#x02019; outcome measure (emotional and behavioral difficulties) and the school psychosocial environment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study setting</title><p id="Par13">The study setting is private schools located in urban Lahore, having monthly fee structure of less than 3000 Pakistani rupees and matching in broad characteristics like student:teacher ratio, facilities, etc. Seven schools, from inner city areas of Lahore, are likely to be involved in the study in order to achieve the needed sample size.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants and sample size</title><p id="Par14">All the teachers in the participating schools of grades 1&#x02013;10 of both genders will be approached.

If the findings show the intervention to be effective, it will help in refining the large-scale RCT and the results will be disseminated to policy-makers in the private and Government sectors for this training to be included in mandatory teacher training.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par38">Despite evidence of more than half of all mental disorders having an onset in childhood and adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and poor mental health in young age being associated with school failure, delinquency, social and peer problems, substance misuse alongside adverse outcomes in adulthood, child mental health is not given due consideration and importance in countries with a high proportion of young people. The WHO report highlights that &#x02018;Lack of attention to the mental health of children and adolescents may lead to mental disorders with lifelong consequences, undermines compliance with health regimens and reduces the capacity of societies to be safe and productive&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Low-income countries, like Pakistan, face a multitude of social adversities including poverty, malnutrition, rapid urbanization, educational deprivation, drug abuse, increased crime, terrorism, etc., thus increasing the risk of mental health problems in youth. However, there has been very limited child mental health epidemiological research in the country of the unmet need for child mental health services and the effectiveness of evidence-based interventions. Given the high prevalence and lack of services, it is important to consider alternate methods for promoting the psychological and emotional well-being of our youth. In this scenario, schools can act as an important platform for promoting positive mental health in children and adolescents in Pakistan.</p><p id="Par40">The aim of this paper is to describe the protocol of a RCT regarding an intervention programme designed to improve teachers&#x02019; knowledge, attitude and skills to promote children&#x02019;s socio-emotional well-being and mental health in the school context in Pakistan. The presented intervention is based on the WHO-EMRO School Mental Health Manual. Specifically, the aim of this pilot RCT is to provide more information on adapting evidence methods for diverse cultures and related school settings. We are not aware of any previous RCT done in Pakistan focusing on teacher training in a whole-school approach. A particular strength of the study is its focus on secondary student&#x02019;s outcome as well. The limited time available for the study makes the follow-up time of 3&#x000a0;months more feasible rather than 6&#x000a0;months, which might have been more appropriate to observe any significant change. Another limitation of the trial is the generalizability of the results to the Government sector and to elite private schools, which differ significantly in various socio-demographic variables and will not be targeted in this pilot trial. Contamination between teachers in the intervention and control groups may occur when recruiting teachers within the same school and is a limitation of the trial. Findings including the effectiveness and implications from this study will provide information supporting the large-scale RCT for training teachers to increase their mental health literacy and thus potentially improving future school mental health services. In addition, the trial will provide important information about any implementation issues and the extent to which it is likely to be sustainable in different settings in the country. Positive trends result from this trial will hopefully support the urgent work needed in school mental health in Pakistan.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par41">Recruitment of schools for the study started in December 2016.
