functional disability was assessed by the Oswestry disability index, and lumbar lordosis
angles were measured by plain radiography. [Results] The Oswestry disability index
decreased significantly in the both groups; however, it was significantly lower in the
lumbar stabilization exercise group. The lumbar lordosis angle increased significantly in
the lumbar stabilization exercise group after treatment and was also significantly greater
than that in the conservative treatment group. [Conclusion] Lumbar stabilization exercise
is more effective than conservative treatment for improving functional disability and

It
is a common condition that restricts movement and activities of daily life<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the decrease in physical
activity due to industrialization has consequently increased low back pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. With long-term backache, chronic low back
pain leads to pain, hypoesthesia, and decreased strength and endurance of the deep spinal
muscles under the muscular system and sensory motor control, thus affecting individuals&#x02019;
daily living and social activities<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Despite many methods for treating chronic low back pain, approaches involving direct
training of the muscles around the lumbar region rather than conservative physical treatment
methods that involve pain relief have recently attracted attention<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, the importance of the relationship between
lumbar stabilization and low back pain has been empirically demonstrated; thus, lumbar
stabilization exercise has been accepted as a more empiric therapeutic exercise method than
any other exercise method<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. To improve
spinal segment instability, lumbar stabilization exercises that strengthen the local muscle
group located deep in the trunk around the lumbar vertebrae, which play an important role in
providing dynamic stability for spinal segments, are useful for relieving functional
disability of the spine<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lumbar
stabilization is important for maintaining the spine and performing extremity movements<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> and is applied to adjust the imbalance
between the abdominal and trunk extensor muscles. Such imbalance causes diseases in the
lumbar vertebral region of the musculoskeletal system, which must be treated to prevent low
back pain<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although many previous studies
report the deep muscles provide stability, studies on the effects of controlling muscles for
maintaining postures for spinal curvature and alignment are insufficient. Therefore, the
present study examined the effects of lumbar stabilization exercises on functional
disability and lumbar lordosis angle (LLA) in patients with chronic low back pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted with 30 patients (9 males and 21 females) diagnosed with
chronic low back pain by orthopedists at M hospital in Daegu, Korea. The patients were
divided into a lumbar stabilization exercise group (LSEG, <italic>n</italic> = 15), whose
mean age, height, and weight were 48.1 &#x000b1; 6.9&#x02005;years, 160.8 &#x000b1; 6.3&#x02005;cm, and 61.9 &#x000b1; 9.3&#x02005;kg,
respectively, and a conservative treatment group (CTG, <italic>n</italic> = 15), whose mean
age, height, and weight were 44.0 &#x000b1; 6.7&#x02005;years, 163.6 &#x000b1; 8.2&#x02005;cm, and 60.5 &#x000b1; 12.2&#x02005;kg,
respectively. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to baseline
characteristics. Ethical approval for the study was provided by the Youngdong University
Institutional Review Board. All patients read and signed informed consent forms in
accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. The patients had no
bone fractures, structural abnormality in joints or nerves, history of surgery, or
infectious disease.</p><p>The LSEG performed a lumbar stabilization exercise program consisting of stretching as a
warm-up (5&#x02005;min), lumbar stabilization exercises (30&#x02005;min), and stretching as a cool-down
(5&#x02005;min). All exercises were performed while the patient maintained basal tonus by straining
the transversus abdominis muscle and pelvic diaphragm, and contracting the upper abdominal
muscles with strain for 10&#x02005;s followed by 5&#x02005;s of rest. First, in the supine position, the
patients placed both arms in contact with the sides of their trunk and bent their knees.
Then, the patients raised their left and right arms in an alternating fashion above their
head (5 times), raised their left and right legs in an alternating fashion from the ground
(5 times), raised one arm and the opposite side leg in an alternating fashion (5 times), and
raised their hip and maintained the posture (10&#x02005;s). Second, the patients assumed a crawling
position and repeated all motions 5 times: raising their left and right hands in an
alternating fashion from the ground, raising their left and right legs in an alternating
fashion from the ground, raising one leg from the ground while raising the hand on the
opposite side simultaneously, moving their hip backward, and moving their hip forward.
Meanwhile, the CTG was treated with a hot pack (20&#x02005;min), interferential current
therapy(15&#x02005;min), and ultrasound (5&#x02005;min) for 40&#x02005;min per session. All patients underwent
treatment 3 times a week for 6 weeks.</p><p>The Oswestry disability index (ODI) was used to assess functional disability. Ten questions
were scored from 0 to 5 according to the patient&#x02019;s ability to perform various functions;
higher scores indicate more severe disability. The scores for the individual items were
summed and divided by 45 points (maximum), and converted into a percentage.</p><p>The LLA was measured by plain radiography (R-630-150, Dongkwang, Korea) of the lumbar
region and magnifying the images 3 times by using a picture archiving and communication
system (PACS; Infinitt, Korea). Lumbar lordosis was assessed by measuring the angle formed
between a line parallel to the top (i.e., body endplate) of the first lumbar vertebral body
and a line parallel to the top of the bottom vertebral body where kyphosis to the sacral
vertebrae begins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Measurement of lumbar lordosis angle</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-1983-g001"/></fig>).</p><p>Paired and independent t-tests were performed for intra- and intergroup comparisons,
respectively, of functional disability and LLA. SPSS version 12.0 Windows was used for
statistical analysis, and the level of significance set a p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The ODI decreased significantly in both groups after the intervention (p &#x0003c; 0.05).

tried to establish the causes of low back pain and develop effective treatments<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, the present study examined the
effects of lumbar stabilization exercises on the functional disability and LLAs of patients
with low back pain.</p><p>Sung<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> applied stabilization exercises to
patients for 4 weeks, which significantly decreased the ODI. Furthermore, Niemist&#x000f6; et
al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> report that the ODI was
significantly lower in 204 patients who performed trunk stabilization exercises for 3&#x02013;12
months than controls. Moreover, Hicks et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> report that the ODI decreased significantly after 8 weeks of lumbar
stabilization exercises. Concordantly, in the present study, the ODI decreased significantly
after lumbar stabilization exercises. This recovery of functionality is similar to the
results of a study conducted by Sekendiz et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, who report lumbar stabilization exercises help mobilize motor
units coordinated by the large-unit muscle system and local muscle systems such as the
musculus transversus abdominis, diaphragm, and lumbar multifidus muscles; furthermore, such
exercises helped restore the function of the stabilizers that contribute to the postural
control of the trunk and deep abdominal muscles, increasing the range of joint motion.</p><p>Magora<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reports that changes in the
spinal curvature of patients with low back pain are a reliable indicator of severe low back
pain. In contrast, Day et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> and
During et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> report that spinal
curvature is unassociated with low back pain. Jackson and McManus<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> report that the mean LLAs in healthy adults and low back
pain patients were 60.9&#x000b0; and 56.3&#x000b0;, respectively. Furthermore, Kim<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> applied trunk stabilization exercises and found that
lumbar lordosis was significantly lower after treatment than that in the control group.
Hwang<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> studied the effects of a
gymnastics program aiming to relieve low back pain and reports the LLA increased
significantly in the gymnasts after exercise. Choi<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reports the LLA increased significantly after an 8-week core
program for middle-aged women. Yoo<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>
reports that low back pain decreased, limited lumbar range of motion was relieved, and
pelvic tilt angle recovered after individual strengthening exercises were implemented in
patients with excessive lordosis. In the present study, lumbar lordosis increased to a
significantly greater extent in the LSEG than the CTG after treatment. Because the LLA
approached the average angle among healthy people after stabilization exercise and it can be
assumed that lumbar stabilization exercises aid the recovery of LLAs among healthy people
after treatment, the results indicate measuring the LLA is helpful for diagnosing patients
with low back pain and assessing them after treatment. The present study has some
limitations. First, the number of subjects was small. Furthermore, because they were
selected from among patients who visited a single hospital over 6 weeks, their daily lives
could not be completely controlled. Finally, long-term observation could not be conducted
because of the short treatment period. Therefore, future long-term studies with more
subjects are necessary to confirm the results.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><person-group><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name></person-group>: Determinants related with quality of life in patients with chronic low
