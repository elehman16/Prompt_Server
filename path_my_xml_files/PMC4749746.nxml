All subjects who participated in the clinical trial were asked to provide written informed consent prior to study activities to undergo this elective second look and biopsy substudy, which was approved by the institutional review boards at each of the clinical sites prior to initiation of activities.

Under arthroscopy, an 11G Jamshidi needle (Cardinal Health, Vaughan, Ontario, Canada) was introduced into the treated knee either through an arthroscopic portal or through the patellar tendon in order to achieve a perpendicular orientation to the articular surface. The geometric center of the treated lesion was visually estimated and the needle was inserted through the repair tissue and bone to a depth of 1 cm (premarked on the needle) and then removed gently. The cylindrical osteochondral biopsy sample (&#x02248;2 mm in diameter) was placed immediately into a labeled tube containing 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) fixative. Standardized shipping kits were provided to the clinical sites and contained a return shipping container, a temperature tracing device, and shipping transfer documentation. The biopsy was packed in the shipping container, the temperature tracing device started, and the biopsy shipped directly to a central laboratory (AccelLab, Boisbriand, Quebec, Canada) for storage, tissue processing and hematoxylin and eosin staining under Good Laboratory Practices.

Readers were trained to score each parameter of the ICRS I and II systems under in-house standard operating procedures that were first validated by measuring intra- and interobserver variability using normal, degraded, and repair cartilage samples. Each biopsy section was scored independently by 3 trained blinded readers for ICRS I parameters 3, 4, and 6, and ICRS II parameters 3, 4, 7 and 10 using hematoxylin and eosin&#x02013;stained sections since it better reveals cell morphology, tidemarks, and calcification. All other parameters were scored using Saf-O&#x02013;stained sections. All scoring was conducted using the digitized histological slides and slide scanner software (NDP-view, version 1.0.6), which permitted imaging up to 400&#x000d7; magnification (equivalent to observation with a microscope equipped with a 40&#x000d7; objective and 10&#x000d7; oculars). Histological slides were also available for direct viewing by light microscopy. All osteochondral biopsies retrieved during the clinical trial were analyzed. Sections were scored for all parameters except when a parameter was impossible to score (missing feature, tear, or crack, etc.).

This result corresponds well with other findings from the same RCT where repair tissue quantity and quality, blindly assessed by quantitative MRI, were both significantly improved over MFx at 12 months following BST-CarGel treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1947603515595837" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>It is generally believed in cartilage repair that improved structure is predictive of long-term durability.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1947603515595837" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="bibr17-1947603515595837" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr18-1947603515595837" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr19-1947603515595837" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr36-1947603515595837" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> The smoother cartilage surface more closely resembling articular cartilage detected by the ICRS macroscopic and ICRS I and II analyses following BST-CarGel treatment is an important finding since many cartilage degradation processes are thought to be initiated by surface fibrillation and degradation.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-1947603515595837" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="bibr38-1947603515595837" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Superior surface properties were previously described to occur due to an alteration by BST-CarGel of the timing, maturation and position of chondrogenic foci,<sup><xref rid="bibr39-1947603515595837" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> which are believed to improve chondral resurfacing and repair tissue organization. Furthermore, the improvements seen for the BST-CarGel group in the cell-based parameters in ICRS I and II suggest greater long-term viability and durability of the repair tissue. Indeed, longer term follow-up in the same BST-CarGel RCT demonstrated that the structural superiority observed at 1 year by quantitative MRI following BST-CarGel treatment over MFx alone is significantly maintained over 5 years.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-1947603515595837" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> ICRS I and II histological parameters related to the matrix or subchondral bone did not show a difference between groups, which could be explained by the fact that maturation of repair tissue and bone remodeling are continuous processes that occur over time and biopsies harvested at 13 months contain an ongoing maturing tissue. Other features were not often observed like abnormal calcification (ICRS I-6, II-10) which was a parameter developed for the first generation of autologous chondrocyte implantation, vascularization (ICRS II-11) present only in fibrous tissue and chondrocyte clustering (ICRS II-4), which is believed to be a hallmark of osteoarthritis.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-1947603515595837" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p><p>The collagen network and its specialized organization in articular cartilage is a primary determinant of cartilage mechanical properties and durability.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-1947603515595837" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="bibr42-1947603515595837" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> In this study, BST-CarGel treatment resulted in superior collagen organization compared with MFx, as demonstrated by improved PLM scores.

A major strength of this study was the use of third parties for biopsy shipping, storage, processing, scoring, and statistical analysis. Other strengths included the scoring, which was performed on every harvested biopsy by trained and blinded readers using validated methodologies, and that ICRS guidelines were followed for histological processing and analyses of osteochondral biopsies.<sup><xref rid="bibr49-1947603515595837" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> On the other hand, biopsies are intrinsically limiting, since they are not representative of the entire repair tissue volume and present patient consent challenges (e.g., only 48% of patients agreed in this trial).
