Hormone replacement therapy with agents such as estradiol is effective in reducing these symptoms, but interest in nonhormonal therapies has increased recently. Till date hormone replacement therapy is the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatment for postmenopausal symptoms, but recent primary and secondary prevention trials show associated increased risk of coronary disease, thromboembolism, and stroke.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Women Health Initiative (WHI) also points towards increased risk of breast cancer and slight increased risk of Alzheimer disease with HRT.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Recent evidence-based reviews of complementary and alternative therapies and non-hormonal agents conclude that there are insufficient data regarding their effectiveness.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] There is little emerging evidence in literature regarding gabapentin, an F-aminobutyric acid, for treatment of hot flushes, but therapy is still evolving.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Gabapentin is FDA approved for many neurological conditions like neuralgia and epilepsy. However, the role of gabapentin in menopausal psychosexual and somatic symptoms has not been studied much. Hence, this study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of gabapentin in these postmenopausal symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a pilot study conducted in Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at a tertiary care hospital from October 2009 to March 2011. Ethical clearance was obtained from institutional ethical committee. Fifty women with natural or surgical menopause presenting to menopause clinic of tertiary care center were recruited in the study after taking informed consent. Complete menstrual, obstetric, and medical history was taken. Presence and severity of menopausal symptoms were noted. Each patient underwent a thorough general and gynecological examination and a battery of investigations: Blood sugar, lipid profile, Pap smear, mammography as screening investigations; ultrasonography to evaluate endometrial thickness and any associated genital pathology.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were age between 45 and 55 years, no menses for &#x02265;1 year, serum follicle stimulating hormone level of &#x02265;40 mIU/ml, clinically normal pelvic examination, and normal Pap smear with any of the following psychosomatic and sexual symptoms like insomnia, fatigue, depression, irritability, nervousness, vaginitis, or dyspareunia. Exclusion criteria were asymptomatic women, abnormal screening investigations, prior hormonal or antidepressant treatment in last 6 months, and renal or liver disorders.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Randomization</title><p>Total 58 women were recruited out of which eight were excluded due to elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH; <italic>n</italic> = 4), not willing for follow-up (<italic>n</italic> = 2), currently on hormone therapy (<italic>n</italic> = 2). Rest 50 women were randomized into two groups using computerized randomization table. Opaque envelope method was used to assign the randomization group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Intervention</title><p>Detailed history was taken regarding presence of psychosexual (anxiety, depression, vaginal dryness, and dyspareunia) and somatic symptoms (insomnia, fatigue, lethargy, body aches, and heaviness) and their baseline severity. Psychological, sexual, and somatic symptoms were recorded and graded on Likert scale by putting self-administered questionnaire to the patient as 0-4 for absent, mild, moderate, and severe symptoms, respectively [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Pretrial investigations included all baseline blood chemistry along with fasting lipid profile. Group I patients received gabapentin 900 mg/day (300 mg thrice daily) along with tablet calcium 500 mg once daily. Group II patients received only tablet calcium (500 mg once daily). Gabapentin was gradually increased from once daily at bedtime to thrice daily 1<sup>st</sup> week to avoid the side effects. Similar tapering was also required during discontinuation of therapy. Patients were asked to keep record of symptoms.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Grading of various psychosexual and somatic symptoms</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JMH-6-10-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Follow up</title><p>Follow-ups were made after 1, 3, and 6 months of therapy.

We evaluated the effect of gabapentin in management of psychosomatic and sexual symptoms and found that maximum improvement was noted in insomnia. It was observed that psychosomatic symptoms improved with gabapentin therapy, but no improvement was observed in sexual symptoms.</p><p>In our study, two to 2.5-folds improvement in anxiety and depression was noted in women in gabapentin group as compared to placebo group. Guttuso <italic>et al</italic>., in 2003 had evaluated the effect of gabapentin 900 mg and reported that it does not affect the tension or anxiety subscale or total mood disturbance score, compared to placebo (<italic>P</italic> &#x02265; 0.05). Although the tension score and profile of mood state tension/anxiety subscale (POMS scale) were lesser in gabapentin group as compared to placebo group, statistical significance was not achieved.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Reddy <italic>et al</italic>., also measured the effect of gabapentin, estrogen, and placebo on depression by Zung depression scale and measured no significant difference between the groups.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>We also studied improvement insomatic symptoms in postmenopausal symptoms with gabapentin therapy. Patients in gabapentin group had 33, 36.8, and 40% improvement at 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively, comparedto18% improvement at all follow-up in placebo group accounting to a significant improvement. Guttuso <italic>et al</italic>., compared the effect of gabapentin vs placebo for somatic complaints on Greene Climacteric Scale and reported an increase in somatic complaints.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>., recorded the reduction in somatic symptoms by 14.9, 56.6, and 80.8% at 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively, with transdermal estrogen patch.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>When evaluation of improvement in sexual symptoms with gabapentin therapy was done in our study, improvement in vaginal dryness and dyspareunia ranged from 0 to 20% at all follow-up in both the groups, but no overall improvement was noted. Another study that recorded the improvement in sexual symptoms was by Butt <italic>et al</italic>., in which gabapentin 900 mg was compared with placebo.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] They reported a decreasing trend in the sexual score in the gabapentin group as compared to placebo group. Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>., recorded the reduction in sexual symptoms by use of transdermal estrogen patch.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Hence, hormone therapy has greater efficacy compared to gabapentin in all the symptoms but on benefit-risk ratio ground nonhormonal agents had been evaluated.</p><p>Our study is the only one in which the effect of gabapentin on lipid profile is evaluated. No significant change in serum cholesterol and triglycerides was noted at end of therapy in both groups. Statistically significant increase was noted in serum LDL level in gabapentin group; however, no significant difference was noted in placebo group. Increase in HDL was also noted in gabapentin group; whereas, no significant difference was noted in placebo group. No significant difference was noted in hemoglobin, urea, and creatinine or total protein. Only one study that had compared these parameters was by Guttuso <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] They found significant decrease in total protein between baseline and 6 months in gabapentin group. They also found urea levels to be decreased in gabapentin group as compared to placebo at the end of 6 months of therapy. However, no significant difference in creatinine was found between both groups.</p><p>In our study, 32% women noted side effects in gabapentin group in the form of headache, dizziness, and somnolence. Guttuso <italic>et al</italic>., also reported somnolence and dizziness during initial weeks of therapy with gabapentin. Also, they reported decrease in total serum protein in gabapentin group unlike in our study, in which no such effect was seen. Peripheraledema was reported in 3% patients in their study.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Overall, 13% women withdrew from their study mainly due to dizziness, while in our study no women withdrew due to side effects. Pandya <italic>et al</italic>., compared the treatment side effects with various doses of gabapentin and reported higher incidence of somnolence with 900 mg, 300 mg, and placebo in that order.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Butt <italic>et al</italic>., reported greater incidence of dizziness, unsteadiness, and drowsiness at 1<sup>st</sup> week of therapy with gabapentin as compared with placebo. However, these symptoms improved by 2<sup>nd</sup> week and were comparable at 4<sup>th</sup> week with baseline levels.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Our study reported a rise in LDL level with gabapentin therapy; hence, it needs to be monitored during therapy, especially in patients with deranged lipid profile.</p><p>Considering the beneficial effects of gabapentin on psychosomatic symptoms with minimal side effects as compared to hormonal agents, this can be used in selected women. Usefulness in improvement of sexual symptoms in postmenopausal women was not reported in our study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Gabapentin can lead to improvement in menopausal psychosomatic symptoms. Sexual symptoms show no relief. As gabapentin can lead to increase in LDL cholesterol, precaution should be taken in patients with deranged lipid profile before starting therapy and it should be checked during course of therapy. This drug can cause minor side effects, though major side effects were reported in our study. Hence, gabapentin can be a better treatment option among the nonhormonal agents as an alternative to hormone therapy for management of some postmenopausal symptoms. Further studies and well-planned trials are required to validate this observation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
