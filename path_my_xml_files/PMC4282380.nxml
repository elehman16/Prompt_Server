For use in early PD, supporting studies include a 33-week, double-blind (DB) trial <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> in which subjects were randomized to pramipexole ER q.d., pramipexole immediate release (IR) three times daily (t.i.d.) or placebo. In another trial <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> lasting 11&#x02013;13 weeks, the safety and tolerability of an overnight switch from pramipexole IR to pramipexole ER in early PD was evaluated. For this purpose, non-fluctuating patients on pramipexole IR t.i.d., alone or in combination with levodopa, were randomly switched overnight to DB treatment with pramipexole ER q.d. or pramipexole IR t.i.d. For use in advanced PD, supportive evidence derives from a 33-week DB trial <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> in which subjects with motor fluctuations on levodopa were randomized to the addition of pramipexole ER q.d., pramipexole IR t.i.d. or placebo.</p><p>Subjects completing one or another of these three studies were invited to enroll immediately in a long-term open-label (OL) extension study, one for early and another for advanced PD (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). In all three initial studies, DB treatment was administered t.i.d. &#x02013; specifically, IR or placebo as morning, afternoon and evening doses, <italic>plus</italic> placebo or ER as a morning dose (double-dummy design). In both of the extensions, the OL treatment was pramipexole ER, taken q.d.

Subjects were also required to be experiencing motor fluctuations (&#x02265;2 h of daily &#x02018;off&#x02019; time, as documented by patient diary on two consecutive days). Subjects were not permitted any dopamine agonists within the previous 4 weeks.</p><p>In the OL extensions, as in the preceding DB trials, patients were excluded for secondary or atypical parkinsonism and for medical or psychiatric conditions capable of impeding the patient's trial participation.</p></sec><sec><title>Study designs</title><p>In the extension study of early PD, completers of the preceding 33-week trial <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> underwent 6-week blinded down-titration of their DB pramipexole or placebo, administered q.d. during this transfer phase (after IR recipients were switched overnight to ER), and concomitant optimization of OL ER.

In the extension study of advanced PD, completers of the preceding up-to-33-week trial <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> underwent a 6-week transfer from DB ER, IR or placebo to OL ER (as described above), followed by 74 weeks of OL maintenance (planned total treatment duration up to 113 weeks). During the extension studies, the maintenance dosage of OL ER could be adjusted (range 0.375&#x02013;4.5 mg q.d.), and concomitant PD drugs were allowed at stable dosages (as they had been in the DB trials).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety measures</title><p>Throughout each OL extension, safety was assessed by the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and of withdrawals due to AEs. To this end, subjects were asked to spontaneously report AEs and were queried about AEs at all on-site visits. For subjects from the 33-week study of early PD <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and the up-to-33-week study of advanced PD <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, the visits were scheduled to occur weekly during the 6-week transfer phase and then at weeks 2, 8, 14, 20, 26, 38, 50, 62 and 74 of OL ER maintenance, with a follow-up visit at week 75. For subjects from the switch study in early PD <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, the visits were scheduled for weeks 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 of OL ER maintenance, with follow-up at week 73.</p><p>The incidence of impulse control disorders was assessed by a modified Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview (mMIDI) <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> consisting of items for pathological gambling, compulsive buying and compulsive sexual behavior.

At all other visits, all subjects were asked whether they had experienced pathological gambling, compulsive buying or compulsive sexual behavior, and all visits included an open-ended question concerning &#x02018;any other abnormal behaviors or urges&#x02019;, which were recorded as AEs.</p><p>Daytime somnolence was assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.

In each extension study, sustained pramipexole efficacy [necessarily excluding subjects who had previously been receiving placebo (ex-placebo recipients)] was assessed at end-point &#x02013; 80 or 72 OL weeks, depending on the prior DB trial &#x02013; as an exploratory analysis, again using UPDRS Parts II + III. For subjects with advanced PD, the Part II score was the average for &#x02018;on&#x02019; and &#x02018;off&#x02019; time and Part III was scored during best &#x02018;on&#x02019; time. Exploratory assessments at end-point also included a UPDRS II + III responder rate (defined as a &#x02265;20% improvement from baseline in the preceding DB trial), change in OL ER dosage and change in levodopa dosage. In advanced PD, analyses also included an &#x02018;off&#x02019; time responder rate (defined as a &#x02265;20% decrease from DB baseline in &#x02018;off&#x02019; time as a percentage of the subject's waking day).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Because the extension studies had no randomized groups, no statistical sample-size need was calculated and all findings are descriptive. Nevertheless, mean changes in UPDRS II + III score were adjusted by analysis of covariance (<sc>ancova</sc>), with country and DB treatment as fixed effects and DB baseline as covariate. All analyses were of observed cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and good clinical practice</title><p>All studies were conducted in accordance with their protocols, with good clinical practice and with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments. Before subjects were enrolled, each study's protocol, informed consent form and all protocol amendments were approved by local Institutional Review Boards or Independent Ethics Committees. Each study's nature and purpose were explained to its subjects, who provided written informed consent before any study procedures. The studies were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov with identifiers NCT00601523 and NCT00577460.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Disposition of subjects</title><p>Of 441 subjects completing the 33-week DB trial in early PD <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 368 (83.4%) entered the OL extension.

During OL treatment for up to 80 weeks (in patients whose total exposure was up to 113 weeks), the AEs reported in early and in advanced PD had patterns typical for use of dopaminergic medications in an aging PD population, with somnolence and peripheral edema the most frequent AE types in early PD and dyskinesia and somnolence the most frequent types in advanced PD. By ESS self-ratings, however, daytime somnolence appeared to show little change during the studies (from a substantial prevalence at OL baseline). Overall, 9.8% of subjects (88 of 902) discontinued prematurely because of AEs. Here, too, the AE types were consistent with advancing age, PD and dopaminergic medication. By semi-structured interviews, impulse control disorders were identified in 1.4% of all subjects (13 of 902), with a comparably small number of additional cases uncovered by other forms of questioning.</p><p>Amongst the studies' measures of long-term ER efficacy, UPDRS II + III scores remained substantially improved after 80 weeks of OL treatment in both early and advanced PD, as compared with the DB baseline in subjects from the two DB trials in which the DB baseline value was obtained prior to introduction of pramipexole <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Compared with OL baseline, UPDRS scores after 72&#x02013;80 weeks were unchanged to mildly worse, as might be expected with disease progression.</p><p>With regard to both safety and efficacy, the extension studies' OL design and their recruitment of subjects from prior trials may be considered limitations to interpreting the data. During the prior trials, patients relatively intolerant of study drug and those with small subjective improvement may have dropped out or become disinclined to enroll in a further trial. Recruitment from prior trials may also have decreased the extension studies' incidence of AEs with a tendency to occur or be especially noticeable early in treatment. Nevertheless, an OL design permitted assessment of ER safety and efficacy for a duration of treatment essentially infeasible in a PD study with placebo control. The design also permitted a treatment-convenience analysis, published elsewhere <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, in which extension subjects were queried as to their preference between their ongoing q.d. dosing and their prior t.i.d. dosing. Ninety-four percent of 374 early-PD patients and 89% of 334 advanced-PD patients preferred q.d. dosing. Greater convenience may translate into better adherence and a better clinical response, although this has not been formally tested.</p><p>Pramipexole ER remains an important therapeutic option in early and advanced PD. The OL extension studies reported here support its long-term safety and efficacy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors meet criteria for authorship as recommended by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, were fully responsible for all content and editorial decisions, and were involved at all stages of manuscript development.
