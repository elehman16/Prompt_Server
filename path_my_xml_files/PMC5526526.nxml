<article-title>The science of rapid start&#x02014;From the when to the how of antiretroviral initiation</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><sec id="sec001"><title>Background</title><p>Attrition during the period from HIV testing to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation is high worldwide. We assessed whether same-day HIV testing and ART initiation improves retention and virologic suppression.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>We conducted an unblinded, randomized trial of standard ART initiation versus same-day HIV testing and ART initiation among eligible adults &#x02265;18 years old with World Health Organization Stage 1 or 2 disease and CD4 count &#x02264;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. The study was conducted among outpatients at the Haitian Group for the Study of Kaposi&#x02019;s Sarcoma and Opportunistic infections (GHESKIO) Clinic in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to standard ART initiation or same-day HIV testing and ART initiation. The standard group initiated ART 3 weeks after HIV testing, and the same-day group initiated ART on the day of testing. The primary study endpoint was retention in care 12 months after HIV testing with HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;50 copies/ml. We assessed the impact of treatment arm with a modified intention-to-treat analysis, using multivariable logistic regression controlling for potential confounders. Between August 2013 and October 2015, 762 participants were enrolled; 59 participants transferred to other clinics during the study period, and were excluded as per protocol, leaving 356 in the standard and 347 in the same-day ART groups.

Eight of 20 (40%) deaths in the standard ART group occurred in participants who were LTFU prior to ART, 8 (40%) deaths occurred in those LTFU after starting ART, and 4 (20%) occurred while in care; the causes of death for those in care were stroke, trauma, and cancer in 3, and the fourth had pain and died after seeing a traditional healer.

These results are important given recent WHO 2016 guidelines stating the lack of evidence in support of same-day ART initiation.</p><p>Our findings suggest that ART initiation as soon as possible after HIV testing may be beneficial for clinically stable patients. In resource-poor settings with fragile delivery systems, such as Haiti, the provision of immediate support by care providers at the time of HIV diagnosis can have both structural and individual impact. In addition to making treatment initiation logistically easier for patients, we believe that same-day counseling and ART initiation increase the sense of hope, optimism, and overall connectedness to the healthcare system for patients, which have been shown to be important for retention [<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Our findings are consistent with the results of the RapIT study, a randomized trial that included participants in South Africa with WHO Stage 3 or 4 disease or CD4 count &#x02264;350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> [<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Participants in the standard group in that study generally started ART at the sixth visit, and 72% of participants in the rapid group started ART on the day of study enrollment. Rapid ART initiation resulted in a 17% improvement in retention and 13% improvement in viral suppression. A stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial in Uganda found an increase in ART initiation within 2 weeks after eligibility by implementing a multicomponent intervention to streamline ART initiation that included training healthcare workers, providing point-of-care CD4 count testing platforms, eliminating mandatory multiple preinitiation sessions, and giving feedback to facilities on their ART initiation rates [<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A weighted proportion of 80% in the intervention group had started ART within 2 weeks after eligibility compared with 38% in the control group. A cohort study of same-day ART initiation in pregnant women in South Africa also found high rates of treatment initiation, with 91% initiating ART on the day of referral to the service [<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the intervention group of the Sustainable East Africa Research on Community Health (SEARCH) HIV test-and-treat study, a cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted in Kenya and Uganda, HIV-infected patients who were identified through community testing were referred to HIV care upon diagnosis and then offered immediate ART initiation; retention was high (89%) among patients newly linking to care [<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>At ART initiation, it is critical that patients are ready to start lifelong therapy, that TB screening is conducted, and that renal function is evaluated to avoid the use of tenofovir in patients with renal insufficiency. In this study, ART readiness was remarkably high, with over 99% of patients screened for the study reporting they were ready to start lifelong ART. This is a particularly significant and timely finding for the provision of recommended universal ART because the majority of people living with HIV have early clinical disease, and there has been prior concern that healthier patients may be less willing to accept lifelong therapy [<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Most patients with early clinical disease do not have TB symptoms (cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss), so they do not require further work up to exclude TB, according to WHO guidelines [<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. With the exclusion of patients with a baseline chest x-ray that was suspicious for TB, we found that less than 1% of participants in the same-day ART group had TB that was missed at the time of ART initiation. We found that 4% of participants in the same-day ART group had creatinine clearance &#x0003c;50 mL/minute; ART regimens were adjusted on Day 3 for these patients.</p><p>Both groups in our study received high-level care, with multiple counseling and physician visits in the first month, followed by monthly physician visits. At the time the study was started, this was the standard of care in Haiti. However, this standard has shifted over the past few years towards decreased frequency of visits and nonphysician providers [<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We believe that same-day ART can be provided with fewer follow-up visits if proper counseling is provided during the early period after ART initiation. However, clinic-level procedures play a major role in the effectiveness of accelerated ART initiation strategies, as illustrated in Malawi, where among nearly 22,000 pregnant women who started ART for mother-to-child prevention, LTFU rates ranged from 0% to 58% between facilities and were highest among women who initiated ART on the day of HIV testing at large clinics [<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Though lower than anticipated, retention in both groups in our study was higher than reports of standard ART initiation from other resource-poor settings. Two studies from South Africa found that approximately one-third of patients remained in care from HIV testing through 12 months of ART, and systematic reviews of African studies have found high rates of pre-ART attrition [<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In Haiti, data on pre-ART outcomes are limited, but 12-month retention after ART initiation is 73% nationwide [<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We attribute the higher retention in our study in large part to faster ART initiation, even in the standard group, compared to many other HIV programs. We surmise that retention would have been lower in the standard group if there had been longer delays in ART initiation [<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The rates of retention with viral suppression in our study are lower than those reported from clinical trial cohorts, including at GHESKIO. In the GHESKIO Clinical Trials Unit, with a median monthly average of 483 subjects participating in NIH-funded clinical trials, retention is 97%. We attribute the lower retention and viral suppression rates in our study to 2 major reasons. First, nearly all patients meeting WHO stage and CD4 criteria were enrolled in the study on the day of HIV testing, including those with substantial barriers to retention in care and adherence. In contrast, over one-third of patients are generally lost to care prior to ART initiation or enrollment in clinical trials [<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Second, the care that was provided in this study was similar to that received by nonstudy patients at GHESKIO, with the aim of producing findings that could be reproduced in other resource-poor settings. In order to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, it will be important to evaluate reasons for attrition and implement new strategies to improve retention in care. One approach that has been successful in a cohort of nonresearch patients at GHESKIO has been expedited follow-up care, with fewer visits of shorter duration for clinically stable patients [<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Streamlined care has also been associated with high rates of retention in the SEARCH study, which is described above [<xref rid="pmed.1002357.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Our study was conducted in a large urban clinic, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. In addition, though our study included patients with early clinical disease, the CD4 counts in our population were lower than would be expected with the provision of universal ART. It is possible that patients with higher CD4 counts may experience less benefit from same-day ART. It is also noteworthy that we conducted a chest x-ray prior to enrollment; if same-day ART is provided without a chest x-ray, it is possible that TB cases will be missed. Our study was not blinded. All participants in both groups received the same number of visits and the same retention plan, but we cannot exclude the possibility that awareness of study group impacted provider behavior.</p><p>In conclusion, in a population of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic HIV-infected patients, same-day HIV testing and ART initiation decreased mortality and improved the rate of retention in care with virologic suppression compared with standard ART initiation. Furthermore, human and material resources provided to each group were similar, so same-day ART is not expected to increase treatment costs. The new WHO recommendations to provide ART to all HIV-infected patients should facilitate same-day test and treat.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002357.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Study protocol.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002357.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002357.s002"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002357.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002357.s003"><label>S3 Text</label><caption><title>HIV medication readiness scale.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002357.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002357.s004"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Anonymized dataset.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002357.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Presented in part at the 21st International AIDS Conference, Durban, South Africa, July 18 to 22, 2016.
