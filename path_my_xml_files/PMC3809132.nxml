implemented. Before the implementation of intervention, a baseline study was
performed to assess the knowledge of dispensers working at community pharmacies.
The study population included all community pharmacy outlets in Islamabad
selling allopathic medicines western or modern medicines including all over the
counter and prescription only medicines, excluding herbal and homeopathic
medicines. Any shop meeting these criteria was included in the sampling
frame.</p></sec><sec><title>Sampling of Pharmacies</title><p>A list of pharmacies was obtained from respective District Health Offices. The
total population of pharmacies in Islamabad was 169. The sample size was
calculated at 95% confidence interval by using Cochrane formula which came out
to be 118. Simple random sampling was used to select the pharmacies from the
list. For the purpose of interview the most experienced dispenser was selected
from the pharmacy and structured questionnaire was used to get information on
knowledge of dispensers at these 118 pharmacies.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Collection Tool</title><p>A structured questionnaire with coded responses and few open ended questions was
designed by using the references of Drug Act of Pakistan 1976 and relevant rules
under, Good Pharmacy Practices guidelines, International Pharmaceutical
Federation (FIP) guidelines and inspection book of pharmacies used to get
information regarding knowledge, qualification and experience of dispensers. Two
Focus group discussions were carried out at different time intervals with four
different groups of community pharmacist, drug inspectors (Government officials
who inspect quality of drugs and legal requirements at community pharmacies by
drug law 1976 Pakistan), academia and members of consumer groups (NGO). Each
group comprised of three to four participants for the development, finalization,
face and content validity of the data collection tool. Pilot testing was carried
out on 12 pharmacies (10%) of total sample size before execution of the final
study. The value of cronbach&#x02019;s alpha was 0.726 which was applied to assess the
reliability and internal consistency of the tool. The structured questionnaire
comprised of a total of 33 questions which included information on demographics,
personal information, status in pharmacy, level of education, experience, in
service training, storage temperature, prescription terminologies, status of
medicines, views and problems about profession and sugestions for improvement.
Data collection was planned and permission for survey was btained from relevant
drug inspectors. The study was also approved by the Research &#x00026; evelopment
wing of Drug Control Organization at Ministry of Health, Government of Pakistan.
Local chapters of PCD (Pakistan chemist and druggist association) were also
informed and consent was taken.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Collection</title><p>Convenience sampling method was used to identify dispensers who responded to the
questions listed in questionnaires. It was intended that a pharmacist with a
bachelor&#x02019;s degree or diploma in pharmacy be interviewed. However, in cases where
a pharmacist was unavailable, the most experienced dispenser was interviewed for
the filling of knowledge assessment questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><title>Results of Pilot Study</title><p>After data collection, data was analyzed by SPSS. The result of the study
revealed that the qualification, knowledge and training of dispensers working at
community pharmacies in Pakistan are inadequate and pharmacies are largely
operated by non-qualified and untrained dispensers. The results of the study
highlights that most of the dispensers are not qualified but have ample years of
experience. Nevertheless, this experience of dispensers does not reflect in
their better knowledge. The study results highlighted that 90 percent of drug
sellers felt that they require training while 84 percent showed their
willingness to participate if such opportunity arises.</p></sec><sec><title>Designing &#x00026; Execution of Interventional Study</title><p>Pharmacies of Islamabad which were visited in pre intervention phase (n=118) were
divided into two geographical regions A (intervention) and B (control). From
which thirty pharmacies were randomly selected from each region. The targeted
group of the interventions was drug sellers. Keeping in view the results of the
base line study an educational intervention was designed to improve the
knowledge of dispensers working at community pharmacies in Pakistan. The results
of the baseline study were shared with representatives of chemist and druggist
association, drug inspectors, academia, drug sellers and community pharmacist.
The focus, targets, contents and format of intervention was designed after a
series of discussions with the above mentioned stakeholders. The contents of the
training materials were developed from Drug Law, Good Pharmacy Practice
guidelines, dispensing practice standards and discussion with drug inspectors.
The format of a formal workshop was selected for training because it is the most
common method used across the world for training drug sellers. After discussion
with different stakeholders the name of the training workshop was recommended to
be &#x02018;Modern Concepts of Dispensing and Patient Handling&#x02019;. The training workshop
was intended to be conducted over two days but due to busy schedule of drug
sellers it was restricted to one day and was divided into three sessions;
duration of each session was of 2.5 hours. The workshop was focused on issues
including storage temperature, prescription terminologies and status of drugs.
The training workshop included presentations, video clips and group tasks.</p><p>The training was conducted in collaboration with District Health Office, Chemist
and druggist association and Hamdard University, Islamabad. District Health
Officer nominated Drug Inspector for coordination of training workshop. Randomly
selected drug sellers were contacted through formal letter inviting for training
and followed on phone for the confirmation of participation. Keeping in view the
influence of opinion leaders; doctors, pharmacist from academia, drug inspectors
and community pharmacies were engaged as trainers. Smooth running of workshop
and attendance of drug sellers was ensured due to the group effort with DHO
office. The trainees were provided with list of responsibilities of dispensers,
essential documents to be kept in pharmacy, daily checklist for pharmacy,
dispensing list, list of control drugs, sample of prescription, checklist for
prescription and list of commonly used abbreviations and were requested to share
the same with their colleagues working in pharmacies.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Collection &#x00026; Data Analysis</title><p>After four weeks of training a letter along with a small poster and a sample of
drug label was sent to the participants of training and were reminded of the
request to share the information with colleagues. Post intervention data was
collected after two months of training using simulated patient visits. Neither
the participants nor the data collectors and the data entry persons were aware
of the intervention and control groups. Same data collection tools were utilized
to collect post-intervention data as were used in pre- data collection. The data
was cleaned coded and entered in SPSS 16 version. Wilicoxon and Mann-Whitney
tests were used to compare the pre and post data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In 23.3% of the cases dispensers knew regarding which medicines to be kept in fridge.
Knowledge of dispensers regarding the terms, OTC increased from 6.7% to 60% and POM
increased from 0% to 43.3% after the training. Before training in 56.7%, 33.3%,
6.7%, 36.7% and 3.3% of the cases dispensers were aware regarding prescription
terminologies b.i.d (twice a week), h.s (at night), q.d (four times a day), s.o.s
(when needed) and p.r.n (as required). While after the training in 96.7%, 80%, 40%,
93.3% and43.3% of the cases dispensers knew about b.i.d, h.s, q.d, sos and p.r.n,
respectively. (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Impact of training on knowledge of dispensers working at community

interventions can only be sustainable through continuous monitoring and
reinforcement of the training. Pharmacists shall be encouraged to come into the
community pharmacy business with introduction of incentives by the government. On
job training to dispensers and specifying their minimum education to work must be
mandatory for the improvement of dispensing practices. There should be a mechanism
for the provision of independent and unbiased information for the dispensers thus
reducing the influence of commercially available information sources on their
knowledge and practice. The collaborative efforts of all the stake holders must be
in line for the strict implementation of laws, presence of qualified person and
training of currently available personnel.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Competing interests: None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Chalker</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Chuc</surname><given-names>NT</given-names></name><name><surname>Falkenberg</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Do</surname><given-names>NT</given-names></name><name><surname>Tomson</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>STD management by private pharmacies in Hanoi: practice and
