<italic>Background and Aim</italic>. The efficacy of supplementation treatment with two multispecies probiotic formulates on subjects diagnosed with IBS-C and the assessment of their gut microbiota were investigated.<italic> Methods</italic>. A randomized, double-blind, three-arm parallel group trial was carried out on 150 IBS-C subjects divided into three groups (F_1, F_2, and F_3). Each group received a daily oral administration of probiotic mixtures (for 60 days) F_1 or F_2 or placebo F_3, respectively. Fecal microbiological analyses were performed by species-specific qPCR to assess the different amount of probiotics.<italic> Results</italic>. The percentage of responders for each symptom was higher in the probiotic groups when compared to placebo group during the treatment period (<italic>t</italic>60) and was maintained quite similar during the follow-up period (<italic>t</italic>90). Fecal analysis demonstrated that probiotics of the formulations increased during the times of treatment only in fecal DNA from subjects treated with F_1 and F_2 and not with F_3, and the same level was maintained during the follow-up period.<italic> Conclusions</italic>. Multispecies probiotic supplementations are effective in IBS-C subjects and induce a different assessment in the composition of intestinal microbiota.

Introduction</title><p>The intestinal microbiota consists of a wide range of bacterial species [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The microbial community resides in the gut of the host establishing a mutually beneficial relationship and modulating, through its metabolic activities, the host's health status [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The microbiota exerts different physiological functions such as inhibition of pathogenic bacteria and synthesis of short fatty acids; stimulation of nutrient and mineral absorption, as well as modulation of the intestinal immune system; synthesis of vitamins and amino acids; and the decomposition of protein compounds [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The intestinal microbiota in healthy adults is generally considered stable over time in predominance of bacteria belonging to four main phyla: Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes as prevalent and Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria that are less represented. The microbiota in subjects with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) has been shown to be less stable compared to healthy adults [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A controlled balance between bacterial species considered beneficial (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) associated with the reduction of those considered harmful (<italic>Clostridium</italic>,<italic> E. coli</italic>,<italic> Salmonella</italic>, and<italic> Pseudomonas</italic>) is fundamental for maintenance of the gut physiological state and should attenuate IBS symptoms. Alteration of the microbiota's composition, which can be caused by psychophysical, dietary, or environmental stress, is defined as dysbiosis and can lead to pathological conditions. Moreover, aberrant stimulation of the immune system leading to inflammation may be reliably encountered as the potential link between dysbiosis and metabolic diseases [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Experimental evidences have increasingly shown a correlation between microbiota imbalance and the induction of Irritable Bowel Syndrome. In particular, dysbiosis was proven to underlie a modification of intercellular tight junctions, responsible under normal conditions for the correct structure of the epithelial layer of intestinal mucosa, which is known to increase the mucosal permeability. Consequently, antigens have been detected in the intercellular space with the activation of the inflammatory cascade, production of cytokines, and tissue damage [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Oral administration of appropriate probiotic strains may therefore be beneficial to health and in particular with respect to IBS. However, clinical data reporting changes in the detection of ingested probiotic traceability in the gastrointestinal tract of patients and the related effects on the gut are still few and inconclusive [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Studies have reported an improvement in global symptoms with probiotics, while others have failed to demonstrate any benefit [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, it is widely known that the effect of probiotics is species-specific [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These indications combined with the diversity and complexity of IBS may indicate that a probiotic combination could be more efficient than a single strain in this particular syndrome. Some authors suggested that multispecies probiotics may in some conditions be more efficient than monospecies probiotics due to, for example, enhanced intestinal adhesion and the production of a greater variety of antimicrobial compounds, compared with single probiotic [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In this regard, the present study was aimed at testing different probiotics, which we had previously characterized [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] for their<italic> in vitro</italic> activities, in order to demonstrate by means of<italic> in vivo</italic> detection procedures their distinctive effects on the intestine after oral administration. The aim of this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to investigate the efficacy of two probiotic formulations in ameliorating IBS-C subjects. The effects of probiotics on IBS symptoms in comparison with placebo and their assessment in the gut microbiota after probiotic therapy by analysing fecal bacteria were evaluated. In order to reach this goal, 150 volunteer subjects were recruited and included in three groups (F_1, F_2, and F_3). Each group received 60-day oral administration of different probiotic mixtures: F_1 containing<italic> L. acidophilus</italic> and<italic> L. reuteri</italic>; F_2 containing<italic> L. plantarum</italic>,<italic> L. rhamnosus</italic>, and<italic> B. animalis </italic>subsp.<italic> lactis</italic>; and F_3 containing placebo. At different time points after probiotic oral administration, fecal microflora was analysed by real-time quantitative PCR performed on DNA from stool samples of the subjects. An additional 30-day follow-up period was encountered in order to assess whether the observed beneficial effects still persist after treatment suspension.</p><p>Our investigation provides a relevant contribution to investigate the efficacy of multispecies probiotics in treating IBS-C and other gastrointestinal syndromes related to the gut disorders.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Subjects were randomized to active or placebo treatments as follows: (i) 53 subjects were randomized to F_1, (ii) 52 subjects were randomized to F_2, and (iii) 52 subjects were randomized to F_3. Seven subjects discontinued intervention because they were no longer interested in participating in the study.</p><p>After randomization, subjects attended four clinic visits every month, except for the first visit (10 days after product use). The population was Caucasian and the mean (&#x000b1;SD) age was 37.4 &#x000b1; 12.5 years. Demographic and baseline characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>) were similar across treatment arms, indicating an unbiased randomization. The per-protocol population consisted of 150 subjects. All subjects were included in the safety analysis dataset.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2. Primary Efficacy Endpoint</title><p>The results of IBS-C related symptoms amelioration of the responder are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The number of responders to treatment was defined as the subject reporting a decrease of symptoms of at least 30% compared to the basal condition for at least 50% of the intervention time. Internal consistency for each item, over time, was good (Cronbach's alpha &#x0003e; 0.88). The percentage of responders for each clinical symptom was higher in the F_1 and F_2 group when compared to placebo F_3 (F_1 versus F_3, in the range of 66%&#x02013;78% versus 6%&#x02013;36%; and F_2 versus F_3 in the range of 78%&#x02013;90% versus 6%&#x02013;36%) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Neither statistical nor clinically significant differences were detected between F_1 and F_2 except for constipation symptom which was less significant during the treatment (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).</p><p>The results of HR-QOL are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref>. Data were reported as the sum of each score given by the subject to each item of the HR-QOL questionnaire. Internal consistency for each item, over time, was good (Cronbach's alpha &#x0003e; 0.86). The HR-QOL was ameliorated for subjects treated with both F_1 and F_2 during the treatment period. Relatively to baseline, the sum of each score given by the subject to each symptom during the treatment (<italic>t</italic>60) was significantly reduced in the probiotics group (31.2 &#x000b1; 1.0 &#x02192; 20.2 &#x000b1; 0.9, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, for F_1 group; and 32.0 &#x000b1; 0.9 &#x02192; 20.4 &#x000b1; 0.9, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, for F_2 group), but not so clinically relevant in the placebo group (30.0 &#x000b1; 0.9 &#x02192; 26.9 &#x000b1; 1.2, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, for F_3 group). As expected, mild amelioration of HR-QOL was seen in the placebo-treated subjects, probably due to the placebo effect. The intergroup amelioration of HR-QOL during the treatment (<italic>t</italic>60) was bigger in the actives-treated (F_1 and F_2) subjects compared to placebo-treated (F_3) subjects (F_1 versus F_3, 20.2 &#x000b1; 0.9 versus 26.9 &#x000b1; 1.2, and F_2 versus F_3, 20.4 &#x000b1; 0.9 versus 26.9 &#x000b1; 1.2, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Neither statistical nor clinically significant differences were found between F_1 and F_2.</p><p>In addition, the analysis of the stool type classification was performed (data not shown). The numbers of samples with values of 3, 4, and 5, according to Bristol scale and representing a healthy bowel movement were calculated. Significant differences were observed between F_1 or F_2 with respect to F_3, representing an increase in the number of stool samples with a healthier characteristic in the probiotic treated groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>3.3.

Discussion</title><p>Probiotics exert their actions through interaction with host intestinal cells. Their supplementation significantly modifies the intestinal microbiota by increasing lactobacilli and bifidobacteria that can improve through the combination with specific probiotics providing a health benefit to the host [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Multispecies probiotics may have a variety of different beneficial effects particularly on IBS symptoms because each species acts in a particular way on the gastrointestinal tract, and two or more species acting together may have a synergistic effect [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Although several trials have demonstrated the superiority of probiotics (above all, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) over placebo in controlling IBS symptoms [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], however, given the controversies in IBS pathophysiology or lack of clear evidence for gut microbiota abnormalities in patients with IBS, additional randomized clinical trials with appropriate endpoints and design are needed to evaluate to which extent probiotics are a useful therapeutic strategy in the management of IBS symptoms.</p><p>In this study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with two formulations containing different probiotics was developed and the evaluation of gut microbiota assessment and gastrointestinal benefits of IBS-C patients was determined until 90 days. Multispecies probiotics were used for the treatment of IBS-C in our study:<italic> L. acidophilus, L. reuteri, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus</italic>, and<italic> B. animalis </italic>subsp.<italic> lactis</italic>. Indeed, it is known that the level of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli species is lower in IBS patients compared to healthy persons [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and several studies show that the supplementation of them, or mixtures including species of these genera, is effective in alleviating symptoms of IBS. Moreover, the selected strains were already known for their effect on intestinal cell lines as previously reported [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>To investigate the alterations in the intestinal microbiota, the number of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria present in fecal samples of recruited subjects was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The numbers of<italic> Lactobacillus</italic> spp. and<italic> Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. of the mixtures (F_1 and F_2) increased during the times of treatment until 60 days in the probiotic groups, with respect to the placebo group (F_3). All the species included in the formulations remained in the gut also 30 days after the follow-up from the last ingestion, except for<italic> Bifidobacterium</italic>. Our results confirmed data reported by Kajander et al. These authors demonstrated that all supplemented strains remained stable during the treatment, with the exception of<italic> Bifidobacterium</italic> species which decreased after treatments with a multispecies probiotic mixture [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, in our study, significant differences in the number of responders to the severity of symptoms were recorded between the two probiotic mixtures, F_1 and F_2, with respect to placebo F_3 group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). No significant differences were registered between F_1 and F_2 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), and the effects of both of them are significant when compared to their respective baselines. These data are in agreement with previous data from multispecies probiotics treatment of IBS subjects [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Compared with placebo, probiotic groups F_1 and F_2 were effective for the primary efficacy endpoints of the study as well as for the secondary endpoints, that is, the maintaining of the obtained effects 30 days after the last product intake. The change of symptoms is correlated to the improvement in the quality of life and resulted in being significantly higher in the probiotic groups compared with the placebo group. Although a great number of data deriving from literature [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] indicate that probiotics may be helpful in the treatment of IBS symptoms, in particular with respect to constipation, their conclusions vary because of inadequate sample size, type of study design, and use of various probiotic strains. These data are in agreement with our data concerning the improvement of specific probiotic treatment versus placebo (specifically in patients with IBS-C) for some of the endpoints, improving symptoms such as pain, flatulence, and bloating, but not others (transit time and urgency and abdominal cramps) [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, in most of the reported cases, the decrease in constipation frequency score was approximately twofold greater in the probiotic groups than in the placebo groups and these results are in line with data deriving from our clinical study.</p><p>Thus, the clinical improvement of this study may be associated with the maintenance (species-specific) of the compositional stability of the intestinal microbiota from probiotics consumption and with their positive effects in subjects affected by irritable bowel syndromes.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the different species of probiotics administered to the IBS-C subjects determine a cooccurrence between the changes in the analysed probiotic groups and an improvement of IBS-C symptoms. This study represents the development of a clinical trial that can support the role of intestinal bacteria in the IBS diseases and the potential role of probiotics belonging to various species in the management of these disorders.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The research was conducted through the Probioplus4Food Project no. 30221122, funded by MIUR and Lombardy Region, Italy.
