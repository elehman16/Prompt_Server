Major therapeutic progress has occurred during the past decade, in particular since the introduction of immunomodulatory agents, however, MS is still an incurable disease. In addition, parenteral application of the currently licensed drugs is associated with injection-related adverse events (AEs) and low patient compliance. Thus, there remains an unmet need for the development of more effective and well tolerated oral therapies for the treatment of MS. A number of new orally administered agents including fingolimod, laquinimod, teriflunomide, cladribine, and BG-12 have been licensed recently or are currently under investigation in relapsing remitting MS patients. In multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III clinical studies, all of these agents have already shown their efficacy on both clinical disease parameters and magnetic resonance imaging-based measures of disease activity in patients with relapsing remitting MS. However, there are essential differences concerning their clinical efficacy and side-effect profiles. Additionally, the mechanisms by which these substances exert clinical efficacy have not been fully elucidated. In this article, we review the pharmaceutical properties of fingolimod, laquinimod, teriflunomide, cladribine, and BG-12; and their suggested mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, and side-effect profiles.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>cladribine</kwd><kwd>fingolimod (FTY)</kwd><kwd>fumaric acid esters (BG-12)</kwd><kwd>laquinimod</kwd><kwd>teriflunomide</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Although great efforts have been made towards improving multiple sclerosis (MS) therapy and understanding the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, MS is still an incurable disease and the most prevalent cause of sustained disability in young adults.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dhps-5-037">1</xref> Symptoms at disease onset are often variable, including visual and sensory abnormalities, motor dysfunction, ataxia, fatigue, and disturbances of the bladder and bowel function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dhps-5-037">1</xref> In the majority of patients, the initial disease course shows complete remission after an acute episode, called relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) followed by a slow accumulation of persistent symptoms. Eventually, the natural disease course enters a stage referred to as secondary progressive MS (SPMS). The pathophysiological pattern of MS is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, demyelination, axonal damage, astrogliosis, and neurodegenerative processes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dhps-5-037">1</xref></p><p>The arsenal for MS therapy involves treatment of acute relapses with corticosteroids, symptomatic treatment with appropriate agents and disease modification with immunomodulatory agents. Currently, approved disease modifying therapies for the treatment of RRMS &#x02013; including interferon beta (IFN-&#x003b2;) preparations (Betaferon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Extavia<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Avonex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, and Rebif<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), glatiramer acetate (Copaxone<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), mitoxantrone (Ralenova<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), natalizumab (Tysabri<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), fingolimod (Gilenya<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), and cladribine &#x02013; modify the immune response that occurs in MS through various immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive effects. However, except for fingolimod and cladribine, all currently approved agents require parenteral administration. Yet, the majority of RRMS patients would prefer safe and effective oral therapies. At this stage, different available oral disease modifying therapies including laquinimod, teriflunomide, and BG-12 have entered or completed phase III clinical trials in patients with MS.</p><p>In this article, we review the pharmaceutical properties of different promising available oral agents for the treatment of RRMS as well as their effects in clinical studies and in particular possible adverse profiles.</p></sec><sec><title>Laquinimod</title><p>Laquinimod, also known as ABR-215062 sodium salt ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dhps-5-037">Figure 1</xref>) is a new orally administered synthetic drug designed for the treatment of RRMS and relates to the antecessor substance roquinimex (Linomide<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). Roquinimex has demonstrated beneficial effects in MS, however, due to its serious adverse profile including cardiopulmonary toxicity, further development was stopped.</p><p>Laquinimod shows a clearly superior safety profile.

The active extension study was scheduled for 36 weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of disease activity were the basis for statistical power and sample size calculations in all studies. In summary, laquinimod (0.3 mg/day and 0.6 mg/day) demonstrated sustained beneficial effects on MRI surrogate parameters, but failed to detect statistically significant effects on the relapse rate in these phase II studies, where clinical effects were only exploratory/tertiary endpoints (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dhps-5-037">Table 1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-dhps-5-037">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-dhps-5-037">11</xref></p><p>To further evaluate the clinical effects of laquinimod in RRMS and its safety profile two global, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind phase III studies have been initiated. The ALLEGRO study (MS-LAQ-301) is a placebo-controlled study, encompassing over 1100 participants, designed to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of laquinimod in a dosage of 0.6 mg/day in patients with RRMS. The BRAVO study (MS-LAQ-302) encompasses over 1300 participants and was designed to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of laquinimod in a dosage of 0.6 mg/day in comparison to a placebo and IFN-&#x003b2;-1a (Avonex&#x000ae;) in patients with RRMS in a rater blinded-fashion.

In the majority of cases elevated liver enzymes occurred within the first month of treatment and normalized without discontinuation of the drug. In only a few cases, an increase of liver enzymes caused termination of laquinimod. In those subjects, withdrawal of therapy was followed by rapid normalization of liver enzymes and no clinical sequelae was noted.

Interestingly, neuroimaging and EAE data suggest neuroprotective effects of laquinimod. However, further studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of laquinimod with respect to established disease modifying therapies.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Fingolimod</title><p>Fingolimod (Gilenya<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) is an oral sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dhps-5-037">Figure 1</xref>). In 2010 and 2011 fingolimod was approved as the first available oral agent for the treatment of highly active RRMS in North America and Europe. Subsequent to its phosphorylation, fingolimod binds with high affinity to S1PR, which in turn leads to an internalization and degradation of the receptor on different tissues and cell types, including lymphocytes. As a consequence, fingolimod inhibits the ability of autoaggressive lymphocytes to egress from the lymph nodes towards the CNS, thereby limiting inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes in MS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-dhps-5-037">14</xref> Furthermore, fingolimod reduces the circulation of Th17 cells in MS patients and may show positive effects on both astrocytosis and remyelination via direct interaction with S1PR on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and the corresponding precursor cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dhps-5-037">Table 1</xref>).</p><sec><title>Studies and clinical efficacy</title><p>One phase II study, followed by an active extension and two phase III (FREEDOMS and TRANSFORMS) placebo-controlled or active comparator-controlled clinical trials have been published in adults with RRMS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dhps-5-037">Table 1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dhps-5-037">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-dhps-5-037">20</xref> The phase II study was scheduled for 36 weeks and the primary endpoint was defined as the total number of Gd-enhanced MRI lesions. In comparison to the placebo, fingolimod (1.25 mg/day or 5 mg/day) significantly reduced the absolute number of Gd-enhanced lesions, evident from 8 weeks onwards. Furthermore, there was a significant effect on clinical outcomes such as ARR and time to first confirmed relapse in both fingolimod treatment groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dhps-5-037">15</xref> The following active extension study was scheduled for a further 36 months. Patients treated with placebo were switched to either dose of fingolimod. Results of the extension study demonstrated sustained beneficial effects on MRI activity and ARR.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-dhps-5-037">16</xref></p><p>FREEDOMS was scheduled for 24 months and included a total of 1272 patients with RRMS. Patients were randomized either to fingolimod 0.5 mg/day, fingolimod 1.25 mg/day, or placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-dhps-5-037">17</xref> The primary endpoint was defined as the ARR. In comparison to the placebo, treatment with both dosages of fingolimod resulted in a significant reduction of the ARR by 55% (fingolimod 0.5 mg/day group) and by 60% (fingolimod 1.25 mg/day group), respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-dhps-5-037">17</xref> Secondary clinical endpoints and MRI measures of disease activity favored treatment with fingolimod over the placebo as well. Both dosages significantly decreased the risk of disease progression, decreased the risk of relapse, and increased the number of relapse-free patients in comparison to the placebo. MRI measurements demonstrated significantly less Gd-enhancing lesions, less new or enlarged T2 lesions, and reduction of brain volume loss in both fingolimod groups compared to the placebo treatment group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-dhps-5-037">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-dhps-5-037">18</xref></p><p>The 12-month TRANSFORMS study enrolled 1292 patients and investigated two dosages of fingolimod (0.5 mg/day, 1.25 mg/day) vs treatment with intramuscular IFN-&#x003b2;-1a (Avonex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-dhps-5-037">19</xref> The primary endpoint was defined as the ARR.

Subsequent to completion of the TRANSFORMS trial subjects were enrolled in a 1 year extension study. Subjects initially treated with IFN-&#x003b2;-1a were switched to fingolimod at a dosage of either 0.5 mg/day or 1.25 mg/day, while actively treated subjects continued their medication. In general, the extension study corroborated the beneficial effects of both dosages in terms of MRI measures of disease activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dhps-5-037">Table 1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-dhps-5-037">20</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Specific safety and tolerability</title><p>In FREEDOMS and TRANSFORMS the majority of AEs were characterized as mild to moderate and were resolved without discontinuation of the study drug. Common AEs in patients treated with fingolimod included flu infections, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, cough, diarrhea, and back pain. Furthermore, incidence of basal cell carcinoma was higher in patients receiving fingolimod. Laboratory examination revealed abnormal liver function tests and lymphopenia more frequently in either of the fingolimod groups in comparison to the placebo group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dhps-5-037">Table 2</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-dhps-5-037">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-dhps-5-037">19</xref></p><p>FREEDOMS reported on serious AEs in 13.4% of subjects treated with the placebo vs 10.1% and 11.9% of subjects receiving fingolimod in a dosage of 0.5 mg/day or fingolimod in a dosage of 1.25 mg/day, respectively. Serious AEs related to either of the fingolimod groups include bradycardia, basal cell carcinoma, chest pain, and macular edema. In total, seven cases of serious bradycardia were noted in the fingolimod groups. Remarkably, all episodes appeared after the first dose of fingolimod. No cases of skin cancer or macular edema appeared during FREEDOMS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-dhps-5-037">17</xref></p><p>TRANSFORMS described serious AEs in 5.8% of subjects treated with IFN-&#x003b2;-1a vs 7.0% and 10.7% of subjects receiving fingolimod in a dosage of 0.5 mg/day or fingolimod in a dosage of 1.25 mg/day, respectively. Similar to FREEDOMS, serious AEs that were observed included bradycardia and basal cell carcinoma. Additionally, atrioventricular block, herpes virus infection and melanoma were reported. In TRANSFORMS two deaths occurred in patients treated with fingolimod in a dosage of 1.25 mg/day: one due to disseminated primary varicella zoster infection and one due to herpes simplex encephalitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-dhps-5-037">19</xref></p><p>Given its immunosuppressive action fingolimod should be avoided in subjects at higher risk of infections or known chronic infection. Vaccination gaps should be closed before initiation of fingolimod and monitoring for macular edema; investigation of dermatological changes as well as regular blood examinations are essential subsequent to treatment initiation. Due to its effect on heart rate, fingolimod is contraindicated in patients with known cardiac arrhythmia or history of cardiovascular disease. In parallel, concomitant medication of agents that lower the heart rate should be avoided. Usually, the maximum heart rate lowering effect of fingolimod occurred within 6 hours of the first dose, however effects may also have occurred as late as 20 hours after the first dose. As a consequence, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend that prior to treatment, initiation of electrocardiogram testing is necessary and subsequent to the first dose of fingolimod all patients must be monitored for signs of bradycardia for at least 6 hours. In patients who are at higher risk the period of cardiovascular monitoring must be extended (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dhps-5-037">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>There are no adequate clinical trials in patients with MS which have studied AEs of fingolimod in pregnancy. However, experimental studies in rabbits and rats suggest teratogenicity and embryo lethality subsequent to medication with fingolimod in pregnant animals. Furthermore, the S1PR is critical for cardiovascular development and loss of S1PR expression leads to malformed embryonic hearts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-dhps-5-037">21</xref></p><p>The FDA has given fingolimod a pregnancy category C (animal studies have shown an AE on the fetus and there are no adequate studies in humans) and the US prescribing information advises women of childbearing age to have a strict use of contraceptives to avoid pregnancies during and for the 8 weeks after discontinuation of fingolimod. In parallel, breastfeeding women should not be exposed to fingolimod (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dhps-5-037">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Place in therapy</title><p>There is clear evidence of the benefit of fingolimod in adults with RRMS and fingolimod has demonstrated a superior efficacy than IFN-&#x003b2;-1a. Furthermore, fingolimod in a dosage of 1.25 mg/day improves health-related quality of life and depression compared with a placebo in RRMS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-dhps-5-037">22</xref> However, due to its safety profile, treatment with fingolimod requires intensive monitoring both before the first dose and in the course of treatment.

Further phase II studies investigated the safety and efficacy of teriflunomide (7 or 14 mg/day) as adjunctive therapy in RRMS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-dhps-5-037">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-dhps-5-037">27</xref> teriflunomide (7 or 14 mg/day) added to ongoing stable-dosed IFN-&#x003b2; in RRMS resulted in a significant reduction of MRI disease activity in comparison to treatment with IFN-&#x003b2; alone after a 48 week treatment period. Another phase II study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of teriflunomide (7 or 14 mg/day) added to ongoing stable-dosed treatment with glatiramer acetate has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed publication.

Additionally, there was a significant reduction of the MRI disease burden (total area, number of lesions, volume of T2 lesions, and number of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions) in both teriflunomide groups and teriflunomide (14 mg/day) was superior to the placebo with regard to disease progression (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03).</p><p>In addition to TEMSO, results of the phase III trial TENERE (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00883337) are expected soon. TENERE enrolled 324 participants, was scheduled for 48 weeks, and was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of teriflunomide (7 mg/day and 14 mg/day) and IFN-&#x003b2;-1a (Rebif<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; 44 mg subcutaneously three times per week) in RRMS. Preliminary results were announced in 2011.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-dhps-5-037">29</xref> Both treatment regimens failed to demonstrate a statistical superiority in comparison to treatment with IFN-&#x003b2;-1a.

The primary outcome measure is the ARR, and the treatment period is scheduled for 24 months. Currently the study is ongoing but not recruiting participants (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00751881).

In TEMSO, the proportion of AEs (87.5%, 89.1%, and 90.8%) and severe AEs (12.8%, 14.1%, and 15.9%) was similar across groups. In parallel, the frequency of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation was similar in all study groups (8.1%, 9.8%, and 10.8%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-dhps-5-037">27</xref> Diarrhea, dizziness, nausea, paresthesia, alopecia, and elevated alanine amino-transferase (ALT) were more common in patients treated with teriflunomide as compared with those taking the placebo (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dhps-5-037">Table 2</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-dhps-5-037">27</xref> Usually, AEs were mild to moderate and normalized without discontinuation of the drug. Aside from elevation of ALT, laboratory examination revealed a mean reduction of neutrophil and lymphocyte counts from baseline more often in the teriflunomide 14 mg/day group than the teriflunomide 7 mg/day or placebo groups. In the majority of cases reductions occurred during the first 12 weeks and stabilized within the course.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-dhps-5-037">27</xref> Serious AEs included pathological liver function, neutropenia, and trigeminal neuralgia as well as one case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-dhps-5-037">27</xref> No opportunistic infections and cases of death related to the study drug were reported.

Animal studies provided positive evidence for fetal malformations. The FDA classified leflunomide as pregnancy category X (animal or human studies have shown fetal abnormalities or toxicity, and the risk outweighs the benefits). Thus, leflunomide is contraindicated in women who plan to become pregnant. In parallel, male patients are recommended to stop treatment with leflunomide if they plan to father a child. A total of 45 pregnancies in female study patients were identified. No structural defects or functional deficits were reported in newborns whereas there were 21 induced abortions and 9 spontaneous abortions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-dhps-5-037">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-dhps-5-037">30</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Place in therapy</title><p>Teriflunomide is a promising available oral agent. Trial data underline the efficacy of teriflunomide in RRMS although preliminary data showed no superiority to IFN-&#x003b2;-1a. Due to its favorable risk benefit profile, teriflunomide might provide an alternative therapeutic option to established injectable agents. It may replace IFN-&#x003b2; and glatiramer acetate or supplement established therapies. Final statements concerning beneficial effects and AEs as well as the time point of licensing are possible after finishing and analyzing ongoing studies.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Cladribine</title><p>Cladribine (2-chloro-2&#x02032;-deoxyadenosine) is a deaminaseresistant deoxyadenosine analogue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dhps-5-037">Figure 1</xref>). It is a long-lasting treatment and application is very comfortable without daily intake. Tablets are taken in two cycles per year, each lasting a few days. As the structure of cladribine is similar to adenosine triphosphate, cladribine triphosphate gets incorporated into DNA in dividing cells, leading to DNA damage and subsequent cell death (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dhps-5-037">Table 1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-dhps-5-037">31</xref> The mode of action selectively depletes numbers of circulating peripheral T(CD4+ and CD8+) and B lymphocytes.
