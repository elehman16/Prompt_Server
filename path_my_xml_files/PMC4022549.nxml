This study assesses whether financial coverage increases the proportion of successful quitters.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A pragmatic, open-label, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in 58 Canadian sites between March 2009 and September 2010. Smokers (&#x02265;10 cigarettes/day) without insurance coverage who were motivated to quit within 14&#x000a0;days were randomized (1:1) in a blinded manner to receive either full coverage eligibility for 26&#x000a0;weeks or no coverage. Pharmacotherapies covered were varenicline, bupropion, or nicotine patches/gum. Investigators/subjects were unblinded to study group assignment after randomization and prior to choosing a smoking cessation method(s). All subjects received brief smoking cessation counseling. The primary outcome measure was self-reported 7-day point prevalence of abstinence (PPA) at week 26.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 1380 randomized subjects (coverage, 696; no coverage, 684), 682 (98.0%) and 435 (63.6%), respectively, were dispensed at least one smoking cessation medication dose.

The efficacy of all smoking cessation medications (pharmacotherapy) i.e., varenicline, bupropion, and nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs; patch, gum, lozenge, inhaler, and nasal spray) is well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Nicotine replacement therapies (odds ratio [OR]&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.89, credible interval [CrI] 95% 1.63&#x02013;2.18), bupropion (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.95, CrI 95% 1.58&#x02013;2.41), and varenicline (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.78, CrI 95% 2.17&#x02013;3.57) all increase the odds of 12-month abstinence compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although there are many reasons why smokers do not access pharmacotherapy, lack of insurance coverage remains a significant barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Pharmacotherapy coverage may increase the number of quit attempts, the likelihood of pharmacotherapy utilization and adherence, and ultimately, smoking cessation.</p><p>Despite pharmacotherapies being among the most cost-effective and highly advocated interventions for coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], funders have been slow to invest. Systematic reviews concluded that full coverage (versus no coverage) of pharmacotherapies could increase quit rates with low attributable incremental cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, the included trials typically excluded real-world smokers who often have psychiatric and medical comorbidity, thereby limiting generalizability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The few published pragmatic studies have several methodological problems such as not being randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and not including all available pharmacotherapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Based on the 10 dimensions of the PRECIS Tool to evaluate clinical trial design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], this mostly pragmatic open-label RCT evaluated the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy coverage versus no coverage for 26 continuous weeks in increasing smoking cessation in ambulatory care settings in motivated adult smokers in Canada.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This open-label RCT was conducted in 58 different sites across Canada (excepting Quebec, Alberta, and New Brunswick). Smokers were recruited by study site referrals and advertisement. Potential subjects were screened by a call centre to assess initial eligibility and drug insurance coverage. The investigator then confirmed eligibility (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><p>Participants were adults (18&#x02013;75 years) who smoked &#x02265;10 cigarettes per day, were willing to set a quit date within 14&#x000a0;days following screening/randomization, had no period of abstinence &#x0003e;3&#x000a0;months in the past year, and had not attempted to quit smoking in the 30-day period before screening. Exclusion criteria were: unknown insurance status, access to unused pharmacotherapy or prescription, use of tobacco products other than cigarettes within the past month, and life-threatening illness (e.g., known or suspected cancer or other disease with a life expectancy of &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;year). Medical and psychiatric conditions were not exclusion criteria <italic>per se</italic>.</p><p>The study was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles originating in or derived from the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with all International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. Written informed consent for participation in the study was obtained from all participants. The final protocol, any amendments, and informed consent documentation were reviewed and approved by the Canadian Institutional Review Board (IRB) (IRB Services, Aurora, ON, Canada), or by local Canadian Ethics Committees (University of British Columbia Clinical Research Ethics Board, Vancouver, BC; Vancouver Island Health Authority Clinical Research Ethics Board, Victoria, BC; University of Manitoba Research Ethics, Winnipeg, MB; Winnipeg Clinic Ethics Committee, Winnipeg, MB; Research Ethics Board St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, Hamilton, ON; University of Western Ontario Office of Research Ethics, London, ON).</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and interventions</title><p>Eligible participants were first counseled about smoking cessation and then randomly and blindly assigned (1:1; centrally to prevent gaming) at the baseline visit to receive either full coverage for 26&#x000a0;weeks or no coverage. Randomization was performed by the investigators using blinded lots of computer-generated randomization codes from the study biostatistician. Randomization codes were mapped to SmartPayment&#x02122; cards (drug reimbursement cards), with a distinctive color linked to the study arm to which the subject was randomized. The SmartPayment&#x02122; cards were enclosed in sealed envelopes with the randomization codes printed on the envelopes. After unblinding, the investigator and participant agreed on the pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological smoking cessation method(s) to be used. Eligible pharmacotherapies were: varenicline; bupropion; and NRT patch and gum, prescribed according to the most recent version of the respective product monograph or equivalent (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). A prescription had to be issued by a physician for these pharmacotherapies to be reimbursed; NRTs obtained without a prescription were not eligible for coverage, but were considered medication for statistical analysis. Participants (irrespective of allocated group) were not obliged to use a pharmacotherapy in their quit attempt. A target quit date was set within 14&#x000a0;days of randomization. The use of a SmartPayment&#x02122; card permitted access to either full coverage of prescribed pharmacotherapy for 26&#x000a0;weeks (full coverage) or a reimbursement of $5.00 per pharmacy dispensation (no coverage). This facilitated tracking of prescriptions dispensed in both groups and provided an incentive for subjects in the no coverage group to present their card at each pharmacy visit. Participants received compensation for reasonable expenses for transportation or parking for study appointments, if needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments and follow-up</title><p>Patient assessment, treatment recommendations, and prescriptions, as needed, were performed by physicians. Other study-related tasks were performed by trained personnel. Participants were screened at the baseline visit for demographic information, type of drug plan insurance, smoking history, Fagerstr&#x000f6;m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], comorbid medical/psychiatric history including the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C&#x02013;SSRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]), and concomitant medications. Brief (10-minute) smoking cessation counseling was provided to all subjects at the screening visit and at each contact, per each site&#x02019;s practice. Prior to study start, all participating sites were provided brief training in current clinical recommendations/guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Participants made four clinic visits (weeks 1, 26, 39, and 52), and received six telephone calls (weeks 2, 13, 30, 34, 44, and 48), during which smoking status, quit attempt(s)/methods, FTND score, and abstinence status (via self-report at clinic visits) were collected. Confirmatory urinary cotinine measurements were collected, but investigators and patients were blinded to the results to mimic real-world practice (where this is not widely used). Patients were not aware that physicians were blinded to the results.</p><p>Safety evaluations included adverse event (AE) monitoring, physical examinations, and C&#x02013;SSRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. All observed or volunteered AEs, regardless of smoking cessation method or suspected causal relationship, were to be reported. The investigator was required to pursue information to both determine the outcome of the AE and assess whether it met criteria for a serious AE. Events were recorded up to and including 28&#x000a0;days after the last administration of one of the smoking cessation methods or week 26 (whichever was longer).</p></sec><sec><title>Effectiveness evaluations</title><p>The primary endpoint was self-reported 7-day point prevalence of abstinence (PPA) at week 26 (end of coverage eligibility), defined as abstinence from smoking (not a single puff) for at least the preceding 7&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This pragmatic endpoint was chosen because in real-world settings there is no evidence of significant difference between estimates of smoking prevalence based on self-report versus urinary cotinine measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Whereas the primary endpoint was more pragmatic, the key secondary endpoints (self-reported 7-day PPA at week 26 and continuous abstinence rates [CAR] at weeks 26&#x02013;52, confirmed by urine cotinine) were more explanatory. Other secondary endpoints were self-reported 7-day PPA at weeks 2 and 13, self-reported CAR (weeks 26&#x02013;39), total number of quit attempts from randomization through week 26, and use of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies during quit attempts.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Based on previous clinical studies of varenicline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], market research, and relevant literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], quit rates in the no coverage versus full coverage group were assumed to be 15% versus 21%, respectively. A sample size of at least 676 participants per group was estimated to provide 80% power to detect a conservative difference of 6% between groups. Some consider a 2% difference clinically significant because of the estimated 50% risk reduction in smoking-related mortality associated with cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Outcome measures were assessed using an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis that included all randomized participants. Individuals who discontinued the study or were lost to follow-up were counted as smokers from the time of discontinuation. For calculation of CAR, participants who reported no smoking or no use of nicotine since the last contact and had a negative urine cotinine test were counted as non-smokers. Participants with missing urine cotinine test results were considered smokers.</p><p>Endpoints were analyzed using logistic regression models that included randomized group effect (full coverage versus non-coverage) as the independent variable and investigation centre as a covariate. In addition, the interaction between randomized group and centre was tested by expanding the logistic regression model to add the interaction term. In testing for the primary and key secondary endpoints, the Type-I overall error rate of 0.05 was preserved by using statistical methods that adjusted for multiple tests.</p><p>Safety data were summarized for all randomized subjects. The incidence of AEs reported during the study was summarized by randomized arm (coverage; non-coverage) and pharmacotherapy (users; non-users) for descriptive rather than comparative purposes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>Eligible participants were recruited from March 3, 2009 to September 20, 2010.

Using self-report and cotinine-confirmed abstinence measurements, respectively, the probability of quitting smoking at the end of the intervention in the full coverage group was 1.64 and 1.68 times larger than the probability of quitting in the no coverage group. Although there was a statistically significant difference between the self-reported and cotinine-confirmed quit rates, there was no significant difference between the groups (data not shown). The weeks 26&#x02013;39 and weeks 26&#x02013;52 CARs between the two groups did not differ significantly, possibly indicating the loss of this benefit upon withdrawal of pharmacotherapy coverage. Using self-reported 7-day PPA at week 26, for every 14.4 smokers who receive pharmacotherapy coverage, there will be one additional quitter. Of every 8.3 persons covered, one will experience an AE due to attempting to quit smoking, and of every 111, one will discontinue due to a serious AE. Given that smoking kills one in two people, the risks of pharmacotherapy are lower than continuing to smoke.</p><p>The results of this study could be explained by greater medication adherence and utilization in the full coverage group, and a consequent greater number of quit attempts. In the no coverage group, the larger loss to follow-up may reflect real-life experience of smokers who receive cessation counselling, but do not complete their quit attempt because of lack of coverage. However, a higher than anticipated number of subjects (63.6%) in the control group were dispensed pharmacotherapy during the intervention period. This could be explained by higher motivation of the smokers in this trial and the SmartPayment&#x02122; card reimbursement of $5.00 per pharmacy dispensation in the control group. Moreover, the study sites, although not based in academic centres, might not reflect other community ambulatory clinics. These clinics were selected to participate because of their interest in treating tobacco addiction and might have been more diligent in promoting medication to stop smoking, medication adherence, and restarting medications in those who failed to quit.</p><p>The results of our study are consistent with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, our study had a greater number of quit attempts, use of pharmacotherapy, and slightly higher quit rates in both groups. This may be because our study enrolled motivated smokers and empowered the practitioner&#x02013;patient dynamic by permitting tailoring of pharmacotherapy options during the coverage period. The loss of effectiveness of coverage by week 39 (13&#x000a0;weeks after coverage ceased) should be interpreted with caution because it is not clear if the diminished quit rates reflect the chronic relapsing nature of nicotine dependence, the erosion of the intervention effect over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], lack of statistical power, the intensity and frequency of the follow-up, or the stringency of the definition of a continuous quitter for a pragmatic, real-world trial. It should be noted that week-26 PPA was chosen as a pragmatic endpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and the study was not powered to detect statistical significance for CARs.</p><p>Despite the study limitations, several strengths should be highlighted. The study was community-based with minimal exclusion criteria; the majority of subjects were treated by their own physician; each smoker could choose their preferred quit method(s) (pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological); and subjects received personalized treatment rather than a standard protocol. Our study attempted to create a longer window than the usual 10&#x02013;12 weeks of standard coverage during which participants could keep trying to quit and allowed for a switch to or combination with another medication. Subject recruitment was completed 5&#x000a0;months ahead of schedule, indicating the demand for services, easy adoption of the protocol, and feasibility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The adoption of a pharmacotherapy coverage drug policy was shown to be an effective intervention to improve 26-week quit rates in Canada. Medication adherence needs to be promoted by prescribers to enhance quitting. Relapse prevention strategies that include preventing and managing slips through extended behavioural and or pharmacological interventions or combination medication might be required for smokers who respond to pharmacotherapy but relapse once medication is discontinued. Further research is needed to establish the actual duration of coverage required for sustained effects on smoking cessation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Pfizer sponsored the study and recruited study sites based on various factors, including but not limited to, clinical research experience and capabilities, smoking cessation expertise/interest, and referral from peers.
