Use of eltrombopag with interferon-based treatment for patients with thrombocytopenia and HCV was assessed in two similarly designed phase 3 trials (Eltrombopag to Initiate and Maintain Interferon Antiviral Treatment to Benefit Subjects With Hepatitis C-Related Liver Disease [ENABLE-1 and ENABLE-2]). These trials also aimed to determine whether response to antiviral therapy (e.g., sustained virologic response [SVR]) is associated with changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This pooled, post-hoc analysis aimed to (1) determine whether or not specific aspects of clinical response to treatment (i.e., achieving SVR) are associated with a significant change in HRQoL, and (2) to determine the magnitude and direction of the association between important changes in HRQoL, clinical response to interferon-based therapy (e.g., SVR) and treatment (eltrombopag or placebo), and patient and disease attributes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The Short-Form 36 Health Survey version 2 and Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire&#x02013;Hepatitis C Virus version were administered at various time points during the studies.

Physical and mental health component summary (PCS and MCS, respectively) scores are then computed using the 8 subscales, to provide a broader metric of physical and mental HRQoL. The technique of norm-based scoring (NBS) is used to calculate the subscales and composite scores; this technique transforms or standardizes scale and component scores using the means and standard deviations (SDs) from a general US population normative sample (QualityMetric 2009 PRO Norming Study, QualityMetric, Lincoln, RI, USA; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), drawn from a national probability sample of US non-institutionalized adults (KnowledgePanel, GfK Custom Research North America, New York, NY, USA).

Consequently, all scores &#x0003c;50 can be interpreted as being below, and scores &#x0003e;50 can be interpreted as being above, the general US population norm. All scales and component scores with NBS are scored on a common metric and facilitate meaningful comparisons.

Approximately one-half of the questions in the CLDQ and the CLDQ-HCV are common. The remaining questions focus on symptoms and issues unique to HCV. The CLDQ-HCV was designed with a 2-week recall period, and items fall into 4 domains: activity/energy, emotion, systemic symptoms, and worry. Each item uses 7-point Likert scales ranging from 1 (all the time) to 7 (none of the time).</p><p>Responses on the CLDQ-HCV were coded into domain scores according to the algorithms designed by the developers; greater scores indicate better HRQoL. This permits decrements in HRQoL from baseline to be captured as negative values, while improved status is captured as positive values.

Other considerations that underlie the model include that duration of AVT depends upon genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and that exposure for 80&#x000a0;% of the planned time and at 80&#x000a0;% of the planned dose of IFN is associated with the greatest likelihood of sustained viral response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>The model used to estimate the log odds of each HRQoL outcome is as follows:<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

SF-36 scores from previous publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] generally agree with those in this study, particularly regarding the impact upon specific SF-36v2 HRQoL domains. All patients enrolled in the ENABLE trials had thrombocytopenia, and 90&#x000a0;% had cirrhosis. Based on the similar safety and efficacy results of the individual ENABLE trials, the descriptive HRQoL analyses in the pooled sample is not expected to differ from HRQoL results analyzed separately.</p><p>An important finding of this study is the observed decline in HRQoL from baseline at AVT initiation and during the course of treatment, with a return to baseline levels upon completing treatment. Although declines in HRQoL were smaller in eltrombopag-treated patients, differences between this group and placebo-treated patients were generally too small to be interpreted as clinically meaningful when the change in HRQoL from baseline to the end of treatment and from AVT baseline to 24&#x000a0;weeks following the completion of AVT were assessed. Treatment with eltrombopag did not mitigate the effects of AVT on HRQoL or worsen adverse events or symptoms of AVT versus placebo. The data suggest that eltrombopag, by keeping platelet counts at levels sufficient to initiate, continue, and complete INF-based AVT, can provide patients who have severe liver disease an opportunity to receive IFN-based treatment without increasing adverse events such as flu-like symptoms or depression that would further impact their HRQoL. Although new non-IFN-based therapies are approved, these treatments may not be available to patients with HCV in all geographical regions of the world, where IFN may still be used to treat patients with HCV infection.</p><p>Regarding both EVR and SVR, analyses of HRQoL changes showed a greater association and clearer patterns in terms of smaller declines in mean HRQoL scores among patients achieving a virologic response. Nevertheless, mean changes in patients achieving EVR and SVR tended to be small compared with accepted thresholds of minimally (clinically) important difference. Furthermore, differences between patients achieving versus not achieving EVR were generally too small to be interpreted as meaningful. Although differences in effect sizes were slightly larger between patients who did and did not achieve SVR, these were also too small to be interpreted as meaningful. Achieving SVR and eliminating the viral infection would be anticipated to slow the progression of liver disease, but do not reverse it. Partitioning the HRQoL effects into those related to INF-based therapy versus those related to viral clearance (EVR and SVR), IFN-based treatment would likely account for the majority of the decline in HRQoL during treatment and improvement in HRQoL after stopping treatment.</p><p>Patients infected with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 received 24&#x000a0;weeks of AVT versus 48&#x000a0;weeks for patients infected with other genotypes. Nonetheless, with the exception of the small interaction between SVR and EVR, none of the 5 clinical factors (SVR, EVR, genotype [2/3 vs. non-2/3], treatment [eltrombopag or placebo], and cumulative IFN dose) was confirmed as a predictor of meaningful change in HRQoL. However, patients with a MELD score &#x0003c;10 (those with less severe cirrhosis and liver damage) were significantly more likely to return to their overall baseline CLDQ-HCV, PCS, and MCS scores.</p><p>The logistic regression models revealed consistent OR patterns for East Asians versus other Asians, and other Asians versus white/other ethnicities for the CLDQ-HCV and SF-36v2 PCS and MCS scores. East Asian patients were consistently more likely to experience a meaningful drop in HRQoL than white/other patients, but also more likely to experience a return to their baseline scores. Other Asians were generally less likely to experience a drop in HRQoL versus white/other patients. Of note, Asian patients received a reduced eltrombopag dose, although eltrombopag treatment seemed to have little impact on HRQoL changes versus placebo. Assessments of HRQoL in Asian patients with chronic HCV infections receiving interferon-based AVT have not been reported in the literature. However, cultural differences in perceptions regarding health status may contribute to differences in scores for the different scales of the SF-36v2, as was seen in a study in Taiwan that revealed the vitality scale was a stronger measure of mental health than physical health in the local population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>The current study has limitations. Data were derived from clinical trials, which may not fully reflect real-world clinical practice. Relatively few patients achieved SVR or EVR compared with those treated with AVT and randomized to receive eltrombopag; therefore, we may not have been able to detect robust average change in HRQoL because of the small number of responders. A general US population was used as the norm in these analyses; however, the trials were international, and differences seen in Asian patients enrolled in these studies may be affected by this. Additionally, there are many options available for measuring the MIC and no particular method is indicative of or reliable in reflecting how patients themselves may perceive change in their health status or quality of life. The choice to use one half SD as an estimate of the MIC was reasonable for expressing observed changes in a standardized way, but is also imperfect and may under- or overestimate the true MIC, as discussed by Farivar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] in a critical review of Norman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A decline in HRQoL was observed during AVT with a return to baseline levels at 24-week post treatment follow-up. Treatment with eltrombopag neither significantly reduced nor enhanced the pattern of changes in HRQoL associated with AVT.
