The study was conducted at 20 sites in the USA (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary file 1</xref>). The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at all participating centres, and the study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. All principal investigators and subinvestigators and study coordinators at each site were required to complete scale assessment training prior to enrolling any patients in the study.

Data from placebo groups were pooled for reporting of results and statistical analyses. Because weekly RCI exposure was similar for the two RCI dosing regimens, statistical analyses were performed comparing pooled placebo data to specific RCI dose regimens, as well as to pooled RCI data. All efficacy and safety analyses were performed on a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, which included all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study medication and had at least one post-baseline assessment of efficacy or safety.</p><p>The primary endpoint (response rate at week 4), the response rate at week 8, and the SRI at both time points were analysed by means of an exact logistic regression model with treatment group (three levels: RCI 40&#x02005;U or 80&#x02005;U and combined placebo groups) as a factor. Secondary endpoints were analysed using analysis-of-covariance models with treatment group as a factor and baseline value of the relevant endpoint as covariate. Secondary endpoints that were proportions were analysed using Fisher's exact test. All statistical tests were two sided, and p values below 0.05 were considered significant.

Although the primary endpoint was not met, the study did demonstrate improved disease activity in patients receiving RCI as compared with placebo as reflected by total hSLEDAI and BILAG scores. SLEDAI and BILAG are widely accepted SLE disease activity indices that are commonly used in lupus clinical trials.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> While the SLEDAI and BILAG scoring systems have been used extensively for clinical investigations in SLE, they have limitations. SLEDAI, for example, is unable to capture partial but potentially clinically important improvement in disease activity, and worsening of a pre-existing manifestation does not yield a change in score.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The improvements in both global (hSLEDAI) and organ-specific (BILAG) disease activity measures in patients receiving RCI as compared with placebo strengthen the evidence that RCI reduces disease burden in this subpopulation of patients with SLE. Concordant improvements in skin or arthritic manifestations of disease as reflected by the CLASI activity score and Tender and Swollen Joint Count in RCI-treated patients provide yet further support of the efficacy of RCI in this SLE subpopulation. The CLASI scoring system provides a validated measure of cutaneous involvement that has been shown to be responsive to treatment-induced reductions in lupus skin lesions.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Both CLASI and the Tender and Swollen Joint Count assess cutaneous and musculoskeletal manifestations of SLE at a specific point in time, and have been used in other investigational SLE trials to verify measures of disease activity in these organ systems captured by SLEDAI and BILAG.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Significant response to RCI was not reflected by the PGA, a subjective assessment describing global disease activity at a single point in time.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, post hoc analysis demonstrated that, by week 8, over half of RCI-treated patients were responders, as measured by a well-established composite responder index, the SRI,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> compared with fewer than 20% of patients receiving placebo.</p><p>Statistically significant differences in changes from baseline for QoL measures (SF-36 and KFSS) were also not detected with consistency between RCI-treated and placebo-treated patients over the 8-week study period. This might reflect a lack of impact of RCI on QoL measures due to the small sample, the short duration of therapy or a true lack of benefit of the intervention. Analysis of serial SF-36 scores obtained over an average of 8&#x02005;years in a large cohort of patients with established SLE revealed that the SF-36 aggregate, mental and physical component scores did not change appreciably over time.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The authors concluded that these measures may not be sensitive to changes in disease activity or damage. Although Furie <italic>et al</italic> demonstrated significant improvements in fatigue and QoL metrics in a post hoc analysis of the phase 3 belimumab data set, the comparison in their analysis was between SRI responders and non-responders, irrespective of treatment assignment.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>The response to treatment with RCI in the SLE population studied was seen as early as week 6 for improvements from baseline in total hSLEDAI score, and by week 8 significant improvements were seen in most objective and composite measures of disease activity (total BILAG, improvement in BILAG A and B scores, CLASI activity and Tender and Swollen Joint Count). An alternative approach to the treatment of active SLE that has been evaluated in clinical trials<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> is the use of B-cell inhibitors such as belimumab. In the BLISS-52 study, response rates as measured by the SRI were significantly higher with belimumab than with placebo.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> However, clinical improvement was not seen until 16&#x02005;weeks, whereas in the current study, improvements in disease activity occurred as early as 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks after the start of treatment with RCI. Although the novel composite primary endpoint for the study was negative, the statistically significant improvements seen for multiple other concordant measures of SLE disease activity achieved by week 8 are notable given the small sample size. Taken together, these controlled data suggest that RCI may be an effective therapy for SLE, although the applicability of these data to a wider SLE patient population will need to be tested in future controlled trials.</p><p>RCI was well tolerated in this study. The overall incidence of AEs was comparable to the placebo group, and the majority of AEs were mild or moderate. The higher incidence of infections in patients receiving RCI may be related to the steroidogenic effects of ACTH.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Strengths of this study include the use of well-validated outcome measures that evaluate articular, systemic and cutaneous manifestations of SLE; objective assessments of global and organ-specific disease activity with varying recall periods; physician-reported and patient-reported subjective outcome measures; and the inclusion of patients with persistent disease despite moderate doses of corticosteroids, a more difficult-to-treat subset of patients.</p><p>The study has a number of limitations, however, notably that no formal sample size calculations to achieve statistical power were performed. Because of the small sample size, patients were not stratified based on disease severity nor background therapies, and potential imbalances in either of these parameters might have influenced response to treatment. In addition, the primary endpoint was a responder index that has not been reported in other clinical investigations of SLE therapies. Potential explanations for the discrepancy between response assessed by the primary endpoint and the more conventional SLE disease activity indices include the small sample size, limitation of the novel responder index to reflect improvement in SLEDAI domains other than rash and arthritis, and a more stringent definition for BILAG worsening (no worsening in any organ system by BILAG) as compared with previously validated composite response measures such as the SRI and BILAG-based Combined Lupus Assessment (no new BILAG A or no more than one new BILAG B domain score).</p><p>In conclusion, the data from this controlled pilot study suggest that RCI may be effective in reducing disease activity in patients with steroid-dependent SLE involving skin and/or joints, and will inform the design of future clinical investigations of RCI in SLE.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The first draft of the manuscript was prepared by academic and industry authors, with professional medical writing and editorial assistance provided by Michael Shaw, Caudex, Oxford, UK, and funded by Mallinckrodt.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> RF was involved in the design of the study, interpretation and analysis of data, and drafting of the manuscript or revising it for critically important intellectual content.
