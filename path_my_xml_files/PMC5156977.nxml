Suicidal behavior causes a significant range of negative consequences including increased likelihood of suicide reattempt and death.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Suicide is one of the three leading causes of death between the ages of 15 and 34 years, and it is one of the five leading causes of death in adolescence.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The World Health Organization estimates that every year approximately one million people die by suicide worldwide, which represents an annual global mortality rate of 16 per 100,000.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>During 1 year after the suicide, 12&#x02013;15% of the patients repeat nonfatal suicidal behavior and about 0.8&#x02013;2.6% of this attempts are fatal.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Repeated suicide attempt is a very important risk factor for future attempt, but it seems that intervention is one of the most important measures for suicide prevention in individuals with previous attempts. Many suicide attempts occur in patients with mood disorders and many of these patients often do not follow a proper treatment process and are not cooperative, which is one of the factors that increases the risk of suicide reattempt.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This has many causes, some of which may be due to problems such as long patient wait times for the visit, the patient admissions process, as well as the lack of proper rapport.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>While there is abundant information about the epidemiology of suicidal behavior, there is little evidence about reducing the risk of suicide reattempts, especially randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), and it is difficult to assess the effects of proposed intervention strategies to reduce the reattempt rate among suicide attempters.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>A promising intervention in adults has been focused on maintaining relationships with people who attempted suicide. Some interventions that have been suggested for the prevention of reattempts are phone call follow-up, cognitive therapy, and dynamic interpersonal psychotherapy.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Fleischmann <italic>et al</italic>. performed an RTC including a brief intervention and continued communication in addition to treatments as usual for suicide attempters in Brazil, India, Sri Lanka, and Iran. Compared with the treatment as usual (TAU as a control group), the intervention results reported a significant reduction in suicide attempts. Also, Brown <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that in a follow-up period of 18 months, face-to-face meetings were effective in the reduction of suicidal attempts in adults.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Chen <italic>et al</italic>. in 2012 showed that in a follow-up period of 6 months, the risk of suicide in the group that received face-to-face intervention was significantly lower than the control group.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, Johannessen <italic>et al</italic>. in 2011 concluded that in 12 months follow-up, no difference was observed in the risk of fatal and nonfatal suicide reattempts in the control group receiving TAU versus the intervention group (receiving face-to-face follow-up and social support).[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In a study by Hvid <italic>et al</italic>. in 2009, it was demonstrated that in suicidal patients who received face-to-face interventions with rapid response as a follow-up, the suicide rates were lower compared with the control group.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Hassanzadeh <italic>et al</italic>. after a 6-month follow-up of suicide attempters who received TAU and brief intervention and contact (BIC) did not find any differences in the prevention of further suicide reattempt between two groups, but the BIC group tended to communicate and get support more than the TAU group patients.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Wei <italic>et al</italic>. in a 12-month follow-up for people who had attempted suicide faced a lack of necessary cooperation in the cognitive therapy, and despite a little better cooperation in treatment in phone group, the intervention goals were not found, so researchers recommended further studies.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Mousavi <italic>et al</italic>., after a 6-month period of phone call versus TAU follow-up after the last suicide attempt, did not find any difference in suicide reattempt between both groups, but there was clearly higher hope and lower suicidal thoughts in the intervention group, compared to the group with TAU.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Berrouiguet <italic>et al</italic>. showed significantly reduced suicide risk in the intervention group compared to the control group after a period of continuous communication and sending short messages at regular intervals for 6 months. They concluded that this method cannot replace treatment but it can be counted as a complementary treatment beside other regimens, especially in patients that refuse treatment or do not want face-to-face visits or do not access treatment.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Given the scattered above findings on the best ways to prevent the repetition of suicide attempts in various studies, lack of enough studies and interventions in our country patients and the importance of preventions in this cases, we performed a comparative study on the effects of phone call versus face-to-face communication on the prevention of suicide reattempt in patients with previous attempts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study is a RCT with parallel sample of all men and women admitted to the poisoning emergency of the Noor Hospital (the university referral center of the province) in Isfahan, Iran, from January to May 2014.

The results showed that the two procedures had no significant difference in preventing the repetition of suicidal attempts in the number and frequency among the attempters.</p><p>Despite these findings, the hope and interest increased in both groups, although it showed more improvement in the face-to-face group compared to the phone call group. Also, suicidal thoughts in both groups decreased over time, but again, the reduction was more significant in the face-to-face group.</p><p>The problems mentioned as the current suicide attempt causes by the participants significantly decreased over time, but this improvement was not significant, comparing the two groups.</p><p>The incidence of new problems during the intervention in the face-to-face group was lower than the phone call group.</p><p>Likewise, in the authors&#x02019; and colleagues&#x02019; previous study,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] there was no significant difference in the reduction of suicide reattempts between &#x0201c;phone call communication,&#x0201d; compared with the &#x0201c;treatment as usual&#x0201d; group during 6 months follow-up, but the &#x0201c;phone call&#x0201d; group patients showed an increased hope and decreased suicidal thoughts compared with the &#x0201c;treatment as usual&#x0201d; group patients. In this study, we evaluated the &#x0201c;phone call&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;face to face&#x0201d; follow-up, but in previous study there was not face-to-face communication, and the control group was allowed to treat as they choose.</p><p>Our finding is consistent with both of our studies, and the Hassanzadeh <italic>et al</italic>. results[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] showed similarities in reduction of suicidal thoughts and improvement of hope in intervention groups. These results show the more close the relationship with suicidal patient, the more hope will arise, and the less suicidal thoughts will remain. But, in our study, there was no significant difference in reducing suicide reattempts between the two groups of phone call intervention and face-to-face intervention. This between groups indifference of suicidal reattempt in the presence of the improvement of hope and reduction of suicidal thoughts may be caused due to the equal effect of the two methods (i.e., phone call and face-to-face communication), or the short-term duration of follow-up (8 months).</p><p>The study of Vaiva <italic>et al</italic>. in a 12-month follow-up of phone call support versus TAU revealed that phone call is effective in preventing suicide reattempt, supports the impact of the duration time of the intervention on the results.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Furthermore, Fleischmann <italic>et al</italic>. added BIC to the TAU and showed fewer suicide reattempts in the intervention group compared with TAU alone (as a control group) during 18 months.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Limitations and suggestions</title><p>This study had several limitations. One was the 8-month period follow-up, which must be lengthened in future works. The second limitation may be mere phone or face-to-face contact, empathy, and guidance. Surely different approaches of the psychologist/psychiatrist/social worker (suggested therapists) have some effects on the therapeutic responses, and these may somehow confound the results. However, our logic in this study was an evaluation of mere phone versus face-to-face contact. We suggest matching the referred therapists approaches with the responses in future studies. Also, the sample can be taken from different centers that admit patients attempting suicide in different ways, with more focus on the impact of each suicidal attempts way.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Comparing the two methods of &#x0201c;phone call follow-up&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;face to face&#x0201d; follow-up in prevention of suicide reattempt, there was tangible, significant reduction in suicidal thoughts and improvement of the interest and hope in the face-to-face group compared to the phone call group, despite the lack of significant differences between the two groups in suicidal reattempt in 8 months follow-up.
