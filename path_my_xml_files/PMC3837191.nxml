Primary variables were headache, weakness, salivation and motor coordination. Out of four primary variables, weakness and motor coordination showed a statistically significant difference between alcohol and non-alcohol group, out of 14 secondary variables, five more variables (dizziness, alterations in sight, alterations in walking, agitation and alterations in speech) also showed significant differences due mainly to contrasts with the non-alcohol group. In none of these end points, could a statistically significant effect be found for the additional ingestion of energy drink or caffeine on the subjective feelings of alcohol intoxication.

Since 2004, energy drinks have been the fastest growing sector of the beverage market, for example the market in Western Europe has grown by 12.9&#x000a0;% between 2007 and 2011 (Database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2012</xref>). One of the most popular energy drinks is Red Bull<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, which has been available in Austria since 1987 and in the United States since 1997 (Reissig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>). It is now available in more than 160 countries.</p><p>The ingestion of caffeine-containing drinks together with alcohol is not a new phenomenon (e.g. rum coke/cola), and recently the combination of energy drinks with alcohol has become popular, with 20&#x000a0;% of students occasionally combining energy drinks with alcohol (de Haan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>). In the past, concerns have been raised suggesting that the combination of both substances might reduce the subjective feelings of alcohol intoxication&#x02014;the so-called &#x0201c;masking effect&#x0201d; (Ferreira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>). Therefore the risk for dangerous activities, such as driving a car, would be increased. Thus possible effects of combined alcohol and caffeine consumption are an important research topic.</p><p>Several studies have already investigated whether caffeine counteracts the neuro-cognitive effects of alcohol consumption, with inconsistent results (Ferreira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>; Alford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2012</xref>; Azcona et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1995</xref>; Marczinski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>). Some studies report a significant antagonising effect of caffeine on alcohol such as influencing weakness and impairment of motor coordination (Ferreira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>), or they suggest that the combination of caffeine and alcohol may lead to longer drinking and to an increase in stimulation compared to alcohol-only consumption (Attwood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>). Other investigations could not find any antagonising effects (Alford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2012</xref>; Marczinski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>; Verster et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>).</p><p>One of the most cited studies regarding the so-called &#x0201c;masking effect&#x0201d; was performed by (Ferreira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>). In this study, twenty-six young and healthy male volunteers were tested concerning breath alcohol concentration, subjective sensations of intoxication, motor coordination, and visual reaction time after consumption of energy drink (3.57&#x000a0;ml/kg&#x000a0;bw), alcohol (0.6 or 1.0&#x000a0;g/kg&#x000a0;bw) or both, using a mixed design. The additional ingestion of energy drinks did not modify breath alcohol concentration, motor coordination, and visual reaction time. Regarding subjective sensations of intoxication, more descriptors registered similar impairment with the energy drink and alcohol combination versus alcohol alone, than showed reduced impairment after co-administration of energy drink with alcohol. However, the authors interpreted these findings as a so-called &#x0201c;masking effect&#x0201d;, since they found significant differences in headache, weakness, salivation and motor coordination.</p><p>Given the variability of results regarding the perception of impairment, no valid evidence can be derived from this study. Therefore, the results and conclusion of this study should be re-assessed and discussed again, especially concerning the importance of the four mentioned subjective effects of intoxication (headache, weakness, salivation and motor coordination) which were reported to be significant. Since the publication of this study, several methodological flaws of this study have been discussed, in particular the statistical analysis, and the interpretation of the results are not undisputed (Alford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2012</xref>; Verster et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>). However, the data have neither been confirmed nor rebutted, and in a review published in 2012, Verster et al. conclude that the masking effect of energy drinks cannot be confirmed by currently available data (Verster et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we aimed to replicate Ferreira&#x02019;s study with a higher number of healthy participants and a within-subjects design to re-examine the effects of alcohol in combination with caffeine or energy drink with special focus on the so-called &#x0201c;masking effect&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Fifty-two healthy male volunteers participated in the study. Their age was 20&#x02013;26&#x000a0;years (24.4&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.5), with body mass indices between 21 and 25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (23.2&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.1), body weight between 68 and 85&#x000a0;kg (77.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.8) and at least 12&#x02013;14&#x000a0;years of formal education. All volunteers were in good general health as determined by medical history and screening investigations. All were taking no regular medication and had no history of psychiatric disorders.</p><p>Further inclusion criteria were: Moderate alcohol consumption (less than 190.4&#x000a0;g/week) according to the Daily Drink questionnaire (Collins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1985</xref>), sporadic users of energy drinks (less than ten cans of 250&#x000a0;ml in the last 6&#x000a0;months), and confirmation from the participant&#x02019;s general practitioner that they do not know of any reason that would advise against participation in the study. Participants were similar regarding social and demographic data, patterns of use of alcoholic beverages and energy drinks as well as quality of life (Martinez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2000</xref>) and having a similar level of physical activity (Baecke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1982</xref>). Exclusion criteria were a consumption of less than two or more than four caffeine-containing drinks per day within 3&#x000a0;months of screening; smoking of more than ten cigarettes per day or equivalent within 3&#x000a0;months of screening; consumption of more than 190.4&#x000a0;g alcohol per week; a history of alcohol or drug abuse or consumption of less than one alcoholic drink per week.</p><p>Volunteers were informed about the procedures of the study and signed an informed consent form. The Committee of Ethics of the Medical University of Vienna approved the study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01350089).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Treatments</title><p>Four mixtures listed below were consumed orally within 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;min, on one occasion each in a randomised order. Volunteers wore a nose clip to optimise blinding. As far as possible all investigational products were identical in appearance and taste, differing only in the absence/presence of alcohol, caffeine and energy drink. The final volume of the mixtures was 500&#x000a0;ml for each treatment. The caffeine, alcohol and energy drink doses were chosen as used by Ferreira et al. because they were within the range of doses usually ingested on a single occasion (Ferreira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>).</p><p>The placebo (A) consisted of (carbonated) water (250&#x000a0;ml), artificial fruit juice [21&#x000a0;g/l prepared with (carbonated) water].</p><p>The comparator B was a mixture of 46.5&#x000a0;g ethanol (in form of vodka 37.5 vol&#x000a0;%) (carbonated) water (250&#x000a0;ml), artificial fruit juice [21&#x000a0;g/l prepared with (carbonated) water].</p><p>The comparator C was a mixture of 46.5&#x000a0;g ethanol (in form of vodka 37.5 vol&#x000a0;%), caffeine (80&#x000a0;mg, equivalent to one 250&#x000a0;ml can of a typical energy drink), (carbonated) water (250&#x000a0;ml), artificial fruit juice [21&#x000a0;g/l prepared with (carbonated) water].</p><p>The comparator D was a mixture of 46.5&#x000a0;g ethanol (in form of vodka 37.5 vol&#x000a0;%), Red Bull Energy Drink (250&#x000a0;ml, equivalent to one can, without flavour to optimise blinding), artificial fruit juice [21&#x000a0;g/l prepared with (carbonated) water].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Subjective effects of intoxication</title><p>This was evaluated through a visual analogue scale (VAS) of somatic symptoms (Bond and Lader <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1972</xref>; Greenwood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1975</xref>) including all items used in Ferreira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>. This was assessed before and 30, 75 and 120&#x000a0;min after the treatments. Each 100&#x000a0;mm line represented the whole range of possible intensity of each listed symptom (e.g. salivation&#x02013;dry mouth). The volunteers marked the location that corresponded to the intensity of their sensation with a vertical line. We tested the items: agitation, alterations in motor coordination, hearing, walking and speech, sensation of well-being, tiredness, headache, dizziness, tremor, weakness, muscular tension, nausea, salivation, perspiration, visual disturbances, tachycardia and difficulty in breathing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Procedures</title><p>The volunteers were instructed to drink no alcohol or high-energy products during each study period with the exception of study treatment. Sufficient sleep (at least 7&#x000a0;h) was required the night before testing and controlled via questionnaire on test days. No alcohol during a period of at least 72&#x000a0;h prior to each test dose was allowed. On the test days, the consumption of at least two and no more than four caffeine-containing drinks was controlled via questionnaire. On every treatment day, the volunteers were instructed to arrive fasting 15&#x000a0;min before the beginning of the treatment administration, which started around midday. A standard meal of 1,000&#x000a0;kcal (1 Big Mac, small French fries and water) was given 45&#x000a0;min before treatment. Sugar-free fluid was allowed until 1&#x000a0;h before treatment, no further fluids were allowed until 2.5&#x000a0;h after dosing. We used a double blind procedure throughout the experiment.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Safety</title><p>
Supine and standing vital signs were evaluated before (in triplicate) and 60 and 150&#x000a0;min after the treatments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Breath alcohol concentration</title><p>This was determined by using a breath analyzer (AlcoQuant 6,020, Envitec, Germany) before and 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150&#x000a0;min after the treatments. The alcohol dose used aimed for a mean breath alcohol concentration of 0.05&#x000a0;% similar to that of Ferreira et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>To check for differences between the four treatment groups mixed models were applied to consider the special data structure of the cross-over design. A restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method was used. The primary variables were the symptoms headache, weakness, salivation and motor coordination, as they yielded statistically significant differences in Ferreira&#x02019;s study. To adjust for multiple comparisons a Bonferroni correction was applied for the four primary variables resulting in a local significance level of 0.05/4&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0125 for each single primary variable.</p><p>In a first step the data of all four treatment groups were used. As the descriptive plots partially revealed considerable differences between the alcohol groups and the non-alcohol group, a further analysis was performed using only the three treatment groups that included alcohol.</p><p>In each of the models, the 20&#x000a0;min pre-treatment values of the respective treatment day were included as baseline values. The following measurements at 30, 90 and 120&#x000a0;min post-treatment were treated as autoregressive. We assumed, that due to the long wash-out period between the treatments no carry-over effect could occur, but in order to account for possible habituation effects the number of the visit was included in the model. Therefore, the fixed effects included in the model were baseline, treatment, number of the visit, time of measurement, and the interaction between treatment and time of measurement. A random influence of each patient was included in the model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Breath alcohol concentration</title><p>Mean breath alcohol concentrations at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150&#x000a0;min after the treatments were 0.059, 0.059, 0.053, 0.047, 0.041 and 0.035&#x000a0;%,respectively; there was no difference within the alcohol groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Primary variables</title><p>The statistical significance of the regression coefficients of the mixed models for all four primary variables is presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>

First, the parameters Salivation and Headache showed no differences between the alcohol-containing treatment conditions and the placebo condition despite our larger population sample. With regards to the two other primary parameters perception of Weakness and Impairment of Motor Coordination, our data confirmed a significant effect of alcohol&#x02014;that also remained robust following correction for multiple comparisons. However, when the subset of alcohol-containing treatment conditions were analysed in a three-group model&#x02014;that excluded the overriding effects of alcohol&#x02014;we were not able to detect a masking effect of the combination of energy drink or caffeine and alcohol compared to the alcohol-only treatment condition, even without correcting for multiple comparisons.</p><p>The use of VAS as a method to evaluate subjective feelings has a long tradition as &#x0201c;comparisons can be achieved with greater sensitivity than with semantic phrases or numeric rating scales&#x0201d; (Aitken <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1969</xref>). Starting with the measurement of feelings and moods (Bond and Lader <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1972</xref>; Aitken <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1969</xref>; Folstein and Luria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1973</xref>), VAS were also used for rating physiological signs of emotions and adapted increasingly for clinical use (Greenwood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1975</xref>). For their study, Ferreira had added five scales to the original 13 items of the Bond and Lader VAS without prior validation as a measure of intoxication (Ferreira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>; Bond and Lader <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1972</xref>). This somatic symptom scale, which was also applied in the current study, may therefore not adequately assess the &#x02018;mental&#x02019; experience of intoxication&#x02014;but was chosen to partially replicate the Ferreira study (Ferreira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>). In a recent review of the literature (Hjermstad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2011</xref>), VAS scales were compared to other methods of rating and confirmed as valid and the most frequently used option. The conditions of its use rather than the type of scale determined the quality of VAS-based methods (Hjermstad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2011</xref>). Accordingly, the current study used well-established anchor descriptors (analogous to Ferreira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>) and a written instruction that was orally checked for comprehension.</p><p>When the statistical analysis of the data obtained by the VAS did not include corrections for multiple comparisons, 13 out of the investigated 18 parameters in the present study differed significantly between alcohol and non-alcohol containing drinks. Ferreira had detected effects of alcohol in fewer parameters, failing to detect differences in parameters such as Tremor, Perspiration, Tachycardia, Breathing difficulty, Agitation and Alteration in hearing. In contrast, Ferreira found significant differences in Headache and Salivation, whereas our data did not demonstrate differences between the alcohol and the non-alcohol group in these parameters. When corrected for multiple comparisons&#x02014;as is imperative in this methodology&#x02014;five of our parameters still remained significant with regards to alcohol effects. Unfortunately, this comparison cannot be performed with Ferreira&#x02019;s paper, as this information is not given in his data. However, the overall broad overlap of results in response to alcohol between our study and that of Ferreira again supports the validity of the VAS as an assessment tool, and confirms the sensitivity of this tool in our population sample.</p><p>In the Ferreira analysis, the differences in perception of salivation, headache, weakness and impairment of motor coordination were statistically significant between the non-alcohol and the alcohol-only group, but were not significantly different between the non-alcohol and the alcohol combined with energy drink group. As there were no significant effects detected in objective measures of visual reaction time or motor coordination, the authors interpreted these findings as a &#x0201c;masking effect&#x0201d;.</p><p>The differentiation between primary and secondary outcome parameters in our study was based on the assumption that the four parameters that described so-called &#x0201c;masking effects&#x0201d; in the Ferreira paper were a suitable subset for primary outcome parameters. As these primary outcome parameters failed to confirm a &#x0201c;masking effect&#x0201d; of combined ingestion of energy drink or caffeine with alcohol, and as this differentiation in primary and secondary outcome parameters was somewhat arbitrary, we also performed a statistical analysis of the other 14 symptoms measured by the VAS.</p><p>For half of these parameters, the two studies were in agreement: regarding tension and nausea neither Ferreira et al. nor we could find any significant differences (even without correction for multiple testing). Ferreira et al. showed a significant difference in the parameters Tiredness, Dizziness*, Alterations in Sight*, Alterations in Walking*, Alterations in Speech* between alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. We also found a similar difference between alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks for these parameters, in four out of the five, even after correction for multiple testing (only Tiredness lost significance after correction for multiple testing).</p><p>For the other seven parameters, the two studies were not in agreement: regarding the parameters Tremor, Perspiration, Tachycardia, Breathing Difficulty, Agitation*, and Alterations in Hearing Ferreira et al. could not find a significant difference between all groups. In contrast, in our study we found a significant difference between the alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, which, however, was lost after correction for multiple testing for all parameters except Agitation.</p><p>As also demonstrated in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, the agreement of any given parameter between the two studies strongly depended on the results of the correction for multiple testing. These data underline the importance of this statistical correction to reduce the risk of false positive findings. Out of the seven parameters (two primary and five secondary) that remained statistically significant after correction for multiplicity, six had also been described by Ferreira, resulting in an agreement of 86&#x000a0;%! In contrast, out of the six parameters that lost their statistical significance by correction for multiple testing, only one had also been described by Ferreira, resulting in an agreement of only 17&#x000a0;%! In other words, correction of multiplicity increased the likelihood for agreement between the two studies fivefold. None of these parameters demonstrated a &#x0201c;masking effect&#x0201d; of combined ingestion of energy drink or caffeine with alcohol. This lack of a &#x0201c;masking effect&#x0201d; was particularly well presented in the graphical display of the original data (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) that showed a clear separation between the alcohol and the non-alcohol containing drinks with no discernible effect of the addition of energy drink or caffeine across a range of subjective parameters.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>
