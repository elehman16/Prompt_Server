MAC may be used for superficial surgical or diagnostic procedures with the primary aim of providing good analgesia and sedation without respiratory depression. It ensures a rapid recovery without any side effects.</p><p>The most commonly used medications for MAC are midazolam, propofol, and fentanyl.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] But sometimes, the simultaneous administration of sedatives-hypnotics with analgesics can cause significant respiratory depression and/or transient upper airway obstruction. Rapid progression from a &#x0201c;light&#x0201d; level of sedation to &#x0201c;deep&#x0201d; sedation (or unconsciousness) may predispose the patient for airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, and even aspiration, thus requiring vigilant monitoring during MAC.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>In contrast, dexmedetomidine is a centrally acting &#x003b1;-2 receptor agonist with both sedative and analgesic properties and devoid of respiratory depressant effect.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Because of its analgesic properties, and lack of respiratory depression, dexmedetomidine is increasingly being used as a sedative-analgesic for MAC. These properties along with its relatively short elimination half-life of 2 h make dexmedetomidine an attractive agent for sedation during MAC.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] This prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical study was undertaken for comparative evaluation of dexmedetomidine-ketamine (Group &#x0201c;KD&#x0201d;) combination with that of midazolam-ketamine in patients undergoing minor superficial surgical procedures under local anesthesia infiltration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After institutional ethical committee approval, 50 American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) I&#x02013;II patients were enrolled in this prospective randomized, double-blind clinical trial. Patients included in the study were between 20 and 50 years of age and were planned for elective minor superficial surgical procedures under local anesthesia. Patients with cardio-respiratory diseases, renal diseases, liver diseases, chronic users of sedatives and narcotics, alcoholic or drug abusers, or those allergic to any of the medications used in the study were excluded. Patients were randomized to receive either Group &#x0201c;KD&#x0201d; or midazolam-ketamine (Group &#x0201c;KM&#x0201d;) for sedation and analgesia during surgery by sealed envelope technique. Both patient and the anesthesiologist were blinded to the patient's group assignment.</p><p>After informed consent, patients were taken in the operating room and an intravenous (I.V) access was secured. All noninvasive monitoring devices (noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiograph leads and pulse oxymeter) were attached, and the baseline cardiorespiratory parameters were recorded every 5 min following the administration of the drugs till the end of surgery. All the patients were premedicated with 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate I.V., injection ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg. Lignocaine sensitivity was performed by the anesthesiologist. Group &#x0201c;KD&#x0201d; patients (<italic>n</italic> = 25) received dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in 10 ml normal saline intravenously over 2 min followed by 0.5 mg/kg I.V. ketamine while Group &#x0201c;KM&#x0201d; patients (<italic>n</italic> = 25) received I.V. midazolam 0.05 mg/kg in 10 ml normal saline over 2 min followed by 0.5 mg/kg of I.V. ketamine to get a targeted level of sedation (&#x02264;4 using Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale score-Reference 1). During the completion of loading dose of the study drug, the blinded surgeon infiltrated local anesthesia using 5 ml of 2% lidocaine with adrenaline. Any adverse events such as hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure [MABP] &#x0003c;60 mmHg) was treated with fluid administration (0.9% normal saline) and bradycardia (heart rate [HR] &#x0003c;55/min) was treated with an increment of 0.3 mg atropine I.V. and O<sub>2</sub>-desaturation (SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c; 95%) with 100% O<sub>2</sub>. Inadequate sedoanalgesia (e.g., 15% increase in MABP and HR, increase in respiratory rate, physical movement, Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale score &#x0003e;4) was treated by a ketamine bolus of 0.5 mg/kg as a rescue sedoanalgesic.</p><p>Reference 1:</p><p>Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale score</p><p>5: Responds readily to name spoken in normal tone</p><p>4: Lethargic response to name spoken in normal tone</p><p>3: Response only after name is called loudly and/or repeatedly</p><p>2: Response only after mild prodding or shaking</p><p>1: Response only after painful trapezius squeeze</p><p>0: No response after painful trapezius squeeze</p><p>The following data were recorded for evaluation:</p><p>

It has become a popular technique during day care surgery. Compared to general anesthesia and regional block, MAC-based techniques can facilitate a faster recovery during day care surgery. MAC achieves the goal of providing analgesia, sedation, anxiolysis with minimal residual sedation to achieve the goal of early discharge during ambulatory surgery. Sedative-hypnotic drugs administered during MAC make procedures more tolerable for patients by reducing anxiety and providing a degree of intraoperative amnesia while allowing them to rest (or sleep) during the operation.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Patients often become restless, bored or uncomfortable when forced to remain immobile for prolonged periods of time under local anesthesia. Sedatives and hypnotics in conjunction with analgesics are required to make patient calm during surgery, but they are associated with significant respiratory depression and/or transient upper airway obstruction.</p><p>Many drugs have been evaluated for their efficacy during MAC. Low dose ketamine (0.25&#x02013;0.5 mg/kg) combined with either midazolam or propofol has also been administered to outpatients undergoing cosmetic surgical procedures with local anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Ketamine produces lesser respiratory depression than the opioid compounds and better intraoperative analgesia than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It is the only anesthetic drug available with analgesic, hypnotic, and amnesic effects, but its main disadvantage is its cardiostimulant effect even in therapeutic doses, leading to an increase in mean arterial pressure, HR and cardiac output as observed by Knox <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Gupta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous midazolam and dexmedetomidine when given along with ketamine on hemodynamic response, duration of analgesia, and to assess the patient and surgeon satisfaction at the end of the surgery.</p><p>It is a well-known fact that a benzodiazepine (midazolam) abolishes the post anesthetic psychotomimetic effects of ketamine by closing the N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors, while an &#x003b1;2 adrenoceptor agonist (dexmedetomidine) induces central sympatholysis by activating presynaptic autoreceptors. Thus, dexmedetomidine induces sedation via central nervous system receptors which differ from those induced by the benzodiazepines drugs.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Ketamine usually do not cause respiratory depression when given in an appropriate doses.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Similar result was found in our study as none of the patient showed clinically significant respiratory depression. Intraoperatively, none of our patients had shown fall in oxygen saturation. No patient required a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal airway to maintain the patency of airway.</p><p>In the present study, at doses that induced comparable and clinically adequate sedation in our healthy patients, premedication with dexmedetomidine was statistically equivalent to midazolam for the attenuation of ketamine-induced intraoperative hypertension, tachycardia, and postoperative hallucinations. Thus, the sedative effects of dexmedetomidine and midazolam appear to be quantitatively similar.</p><p>Various studies have shown that dexmedetomidine has a propensity to cause bradycardia.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, in our study no patient suffered an episode of bradycardia, though there was a decrease in HR at 5 min in the KD group (statistically significant). This absence of bradycardia was probably because of the sympathetic stimulation produced by ketamine which probably counteracted the bradycardia causing characteristics of dexmedetomidine.</p><p>The main drawback of using ketamine is usually the sympathetic stimulation and postoperative hallucinations. Numerous drugs have been tried to attenuate these undesirable responses. Small doses of either midazolam and propofol can be administered to attenuate the adverse psychotomimetic reactions produced by ketamine.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Dexmedetomidine (1 &#x003bc;g/kg I.V.) significantly decreases anxiety levels and reduces the requirement for supplemental analgesic medications when given before intravenous regional anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic agonists, such as clonidine and dexmedetomidine, induce preoperative sedation, reduce anesthetic requirements, and improve intraoperative hemodynamic stability with postoperative analgesia, thus making them suitable adjuncts to ketamine anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] We found the same result in our study that, there was no difference between dexmedetomidine and midazolam in terms of hemodynamic stability when given along with ketamine.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is an a<sub>2</sub> agonist similar to clonidine, with analgesic and sedative properties. We found that the duration of analgesia by the loading dose of dexmedetomidine and ketamine was significantly longer as compared to the duration of analgesia by midazolam and ketamine combination [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. Similar to the result found by Koruk <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] we also observed that fewer patients required supplemental analgesia in KD group as compared to KM group (7/10). Though the supplemental dose of ketamine was lower in the KD group (29.86 &#x000b1; 3.29 mg) than in the KM group (32.20 &#x000b1; 10.20 mg), the difference between the doses was statistically nonsignificant [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>]. Because supplementation was given whenever the sedation score was &#x0003e;4, lesser supplementation in KD group suggest better sedation in that group as compared to KM group.</p><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Mean total extra dose of ketamine requirement in the operative period in the two groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-9-167-g006"/></table-wrap><p>Hence, we found that there was a synergistic effect between dexmedetomidine and ketamine in terms of analgesia and thus the duration of analgesia was longer in the KD group, with an added advantage of sedation. Furthermore, less no. of patients required lesser (though non-significant) supplemental doses of ketamine in the KD group.</p><p>Patients in KD group expressed significantly greater satisfaction than the KM group. Though Alhashemi[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and Zeyneloglu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] found the time for recovery and discharge from post-anesthesia care unit longer with dexmedetomidine as compared to propofol and midazolam/fentanyl respectively, all the patients in our study were ready for discharge after 2 h from the postoperative period.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine&#x02013;treated patients were significantly more satisfied with their anesthesia experience than patients in the midazolam group. Patient in KD group felt less pain and were feeling better overall in the postoperative period, as assessed by our questionnaire. In the KM group, the main complaint was the perception of pain during the operative period and in the postoperative room.</p><p>Similarly, the surgeon satisfaction score was greater in KD group than in the KM group. They observed the lesser incidence of patient movement and a greater degree of patient sedation in KD group.</p><p>Overall, patients&#x02019; and surgeons&#x02019; satisfaction difference was statistically significant between the two groups.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Limitations</title><p>The main limitation of our study was the assessment of patient and surgeon satisfaction, which is totally subjective and depends on individual susceptibility to pain perception.</p><p>We also tabulated and evaluated the hemodynamic parameters for the first 20 min of surgery primarily because most of the surgeries lasted for around 20 min. We also restricted our study to the intraoperative period and did not compared the drugs in the postoperative period probably because we took the targeted sedation score of &#x02264;4 and avoided deep sedation with a score of &#x02264;3, hence all our patients had a score of &#x0003e;4 at the end of surgery.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Dexmedetomidine provides a superior analgesic effect in combination with ketamine, provides a better operating conditions for the surgeon, and a better patient satisfaction as compared to the midazolam and ketamine combination. At comparable sedation scores, dexmedetomidine is a better option as compared to midazolam for procedures requiring MAC.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bailey</surname><given-names>PL</given-names></name><name><surname>Pace</surname><given-names>NL</given-names></name><name><surname>Ashburn</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Moll</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name><name><surname>East</surname><given-names>KA</given-names></name><name><surname>Stanley</surname><given-names>TH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Frequent hypoxemia and apnea after sedation with midazolam and fentanyl</article-title><source>Anesthesiology</source><year>1990</year><volume>73</volume><fpage>826</fpage><lpage>30</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2122773</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Sedation and Analgesia by Non-Anesthesiologists.
