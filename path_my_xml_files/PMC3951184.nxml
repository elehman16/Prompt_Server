The prospective clinical trial design included pre- and post-intervention neuroimaging of women randomized to continue (HT+) or discontinue (HT&#x02212;) therapy following an average of 10 years of use. The primary outcome measure was change in brain metabolism during the subsequent two years, as assessed with fluorodeoxyglucose-18 positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Longitudinal FDG-PET data were available for 45 study completers. Results showed that women randomized to continue HT experienced relative preservation of frontal and parietal cortical metabolism, compared with women randomized to discontinue HT. Women who discontinued 17-&#x003b2; estradiol (17&#x003b2;E)-based HT, as well as women who continued conjugated equine estrogen (CEE)-based HT, exhibited significant decline in metabolism of the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortical (PCC) area. Significant decline in PCC metabolism was additionally seen in women taking concurrent progestins (with either 17&#x003b2;E or CEE). Together, these findings suggest that among postmenopausal subjects at risk for developing dementia, regional cerebral cortical metabolism is relatively preserved for at least two years in women randomized to continue HT, compared with women randomized to discontinue HT. In addition, continuing unopposed 17&#x003b2;E therapy is associated specifically with preservation of metabolism in PCC, known to undergo the most significant decline in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>

Though controversial, studies on estrogen hormone therapy (HT) use in middle-aged and older postmenopausal women have suggested possible protection against aging-related cognitive decline, with the majority of previous studies reporting stabilization of cognitive and brain tissue integrity with HT <xref rid="pone.0089095-Frick1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089095-Henderson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Notably, beneficial and detrimental findings in the literature to date suggest differential effects of HT by the respective type of estrogen formulation and the timing of initiation relative to the onset of menopause <xref rid="pone.0089095-Gleason1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Many of the studies on HT that have found beneficial effects have included 17-&#x003b2; estradiol (17-&#x003b2;E)-based HT formulations <xref rid="pone.0089095-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0089095-Robertson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, while the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), which recruited women 65 and older, found an increased risk of dementia with conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) compared to placebo <xref rid="pone.0089095-Shumaker1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089095-Shumaker2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Consequently, the WHIMS findings have resulted in the broad interpretation that HT fails to protect against dementia in postmenopausal women <xref rid="pone.0089095-Shumaker1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, though this conclusion conflicts with the majority of data showing beneficial effects of estrogen HT in the aging female brain <xref rid="pone.0089095-Harman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The type of estrogen HT used by women has been proposed as a potential explanation for the discrepancy in the cumulative literature, as CEE and 17-&#x003b2;E-based preparations significantly differ in their biological action, especially in the brain <xref rid="pone.0089095-Frick1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089095-Henderson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Further, there may also be a &#x0201c;window of opportunity&#x0201d; for beneficial effects of HT, as the observational studies based on typical prescription patterns (usually initiated during menopausal transition for treatment of vasomotor symptoms) of estrogen HT suggest a decreased risk for dementia with initiation of treatment on or around the time of menopause <xref rid="pone.0089095-Frick1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089095-Henderson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Functional neuroimaging data on the effects of estrogen HT in brain aging and risk for dementia in postmenopausal women are limited. Several lines of evidence suggest that the neuropathological decline in brain function leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins many years before patients develop the full AD clinical syndrome, i.e., disease severe enough to warrant the diagnosis of probable AD (NINCDS-ADRDA diagnostic criteria) <xref rid="pone.0089095-McKhann1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Consistent with a prolonged preclinical disease stage, a number of investigations, including studies from our group, have shown that positron emission tomography (PET) measures of cerebral glucose metabolism vary according to AD genetic risk (apolipoprotein E &#x003b5;-4 [ApoE-&#x003b5;4]) and predict cerebral metabolic and cognitive decline in people with mild cognitive complaints (age-associated memory impairment) <xref rid="pone.0089095-Small1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0089095-Silverman1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In particular, hypometabolic brain changes in the posterior cingulate, parietal, temporal and eventually prefrontal regions are found with FDG-PET and are associated with cognitive decline and AD.</p><p>Other biomarkers of brain function, i.e. structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological assessments, are also of predictive value for middle-aged and older women at risk for dementia <xref rid="pone.0089095-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0089095-Lehtovirta2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, although studies have varied in the type of HT formulation and their control for pre-study disease state. The present longitudinal findings follow previously reported baseline (cross-sectional) results from this study, in which we reported regional differences in cerebral metabolism in accordance with the type of estrogen component of HT <xref rid="pone.0089095-Silverman2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> that subjects had been taking at the time of enrollment. The current report summarizes our longitudinal PET findings from a study of postmenopausal women (on 17&#x003b2;E-based or CEE-based HT) who were randomized to continuation or discontinuation of their HT for a two-year observational period. This study utilized functional (<xref rid="pone.0089095-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) and structural (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) brain imaging, along with assessment of cognitive performance to identify biomarkers of preclinical change and propose predictors of cognitive decline. Study inclusion criteria called for postmenopausal women, ages 50&#x02013;65 years, at risk for dementia, and who had been receiving prescribed HT for at least one year. The main purpose of the overall study was to determine whether HT of any preparation is protective of regional cerebral metabolism and cognitive performance of postmenopausal women with at least one risk factor for AD. Risk factors included having a first-degree relative with AD, known carriership of apolipoprotein E (ApoE-&#x003b5;4) allele, or personal history of major depression. Brain regions considered appropriate for examination <italic>a priori</italic>, based upon well-established metabolic involvement in the earliest stages of prodromal Alzheimer's disease were the bilateral precuneus/posterior cingulate areas, parietotemporal cortex in the vicinity of the angular and marginal gyri, medial prefrontal cortex given its aging-related metabolic decline, and as described in our baseline analysis, attention was further directed to the medial temporal including the hippocampal area, inferior lateral temporal, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, for their roles in cognitive processes vulnerable to early decline in aging individuals <xref rid="pone.0089095-Silverman2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.

A flowchart of study subjects is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089095-g001">Figure 1</xref>. A target sample size of 50 subjects (25 randomized to continue HT and 25 randomized to discontinue HT) completing all procedures at 2-year follow-up was established based on large effect sizes (d&#x0223c;.9) observed in preliminary data by the senior author <xref rid="pone.0089095-Rasgon1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. An estimated 70% subject retention rate was initially anticipated, therefore a target of 71 (approximately 35 per randomization group) was established for randomization. However, the observed study retention rate was found to be approximately 80%, and randomization was ended at a target N of 64, 32 subjects per randomization group. At time of enrollment, all subjects met the 2001 Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) criteria for menopause and were taking continuous (not cyclic) HT. Women in the current analyses included 18 women using 0.625 mg CEE (9 monotherapy, 9 concurrent with progestin) and 36 women using 0.1 mg 17&#x003b2;E (12 monotherapy, 24 concurrent with progestin). All taking concurrent progestin were using Provera, with the exception of 2 subjects taking Prometrium (1 from each HT randomization group). Eligibility screening for the study included willingness to sign consent for all study procedures and undergo randomization to continue or discontinue current HT, psychiatric, physical, and neurological examination, and laboratory blood measures. After screening in, subjects underwent baseline positron emission tomography (PET) and formal neuropsychological testing (complete results to be reported elsewhere), followed by randomization to continue or discontinue HT for a period of two years. For those subjects randomized to stay on HT, the investigators implemented no changes to current HT regimen. During the two-year follow-up period, subjects underwent interim assessments every three months to closely monitor cognition, mood, and serum estradiol levels. If a subject's mood was determined to have declined at interim visits, a referral was made to treating physician for medication management in order to assure mood stabilization and prevent negative effects on brain metabolism and cognition. At the end of two years, subjects repeated all baseline assessments, including PET and neuropsychological testing. Self-reported information from subjects was confirmed by documentation from primary health care providers whenever possible. Duration of endogenous exposure was calculated by subtracting age at menarche from age at menopause. Serum estradiol allowed for monitoring of adherence to randomization.</p><fig id="pone-0089095-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0089095.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Study Subject Flow.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0089095.g001"/></fig><p>Inclusion criteria were: 50&#x02013;65 years of age at time of recruitment, &#x02265;1 year post-complete cessation of menses, &#x02265;1 year current HT use, &#x02265;8 years of education.

Our results suggest that CEE does not confer the same benefits as 17&#x003b2;-E either in terms of metabolism or cognition. In fact, we previously reported that at baseline women taking 17&#x003b2;-E performed 3 standard deviations higher in verbal memory than women taking CEE, and their verbal memory performance positively correlated with metabolism in Wernicke's area <xref rid="pone.0089095-Silverman2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089095-Wroolie1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>.</p><p>The present findings provide evidence that the use of 17&#x003b2;-E in postmenopause could be protective against some of the effects of &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; aging, given the difference in anterior medial prefrontal cortex metabolism observed between women continuing and discontinuing 17&#x003b2;-E. This part of the brain is known to exhibit decreased metabolism as a part of the natural aging process, independent of any neurodegenerative disease <xref rid="pone.0089095-Pardo1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Thus, the increased activity in this region shown by women continuing use of 17&#x003b2;-E is an encouraging result in terms of preserving executive functioning into older age. Both of these metabolic findings confirm the results from our preliminary analyses performed when half of the subjects had completed the protocol <xref rid="pone.0089095-Rasgon3" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. The fact that these findings remained consistent is a testament to their strength and reliability.</p><p>Further supporting the observed differences in cerebral metabolism relative to type of estrogen formulation were the effects of progesterone (or lack thereof). For women continuing to use CEE unopposed by progesterone, the largest decrease in metabolism was found in the posterior lateral temporal cortex, extending into the precuneus and middle frontal gyrus. These metabolic declines are consistent with changes in brain areas associated with early stage AD <xref rid="pone.0089095-Genon1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>.</p><p>Preserved metabolism for the posterior cingulate in only those women who continued use of unopposed 17&#x003b2;-E suggests that HT with 17&#x003b2;-E alone may be a viable means to slow the onset of AD symptoms. These findings lead to the conclusion that the strongest neuroprotection of the precuneus/posterior cingulate area is afforded by unopposed 17&#x003b2;-E, and that including progesterone in HT mitigates the benefits conferred by estrogen treatment. To our knowledge, no studies have previously described effects of opposed versus unopposed HT on cerebral metabolism, amplifying the importance of replicating our results for their potentially significant health care implications. The importance of the role of 17&#x003b2;-E in protection of the precuneus/posterior cingulate area is further illustrated by preservation of cognitive abilities in the current study (data not shown) and previous studies that document the significance of the posterior cingulate metabolism as an early marker of cognitive changes consistent with Alzheimer-related dementia <xref rid="pone.0089095-Silverman5" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089095-Minoshima1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089095-Kantarci1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0089095-Kordower1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>.</p><p>A number of specific characteristics of this sample deserve mention in order to reasonably summarize the results. There were several considerations that led us to enroll subjects of the 50&#x02013;65 years age cohort. First, we anticipated that many women 50 years and older would have subjective memory complaints, therefore their risk for developing cognitive decline during the course of the study was increased. Second, changes in regional metabolic patterns precede the actual cognitive decline by many years, even decades <xref rid="pone.0089095-Silverman5" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, so it was important to choose an age group where such changes in the brain may be corroborated by changes in cognitive performance. Another reason for choosing this particular age range is the fact that span of 50 to 65 years of age covers a critical time for cognitive changes before they become assessable by neuropsychological tests. Timing of HT initiation is another important moderator of its effects in the organism. In our study, all but two women had initiated HT at the time of perimenopause or within one year of menopause onset, whereas women in the WHI study initiated HT after age 65 years, years after the onset of menopause. The characteristics of our sample are consistent with the age and timing of HT initiation that is proposed by the window of opportunity theory. Interestingly, our previous findings are consistent with the WHI findings among women receiving CEE with or without progesterone (medroxyprogesterone acetate), wherein women receiving CEE with concurrent progesterone showed declines in delayed verbal memory scores <xref rid="pone.0089095-Coker1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>.</p><p>Prolonged hypoestrogenism (on average 12 years) prior to starting HT in the WHI study may have been the main reason for the negative effects of CEE on indices of brain function. In fact, post-hoc analyses from the WHI study indicate that those women who initiated HT at or around the time of menopause did, in fact, have reduced risk for AD and all-cause dementia <xref rid="pone.0089095-Henderson2" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. However, the addition of a progesterone component seems to invariably be associated with worse brain function independent of the time at initiation of HT or type of estrogen formulation.</p><p>In AD, neurological decline begins in certain brain regions, like the posterior cingulate and lateral temporal, before noticeable symptoms manifest. These regions also tend to show the most metabolic decline in women at risk for dementia, even while they remain outwardly healthy. Deficits of attention and executive function are also seen in persons with mild cognitive impairment as well as with early AD. Therefore, it is essential to determine in further longitudinal studies whether HT-related preservation of metabolism in the critical brain regions can, in fact, postpone this decline, and if so, which type of HT and which populations of women may benefit from using HT.</p><p>There are some notable limitations to our study. These results cannot be generalized to healthy postmenopausal women without risk factors for dementia. At the same time, they may be relevant in a number of situations, as some of these risks factors are present in the general population and may be overlooked by researchers in other neuroimaging studies. In addition, the small sample size in our study did not allow for conclusions on cognitive function in the absence of regional metabolic changes. However, this study was aimed at pinpointing metabolic changes as a main outcome variable. Similarly, the small sample precluded assessment of potential interaction effects of genetic risk factors for dementia and use of HT. A separate randomized study of HT on women with and without risk factors for dementia would be able to clarify this issue.</p><p>&#x0201c;Healthy user bias&#x0201d; can be applied to our findings since the cohort of women were overall healthy, middle-aged and well educated, so that the observed changes in brain function were within normal ranges for the age category. At the same time it is also a strength of the present investigation that the study sample was unusually homogeneous in terms of demographics, in that all of the present study subjects were women, all were postmenopausal and well-documented with respect to pharmacologic records on hormonal (and other) treatment initiated around the time of menopause, and aged between 50 and 65 years old (e.g., near menopause).
