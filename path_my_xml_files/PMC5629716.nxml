The primary outcomes are (1) change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline and (2) polyp regression at week 52, assessed by indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). Fifty patients with treatment-naive PCV will be recruited from Portuguese and Spanish clinical sites. Eligible patients will receive monthly IVA for 3 months (week 0, week 4 and week 8). At week 16, all patients will repeat ICGA and undergo central randomisation (1:1 ratio) into one of the following groups: Group 1&#x02014;IVA T&#x00026;E + vPDT; Group 2&#x02014;IVA T&#x00026;E + sPDT. PDT will be performed at week 16, week 28 and week 40 in the presence of active polyps. After week 16, the presence of macular fluid on optical coherence tomography will determine the schedule of observations. When present, the interval between visits/injections will decrease 2&#x02009;weeks (minimum 6&#x02009;weeks). When not, the interval between visits/injections will increase 2&#x02009;weeks (maximum 12&#x02009;weeks). Efficacy will be evaluated based on BCVA, central retinal thickness and polyp regression. Safety parameters will include assessment of intraocular pressure, adverse events and serious adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study was designed and shall be implemented and reported in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with applicable local regulations and with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.

However, the use of anti-VEGF compounds in monotherapy in PCV has been associated with a lower rate of polyp closure, despite the good visual outcomes. In the EVEREST study,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> a 6-month multicentre, randomised clinical trial (RCT) conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of verteporfin photodynamic therapy (vPDT) with or without 0.5&#x02009;mg ranibizumab versus ranibizumab 0.5&#x02009;mg monotherapy in Asian patients with symptomatic PCV, the authors reported a significantly lower rate of complete polyp regression in the ranibizumab monotherapy group (28.6%) than in the PDT-containing treatment arms (77.8% in the PDT plus ranibizumab arm and 71.4% in the PDT monotherapy arm). All treatment arms showed an improvement of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline, with patients in the combination group achieving the highest gain (+10.9 letters from baseline). The proportion of patients gaining&#x000a0;&#x02265;15 letters was 21% in the vPDT + ranibizumab group, 19% in the vPDT group and 33.3% in the ranibizumab monotherapy group. However, BCVA differences between groups were not statistically significant. Another study in an Asian population, the LAPTOP study,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> randomised patients with PCV to either ranibizumab monotherapy or PDT monotherapy. A higher proportion of patients in the ranibizumab arm gained 0.2 logMAR than those in the PDT arm, both at 12 and 24 months. Nevertheless, the polyp regression rate was not evaluated. In 2013, a group of experts published a set of guidelines for the management of PCV<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and recommended a combination of indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) guided PDT with Verteporfin and 3 monthly injections of ranibizumab 0.5&#x02009;mg as the initial treatment of active juxtafoveal and subfoveal PCV. A systematic review and meta-analysis published by Wang <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> concluded that even though combined treatment (PDT + ranibizumab 0.5&#x02009;mg) appeared to result in better visual acuity and lower retinal haemorrhage, it did not affect the resolution and recurrence of lesions.</p><p>Given the introduction of aflibercept in clinical practice and its promising results in typical exudative AMD,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> clarifying its anatomical and functional outcomes in the treatment of PCV, either alone or in combination with PDT, is an unmet medical need. Previously known as VEGF trap-eye,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> aflibercept (Eylea, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, New&#x000a0;York, USA) is a chimeric molecule composed of an Fc fragment linked to the extracellular portions of the VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 receptors. It binds to all isoforms of VEGF, thus preventing activation of VEGF receptors.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The approved treatment regimen for wet AMD is one injection per month for three consecutive months, followed by one injection every 2&#x02009;months (2&#x02009;mg every 8 weeks&#x02014;2Q8). Kikushima <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> retrospectively evaluated the results of aflibercept monotherapy versus a combined regimen of aflibercept and PDT in an Asian population with PCV. The authors reported that the combined treatment might be superior to aflibercept monotherapy in terms of disease-stabilising efficacy, but with an equivalent visual gain at 12 months.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, to the best of our knowledge, no RCT has been conducted in Caucasians to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aflibercept in PCV, either alone or in combination with PDT. Considering that several genetic variants associated with PCV do not seem to translate across ethnic lines,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 14&#x02013;16</xref> it is important as a proof of concept to evaluate if a combination regimen is superior to anti-VEGF monotherapy in the specific setting of a Caucasian population. There is also some controversy regarding the real need of closuring all the polyps when treating PCV. In fact, based on the visual acuity results of the EVEREST study,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> many ophthalmologists are currently treating PCV with anti-VEGF monotherapy. A treat and extend (T&#x00026;E) regimen using aflibercept with or without PDT may answer these questions, eventually leading to a paradigm shift in the current management of PCV. The importance of this study lies in the possibility of providing responses to the following questions: (1) is aflibercept safe when used in combination with PDT? (2) can combination therapy of aflibercept plus PDT improve the anatomical and functional results in PCV when compared with aflibercept monotherapy? (3) is the currently approved aflibercept treatment regimen for typical exudative AMD effective in PCV? (4) what is the best injection interval for aflibercept in PCV eyes?</p><p>The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of intravitreal aflibercept&#x000a0;(IVA) with sham PDT&#x000a0;(sPDT) versus IVA with vPDT in a Caucasian population with treatment-naive PCV, undergoing a T&#x00026;E regimen.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study type and study design&#x000a0;</title><p>Randomised, double-masked, sham-controlled, multicentre phase 4 investigator-driven clinical trial registered under the EudraCT number: 2015-001368-20 and the ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02495181 (see&#x000a0;online&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-015785.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1</label><p>
