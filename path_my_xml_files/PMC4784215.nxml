Concern about the possibility of cervical spinal cord injury when extending the head and flexing the neck for direct laryngoscopy and intubation leads many anesthesiologists to prefer awake fiberoptic intubation (AFOI) in patients with CSI.</p><p>Awake fiberoptic intubation is either performed in a completely awake patient without sedation after anesthetizing the airway or under conscious sedation. There are advantages and disadvantages of both approaches. Awake intubation can provoke anxiety and can lead to discomfort to the patient. With the conscious sedation, the sedation needs to be carefully titrated as it can lead to hypoventilation, whereas inadequate sedation leads to discomfort, anxiety and excessive sympathetic discharge. Various pharmacological methods have been reported to achieve conscious sedation for AFOI including fentanyl, midazolam (MDZ), ketamine, propofol, remifentanil, and dexmedetomidine (DEX).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective and specific alpha 2 adrenoreceptor agonist and has properties making it suitable for AFOI. In addition to hemodynamic stability, anxiolytic and analgesic properties, it results in sedation while maintaining easy arousability. DEX demonstrates minimal respiratory depression[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] even at higher doses and also decreases salivary secretions, which is desirable during AFOI.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DEX 1 &#x003bc;g/kg over 10 min followed by 0.7 &#x003bc;g/kg/h infusion in providing optimum conditions for AFOI in simulated CSI patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>After obtaining Institutional Research and Ethics Committee Approval, written informed consent for this double-blind trial was obtained from 100 healthy patients between the age groups 18-65 years. Patients belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists Grade I or II, with Mallampati Grade I or II, scheduled for elective surgery requiring general anesthesia were included in the study conducted during the period from March 2012 to June 2013.</p><p>Using alpha 0.05 and beta 0.2, we calculated that at least 38 patients per group would be required to detect a significant difference in number of patients requiring rescue drug to achieve proper sedation (Ramsay sedation score [RSS] &#x02265;2) between the two groups. Hence, we recruited 50 patients in each group.</p><p>The criteria for exclusion were patients with a history of allergy to DEX, concomitant use of medications, which may exaggerate the heart rate (HR) response of DEX including digoxin or &#x003b2;-adrenergic antagonists, HR &#x0003c;50 beats/min, systolic blood pressure (SBP) &#x0003c;90 mm Hg, pregnancy, nursing women and morbid obesity. Patients on anticoagulants, nasal trauma, deformity or polyp, liver transaminase enzymes &#x02265;2 times upper normal limit and surgery &#x0003c;1 h duration were also excluded.</p><p>Patients were premedicated with 0.5 mg oral alprazolam and 150 mg ranitidine the night before surgery and were allocated into two groups on the basis of even and odd number distribution. DEX group, (Group D, <italic>n</italic> = 50): Received intravenous (IV) DEX (1 &#x003bc;g/kg) over 10 min followed by DEX infusion at the rate of 0.7 &#x003bc;g/kg/h. Placebo group, (Group P, <italic>n</italic> = 50) received IV normal saline bolus (1 ml/kg) over 10 min, followed by normal saline infusion at the rate of 0.7 ml/kg/h.</p><p>In the preoperative area, patient's HR, blood pressure (BP) (SBP, diastolic blood pressure [DBP], mean arterial pressure [MAP]), SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded, and 20G IV cannula was placed on the dorsum of a hand for drug and continuous fluid administration. Glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg was given intramuscularly 45 min before the surgery. Nasal patency was confirmed, and 2-3 drops of 0.1% xylometazoline were instilled in both the nostrils. Lignocaine up to a maximum dose of 5 mg/kg was used to topicalize the airway of each patient. Based on the total lignocaine dose calculated as per weight of the patient, all patients were nebulized with 4-5 ml of 4% lignocaine through ultrasonic nebulizer. On arrival in the operating room, the patient's baseline HR, BP and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded. Pledgets soaked in 2% lignocaine with adrenaline were placed in both the nostrils one by one for 10 min and 2-3 puffs of 10% lignocaine was sprayed on oropharynx and base of the tongue. Transtracheal block with 2-3 ml of 2% lignocaine, was given to the patient on the operating table, eliciting a cough without significant cervical motion. Then patient's neck was immobilized with semi rigid cervical collar (Philadelphia cervical collar, Tynore, India).</p><p>Infusion of DEX (1 &#x003bc;g/kg) over 10 min (loading dose) followed by a continuous infusion (maintenance dose) of DEX (0.7 &#x003bc;g/kg/h) in Group D and 0.9% Normal Saline (1 ml/kg) over 10 min (loading dose) followed by continuous infusion (maintenance dose) of normal saline (0.7 ml/kg/h) in Group P was administered IV as per group allocation of the patient. Infusion was prepared by an anesthesia resident not participating in the study. The anesthetist doing AFOI and the anesthesia resident noting the parameters were blinded to the drug given to the patient.</p><p>Ramsay sedation score, was assessed after the loading dose of DEX or normal saline and thereafter every 2 min from the beginning of the maintenance dose till the completion of the fiberoptic intubation procedure. Any patient having RSS &#x0003c;2 was given MDZ as the rescue drug, in the dose of 0.5 mg intravenously in repeated doses until RSS &#x02265;2 was attained, or a total maximum dose of 0.1 mg/kg was achieved, whichever was earlier. After confirming suppressed gag reflex and RSS &#x02265;2, fiberoptic bronchoscopy (using Karl Storz, 5 mm adult fiberoptic bronchoscope) was done by an anesthesiologist experienced in bronchoscopy. After visualization of carina, prewarmed loaded endotracheal tube (size 6.5 in females and 7.0 in males) was slid over the bronchoscope. Placement of endotracheal tube was confirmed by recording end tidal carbon dioxide and chest auscultation. If the patient remained inadequately sedated (RSS &#x0003c;2) after a total MDZ dose of 0.1 mg/kg, propofol was given in incremental doses of 5 mg intravenously until RSS &#x02265;2 is attained, or a total maximum dose of 1 mg/kg was achieved and fiberoptic intubation was completed in the same manner. Patients requiring propofol were excluded from the study. After the confirmation of intubation, the study drug was stopped, arousability of the patient was checked by asking them to move their hand and the cervical collar was removed. Subsequently, general anesthesia was administered as per routine protocol, and scheduled surgery was completed. All the patients were given oxygen through nasal cannula at the rate of 4 L/min throughout the AFOI procedure.</p><p>Vital signs were recorded at baseline and every 3 min from the start of study drug infusion until completion of AFOI. Baseline values of SBP, DBP, SpO<sub>2</sub>, HR, respiratory rate (RR) were used to define adverse events requiring study discontinuation and/or therapeutic intervention. Hypotension was defined as SBP &#x0003c;80 mmHg, DBP &#x0003c;50 mmHg, or SBP &#x0003c;30% below baseline. Hypertension was defined as SBP &#x0003e;180 mmHg, DBP &#x0003e;100 mmHg, or a SBP increase to &#x0003e;30% mmHg above baseline. Bradycardia was defined as HR &#x0003c;50 beats/min or a decrease to &#x0003c;30% below baseline. Tachycardia was defined as HR &#x0003e;120 beats/min or increase to &#x0003e;30% above baseline. Respiratory depression was defined as RR &#x0003c;8 breaths/min or a decrease to &#x0003c;25% below baseline. Hypoxia was defined as SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;90% or a decrease to &#x0003c;10% below baseline saturation.</p><p>Hypotension was treated with fluid infusion followed by mephenteramine if there was no response to fluid infusion. Bradycardia was treated with atropine. In case the patient did not tolerate the procedure the cervical collar was removed, study procedure was abandoned and anesthesia was induced as per routine protocol and scheduled surgery was completed. That particular patient was excluded from the study.</p><p>At the 24 h postoperative follow-up, the patient was assessed for satisfaction in terms of recall, anxiety and pain (pain assessed using 10 cm visual analog scale) during AFOI on a scale of 1-4 [1-excellent, 2-good, 3-reasonable, 4-poor].</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients requiring MDZ for rescue to achieve/maintain targeted sedation (RSS &#x02265;2) throughout the AFOI procedure in each group. Secondary endpoints were total dose of MDZ required, patient's satisfaction for the procedure (in terms of recall, anxiety, and pain), assessed 24 h postoperatively and arousability after intubation in each group. Any adverse events or complications during intraoperative period were mentioned separately. Sedation was assessed using RSS.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data were statistically analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 16.0) statistical software using unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test, and Wilcoxon-w test, as appropriate. <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Two patients from the placebo group were excluded as they required propofol for targeted sedation (RSS &#x02265;2).
