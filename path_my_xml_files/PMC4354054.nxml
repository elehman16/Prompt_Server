Both patients and investigators were blinded to study groups. Also, a group of patients who were taking atorvastatin before entering the study were selected as a third group to compare the effect of long term and pre operation taking of atorvastatin. All the participants were asked not to take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 48 h before and after the angiography. Furthermore, the subjects were asked not to use metformin by starting the angiography till 48 h after the procedures. Angiography was done using the standard technique. For all patients 30-40 cc, a nonionic, iso-osmolar (290 mOsm/kg), visipaque (iodixanole) 320 mg/dl was used in all interventions. Patients were hydrated with 1 ml/kg &#x000d7; h of isotonic saline solution 12 h before and after the contrast injection. All the participants were evaluated before and 48 h after the procedure. Patients in the intervention group received 80 mg oral atorvastatin (two 40 mg tablets, Darou Pakhsh Pharmaceutical Co., Tehran, Iran) 12 h before contrast injection. The placebo group was treated as the intervention group with placebo similar to the atorvastatin (produced in Faculty of Pharmacy, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences). Patients who were receiving atorvastatin before the study continued their treatment. Drug and placebo were coded before investigations and after the study they were decoded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Assessments</title><p>Demographic characteristics of the participants including age, sex, history of other diseases such as hypertension and ischemic heart disorders and also drug history of the subjects were recorded.

For the measurement of serum creatinine (Scr), blood samples were taken before and 48 h after the procedure. Also, fasting blood sugar (FBS) was measured before the study.

So the aim of the current study was to assess the effect of atorvastatin on prevention of CIN in patients undergoing coronary angiography.</p><p>Our result couldn&#x02019;t show any association between pre operation atorvastatin and also long term use of statins and prevention of CIN. The incidence of CIN in the current study was 1% in both pre operation and long term statins groups and 2% in the placebo group. In addition, our results showed that taking 80 mg atorvastatin (high dose) 12 h before the angiography was associated with a significant decrease in Scr level and also a significant increase in GFR after the procedure. But long term statin use and also placebo consumption did not show the mentioned effect. Different studies have reported different incidence of CIN. A study conducted by Jo <italic>et al</italic>. on patients with baseline renal insufficiency revealed that the incidence of CIN was 2.5% in patients treated by short term high dose of simvastatin and 3.4% in placebo group and the difference was not statistically significant. They have reported no relation between statin use and prevention of CIN after angiography.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] They have mentioned that they have enrolled patients with normal or mildly impaired renal function ad it can be the reason of the lower incidence of CIN. Also they have mentioned that short term use of statins may not be enough to develop the anti-oxidant effect of the drug. Also, more following was suggested in that study. Another study has reported that 3.3% in the atorvastatin group (short term high dose use) and 10% in the control group developed CIN, and the difference was not significant. But similar to our results they have reported that the baseline Cr and GFR levels were similar before the study and after the procedure a significant Cr decrease and GFR increase in the atorvastatin group were shown.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In that study, patients with diabetes mellitus were not excluded. Toso <italic>et al</italic>. in their study concluded that short term administration of high dose atorvastatin before and after the contrast injection is not effective on reduction of CIN.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In that study, all patients received NAC, and it was a mentioned limitation of the study by the authors. Furthermore, larger sample size and longer period of follow-up are recommended in that study. Some factors including renal dysfunction, diabetes, congestive heart failure, older age and using nephrotoxic drugs are associated with a higher incidence of CIN.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] We excluded patients with renal dysfunction and diabetes mellitus, and this can be the reason of the lower incidence of CIN in our study compared with previous studies. Also in our study patients with PCI were excluded. In PCI, more contrast media than angiography is used, and higher incidence of CIN is expected. Some other studies have reported the same results like our study and have reported that pre-operation statin use is not associated with prevention of CIN.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In contrast to our results, study conducted by Khanal <italic>et al</italic>. on 29409 patient undergoing PCI showed that pre-operation statin use is associated with lower incidence of CIN (4.37 vs. 5.93) in comparison to no statin use group.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Also, another study showed that pre PCI statin use was associated with a lower incidence of CIN and better Cr clearance.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Attallah <italic>et al</italic>. reported that prophylactic use of statins is associated with better Scr levels and lower incidence of CIN.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] A previous study in Iran conducted by Sanadgol <italic>et al</italic>. was conclusive that short term high dose simvastatin before contrast exposure is associated with less CIN. But in that study incidence of CIN is not reported, and only GFR changes are evaluated. That study only revealed the increase of GFR after statin therapy in comparison to control the group.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] According to our results, the effect of long term use of satins was similar to placebo and had lower effects on Scr level and GFR in comparison to pre-operation high dose atorvastatin use. A study conducted by Xinwei <italic>et al</italic>. showed that higher doses (80 mg vs. 20 mg) of simvastatin was more effective on decrease of Scr level and increase of Cr clearance after the PCI.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>A meta-analysis conducted by Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. was no conclusive for CIN preventive effect of statins before contrast exposure and more studies with larger sample sizes and better designed was recommended.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] But another study conducted by Pappy <italic>et al</italic>. showed different conclusion and they have reported that statin use is associated with a significant reduction of CIN in patient undergoing coronary angiography.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] According to these results and results of the current study, more well-designed studies with larger sample sizes are recommended.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Limitations</title><p>The small sample size could be a limitation of this study. Although the sampling was random but finally, most of the participants were male which may another limitation of this study. Also, we excluded the patients with renal dysfunction, diabetes and congestive heart failure. Including these patients and evaluating them separately will provide more information. Llonger duration of follow-up of the patients may provide more results and better conclusions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, our results didn&#x02019;t reveal any association between pre-angiography high dose atorvastatin and also long term statin use and prevention of CIN.
