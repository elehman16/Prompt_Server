The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of fish oil supplementation on the plasma lipidomic profile in healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In a double-blinded randomized controlled parallel-group study, healthy subjects received capsules containing either 8 g/d of fish oil (FO) (1.6 g/d EPA+DHA) (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;16) or 8 g/d of high oleic sunflower oil (HOSO) (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;17) for seven weeks. During the first three weeks of intervention, the subjects completed a fully controlled diet period. BMI and total serum triglycerides, total-, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol were unchanged during the intervention period. Lipidomic analyses were performed using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOFMS), where 568 lipids were detected and 260 identified. Both t-tests and Multi-Block Partial Least Square Regression (MBPLSR) analysis were performed for analysing differences between the intervention groups. The intervention groups were well separated by the lipidomic data after three weeks of intervention. Several lipid classes such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, and triglycerides contributed strongly to this separation. Twenty-three lipids were significantly decreased (FDR&#x0003c;0.05) in the FO group after three weeks compared with the HOSO group, whereas fifty-one were increased including selected phospholipids and triglycerides of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. After seven weeks of intervention the two intervention groups showed similar grouping.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>In healthy subjects, fish oil supplementation alters lipid metabolism and increases the proportion of phospholipids and triglycerides containing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Whether the beneficial effects of fish oil supplementation may be explained by a remodeling of the plasma lipids into phospholipids and triglycerides of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids needs to be further investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01034423">NCT01034423</ext-link>

It has been suggested that bioactive lipid components may be important in mediating these effects, but the molecular mechanisms are still to a large extent unknown.</p><p>Cells, tissues and biological fluids contain tens of thousands of structurally different lipids, that fulfil multiple roles in cellular signalling, in membrane structure, and as fuel sources for many cell types <xref rid="pone.0042550-Gross1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The entire spectrum of lipids in a biological system, can be defined as the lipidome <xref rid="pone.0042550-SeppanenLaakso1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, which combines mass spectrometry technology and bioinformatics methods with traditional methods such as sample preparation, lipid extraction and separation. Lipidome analyses have revealed a diversity of lipid compounds in human plasma, which can be classified into six main lipid categories including fatty acyls, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, sterol lipids and prenol lipids <xref rid="pone.0042550-Quehenberger1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The major plasma lipids are the glycerolipids (TGs), glycerophospholipids (phospholipids) and sterol lipids which are transported in the lipoprotein particles <xref rid="pone.0042550-Quehenberger1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042550-Kontush1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>In n-3 FA intervention studies fatty acids have been measured in different blood compartments such as in platelets and red blood cells, and in plasma cholesteryl esters, triglycerides and phospholipids.

In order to estimate both the influence of the total amount of lipids in each lipid class and simultaneously the influence of the relative variation within each lipid class, each block was normalized by a division by the total amount of lipids in the corresponding class. The total amounts of lipids of each lipid classes were then used as an additional block and named &#x0201c;the sums of lipids&#x0201d;. Subsequently, plasma lipids were transformed by taking the log2 ratio (baseline adjusted log2 values) after three and seven weeks in both the FO and the HOSO group. After this, each block (lipid class) was set on the same footing prior to MBPLSR analysis by block scaling as described in <xref rid="pone.0042550-Hassani1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Model-validation and testing of the influence of each lipid class to the global model was done by cross-validation as described in <xref rid="pone.0042550-Hassani1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.Variable significance testing for the difference between the groups at baseline and after the intervention (baseline adjusted values) was done by cross-validation <xref rid="pone.0042550-Wangen1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042550-Hassani1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> of the multivariate MBPLSR model and by univariate testing using Student's- <italic>t</italic> test. For the univariate testing the log2 ratios were used and False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrected <italic>q</italic>-values were computed using the R package &#x02018;qvalue&#x02019;.

Of these lipids, 260 were identified, including the following lipid classes; ceramides, sphingomyelins (SM), lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamines (lysoPE), phosphatidic acids (PA), phosphatidylcholines (PC), phosphatidyethanolamines (PE), phosphatidylglycerols (PG), phosphatidylinositols (PI), phosphatidyserines (PS) and triglycerides (TG). In the present study, the identified lipids were included in the statistical analysis.</p><p>MBPLSR was performed with lipid class blocks as a multi-block <bold>X</bold> and intervention group indicator variable as y-variable. The lipid class block variation patterns after three weeks of intervention are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042550-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042550-g003">Figure 3A&#x02013;D</xref>. The lipidomic profiles of the two intervention groups were well separated in the global sample variation pattern (global score plot) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042550-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). The first principal component accounted for most of the separation of the two groups and explained 91.5% of the total variance in the y-variable. The explained block variances are shown on the respective axes. Several lipid class blocks (lysoPC, PC, PE, PG, PS, SM and TG) showed a clear separation of the FO and the HOSO group, whereas ceramides, lysoPE and PA lipids did not separate the FO and the HOSO group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042550-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042550-g003">Figure 3A&#x02013;D</xref>). In addition, the sums of lipid classes did not separate the FO and the HOSO group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042550-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) showing that the differences between FO and HOSO group can be explained by remodelling within lipid classes rather than by changes in the total amount of lipids in each class. A similar separation of the groups and patterns in block score plots were observed also after seven weeks of intervention (data not shown). To further analyze the plasma lipid profile and to identify specific lipids contributing to the separation, we decided to use the data obtained after completing a three weeks fully controlled diet period. After three weeks of intervention, the contribution of each lipid class block to the prediction of the group indicator variable was validated by calculating root mean squared errors of cross-validation per block. The validated explained variances for the first two components are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042550-g004">Figure 4</xref>. The first principal component of the lysoPC, PC, PE and SM lipid classes described most of the group separation and explained more than 70% of the y-variance. The second component of the PG, PS and TG lipids explained the separation of the two intervention groups further accounting for 19&#x02013;37% of the y-variance.

lipidomic profile in healthy subjects. A clear distinction of the lipidomic profile was obtained between the FO and the HOSO group after three and seven weeks of intervention. The lipid classes that contributed to the separation of the intervention groups were LysoPC, PC, PE, PG, PS, SM and TG. FO supplementation especially increased phospholipids and TGs of long-chain PUFAs, but the total concentration of the lipids within each lipid class remained unchanged and did not differ in the FO compared to the HOSO group. The clear distinction between the FO and the HOSO group was observed after a fully-controlled isocaloric diet period for three weeks and it was also evident after the subjects had continued on their habitual diet for additionally four weeks. HOSO was used as control oil due to a similar lipid composition as the background diet, and the expected change in plasma lipidome after intake of HOSO were thought to be small.</p><p>By using MBPLSR, co-variation patterns in sample and variable space for the different lipid classes was studied. MBPLSR is a method based on latent variables, where by using only few latent variables the problem of over-fitting and false discovery is minimized. For MBPLSR analysis data blocks were organized and normalized, such that remodelling effects in each lipid class and changes in total amounts of lipids per class could be studied separately. A possible consequence of organizing the data into lipid classes is that patterns in the dataset related to other features maybe overlooked. We also included univariate analyses were the data was not organized into lipid classes. The univariate analyses will produce many false significant lipids due to the high number of variables and therefore false discovery adjusted q-values were computed. The majority of the significant altered lipids identified with univariate analyses were also identified as changed with multivariate analyses, indicating that the organization into lipid classes did not influenced the identification of significant altered lipids.</p><p>Recent results from a dietary intervention study have shown that fish intake increased TGs of long-chain PUFA similar to our results, and that fish consumption for eight weeks increased plasma long-chain TGs in subjects with coronary heart disease <xref rid="pone.0042550-Lankinen2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Interestingly, this effect was significant after intake of lean fish and not fatty fish <xref rid="pone.0042550-Lankinen2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. A healthy diet rich in whole grain products, fish and bilberries significantly changed multiple TGs incorporating long-chain PUFAs after 12 weeks intervention in subjects with impaired glucose metabolism <xref rid="pone.0042550-Lankinen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Fish oil supplementation was previously found to reduce the total plasma TG concentration by selectively reducing short chain fatty acids and to increase various phospholipids <xref rid="pone.0042550-McCombie1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that intake of fish and fish oil causes a remodeling of plasma TG species towards more long-chained fatty acids. Our results demonstrate that this remodeling occurs in healthy subjects where the total serum TG level and the BMI are unchanged.</p><p>We observed an increase in several phospholipids incorporating n-3 PUFAs, such as lysoPC(20:5) and lysoPC(22:6) in the FO group compared to the HOSO group. An association between n-3 FA intake and changes in lysoPC has previously been described <xref rid="pone.0042550-Lankinen2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042550-Block1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, and in accordance with our results, lysoPC(20:5) was significantly increased in subjects with impaired glucose metabolism after a healthy diet containing fatty fish <xref rid="pone.0042550-Lankinen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In contrast, fatty fish consumption for eight weeks in subjects with CVD decreased the total concentration of lysoPC <xref rid="pone.0042550-Lankinen2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In addition, Block and colleagues found that FO supplementation increased the EPA and DHA species of lysoPC in healthy individuals <xref rid="pone.0042550-Block1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The potential health effect of altering the blood plasma concentration of EPA and DHA lysoPC compounds is uncertain. However, the biological functions of lysoPC compounds are assumed to vary with the degree of saturation and acyl length <xref rid="pone.0042550-Block1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and LysoPC has been suggested as the major carrier of DHA to brain tissues <xref rid="pone.0042550-Lagarde1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Three out of four significantly altered SM lipids were increased in the FO group compared to the HOSO group. SM lipids are the most dominant circulating sphingolipid representing 88% of the total concentration in blood, whereasceramides account for approximately 3% <xref rid="pone.0042550-Hammad1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. SM in blood is key components and exists predominantly in the hydrophobic outer layer of lipoprotein particles. Of the lipoprotein particles, the VLDL particle contains the highest amount of SM lipids <xref rid="pone.0042550-Hammad2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. However, the localization, distribution and role SM lipid species among the lipoprotein particles is still obscure.</p><p>In the present study, FO supplementation was not associated with changes in plasma PA, lysoPE and ceramides, indicating that n-3 PUFA is selectively incorporated into other lipid classes. Ceramides have been associated with inflammation and cardiovascular disease <xref rid="pone.0042550-Pfeiffer1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042550-deMello1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, high content of specific C<sub>24</sub> ceramides have been linked to less atherogenic lipoprotein particles in healthy subjects <xref rid="pone.0042550-Hammad2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Lankinen et al. observed that the total concentration of ceramides decreased after fatty fish consumption for eight weeks <xref rid="pone.0042550-Lankinen2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The discrepancies observed between these studies may be due to differences in the study population and design, or due to lack of specific bioactive components in fish oil which are normally present in fish.</p><p>Lipid profiling has identified a relation between lipid acyl chain structure and risk of disease <xref rid="pone.0042550-Rhee1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The present study shows that fish oil supplement increases the level of lipids such as TG(56:9), TG(58:10), LysoPC(22:6) and PC(38:6). These lipid species were recently associated with decreased risk of diabetes, when lipidome analyses were applied to plasma obtained from participants in the Framingham heart cohort study <xref rid="pone.0042550-Rhee1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In that study a higher carbon number and higher double bond content were associated with decreased risk of diabetes. Thus, long-chain highly unsaturated TGs that have been associated with diabetes risk reduction were increased after intake of fish oil in the present study.</p><p>Whether the beneficial effects of fish oil supplementation may be explained by a remodeling of the plasma lipids into TGs and PLs of long-chain PUFAs, needs to be further investigated. However, PUFAs incorporated into TGs and PLs may reach tissues, cells and lipoproteins by a selective lipid exchange <xref rid="pone.0042550-Shearer1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In the tissues, EPA and DHA can be incorporated into membranes and cause alterations in signaling pathways and the formation of lipid mediators that are important in inflammation <xref rid="pone.0042550-Calder1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042550-Sijben1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In addition, EPA and DHA or their oxidation products have the ability to activate transcription factors both in the liver and in other metabolic active tissues and increase the expression of target genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation <xref rid="pone.0042550-Jump1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0042550-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Altering the lipid composition of lipoprotein particles can also contribute to modulation of the lipoprotein particles <xref rid="pone.0042550-Kontush1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, including altered spatial distribution of lipids and therefore also alternation of the function <xref rid="pone.0042550-Yetukuri1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042550-Yetukuri2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, fish oil supplementation for three and seven weeks alter the plasma lipidomic profile markedly compared to intake of high-oleic sunflower oil. The selective elevation of TGs and phospholipids of high carbon number and double bond content may represent beneficial effects of fish oil supplementation in healthy subjects. Future studies are needed in order to elucidate the health benefits of incorporation of long-chain PUFAs into selective phospholipids classes and TGs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0042550.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
