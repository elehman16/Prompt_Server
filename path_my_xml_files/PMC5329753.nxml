The optimal management of lower calyceal renal calculi of&#x000a0;&#x02a7d;&#x000a0;2 cm is still debatable. Shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) was considered for a long time to be the best method for treating lower calyceal stones. However, the stone-free rates (SFRs) for SWL in most recent studies for lower calyceal stones range between 37% and 68% <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. SWL outcomes are influenced by stone composition, the lower calyceal angle that permits the clearance of the resultant residuals, and the patient&#x02019;s body habitus, which may decrease the efficacy of SWL and increase the re-treatment rate.</p><p>Other available options include percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). The main disadvantage of the traditional PCNL was the need to use a large sheath (32 F), with the resultant potential complications of bleeding, injury to adjacent organs, postoperative pain, long hospital stay, and urinary fistulae. However, the introduction of the concept of mini-PCNL and fragmenting the stones using a holmium laser without the need for a postoperative nephrostomy tube (i.e. tubeless), has dramatically decreased these complications <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Flexible ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy, also referred to as retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), is now considered a treatment option, as compared to SWL it has proven to have a better SFR <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Several studies have been conducted to compare mini-PCNL and RIRS as regards the SFR and the safety for managing lower calyceal stones. The main limitations of these previous studies were the limited number of cases, the different classifications of targeted stone size, and their definition of success <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to assess the safety, efficacy, and SFR of mini-PCNL and RIRS in the management of lower calyceal stones of &#x02a7d;2&#x000a0;cm and to determine the advantages and disadvantages of each.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This is a prospective randomised study carried out between July 2012 and December 2015.

In all, 20 patients refused any form of surgical intervention and were excluded from the study.

Radiological investigations included abdominal ultrasonography, multi-slice spiral CT to measure the stone size and plain abdominal radiograph of the kidneys, ureters and bladder (KUB).</p><p>The 60 patients randomly assigned to Group A were managed by mini-PCNL and those in Group B were managed by RIRS.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The ethics committee approved the study and all patients were informed about the study and a signed written consent was obtained.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><title>Procedure</title><p>All patients in both groups had a urine analysis before the procedure. All patients with UTIs received antibiotics based on urine culture and sensitivity. Urine analysis was repeated again before the procedure.

Localisation and proper selection of the puncture sites was aided by contrast injection through the 6-F ureteric catheter placed at the beginning of the procedure. The time needed for the insertion of the ureteric catheter, as well as that needed for patient positioning were included in the overall operating time. Calyceal puncture was performed using a 22-G needle. A 0.035-mm J-tipped guidewire was inserted through the calyceal puncture into the renal pelvis. Dilatation of the tract was performed using the first three Alkan dilators. After tract dilatation, a 16-F sheath was inserted. A rigid 10-F ureteroscope was introduced and stone fragmentation was carried out using a Ho:YAG laser (365&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m fibre; energy 0.8&#x000a0;J; frequency 12&#x000a0;Hz).

In their study, Albala et al. <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> reported a statistically significantly higher SFR for PCNL compared to SWL for lower calyceal stones of 95.8% and 40%, respectively. A similar result was also reported by Yuruk et al. <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, they compared PCNL and SWL for managing 62 patients with lower calyceal stones of &#x0003c;2.0&#x000a0;cm and documented a higher SFR for PCNL as compared to SWL of 96.7% and 56.7%, respectively. Several studies have compared RIRS to SWL for managing lower calyceal stones. Salem et al. <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> conducted their study on 60 patients with lower calyceal stones of &#x0003c;2.0&#x000a0;cm who were randomly divided into two groups and were managed with either RIRS or SWL. The SFR for RIRS was 96.7% and for SWL was 56.7%, which was statistically significant. Similar results but at 4&#x000a0;weeks postoperatively were also achieved by Singh et al. <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Lee et al. <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> conducted a study to compare mini-PCNL and RIRS for managing patients with renal stones of &#x0003e;1.0&#x000a0;cm and came to the conclusion that both techniques are safe and equally effective, with a SFR following a single session at 12&#x000a0;weeks follow-up of 85.7% in the mini-PCNL group and 97.0% in the RIRS group (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.199). Two important differences were reported between the different studies comparing these two techniques, the first was the initial stone size studied and the second was the definition of the success. Whilst Albala et al. <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and Carlsson and et al. <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> studied stones of &#x02a7d;3.0&#x000a0;cm, Pearle et al. <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> conducted their studies on stones of &#x02a7d;1.0&#x000a0;cm, and Kuo et al. <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> studied stones of 1.1&#x02013;2.5&#x000a0;cm. As regards the definition of their success, Albala et al. <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> defined the success as stone free or residual fragments of &#x02a7d;0.3&#x000a0;cm at 12&#x000a0;weeks, Carlsson et al. <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> defined it as stone free or residual fragments of &#x02a7d;0.5&#x000a0;cm at 4&#x000a0;weeks and Pearle et al. <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> defined it stone free or residual fragments of &#x02a7d;0.5&#x000a0;cm at 12&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>In the present study, we compared mini-PCNL and RIRS, after random allocation of patients, for managing lower calyceal stones in order to determine the pros and cons of each technique. Such data are important for assisting the urologist together with their patients in deciding which technique to choose.</p><p>We prospectively studied stones of &#x02a7d;2&#x000a0;cm and the patients were randomly divided into two groups, each of 60 patients. Our definition of success was similar to that of Albala et al. <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, there were no major intraoperative complications that required surgical or radiological intervention. By contrast, Ozturk et al. <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> reported a case of ureteric injury during RIRS that required surgical repair and a case of significant bleeding in their mini-PCNL group that required angio-embolisation. The most commonly encountered complication in the present study was postoperative fever reported in five cases [two in Group A (3.33%) and three in Group B (5%)] followed by minor pelvi-calyceal injury that was managed conservatively [one in Group A (1.66%) and two in Group B (3.33%)]. This is comparable to the results of Yuruk et al. <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> for PCNL. The incidence of postoperative fever in our present study was more than that reported by Hyams et al. <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> who reported fever in only 2.5%, and that reported Kumar et al. <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> of 3.3% for RIRS.</p><p>The mean operating time was statistically significantly longer in Group B (RIRS) than in Group A (mini-PCNL) (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001), which disagrees with the study of Sabnis et al. <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> who reported a shorter operating time for RIRS as compared to PCNL.
