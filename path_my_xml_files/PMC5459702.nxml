They can result in superabundant production of inflammatory mediators and cytokines, which can have a negative impact on several processes, increasing mortality risk.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Second-degree burns are sometimes a dilemma as to whether early surgery should be carried out or whether this should be delayed until remnant dermal components are re-epithelialized.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> It has been reported that early excision and grafting of less than 20% of the total burn surface area (TBSA) performed better than non-operative treatment due to hypertrophic scar (HS) formation and scar quality.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Muangman et al<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> demonstrated that dermal replacement template surgery on the 5th day after burn, followed by autografting on the 21st day after burn was safe and effective for patients with deep dermal burns to full-thickness burns and 43% TBSA.</p><p>However, many patients refuse surgery due to the financial cost and the risks involved, and in patients with large-area burns, intact epithelium is often difficult to obtain for surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Therefore, the development of effective drugs which can be directly applied to wounds is of great importance in the treatment of deep second-degree burns.</p><p>Recently, several innovative therapies for burn treatment have been proposed, one of these was the use of recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF).<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> RhGM-CSF has been proven beneficial in healing both deep burn wounds and leprosy ulcers, indicating its potential in second-degree burns.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Because of rhGM-CSF can promote hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation in bone marrow and aid the transferring of mature cells to the periphery. Meanwhile, rhGM-CSF can increase the amounts of monocytes and macrophages within tissue, eventually enhancing immune response to local wounds and accelerating wound healing.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Fang et al<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> and Kaplan et al<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> both found that GM-CSF could promotes wound healing, abates inflammation of local wounds, and promotes the growth of epithelial tissue in diabetic and immune deficient rats. Overall, the efficacy of rhGM-CSF in the clinical treatment of wound healing has thus gained our attention, prompting this study.</p><p>In an attempt to evaluate the treatment efforts of patients with deep second-degree burn, we planned a prospective randomized trial of rhGM-CSF versus placebo. In this experiment, we evaluated and compared the efficacy of rhGM-CSF and placebo on second-degree burn wound healing so that a more efficacious and convenient treatment can be used in clinical practice. In this study, a series of wound healing indicators have been examined to compare the effects of rhGM-CSF with placebo.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>In total, 95 large-area burn patients admitted to our hospital between December 2013 and January 2015 were enrolled in this study. The sample size we took in our study was much more than the calculation result of 48 when the power was over 90% by the power calculation. Patients were divided into 2 groups: rhGM-CSF and placebo groups. The baseline characteristics of patients in 2 groups were shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and all included outcomes showed no statistical difference (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003e;&#x0200a;.05). A diagnosis of deep second-degree burn and large-area burn (&#x0003e; 50% of total body surface area [TBSA]) was made according to the 3-degree scale and the rule of nines, respectively. Participants were aged between 18 and 60, with at least 2 adjacent residual wounds (distance more than 20&#x0200a;cm) with similar wound area (area difference less than 4&#x0200a;cm<sup>2</sup>), and with residual wound areas smaller than 25&#x0200a;cm<sup>2</sup>. Patents who met any of the following conditions were excluded from this study: (1) history of medication treatment; (2) allergic to rhGM-CSF or bFGF or had allergic history with multiple medications, or recent allergy outbreak; (3) had severe combined injury, diabetes, cardiac, hepatic, or renal dysfunctions; (4) women during pregnancy and lactation. The Ethics Committee of the 253rd Hospital of PLA approved our research, and all participants were informed of the treatments and gave written consent. The number of ethical approval was 2011 (04) and the date of ethical approval was 26th July, 2015.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of 3 groups.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e6881-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Treatment</title><p>A total of 190 burn wounds of 95 patients were randomly assigned into the rhGM-CSF group (using rhGM-CSF, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;95) and control group (using placebo, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;95) by the principle of matched pair design. Empowerstats software was used as the randomization method. When there were 2 wounds on the same participant, one was randomly chosen for the rhGM-CSF group and the other one for the placebo group. All participants underwent routine debridement. Before drug treatment, the secretions the wounds were fully cleaned and washed with physiological saline. The experimental group was treated with rhGM-CSF gelatin (GeneScience Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. Changchun, China) and the control group was treated with a placebo (GeneScience Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. Changchun, China). All wounds were covered with the rhGM-CSF gelatin or placebo of 1 to 2&#x0200a;mm and bandaged with 4 to 5 layers of dressings. Dry gauze was then applied and the fresh dressing was changed for each wound every day.

The sample cloth showing the shape of the wound was then put in a grid table (the side length of each small square was 0.25&#x0200a;cm).

Besides, RhGM-CSF repairs wounds not only by accelerating the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells into neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages, but also by promoting the migration and differentiation of epithelial cells and keratinocytes, which spread across the wound area. And the main function of epithelial cells and keratinocytes is to re-epithelialize and form a neuroepithelial layer.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Fang et al<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> discovered that exogenous GM-CSF promoted wound healing in diabetic mice and raised the level of some cytokines which promote neovascularization and infiltration of macrophages as well as neutrophils.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Mann et al<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> also suggested that rhGM-CSF can promote vascular endothelial cell differentiation and accelerate the generation of new blood vessels, which was also supported by our experiment. In our research, we discovered that blood capillary and vascularity distinctively improved in the rhGM-CSF group in comparison with the placebo group. The results of our study indicated that rhGM-CSF can promote both re-epithelization and angiogenesis in the burn wound area, which then could facilitate a more rapid wound recovery.</p><p>In our experiment, we compared the scar scaling scores of patients treated with rhGM-CSF and placebo. The results demonstrated that patients treated with rhGM-CSF showed lower scores, indicating better recovery condition, whereas those treated with placebo showed inferior recovery conditions to those treated with rhGM-CSF. The scaling results suggested an outstanding performance of rhGM-CSF in reducing scar formation, which also contributes to a better treatment outcome of large-area burns.</p><p>Our research consisted of a comparison between rhGM-CSF and placebo confirmed the effectiveness of rhGM-CSF in the treatment of burn injuries. However, the participators in our study only included hydrothermal burn, flame burn, and chemical burn. Moreover, the effect of rhGM-CSF on purulent secretion of burn wounds needs further investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that rhGM-CSF generally outperformed placebo in burn wound healing. The good performance of rhGM-CSF confirms its role in burn healing and could provide a practical method in the treatment of burn wounds.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: FGF = fibroblast growth factor, HE = hematoxylin and eosin, HS = hypertrophic scar, rhGM-CSF = recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, TBSA = total burn surface area, VEGF = vascular endothelial factor.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>DY and SL contributed equally to this study.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no funding and conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>LY</given-names></name><name><surname>Hou</surname><given-names>YS</given-names></name><name><surname>Chai</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
