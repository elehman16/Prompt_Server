Increasing age, comorbid conditions, cancer stage, side effects of treatment, and limited access to targeted programs and facilities have been identified as factors that influence participation in exercise for men living with the condition.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Furthermore, men lack the confidence in their ability to be physically active and do not have knowledge about appropriate exercise levels.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Addressing barriers to exercise participation requires a multipronged approach. One strategy is for clinicians to encourage exercise as part of patients' clinical care through a referral to an exercise program that is tailored to individual capabilities. Research has highlighted the importance of cancer clinician endorsement of physical activity recommendations to improving physical activity levels in men with prostate cancer,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> with cancer survivors increasingly looking for lifestyle advice, such as exercise, to improve their health outcomes.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A recent study of men with prostate cancer suggested that encouragement from clinicians and referral to an exercise specialist were likely to give men more confidence to participate in physical activity.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, the effectiveness of this approach has not been tested because exercise programs do not form part of standard clinical care after a cancer diagnosis.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Few clinicians view their role as health promotion advocates, with only 20% promoting lifestyle changes to their patients.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> A recent survey of clinicians who treated men with prostate cancer showed that more than half of clinicians (55%) reported that advising patients on physical activity was not part of their role, with &#x0201c;not enough time&#x0201d; and a &#x0201c;lack of knowledge/resources&#x0201d; being the most common barriers to promoting physical activity.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>The development of clinical partnerships and referral pathways with allied health personnel, such as exercise physiologists, could overcome the barriers experienced by clinicians. Such referrals would allow men with prostate cancer to receive an appropriate exercise dose to optimize therapeutic outcomes while receiving endorsement from their trusted treating clinicians.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><sec><title>Study Aims and Hypotheses</title><p>The primary aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a clinician-referred 12-week exercise program in comparison with usual care in increasing self-reported physical activity levels for men who had completed active treatment for prostate cancer. Secondary aims examined the effect of the exercise program on psychological well-being, quality of life, and objectively assessed physical activity. We hypothesized that participants in the intervention would be more physically active and have improved quality of life in comparison with participants in the control condition.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>The study was a 2-armed, prospective, multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of a medical or nursing clinician referral to a 12-week exercise program (comprising 2 gym sessions and 1 home-based session per week and commencing 3 to 12 months after active treatment for prostate cancer) in comparison with usual care. The study was approved by the institutional research ethics committee. A detailed description of the study methods is available in the published protocol.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Random Assignment</title><p>Fifteen clinicians (71%) who agreed to participate in the study were randomly allocated with an online random number generator to either the intervention (n = 8) or the control condition (n = 7). Clinicians remained in the 1 randomized condition for the entire recruitment period. Intervention clinicians were trained in the referral process, which comprised a standard script to follow and a referral slip<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> to the supervised exercise program, which was handed to the participant during the consultation, as part of the standardized procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Participant Recruitment</title><p>Recruitment occurred through urology and radiation oncology outpatient clinics across 3 major public health services and 4 private clinics located across Melbourne, Australia. Men were eligible to participate if they had completed active treatment for prostate cancer within the previous 3 to 12 months, were treated with curative intent, and could complete surveys in the English language. Men on hormone treatment were also eligible to take part in the study. Before a patient's consultation with a clinician at an outpatient clinic, eligible patients were informed about the study, provided with an information package, and followed up with respect to their interest in participating in the study. Those who were interested were asked to sign and return the consent form and baseline questionnaire before their participation in the study.</p><p>During the consultation, clinicians randomized to the intervention condition provided a standardized referral slip,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> which stated that the participant had been assigned to the exercise group and that the clinician recommended that they participate in the exercise program. Clinicians randomized into the control condition provided usual care regarding physical activity advice, which was typically minimal information. Clinician adherence to the study process was monitored each week.</p><p>The supervised exercise program was undertaken at each participant's local community gym and was supervised by exercise physiologists. The 12-week exercise program was based on exercise guidelines for cancer survivors developed by the American College of Sports Medicine<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and Exercise and Sport Science Australia<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and was guided by social cognitive theory.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Postgraduate clinical exercise physiology students under the supervision of accredited exercise physiologists instructed participants during 2 supervised, 50-minute sessions per week at local gym facilities, and they advised participants on a weekly home-based session.</p><p>The primary outcome was the number of self-reported minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week as measured with an adapted Godin-Shepherd Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire, which was administered to assess participation in physical activity.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Participants were asked to recall their average weekly frequency and duration of light-intensity activity (minimal effort, no perspiration), moderate-intensity activity (not exhausting, light perspiration), and vigorous-intensity activity (rapidly beating heart, sweating) in a typical week in the past month. We also calculated the percentage of participants meeting aerobic exercise guidelines of combined MVPA levels &#x02265; 150 min/wk and the number who reported zero MVPA levels.</p><p>The secondary outcomes included an objective assessment of physical activity as well as self-reported depressive symptoms, anxiety, and quality of life. All participants were asked to wear a hip-mounted accelerometer (GT1M; ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL) for 7 days at the baseline and immediately after the 12-week exercise program (equivalent time period for the control group) to obtain a quantitative measure of light-intensity activity and MVPA on an average day according to the Freedson adult cut points.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Accelerometry data were processed with ActiLife software (version 6.7.1) and managed with a customized Excel macro. Minutes of daily light-intensity activity and MVPA were calculated by the summation of valid days (10 hours of wear time per day, with the removal of 60 minutes of consecutive zero counts), weighted by week and weekend days and divided by 7. Quality of life was measured with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core quality-of-life questionnaire (QLQ-C30, version 3) and prostate tumor&#x02013;specific module (QLQ-PR25).<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Prostate cancer&#x02013;related anxiety was measured with the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC).<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Depressive symptoms were assessed with the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Inventory, with mean and total scores calculated.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>A satisfaction survey (intervention group) was conducted to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the clinician referral and exercise program. Participants were asked a series of questions about how much the clinician referral influenced their decision to participate in the 12-week program and their experience with the 12-week program, including whether they met their exercise goals, whether the gym location was convenient, and whether they intended to continue the exercise program after the study was completed.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p><italic>t</italic> tests and chi-square tests were used to compare baseline characteristics between the intervention and control groups. To assess the impact of the intervention on primary and secondary outcomes, time-by-treatment interactions were analyzed in a repeated measures split plot in time analysis of variance model for continuous outcomes. Post hoc contrasts were also conducted to determine follow-up by intervention impact. Repeated measures logistic regression was used for binary outcomes to evaluate time-by-treatment interactions. In both scenarios, model parameters were estimated with generalized estimating equations with an exchangeable working correlation matrix to take account of the repeated measures for each participant. Effect sizes (follow-up by intervention effect) were calculated with Cohen's <italic>d</italic>. Odds ratios were transformed into effect sizes with a logarithmic transformation.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> We performed an intention-to-treat analysis with a linear mixed model approach. Tests were 2-tailed with the statistical significance set at an &#x003b1; level of .05. The analyses were undertaken with STATA.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A consecutive series of men who completed active treatment for prostate cancer was screened from October 2011 to June 2013.

Compared with men in the control condition, men in the intervention condition undertook more than twice as much vigorous exercise at follow-up and had almost 4 times the odds of meeting exercise guidelines (&#x02265;150 min/wk of MVPA) and nearly 5 times the odds of avoiding complete inactivity (0 MVPA minutes). However, the failure of our exercise intervention to significantly improve MVPA minutes may in part be due to the variation in the 2 groups both at baseline and at follow-up, which resulted in imprecise interval estimations. For example, 48% of those in the control condition and 41.5% in the intervention group did not participate in MVPA at the baseline, and this inflated the variance; at follow-up, 32% in the control group reported zero MVPA, whereas only 6% in the intervention group.</p><p>There were no significant intervention effects based on objectively measured physical activity. This may be due to the limited ability of the device to capture activities such as swimming, biking, and strength training<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> or due to behavioral compensation in total daily physical activity (as reflected by the device's ability to capture all major bodily movement in comparison with the self-report measure, which is based mainly on structured activities) or the timing of wearing the accelerometer (ie, in the week immediately before and after the intervention).</p><p>The intervention did produce positive findings for depressive symptoms and quality-of-life outcomes (specifically improved cognitive function). The importance of exercise in improving quality-of-life outcomes has been supported by recently published Cochrane reviews and meta-analyses. However, because only 12% of the participants in the current study had clinical depression (&#x02265;16) at baseline, our ability to determine a significant impact of the program on depressive symptoms was limited. Cognitive dysfunction is a common outcome for men with prostate cancer and particularly for those on androgen-deprivation therapy. Regular exercise improves cardiovascular fitness, which has a positive association with cognitive performance in older adults and a protective effect against cognitive decline.<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> There are several potential mechanisms explaining these associations: vascular contributions from exercise may delay or prevent the onset of cerebrovascular disease, exercise increases the expression of synaptic plasticity genes and results in increased brain neuroplasticity, and exercise increases resilience to brain aging and neurodegeneration through increases in brain volume.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> This study highlighted the potential importance of a targeted exercise program in improving cognitive functioning in men with prostate cancer.</p><p>Results from MAX-PC are somewhat difficult to interpret. The MAX-PC anxiety scale is focused on anxiety related to prostate-specific antigen scores, risk of recurrence, and generalized anxiety and may be more suitable for observing changes over longer periods of time. The follow-up of participants at 6 or 12 months, rather than 12 weeks, may provide a better understanding of the role of exercise and its impact on anxiety.</p><p>Nearly half of the participants in the intervention group indicated their intention to continue their program by joining their local community gym; the majority reported a benefit from the targeted program. Whether the program is sustained over time will determine the potential of the program to improve the medium- and long-term health outcomes for men living with the disease.<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Exercise adherence can be a challenge in cancer trials.<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> However, this was not evident in the current study. In comparison with the control arm, there was a higher representation of patients who had surgery and completed adjuvant therapies, including radiotherapy and androgen-deprivation therapy, and participated in the intervention. The program was well tolerated by participants; only 13% completed fewer than 18 sessions, and this suggested that the exercise program was acceptable to participants. Attrition was substantially lower than that for other exercise trials, which reported attrition rates ranging from 0% to 44%.<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> This reduces the risk of bias in the current study. The majority of the participants found the program rewarding and reported that it was beneficial to their health and well-being and that they achieved their exercise goals; this suggests that it was feasible. Supervised programs ensure that the exercise is targeted to the individual, and this can reduce the risk of injury and improve adherence to the program; the unsupervised home-based program potentially increases long-term adoption and maintenance of physical activity as part of one's daily routine.<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>Importantly, among those who agreed to participate, 80% reported that the clinician's referral to take part in the 12-week program influenced their decision to participate. This has important clinical implications for how clinicians may assist and facilitate men's physical activity engagement in tailored exercise programs for improved physical activity and health outcomes.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>Our trial's strengths include recruitment of a sequential cohort of men with prostate cancer across public and private outpatient clinics, clinicians providing a standardized referral to men to a supervised exercise program, high adherence rates being achieved with the 2 gym sessions and 1 home-based session per week over the 12-week period, the use of previously validated measures, and 95% participant compliance with questionnaire completion.</p><p>Limitations of the study include the fact that the average MVPA levels at the baseline were higher than those found in the clinical trial from which we derived our initial power calculations,<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and this suggests that we may have recruited a more physically active sample of participants. Response bias is difficult to overcome in a study that relies on voluntary participation. Modest recruitment and fixed-term funding constraints resulted in a sample of 147 participants rather than the original target of 200.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> A post hoc power analysis was conducted and showed that there was 80% power to detect an interaction effect (time-by-treatment group) of 80 minutes.</p><p>Differential intervention effects between self-report and accelerometer data have been reported elsewhere in other cancer cohorts.<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> However, a recent systematic review that compared self-reporting, including diaries, and direct measurement results found no clear trends in the overreporting or underreporting of physical activity by self-reporting versus direct methods.<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Researchers undertaking exercise studies should consider including self-report exercise behavior as well as objective measurements.<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> We achieved a 46% participation rate, which was better than, or similar to, the rates in other randomized controlled trials involving prostate cancer survivors<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>; however, our sample was overrepresented by men with stage I and II disease. Future research should address different disease stages and exercise capacity in these vulnerable disease groups.</p><p>Our trial highlighted that clinicians are ideally suited to provide a teachable moment<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and refer men to exercise programs as part of their clinical care after active treatment for prostate cancer with an individually tailored supervised program to improve quality-of-life outcomes. Engagement with medical and allied health professionals in the establishment of a clinician referral pathway for exercise-based programs could reduce the barriers to exercise among prostate cancer survivors. Further study is required to determine the sustainability of the exercise program and its generalizability to other disease stage groups and cancer populations and investigate whether the supervised 12 week program is better suited for men who are more sedentary.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p></sec></body><back><sec><title>FUNDING SUPPORT</title><p>This study was funded by the Australian Research Council (LP100200176) and the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia with in-kind support from YMCA Victoria, Eastern Health, Epworth Healthcare, North Eastern Metropolitan Integrated Cancer Service, and the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre.
