The hallmark of COPD is expiratory flow limitation, which is slowly progressive and irreversible.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-copd-8-569">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-copd-8-569">3</xref> There is also increasing evidence that the inflammatory processes of COPD are closely associated with oxidative stress. Proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors stimulate production of reactive oxygen species. The resulting imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants triggers signaling cascades for a variety of transduction pathways and gene expression, leading in turn to altered expression of proinflammatory factors. Neutrophils are key cells in the inflammatory response in COPD. Excessive transmigration into the lung tissues and abnormal activation are largely responsible for overproduction of reactive oxygen species and release of proteolytic enzymes in the lungs.</p><p>N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a glutathione precursor with beneficial properties. It is a source of sulfhydryl groups in cells and increases the level of reduced glutathione. Reduced glutathione serves as a reducing agent by forming intermolecular disulfide nonradical end product-oxidized glutathione. NAC is also a scavenger of free radicals as it interacts with reactive oxygen species, such as the hydroxyl radical (OH-) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-copd-8-569">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-copd-8-569">7</xref></p><p>In COPD patients, NAC has been used as a mucolytic and for its antioxidant properties. In a large-scale study, it was not possible to demonstrate that NAC decreases the decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) in COPD patients after a period of 3 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-copd-8-569">8</xref> In the same study, however, there were some preliminary indications that NAC reduce hyperinflation, since a decrease in functional residual capacity was observed over time. However, the effects of NAC are certainly dose-dependent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-copd-8-569">9</xref> It might well be that the lack of efficacy is partially explained by use of dosages that are too low.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-copd-8-569">9</xref></p><p>Considering all the above, it would be worthwhile to study the effect of higher dosages of NAC on the small airways, inflammation, and oxidative stress in COPD patients. In this randomized crossover study, patients with Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage II COPD received placebo for 3 months and NAC at a dosage of 600 mg 3 times daily for 3 months in addition to their usual medication. For this trial, we used novel advanced imaging tools that have been demonstrated in the past to yield more sensitive outcome parameters compared with classical lung function tests.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-copd-8-569">10</xref> This functional respiratory imaging method was validated in previous studies using gamma scintigraphy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-copd-8-569">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-copd-8-569">12</xref> single photon emission computed tomography (CT),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-copd-8-569">13</xref> and hyperpolarized 3He magnetic resonance imaging.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-copd-8-569">14</xref> Subsequently, this method was used to assess the effect of a long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-copd-8-569">15</xref> a combination of a long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-copd-8-569">10</xref> and a short-acting anticholinergic and short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-copd-8-569">16</xref> In the current study, we hypothesized that this method could be used to gain additional insight into the mode of action of NAC in COPD patients, particularly the relationship between upregulation of glutathione/glutathione peroxidase and changes in airways volume and resistance. Further, this pilot study aimed to provide a basis for identifying patient phenotypes that would benefit most from NAC therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study was conducted according to all ethical principles. Approval was obtained from the ethics committee and all patients gave their informed consent (NCT00969904). The study started in August 2009 and ended in June 2012.</p><sec><title>Patient population</title><p>Twelve COPD patients (nine men and three women) were included. To be eligible for the study, patients had to have documented COPD and meet the following inclusion criteria: a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years; compatible symptoms, including dyspnea, cough, and sputum production; a decreased Tiffeneau index (FEV<sub>1</sub>/forced vital capacity [FVC]) &#x0003c; 0.7; age &#x02265;40 years; cessation of smoking for at least one month; moderate to severe COPD with an FEV<sub>1</sub> 30%&#x02013;80% of predicted [GOLD stages II and III]; and treatment according to GOLD guidelines. The following exclusion criteria were applied: exacerbation during the last 8 weeks; allergy to acetylcysteine or to another element of the product; phenylketonuria; untreated active peptic ulcer; renal and/or cardiac insufficiency; previous treatment with NAC for more than 6 months or during the last 3 months; ongoing treatment with oral, intravenous, or intramuscular corticosteroids; pregnancy or breast-feeding; and treatment with an orally administered cephalosporin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>At all visits, patients received full lung function testing yielding the following parameters: FEV<sub>1</sub>, FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, peak expiratory flow from spirometry, and airway resistance (Raw) and specific airway resistance from body plethysmography. A low-dose multislice CT scan was taken at total lung capacity and functional residual capacity. From these images of the airways, lung and lobar volumes could be obtained as well as airway resistance values by means of computational fluid dynamics. In addition, a blood sample was taken to measure levels of glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and interleukin-8. Patients completed the Saint George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-copd-8-569">Table 1</xref>). At the first visit, patients were randomized according to a computer-generated randomization list to treatment with NAC (Fluimucil&#x000ae;, Zambon SpA, Bresso, Italy) at a dose of 600 mg three times daily or placebo in addition to their usual treatment. After 3 months of treatment, the patients returned to the hospital for further tests and were crossed over to NAC or placebo. After a further 3 months, all measurements were repeated.</p><p>To limit exposure to ionizing radiation, a dose reduction protocol was used for the CT scans. A VCT light speed scanner with 64 detector rows (General Electric, Fairfield, CT, USA) was used. The multislice CT settings were as follows: tube voltage, 120 kV; tube current,10&#x02013;100 mA; noise factor, 28; collimation, 0.625 mm; rotation time, 0.6 seconds; and pitch factor, 1.375. The resulting radiation dose was in the order of 1&#x02013;2 mSv per scan. Images were reconstructed to a slice thickness of 0.6 mm. Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images were assessed using a commercially available software package approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (Mimics, Materialise, Leuven, Belgium). The tracheobronchial tree was subsequently segmented using a semiautomatic approach. A total of three airway models were obtained per patient, ie, a baseline model, a model after 3 months of treatment with NAC or placebo, and a repeat model 3 months after crossover from NAC or placebo. After segmentation, all models for the same patient were superimposed using a least squares method to ensure that a comparison was possible between the different geometries. Segmentation yields the airway volumes at the central (iVaw<sub>cent</sub>) and distal (iVaw<sub>dist</sub>) levels. In addition to airway volumes, it was also possible to extract the lung and lobar volumes from the CT images at functional residual capacity and total lung capacity. Using computational fluid dynamics, it is possible to describe the flow patterns inside the airways based on computer simulation. Computational fluid dynamics numerically solves the Navier&#x02013;Stokes equations inside the prescribed flow domain, in this case the airway tree structures at different measurement points. The main outcome parameter of computational fluid dynamic calculations is airway resistance in the central (iRaw<sub>cent</sub>) and distal airways (iRaw<sub>dist</sub>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Statistica 9.1 software (StatSoft Inc, Tulsa, OK, USA).

The left hand side depicts iRaw, while the right hand side shows iVaw. The left upper quadrant indicates an increase in iRaw, hence nonresponders. The left lower quadrant indicates a decline in iRaw, hence responders. For iVaw it is reversed, whereby the right upper quadrant indicates an increase in iVaw, therefore identifying responders, and the right lower quadrant indicates an decline in iVaw, hence nonresponders. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-copd-8-569">Figure 1</xref>, it can be seen that there was a relatively even distribution between patients who responded in terms of iRaw and iVaw measurements. There were six patients with a reported reduction in iRaw<sub>cent</sub> and four with a reported reduction in iRaw<sub>dist</sub>. In total, five patients demonstrated an increase in iVaw<sub>dist</sub> and three patients showed an increase in iVaw<sub>cent</sub>. In general, the changes could be considered small. However, the differences are considerable for individual patients on a local scale. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-copd-8-569">Figure 2</xref> shows the changes in airway resistance after placebo and NAC treatment for a patient who could be considered an iRaw or NAC responder. It could be observed that the changes are not homogeneously distributed throughout the airway system with a general decline in airway resistance up to 50% after NAC treatment and an increase in airway resistance up to 20% after placebo. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-copd-8-569">Figure 3</xref> shows the results for a nonresponder in terms of iRaw after NAC treatment. It could be observed that local resistance tended to increase up to 20% both after placebo and after NAC treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Glutathione peroxidase and glutathione</title><p>The study showed a significant correlation (<italic>R</italic> = &#x02212;0.7, <italic>P</italic> = 0.011) between the level of glutathione after NAC treatment and the change in resistance of the central airways (iRaw<sub>cent</sub>) measured using imaging and computational fluid dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-copd-8-569">Figure 4</xref>). No correlation was found between glutathione after placebo and iRaw<sub>cent</sub> after placebo. The level of glutathione peroxidase at baseline (<italic>R</italic> = 0.61, <italic>P</italic> = 0.036) and after placebo treatment (<italic>R</italic> = 0.67, <italic>P</italic> = 0.017) correlated with the change in distal airway resistance (iRaw<sub>dist</sub>) after NAC treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-copd-8-569">Figure 5</xref>). No significant correlation was found between the baseline and placebo values for glutathione peroxidase and the change in iRaw<sub>dist</sub> after placebo. Using the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, it could be observed that the level of glutathione after treatment was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> = 0.020) in patients who demonstrated a reduction in iRaw<sub>cent</sub> compared with patients in whom iRaw<sub>cent</sub> stayed constant or increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-copd-8-569">Figure 6</xref>). A similar result was found based on the segmented airway volume of the central airways (iVaw<sub>cent</sub>). Glutathione after NAC treatment was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> = 0.042) in patients with an increase in iVaw<sub>cent</sub>. In patients who demonstrated a reduction in total (central + distal) image-based airway resistance (iRaw<sub>tot</sub>), the change in glutathione peroxidase was significantly (<italic>P</italic> = 0.035) higher compared with patients in whom iRaw<sub>tot</sub> did increase. On average, glutathione peroxidase levels increased in the group with reduced iRaw<sub>tot</sub> and decreased in the group with elevated iRaw<sub>tot</sub> after treatment. FEV<sub>1</sub> also increased slightly in the group with reduced iRaw<sub>tot</sub> and decreased in the group with higher iRaw<sub>tot</sub> after NAC treatment, although the difference between the two groups was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-copd-8-569">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Hyperinflation</title><p>For patients in whom iRaw<sub>dist</sub> decreased, hyperinflation in terms of lobar functional residual capacity level also decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-copd-8-569">Figure 8</xref>). For patients in whom iRaw<sub>dist</sub> did not decrease, the median lobar functional residual capacity level increased. The difference between the two groups was significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.00084). Two patients experienced a reduction in iRaw<sub>dist</sub> larger than 0.002 kPa/L. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs test showed a significant improvement in lobar inspiratory capacity (lobar total lung capacity &#x02013; lobar functional residual capacity) in these patients compared with baseline (<italic>P</italic> = 0.028) and placebo (<italic>P</italic> = 0.011). A significant decline in lobar inspiratory capacity was observed between baseline and placebo (<italic>P</italic> = 0.011, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-copd-8-569">Table 3</xref>). The SGRQ symptom score also improved in these two patients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study aimed to assess the effect of high-dose NAC on image-based airway and lung geometry, inflammation, and oxidative stress in patients with moderate COPD. Previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-copd-8-569">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-copd-8-569">16</xref> have demonstrated that functional respiratory imaging can detect changes that are not reflected in conventional pulmonary function tests. Significant correlations were found between imaging parameters and markers related to oxidative stress. The initial results of this placebo-controlled, crossover trial could assist in gaining further insight into the effect of NAC and selection of potential responders.</p><p>The effect of NAC in COPD patients has been the subject of many clinical trials in the past. The capability of NAC to increase levels of reduced glutathione and hence to enhance protection against oxidative stress has been clearly demonstrated in preclinical studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-copd-8-569">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-copd-8-569">19</xref> Nevertheless, it has been difficult to demonstrate consistently the added clinical value of NAC in COPD patients. Reasons often cited for this are the relatively small size of the clinical trials and variation in the dose of NAC used in the trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-copd-8-569">20</xref> Positive effects of NAC demonstrated in previous trials include a reduction in air trapping and subsequent improvement in inspiratory capacity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-copd-8-569">21</xref> Also, a reduction in the hazard ratio for exacerbations was reported in BRONCUS (Bronchitis Randomized on N-acetylcysteine (NAC) Cost-Utility Study),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-copd-8-569">8</xref> potentially due to enhanced protection against viral infections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-copd-8-569">20</xref> The use of lung function, and especially FEV<sub>1</sub>, to establish the effect of NAC, which is not a bronchodilator, has been challenging because FEV<sub>1</sub> is a poor predictor of clinical symptoms, exercise tolerance, and response to bronchodilators in COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-copd-8-569">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-copd-8-569">23</xref></p><p>Our placebo-controlled, crossover study, for the first time, uses novel imaging tools with a higher sensitivity to detect changes in the respiratory system induced by high-dose NAC. Previous studies have validated and demonstrated the capabilities of these new methods to show changes induced by short-acting and long-acting bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory compounds. Interestingly, even despite the small sample size, the current study was able to show correlations between image-based parameters (ie, computational fluid dynamics-based resistance) and the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which protects against oxidative stress, and the antioxidant glutathione. Both the enzyme and the antioxidant are known to be affected by NAC. To put these results into perspective, it is useful to compare the changes in central and distal airway resistance as measured by the CT/computational fluid dynamics combination with changes previously reported in our other imaging trials. It could be observed that for patients responding well to NAC, the magnitude of the reduction in airway resistance was in the same order as the effect induced by 320/90 &#x003bc;g budesonide/formoterol combination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-copd-8-569">10</xref> and just below the maximum effect of 400 &#x003bc;g of salbutamol and 80 &#x003bc;g of ipratropium bromide.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-copd-8-569">16</xref> As in previous studies, the placebo group also demonstrated in general an increase in airway resistance which indicates that, despite the lack of clear evidence, COPD patients need to use their inhalation medication consistently to limit the decline in lung function.</p><p>The role of glutathione peroxidase appears to be interesting. The current study clearly shows a correlation between the baseline and placebo values for glutathione peroxidase and the change in resistance after treatment. It is known that the biochemical function of glutathione peroxidase is to reduce free H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to water, thereby protecting the organism from oxidative stress. We could speculate that patients with low baseline glutathione peroxidase have additional reserves that could be activated by high doses of NAC, eventually resulting in a reduction in airway resistance. This hypothesis needs to be investigated further in a larger clinical trial in which the role of cytokines, not studied in the current trial, could also be explored further. If the hypothesis is confirmed, the level of glutathione peroxidase could be the basis for selecting patients who would benefit from treatment with NAC in addition to their current therapy.</p><p>Further, the current pilot study demonstrated that FEV<sub>1</sub> was not a good predictor for changes in glutathione peroxidase induced by NAC therapy. The iRaw<sub>dist</sub> on the other hand was able to group patients according to the difference in glutathione peroxidase with statistical significance. The latter can be explained by the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio of imaging. By focusing on a specific clinically relevant region, ie, the central and distal airways, it is possible to eliminate &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d; from the upper airway and the patient&#x02019;s effort. However, the spirometer&#x02019;s inherent black box approach does not allow this. In line with previous studies, it was demonstrated that NAC could have a beneficial effect on hyperinflation in a subset of patients. The functional residual capacity level of the lobes was significantly reduced in patients showing a decrease in distal airway resistance. Inspiratory capacity at a lobar level was improved in the best iRaw<sub>dist</sub> responders. Even though this was only in two patients, the improvement in SGRQ symptom score potentially indicates a beneficial effect of reduction in hyperinflation on the patient&#x02019;s quality of life. Recent large-scale studies also point in the same direction, whereby hyperinflation appears to be an important determinant of the patient&#x02019;s clinical condition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-copd-8-569">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-copd-8-569">25</xref></p><p>The current pilot study demonstrates how new imaging tools can assist research into the pathophysiology of COPD and the subsequent effect of inhalation therapies. However, the sample size of the current study was very small and the results need to be confirmed in larger clinical trials. Nonetheless, there is increasing evidence that these novel imaging methods could complement existing pulmonary function tests and patient-reported outcome parameters to provide better phenotyping of COPD patients in order to enhance and expedite future development of respiratory drugs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p>JDB, WV, SV, CVH, RC, PMP and WDB were responsible for the conception and design of the study, along with its analysis and interpretation.
