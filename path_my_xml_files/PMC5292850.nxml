In this study, we have compared the intrathecal clonidine with intrathecal fentanyl as adjuvant to bupivacaine in terms of safety, efficacy, and postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing lower abdominal surgeries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>After approval from the Institutional Ethic Committee, this prospective, randomized study is conducted on 100 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I or II patients between 18 and 65 years of age planned for elective lower abdominal surgery and patients were divided into two groups of 50 each. From all the patients, informed consent was obtained. Exclusion criteria were severe systemic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart disease with ASA grade more than II, allergy to study drugs, and all potential contraindications for spinal anesthesia, such as patient refusal, spine deformity, raised intracranial pressure, neurological disorders, bleeding disorders, or infection at the puncture site. The patients were randomized into two groups of 50 each, and patients were given 2.5 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine with either 50 &#x000b5;g of clonidine or 25 &#x000b5;g of fentanyl intrathecally. Premedication consists of glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intravenous (IV) and ondansetron 4 mg IV, and sedatives were avoided as premedication, as well as during operative procedure. Preloading was done with ringer lactate 10&#x02013;15 ml/kg. Monitoring parameters such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure were recorded. Under all aseptic precautions, subarachnoid block was given with 25 gauge Quincke needle in sitting position and depending upon the groups, either 25 &#x000b5;g fentanyl or 50 &#x000b5;g clonidine admixed with 2.5 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine resulting in total volume of 3 ml were injected intrathecally. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded every 5 min, and all the heart rate and blood pressure variations more than 20% of baseline were recorded in both groups. Symptomatic hypotension and bradycardia are treated with mephentermine and atropine, respectively. Pinprick method was employed to check the sensory block. Modified bromage scale was used to assess the degree of motor blockade. Observations were recorded at T<sub>0</sub>= time of subarachnoid block administration, T<sub>1</sub> = onset of sensory block time, T<sub>2</sub> = onset of motor block time, T<sub>3</sub> = peak sensory block time, T<sub>4</sub> = time of two segment regression of sensory level, T<sub>5</sub> = time of wearing off of motor block, and T<sub>6</sub> = time to first dose of postoperative rescue analgesia. Any potential side effects such as nausea, vomiting, shivering, pruritus, sedation, hypotension, bradycardia, and respiratory discomfort were recorded. Campbell Sedation Score was used to assess the degree of sedation and scoring. Campbell sedation score as (1) wide awake (2) awake and comfortable (3) drowsy and difficult to arouse (4) not arousable. Residual sensory blockade was monitored and its wearing-off time was noted using two segment sensory regression (sensation to pin-prick gets two dermatomal segments regression). Residual motor blockade was monitored and its wearing off time was noted when patient started to lift legs against gravity. Patients were monitored for degree of pain with the visual analogue scale (VAS). Postoperative rescue analgesia (intramuscular diclofenac 75 mg) was given when the VAS score was &#x0003e;5 and the time of injection of first analgesic drug was noted. This was taken as the time of wearing off of analgesia.</p><p>Statistical analysis was carried out using Mann&#x02013;Whitney test, ANOVA, and Chi-square test and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 is considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>In our study, we observed that demographic data (age, height, weight, ASA grade, gender, and duration of surgery) were comparable with <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05 (statistically not significant) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic data</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-11-37-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Similarly, in our study, there is no statistically significant difference in hemodynamic parameter (blood pressure and heart rate) is observed in both groups.

No patient in BF group demonstrated sedation score more than 2, whereas 8 patients in BC group showed sedation score of 3. From the above observation, we conclude that more patients are sedated in BC group as compared to BF and this difference is statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> depicts the sedation scoring and percentage of patients in both the groups showing the sedation scores.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Campbell sedation score</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-11-37-g003"/></table-wrap><p>Apart from sedation, other complications and side effects are similar in both the groups and are not significant statistically (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) and these complications are depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Other complications and side effects</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-11-37-g004"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Both clonidine and fentanyl when used in lower dose are safe and prolongs the postoperative analgesia of intrathecal bupivacaine, and there is a paucity of studies comparing the safety and efficacy of these two drugs. In our study, we compared intrathecal clonidine and fentanyl in terms of safety and efficacy, and to compare the efficacy, we used the effective analgesia duration measured in minutes for requirement of rescue analgesia. In consistent with several other studies,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] we found that both drugs are effective as adjuvants to intrathecal bupivacaine in prolonging the analgesia duration. Duration of analgesia was significantly higher in clonidine group (497.20 &#x000b1; 139.78 min) than in fentanyl group (416.87 &#x000b1; 105.67), (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Augmented analgesia duration due to fentanyl and clonidine in our study was different as compared to other studies[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] but is consistent with the study conducted by Shidhaye <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The reason for this may be because of the usage of doses of clonidine, fentanyl, or bupivacaine similar to those used by Shidhaye <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Systemic side effects such as bradycardia, hypotension, or sedation are usually not associated with small dose of intrathecal clonidine or fentanyl and hemodynamic stability observed in both groups of our study confirms this. Only one patient had significant bradycardia requiring treatment with IV atropine. Similarly, Sethi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Shah <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] observed very few incidences of hypotension and bradycardia by using 1 mcg/kg of intrathecal clonidine for nonobstetric surgeries, whereas Kothari <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] found the increased incidence of both hypotension and bradycardia in bupivacaine group than in bupivacaine with clonidine group. Bajwa <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] did not observe bradycardia by addition of clonidine even up to 45 &#x000b5;g in 9 mg of bupivacaine. Similar hemodynamic stability was observed by Biswas <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Agrawal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] while using 12.5 &#x000b5;g and 25 &#x000b5;g of intrathecal fentanyl. In our study, both the groups are similar regarding onset, peak, and duration of sensory and motor block, but the duration of analgesia is significantly higher in clonidine group than in fentanyl group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Sedation scores in our study were more in clonidine group than in fentanyl group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Similarly, in consistent with our study, Kothari <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] reported 35&#x02013;45% of patients drowsy by addition of 50 &#x000b5;g of clonidine to bupivacaine but Bajwa <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] did not report any sedation by addition of up to 45 &#x000b5;g of clonidine to bupivacaine. From the above observation, we can make out that the sedation with clonidine is dose dependent. In our study, we observe no sedation in fentanyl group and these findings are consistent with study conducted by Biswas <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Dahlgren <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Hunt <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Addition of 50 &#x000b5;g clonidine to intrathecal bupivacaine offers longer duration of postoperative analgesia than 25 &#x000b5;g of fentanyl but with higher sedation. Both the drugs offer similar surgical conditions and prolongs postoperative analgesia (clonidine more than fentanyl), so we suggest fentanyl as better choice when sedation is not desirable and clonidine is recommended where sedation is acceptable.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts
