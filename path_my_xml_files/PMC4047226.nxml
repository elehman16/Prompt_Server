balance. To confirm whether strengthening trunk muscles could facilitate rehabilitation of
stroke patients, we investigated the effectiveness of sling exercise therapy (SET) using
closed kinetic chain exercises to activate trunk muscles and improve balance in stroke
patients. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty stroke patients with chronic hemiplegia were
equally divided into 2 groups, a SET group and a control group that performed regular
exercises on a mat with the assistance of a table. Patients in both groups exercised for
30&#x02005;min, three times per week for 4 weeks. Trunk muscle activity was measured using surface
electromyography, whereas balance was measured using the Berg Balance Scale, Frailty and
Injuries Cooperative Studies of Intervention Technique, Timed Up &#x00026; Go test, and
BioRescue before and after the 4-week experimental period. [Results] Trunk muscle activity
and balance before and after intervention in both groups were significantly different.
However, no significant differences were observed between the 2 groups. [Conclusion]
Although SET was not more effective than regular exercise, significant improvement was
observed before and after SET. Therefore, SET can be considered effective in strengthening
trunk muscles in stroke patients with chronic hemiplegia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Chronic stroke patients</kwd><kwd>Sling exercise therapy</kwd><kwd>Trunk muscles</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is caused by apoptosis of brain cells due to cerebral infarction or hemorrhage<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Primary risk factors for stroke include
high blood pressure, diabetes, lack of physical activity, and alcohol consumption<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the main symptoms of stroke are
headache, difficulty in walking, seizures, impaired vision, and dysesthesia<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The prevalence of stroke is increasing with
the increase in the aged population, especially with the increase in the number of survivors
of cardiovascular disease<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In some European countries, this incidence is predicted to
increase until 2020<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Better management of
the disease has enabled long-term survival of stroke patients; however, the associated
increase in the number of patients, along with their families has resulted in an increase in
social and economic burdens<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The outcome of stroke patients with an asymmetric trunk posture is unsatisfactory<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Weakening of trunk flexor and extensor
muscles after stroke obstructs functional ability, safety, and balance<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Decreased exterior trunk muscle activity causes even more
left&#x02013;right asymmetry, leading to decreased quality of balance and walking<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recent studies on hemiplegic patients have focused on the problems
of walking and balance as well as related factors, particularly muscle strength, including
myologic parameters<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Problems related to balance in stroke patients are due to
a loss of muscle activation; thus, balance can be improved via improvement of muscle
activation<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, trunk muscle
activation is essential for restoring functional ability, safety, and balance in stroke
patients.</p><p>Several exercise methods have been proposed for trunk muscle activation, including sling
exercise therapy (SET). SET is expected to improve trunk muscle activation based on
performance of active exercises with the aid of sling exercise equipment. This exercise
method involves the use of a dangling rope and auxiliary equipment to improve physical
disabilities. It can be used in open and closed kinetic chain exercises including those for
diagnosis of muscle limitations through gradual weight bearing. SET aims at muscle
relaxation, increasing range of motion and traction, and stabilizing musculature as well as
sensorimotor exercises<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition,
this therapy is based on the neuromuscular activation (Neurac) principle via high-strength
static and dynamic contraction exercises<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Because of the loss of trunk flexibility and various related problems, retraining muscles
is particularly important in stroke patients. Despite this fact, there is a lack of research
on the usefulness of SET in such patients. Accordingly, this study investigated the
effectiveness of SET on activating trunk muscles and improving balance ability in stroke
patients based on the concept of closed kinetic chain exercises.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>This study involved 20 stroke inpatients at the M Convalescent Hospital in Suncheon,
Jeollanam-do, South Korea. Study participants were selected if they met the following
criteria: more than 24 months since diagnosis of stroke with chronic hemiplegia, Korean
mini-mental state examination score higher than 21, independent walking, ability to
communicate, and no neurologic disease besides stroke. All subjects voluntarily consented
to participate in this study prior to its initiation. Data were collected after obtaining
approval from the Institutional Review Board of Dongshin University.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>After the 20 participants passed the pretest, they were randomly allocated to either the

for 4 weeks. Interventions were discontinued if participants experienced any pain, and all
the exercise commands were given orally.</p><p>SET for strengthening trunk muscles comprised 3 types of exercises: bridge exercises in
the supine, prone, and lateral decubitus positions. In each exercise, the position was
maintained for 7&#x02005;s followed by 10&#x02005;s of relaxation; each set was repeated 10 times, and a
total of 3 sets were performed. The rest interval between sets was 60 s. At the beginning
of the intervention, an auxiliary elastic rope was used. However, after half the time had
elapsed, it was removed, and the weight load was increased.</p><p>Similar to the SET regimen, the regular exercise included 3 types of exercises&#x02014;bridge
exercises in the supine, prone, and lateral decubitus positions&#x02014;performed with the help of
an auxiliary table. The durations of maintaining the position and breaks were also the
same as those in for the SET group. Regular exercise was performed with the pelvis
elevated with the help of a wedge and roll.</p><p>Surface electromyography (EMG; Bagnoli EMG system; Delsys Inc., Boston, MA, USA) was used
to measure trunk muscle activity during the interventions. To minimize skin resistance,
impurities were eliminated from the areas where electrodes were placed. The recording
electrode for the straight abdominal muscles was placed 3&#x02005;cm from the outside of the
navel, that for the external oblique abdominal muscle was placed 15&#x02005;cm from the outside of
the navel, and that for the backbone erector was placed 2&#x02005;cm from the spinous process of
the first lumbar vertebra. To ensure precise placement of the electrodes during repeated
measurements, the areas of placement were marked. EMG signals were saved and analyzed by
calculating the root mean square (RMS) with the help of acquisition and analysis software
(Delsys Inc.).</p><p>To evaluate balance function, the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Frailty and Injuries
Cooperative Studies of Intervention Technique (FICSIT-4), Timed Up &#x00026; Go (TUG) test,
and BioRescue were used. The BBS is used to evaluate balance function in elderly persons
and adults with disabilities. This measurement instrument is strongly correlated with
walking speed. It has a maximum score of 56 points; scores less than 44 points indicate a
high risk of falling. The BBS comprises 14 tasks, including changing position from sitting
to standing, standing unsupported, sitting unsupported, transfers, standing with the eyes
closed, standing with the feet together, reaching forward while standing, retrieving
objects from the floor while standing, turning the trunk while standing (feet fixed),
turning 360&#x000b0;, stool stepping, tandem standing, and standing on one leg. To prevent falling
during measurement and to decrease mistakes, patients received information about the
postures prior to the test.</p><p>The FICSIT-4 is an instrument for assessing static balance ability. It has a maximum
score of 28 points and comprises the following 7 tasks: feet close together (eyes
open/closed), semi-tandem (eyes open/closed), full-tandem (eyes open/closed), and one-leg
standing. To prevent falls during measurement and to decrease mistakes, patients received
information about the postures prior to the test.</p><p>The TUG test is a dynamic balance test for quickly assessing balance problems in stroke
and elderly patients. On the command &#x0201c;go,&#x0201d; the participant is instructed to stand up from
a chair and walk 3&#x02005;m at the safest and most convenient speed. When the participant reaches
the 3-m point, he/she turns, walks back to the original location, and sits on the chair.
The total time is recorded with a stopwatch.</p><p>BioRescue (RM Ingenierie, France) measures the moving distance and speed of the
participant&#x02019;s center of gravity with weights placed on both legs. Screens are placed such
that the participant cannot see the instructor to prevent visual feedback. To decrease
errors related to changes in foot placement during repeated measurements, the feet are
placed consistently.</p><p>All values were calculated as mean &#x000b1; SD values. All statistical analyses were carried out
using SPSS version 18.0 for Windows. A test of normality was applied to the general
characteristics of the participants. To compare the results before and after therapy,
matched paired t-tests were used. To investigate differences between the 2 groups,
independent sample t-tests were used. The level of statistical significance for all data
was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>No significant difference was observed in trunk muscle (i.e., rectus abdominis, external

by using the BBS, FICSIT-4, TUG test, and BioRescue in order to investigate the
effectiveness of SET on trunk muscle activation and balance in chronic hemiplegic patients.
After 4 weeks of intervention, both groups exhibited a significant difference in trunk
muscle activation compared with that before the intervention. However, there was no
significant difference in trunk muscle activation between the groups.</p><p>Vasseljen<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, who studied the effects of
8 weeks of sling exercise in patients with lumbar pain, found no significant differences in
the thicknesses of the transverse abdominis, internal or external oblique, or lateral
transverse abdominis muscles of patients who underwent the intervention compared with the
muscles of those who performed regular exercises. Thus, the results of the present study are
comparable to those of previous studies, although structural changes in the muscle are not
always necessary for enhanced muscle strength, but rather reflect changes in a muscle&#x02019;s
electrical activity<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Some studies have demonstrated significant differences in improvement between sling and
regular exercise therapies. A study of patients with lumbar pain who used a sling for 4
weeks revealed a significant improvement in contraction power of the trunk extensor muscles
after sling therapy compared with that of patients who performed mat exercises<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, a cross-over study of trunk
stabilization training that used a sling showed significant differences in improvement
between groups with respect to contraction power of the rectus abdominis, external oblique,
and erector spinae<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> muscles.</p><p>The discrepancy between these studies may stem from differences in intervention time,
measurement tools, and/or measured items. First, studies in the literature confirm that
muscle activity measured using EMG, namely muscle contraction power, exhibits early changes
within several days after intervention due to neural adaptation<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, studies measuring maximum muscle contraction
power using EMG show significant differences in improvement between groups, even with a
shorter intervention time. On the other hand, previous studies also confirm that when
ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging is used, muscle hypertrophy
can be measured for in more than 10 weeks after intense strengthening exercises<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. This may explain why no significant
difference in trunk muscle thickness was observed between our groups after the intervention.
Because the outcomes of measurement differ depending on the intervention period when muscle
activity is measured, different measurement tools must be used for different intervention
periods. It is also advisable to simultaneously use tools that measure muscle thickness and
muscle activity.</p><p>This study also investigated the influence of SET on balance function. The results of the
BBS, FICSIT-4, TUG test, and BioRescue showed that both the SET and control groups exhibited
significant differences before and after intervention, though there was no significant
difference in improvement between the groups after intervention. In another study of
hemiplegic patients, the experimental group, which performed both regular exercises and
strengthening and trunk stabilization exercises with the use of a sling board, exhibited a
significant improvement in Mettler-Toledo International balance ability (MTD-balance)
compared with the control group, which performed only regular exercises<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the other hand, in a study of hemiplegic patients who
used SET, there was no significant difference in improvement between the experimental and
control (i.e., rehabilitation) groups with respect to balance ability (BBS, PASS)<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, it appears that differences in
results may stem from differences in intervention methods involving the use of sling
equipment. The balance ability of stroke patients is related to trunk intersegmental
movement<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>; therefore, significant
differences in improvement between groups after intervention must be due to the use of
intersegmental exercise. Correspondingly, when no intersegmental exercise is used, no
significant difference in improvement is observed between groups.</p><p>In this study, patients performed sling exercise therapy. The results indicate that
intervention methods should be changed based on the expected results. Furthermore, different
measurement tools are required depending on the intervention period. This study is limited
by the short intervention period and the small number of participants. Therefore, further
studies on the effects of SET using various measurement tools and sufficiently long
interventions are required.</p><p>Four weeks of sling exercise therapy in stroke patients provides no significant benefit in
muscle activation or balance ability compared with regular exercise. Although no difference
in improvement in trunk stability and balance was noted between patients belonging to the
control and sling exercise therapy group, significant differences in these parameters were
noted before and after sling exercise therapy. Therefore, sling exercise therapy can
strengthen trunk muscles in stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Sturm</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name><name><surname>Dewey</surname><given-names>HM</given-names></name><name><surname>Donnan</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Handicap after stroke: how does it relate to disability,
