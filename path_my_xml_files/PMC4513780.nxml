In addition, recurrent or secondary dental caries has been proven to be one of the most common complications following tooth restoration.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Many investigators have identified microleakage as the primary cause for recurrent or secondary dental caries, pulpal inflammation and necrosis.</p><p>Success in conservative dentistry depends on total removal of the infected dentin and achievement of a good seal; however, contemporary procedures for treating dental caries do not always eliminate all cariogenic microorganisms in prepared cavities. Other studies have shown that microorganisms left in the prepared cavity could survive for a long period of time and this problem may be magnified by microleakage of composite resin at margins not ending on enamel. To solve this problem, the use of an antimicrobial solution has been suggested.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Chlorhexidine solutions has been found to be effective in reducing levels of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> found in occlusal fissures and on exposed root surfaces. The authors of the current study suggest that the use of a 2% chlorhexidine solution to treat the cavity preparation prior to restoration placement could help to reduce residual caries and post-operative sensitivity. Its application does not impair the sealing ability and bond strength of adhesive materials, although, in specific situations, some studies showed an interference of chlorhexidine in adhesion.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>In theory, these self-etching systems simultaneously decalcify the inorganic component of dentin and infiltrate the collagen fibers at the same time through the action of acidic primers that minimize the potential for voids. The clinical procedure is less complicated and time-consuming, because there is no need for rinsing.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Different from etch-and-rinse adhesives, self-etch adhesives do not require a separate etching step, as they contain acidic monomers that simultaneously &#x02018;condition&#x02019; and &#x02018;prime&#x02019; the dental substrate. Consequently, this approach has been claimed to be user-friendlier (shorter application time, less steps) and less technique-sensitive (no wet-bonding, simple drying), thereby resulting in a reliable clinical performance, though this appeared very product-dependent.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>To provide resin-based materials with antibacterial activity, a new monomer, 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridiniumbromide (MDPB), has been developed. MDPB is a compound of an antibacterial agent quaternary ammonium with a methacryloyl group and it exhibits strong antibacterial activity against oral streptococci. The incorporation of MDPB has been reported to be effective in providing dentin bonding systems with antibacterial activity before and after curing.</p><p>The current study evaluated the influence 2% chlorhexidine gluconate, Clearfil Protect Bond (CPB) (which contains the antibacterial monomer 12-MDPB) on the microleakage of Class V composite restorations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>40 freshly-extracted caries-free human premolars were selected. The teeth were cleaned of calculus, soft tissue and other debris. They were then maintained in distilled water until testing. Standard Class V cavity preparations (mesiodistal width of 3 mm, occluso-gingival length of 2 mm and a depth of 2 mm) were prepared on the buccal and lingual surfaces using a high-speed handpiece with air-water spray and a diamond fissure bur. New burs were used after every four preparations. Each preparation was designed with the occlusal margin in enamel and the gingival margin in dentin. No bevels were placed.

After thermocycling, the apices of the teeth were sealed with sticky wax, and all tooth surfaces except a 1 mm wide zone around the margins of each restoration were sealed with nail polish.

Cavosurface margin of restorations, leak more which may lead to recurrent caries at the tooth restoration interface, post-operative sensitivity and pulpal pathosis.</p><p>The ability of a composite to minimize the extent of microleakage at the tooth/restoration interface is an important factor in predicting clinical success.</p><p>In the current study, basic fuchsin was used to detect leakage at the gingival and occlusal surface. Different methods have been employed to disclose microleakage around the restorations. Dye leakage is probably the most common method used. The principal advantages of this technique are its low cost and ease of application. Disadvantages include subjective evaluation of the results and low molecular weight of the dye, which is less than that of bacteria. Also, tests using dyes could sometimes detect leakage where bacteria could not penetrate.</p><p>Researchers have adopted several methods for estimation of dye leakage under <italic>in</italic>-<italic>vitro</italic> condition. The available <italic>in</italic>-<italic>vitro</italic> studies include the use of dyes, chemical tracers, radioactive isotopes, air pressure, bacteria, neutron activation analysis, scanning electron microscopy, artificial caries techniques and electrical conductivity.</p><p>The use of organic dye as tracers is one of the oldest and most common methods of detecting leakage <italic>in</italic>-<italic>vitro</italic>. The review of published literature demonstrates that there have been wide variations in choice of dye used either as solutions or particle suspension of different particle size. The concentration of dyes used also ranges between 0.5% and 10% while the time of immersion of specimen in dye varied between 4 h and 72 h or more.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Christen and Mitchell (1966) found that different concentration of dyes can vary in penetration time between 5 min and over 1 h. Most researchers have used 0.5% basic fuchsin as a standard dye in all <italic>in</italic>-<italic>vitro</italic> leakage studies.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>In the present study, we have utilized 0.5% basic fuchsin and the time of immersion of specimen in the dye was 24 h. This included three experimental groups and one control group. In all the three experimental groups self-etching primers were used as preliminary step while in Group II 2% chlorhexidine gluconate was used before application of the self-etching primer. However in Group III CPB which is supposed to have antiseptic properties was utilized, while in the control group however conventional self-etching primer was used. Filtek Z350 composite resin was utilized according to the manufacturer's instructions for the restoration of the cavities in all the groups.</p><p>Results of the present study indicated that the scores of microleakage of the four groups at the enamel margin when compared, there was no statistical significant difference found (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>The lowest mean microleakage values at the enamel margin were obtained from Group II when 2% chlorhexidine gluconate was used as a coating.</p><p>The highest mean microleakage was obtained from Group III at enamel margin where CPB was used and Group IV the control group.</p><p>When the scores at gingival margin of four groups were compared there was no statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>However the lowest mean values at gingival margin were obtained from Group I (clearfil SE bond) followed by Group II (clearfil SE bond + 2% chlorhexidine gluconate).</p><p>The highest mean value were obtained at gingival margin from Group III (CPB) and Group IV (control).</p><p>When comparing the enamel and gingival margin in the entire three experimental groups, microleakage was higher in the gingival margin compared to the enamel margin. However there was no statistical significant difference between the groups.</p><p>Alani and Toh (1997) observed that dentin permeability is also an important factor to be considered.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>In the present study both enamel and gingival margin were studied for microleakage and found to be higher in the gingival margin when compared to enamel margin.</p><p>Shafie <italic>et al</italic>. (2010)<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> observed that chlorhexidine gluconate 2% is a well-known disinfectant and has antimicrobial effect when applied prior to placing a restoration. 2% chlorhexidine gluconate functions as a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor apart from its antibacterial property, which may also prevent collagen degradation and disintegration of the bonding interface over a period of time.</p><p>Siso <italic>et al</italic>. (2009) observed in their studies on microleakage in resin composite restorations that the most critical factor affecting the microleakage of resin composite is the polymerization shrinkage. The forces generated by polymerization shrinkage exceeded the bond strength especially in the gingival margin. Polymerization shrinkage in this area is not compensated for by acid etching and the application of dentin adhesive.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Clearfil SE bond is one of the first self-etching primer in the market and belong to the mild group of self-etch adhesive with a hydrogen ion concentration very close to two Clearfil SE bond contains functional monomer 10-methacryloxyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (10-MDP), which has two hydroxyl groups that also may bind to calcium. Moreover, 10-MDP causes minimal dissolution of smear plugs and the limited opening of the tubules, thus reducing dentin permeability. The functional monomer 10-MDP also facilitates penetration, impregnation, polymerization and the entanglement of monomers with demineralized dentin to form a relatively thick hybrid layer.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Others have reported that MDP tightly adheres to hydroxyapatite and that its calcium salt hardly dissolved in water.</p><p>Same mean microleakage values were obtained with application of 2% chlorhexidine gluconate as a pre application. With the CPB application almost similar microleakage values were obtained without application of 2% chlorhexidine gluconate and there were no statistical significant difference in leakage values among the experimental group. In the control group Xeno III also similar results were obtained without the application of 2% chlorhexidine gluconate on the dentin margin. Xeno III is again a self etching primer with a two bottle system used as a control.</p><p>CM Esteves <italic>et al</italic> (2010)<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, evaluated the antibacterial properties of some self etching/primer solutions against oral streptococci. They concluded that the self etching adhesives or self etching primers used in the current study demonstrated different levels of inhibition for oral streptococci tested. Clearfil Protect Bond self etching primer exhibited the most effective antibacterial activity against oral streptococci.</p><p>CPB is a two-step self etch adhesive system composed of a self etching primer containing the antibacterial monomer 12- MDPB and a fluoride releasing adhesive. The antibacterial monomer 12- MDPB is a polymerizable biocide and has a strong bactericidal activity against oral bacteria. Although CPB is derived from clearfil SE bond with modifications in the components mean microleakage values were higher than clearfil SE bond in the current study. This is in agreement with the studies of Siso <italic>et al</italic>. (2009)<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> however, no statistical difference in microleakage were found among all the groups in gingival surface and when the scores of microleakage at the occlusal surface position of the four groups were compared.</p><p>CPB contains crystal-like structures, and these are likely to the NaF crystals. Although the filled adhesive resins have been said to have greater mechanical properties, differences in the filler content and composition of the adhesive may account for variations between them. The non-uniform distribution of the nanometer-sized fillers observed may contribute to a relatively poor mechanical property in some regions.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Hence, microleakage values could be higher than clearfil SE bond in the current study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Results of the study indicated that the score of microleakage of the four groups at the enamel margin and gingival margin when compared did not have statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>Under the conditions of this <italic>in</italic>-<italic>vitro</italic> study the following assessments were made:</p><p>
