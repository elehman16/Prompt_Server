The condition is surrounded by taboo; it can have a devastating impact on quality of life and lead to major limitations in daily life. Pelvic floor muscle training in combination with information and fibre supplements is recommended as first-line treatment for faecal incontinence. Despite this, the effect of pelvic floor muscle training for faecal incontinence is unclear. No previous trials have investigated the efficacy of supervised pelvic floor muscle training in combination with conservative treatment and compared this to an attention-control massage treatment including conservative treatment.

Secondary outcomes are the Vaizey Incontinence Score, the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index, the Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life Scale, a 14-day bowel diary, anorectal manometry and rectal capacity measurements.

The recommended first-line treatment consists of a multi-modal approach including: information, fibre supplements, antidiarrhoeal medication, laxatives, pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and biofeedback training <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. PFMT is defined as &#x02018;systematic training with repeated voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles and the external anal sphincter with the purpose of increasing muscle strength, speed, endurance and/or coordination&#x02019; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In most trials, PFMT is supplemented with biofeedback training in form of &#x02018;strength training&#x02019; and/or &#x02018;rectal sensitivity training&#x02019; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p id="p0020">A recent systematic Cochrane review <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> included 20 randomised controlled trials to investigate the efficacy of PFMT and/or biofeedback training for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adults. With the exception of two trials that evaluated PFMT and biofeedback training in conjunction with an operation, the included trials compared different training modalities and thus lacked a non-training comparator <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This limits the ability to conclude on the &#x02018;true&#x02019; efficacy of PFMT and biofeedback training. Due to risk of bias, intervention heterogeneity and the use of different comparators, the authors of the Cochrane review concluded that the role of PFMT and biofeedback training for treatment of faecal incontinence is unclear <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Two trials published after the Cochrane review <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> evaluated the effect of PFMT and biofeedback training compared to a group not receiving PFMT. However, neither trial controlled for the possible placebo effect associated with the attention given by the health care professional delivering the training interventions <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. To evaluate the efficacy of PFMT, there is a need for a trial that uses an attention-control treatment, which is biologically ineffective, but controls for the placebo effect associated with the attention given by the health care professional delivering the PFMT. To our knowledge, no previous trials have investigated the efficacy of supervised PFMT in combination with conservative treatment and compared this to an attention-control massage treatment in addition to conservative treatment.</p><p id="p0025">The aim of the current trial is to investigate if supervised PFMT in combination with conservative treatment (mainly information) is superior to attention-control massage-treatment in combination with the same conservative treatment in patients with faecal incontinence. This possible superiority effect is based on the primary outcome of changes in faecal incontinence symptoms after 16 weeks of treatment using The Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale (PGI-I). The aim of this paper is to describe the rationale, the methods, and in particular the statistical analysis plan of this trial, so that this information is made public.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Design of the trial</title><p id="p0030">The trial is a prospective, outcome assessor-blinded, randomised, controlled, superiority trial with two parallel arms. Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline (before treatment start) and after 16 weeks of treatment (end of treatment period, primary endpoint) and at a long-term follow-up 36 months after completing the treatments. From January 1, 2016, 98 participants are randomised into two groups (supervised PFMT and attention-control massage treatment) by simple randomisation, using a ratio of 1:1. Data for the primary analysis (baseline plus the 16-week outcome assessment) will be collected from October 24, 2012 until June 17, 2016. Data for the 36-months follow-up will be collected until June 2019. Currently, no analyses have been performed and treatment group allocation remains blinded. This protocol and statistical analysis plan is reported in accordance with the SPIRIT 2013 Statement: Standard Protocol items: Recommendation for Interventional Trials <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> (See the completed SPIRIT checklist attached as Additional file 1).

Between October 15, 2012 and December 15, 2015, consecutive patients referred for examination and treatment of faecal incontinence at the Department of Surgical and Medical Gastroenterology will be assessed for eligibility. We aim to include 100 participants, based on estimations described in the &#x02018;sample size&#x02019; section. At the first visit with a specialised nurse, eligible patients will be briefly informed about the trial. Patients interested in the trial will be invited to a second visit at the Department of Physiotherapy- and Occupational Therapy where they will receive thorough verbal and written information about the trial.

The supervised PFMT will be given by one of two physiotherapists specialised in faecal incontinence and pelvic floor disorders. Both of them have over 10 years of experience in treating pelvic floor disorders. At the first visit, the participants receive information about the anatomy and function of the pelvic floor muscles by the use of images and a model of the pelvis. They receive verbal instructions on how to perform a correct pelvic floor muscle contraction and correct contractions will also be taught by digital vaginal and rectal examination. In each session, the participants receive an examination of the function of their pelvic floor muscles by a digital vaginal and rectal examination. The pelvic floor muscles and the external anal sphincter strength will be assessed according to the Modified Oxford Score (ranging 0&#x02013;5) and endurance of a submaximal contraction will be determined <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The function of the pelvic floor muscles will be assessed with intra-anal electromyography (EMG)-biofeedback using the U-control EMG-trainer and an anal probe from Thought Technology Ltd, Canada. This &#x02018;strength biofeedback training&#x02019; will be used to give the participants visual and auditory feedback on a contraction in order to enhance the awareness, strength and endurance of a correct pelvic floor muscle contraction <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The biofeedback assessment will be conducted with the participant in a lying position and, from the second visit, with the participant in a lying, sitting and standing position. Static and dynamic endurance will be determined in all positions, as will the ability to perform a pelvic floor muscle contraction before and during coughing, transfers, lifting and walking. According to the findings from the physiotherapeutic examination, a home training program is prepared. The training program will be individually adapted according to the abilities of each participant. Participants will be instructed in submaximal contractions and relaxation of the muscles between contractions. Submaximal contractions are chosen to ensure a correct pelvic floor muscle contraction where participants are able to breathe freely and avoid activation of muscle synergists like the gluteal, thigh or abdominal muscles. The training program consists of three sets of 10 pelvic floor muscles contractions sustained for up to 10&#x000a0;s and two sets of three contractions sustained for up to 30&#x000a0;s. Participants will be instructed in a 1-min rest between each set and between each of the 30&#x000a0;s contractions. Participants with low muscular endurance will be instructed to hold the contractions according to the findings from the physiotherapeutic examination. For example, a participant with low muscular endurance could be instructed to perform six sets of five contractions sustained for 5&#x000a0;s and then increase the duration and number of the contractions in each set until he/she is able to perform the described program. Participants who experience difficulties in performing a correct pelvic floor muscle contraction will be instructed to check their contraction by palpation at the anus and/or perineum when training at home in order to achieve a correct contraction. The participants will be encouraged to perform the training program at home on a daily basis. They will also be taught to contract the pelvic floor muscles in response to faecal urgency and in situations with increased abdominal pressure. Participants will receive written training materials with explanations and illustrations along with the verbally and digitally provided instructions (See <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref> for the illustrations explaining a correct pelvic floor muscle contraction and Additional file 2 for the training materials).<fig id="fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Illustrations from the written training materials illustrating a correct pelvic floor muscle contraction for a) women and b) men.

The training diary is used as a motivational tool and to quantify training adherence. At each follow-up visit, the training diary will be evaluated and any problems will be discussed with the physiotherapist. To achieve overload of the pelvic floor muscles, the training program will be progressed at each follow-up visit based on the findings from the examination. As the participants make progress they will be instructed to perform the exercises in different body positions such as sitting, bending forward and standing and during movements such as transfers, lifting, walking and coughing.

Baseline data consists of: demographic background information, a medical history with emphasis on the history of faecal incontinence and known risk factors for faecal incontinence and for the women an obstetric history. The participants fill out validated questionnaires measuring severity of faecal incontinence and condition-specific quality of life: The Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI), the Vaizey Incontinence Score and the Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life Scale (FIQL) (See Outcome measures below). If the participants should have any clarifying questions in relation to filling out the questionnaires, they are allowed to ask the primary investigator. After 2&#x02013;4 weeks, the participants return to the Department of Surgical and Medical Gastroenterology. A research nurse blinded to group allocation collects the 14-day bowel dairy and conducts an anorectal manometry and rectal capacity measurements. The participants then go to a secretary in the Department of Physiotherapy- and Occupational Therapy who will perform the randomisation of the participants.(For trial flow, see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.7"><label>2.7</label><title>Outcome measures</title><p id="p0100">Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline before randomisation, within 14 days after completion of the 16-week PFMT treatment or attention-control massage treatments (primary endpoint) and at follow-up 36 months after completing the treatments (still ongoing) using both patient-reported outcomes and objective outcomes.

id="p0105">The Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale (PGI-I) <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> is used as the primary efficacy outcome measure. The scale is validated to measure subjective treatment effect in relation to urinary incontinence <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and pelvic organ prolapse <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The scale is a self-rated assessment of changes in incontinence symptoms after treatment. The participants are asked to compare their faecal incontinence symptoms before and after the 16 weeks of treatment and to rate the degree of changes in their symptoms. On a seven-point Likert scale, they indicate if their incontinence symptoms after the 16 weeks of treatment are: very much better, much better, a little better, unchanged, a little worse, much worse or very much worse compared to the period prior to the trial <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. This scale is chosen since faecal incontinence is a symptom primarily affecting quality of life. On this basis, it is argued that treatment efficacy in people with faecal incontinence is best measured by the person's subjective impression of symptoms (e.g. PGI-I) and by measures of condition-specific quality of life <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.7.2"><label>2.7.2</label><title>Secondary outcomes</title><sec id="sec2.7.2.1"><label>2.7.2.1</label><title>The following outcome measures are the secondary outcomes</title><p id="p0110">Vaizey Incontinence Score: This is a validated summary scale measuring severity of faecal incontinence, ranging from 0 &#x02013; 24, 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;complete continence, 24&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;complete incontinence <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The scale distinguishes between incontinence for flatus, thin and formed stool. Participants rate the frequency of each incontinence item in five categories with frequencies ranging from less than once monthly to daily. The presence of faecal urgency, use of pads and medication and changes in life style in relation to faecal incontinence is also registered <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p id="p0115">Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI): FISI is a validated severity scale for faecal incontinence ranging from 0 &#x02013; 61, 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;complete continence, 61&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;complete incontinence <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The scale distinguishes between incontinence for gas, mucus, liquid and solid stool. Participants rate the frequency of each incontinence item in six categories. Frequencies range from one to three times per month to two or more times per day. Values for all categories are summed. The values are weighted and reflect patients' subjective impression of severity.

The Scale consists of 29 questions divided into four sub-scales: Lifestyle, Coping/behaviour, Depression/self-perception and Embarrassment <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.

In this trial, we use the Danish versions of the questionnaires that are generally used in Denmark, which have only been linguistically validated.</p><p id="p0130">Bowel diary: The participants fill out a paper bowel dairy for 14 days where they report the number of stools, episodes of faecal urgency, soiling and incontinence as well as the use of pads and laxatives. Limitations in daily life due to faecal incontinence are also reported. The participants are instructed to fill out the diary at the end of the day or to use real time assessment during the day by their own choice <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p id="p0135">Anorectal manometry and rectal capacity measurements: A specialised nurse (ID) will conduct anorectal manometry and rectal capacity measurements. She has over 10 years of experience in conducting these investigations. All measurements are recorded with the physiologic recorder Polygraf ID from Medtronic, Denmark using the Polygram NET software, Medtronic, Denmark. Anorectal manometry is performed to measure anal sphincter pressures to get an objective evaluation of the function of the pelvic floor muscles and rectum capacity. By this, objective changes after the treatments can be documented <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The investigation is conducted by the water perfused catheter technique using a single-use anorectal 8ch catheter from Sandhill, USA. With the participant lying in the left lateral position and hip flexed to 90&#x000b0;, a balloon catheter is inserted into the rectum. Resting pressure and maximum squeeze increment pressure is determined. Both measures are recorded in the high pressure zone using the pull through technique <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Rectal capacity measurements of the rectum are performed by the use of a single-use 4ch catheter from Sandhill, USA. The catheter is inserted into the rectum and then slowly inflated with air. Sensory threshold is determined as the minimum volume of filling where a rectal sensation is perceived. Urge sensation is determined as the volume associated with the initial urge to defecate and maximum tolerated volume is determined as the volume where the participants feel a strong desire to defecate and feel pain or discomfort.</p><p id="p0140">3D Endoanal ultrasound and gynaecological and rectal examination: An experienced colon and rectal surgeon (MS) conducts a gynaecological and rectal examination. To detect internal and/or external anal sphincter defects, the examination is supplemented by endoanal ultrasonography. The investigation is conducted with the ultrasound system Flex Focus 500 from BK Medical, Denmark using the anorectal 3D transducer 2052, 13&#x000a0;MHz from BK Medical, Denmark. The system provides a three-dimensional image of the sphincter complex and the puborectal muscle. With the participant lying in the supine position, the probe is inserted into the anal canal just above the level of the puborectal muscle. The different components of the anal sphincter complex and the puborectal muscle are visualised and a 360-degree image is created. Sphincter defects in the internal and/or external sphincter are defined as a gap in the muscle ring or a loss of muscle substance in a range of more than 60&#x000b0;. The extension of sphincter defect is measured in degrees.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.7.3"><label>2.7.3</label><title>Minimizing missing data</title><p id="p0145">To minimise missing data for the primary endpoint, all participants will be reminded about the 16-week assessment visit (primary endpoint) by a telephone call from the primary investigator 14 days before the visit. At the same time, the participants will be encouraged to begin filling out the bowel diary.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.7.4"><label>2.7.4</label><title>Deviations from the trial protocol and trial registration</title><p id="p0150">Initially, a 12-month follow-up was planned and described in the trial registry. For logistical reasons, however, we failed to perform the 12-month follow-up for the first 15 participants. Because of this, we decided to change the 12-month follow-up to 36 months. This will enable us to perform a long-term outcome assessment for all included participants. This change does not affect the pre-specified primary endpoint, that is, the participants' rating of changes in their incontinence symptoms after 16 weeks of treatment measured by the PGI-I. To achieve as high response rate as possible, we decided to restrict the 36-month follow-up measurement to the PGI-I, the Vaizey Incontinence Score, the FISI and the FIQL. Additional questions about further treatment for faecal incontinence since completion of the trial will be added to the 36-months follow-up assessment, as will questions about the current amount of PFMT. The follow-up questionnaire will be handled by post. Reminders will be sent to non-responders after 4 weeks, and followed up with telephone calls.</p><p id="p0155">Originally, it was planned to measure maximum squeeze duration as a part of the anorectal manometry investigation. Maximum squeeze duration is defined as the time the participants could hold a squeeze from maximum increment squeeze pressure to a drop of 50% of maximum increment squeeze pressure. The maximum squeeze duration was measured three times with a stationary probe for up to a maximum of 30&#x000a0;s. The participants had 1&#x000a0;min's rest between each of the three trials. It was planned to determine maximum squeeze duration as the average of these three trials. As a part of the ongoing data quality check during the data collection it became clear that it was difficult to determine the time duration of a maximum squeeze with the stationary probe. Therefore, it was decided to not use the data for maximum squeeze duration in further analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.8"><label>2.8</label><title>Sample size</title><p id="p0160">The sample size is calculated in relation to the PGI-I (primary outcome).

To create a full analysis data set, missing data for the primary outcome will be imputed with a score of &#x02018;unchanged&#x02019; in both groups. The primary analysis will be carried out using logistic regression with PGI-I scores as the dependent variable. The PGI-I outcomes will be dichotomised into symptoms improvement (PGI-I scores of &#x02018;very much better&#x02019;, &#x02018;much better&#x02019; or a &#x02018;little better&#x02019;) or unchanged/worsening symptoms (PGI-I scores of &#x02018;unchanged&#x02019;, &#x02018;a little worse&#x02019;, &#x02018;much worse&#x02019; or &#x02018;very much worse&#x02019;).

As paper diaries are prone to low compliance and missing data <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis in case of missing data exceeds 10% for the bowel diaries or the missing data appear not to be missing at random. In this analysis, missing values will be imputed using multiple imputation for variables where missing values are jugded to be missing at random (no specific pattern in the missing data). But at the same time, for variables where missing values are judged not to be missing at random (data are generally missing for a specific items unless that specific item is scored positively) missing values will be replaced with a score of zero for numeric questions and a negative answer for yes/no questions.</p><p id="p0235">All estimates of treatment effect will be presented as mean differences in change between groups with 95% confidence intervals. All regression models will be controlled for goodness-of-fit by evaluation of whether the data meet the assumptions of linearity, normal distribution and variance homogeneity.

No interim analysis or stopping guidelines will be applied to the trial. All physiotherapists and outcome assessors are instructed to report any adverse events during the trial to the primary investigator via weekly conferences that allow discussion of the conduct of the trial and any adverse events. All adverse events will be reported annually to the Health Research Ethics Committee and all serious adverse events will be reported immediately. Since the trial is not investigating clinical products or drugs, the trial is not covered by the Good Clinical Practice regulations. Therefore, no regulatory auditing of the trial is prescribed by law. The trial can be subject to unannounced audits by the local regional Health Research Ethics Committee or Danish Data Protection Agency.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0255">This trial will show whether supervised PFMT in combination with conservative treatment is superior to attention-control massage treatment and conservative treatment in patients with faecal incontinence. This will be based on changes in faecal incontinence symptoms after 16 weeks of treatment using the PGI-I. The efficacy of PFMT and biofeedback training for faecal incontinence is unclear. Previous trials have lacked an attention-control group in the form of a non-training comparator. This trial adds an attention-control group receiving the same number of visits and approximately the same amount of attention as the PFMT group. We consider the attention-control massage treatment to represent an inactive control treatment, since it has been shown not to improve urinary incontinence <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> which shares many of the known risk factors for faecal incontinence. Adding this attention-control group will enable us to evaluate the true efficacy of supervised PFMT controlled for the placebo effect associated with attention given by the healthcare professional. This knowledge will help to clarify the role of pelvic floor muscle training for faecal incontinence and permit evidence-based recommendations about PFMT as a part of the first-line treatment for faecal incontinence.</p><p id="p0260">In this trial, we have chosen the individualised, supervised approach to PFMT, including palpation of a correct contraction. This is because, it is shown that up to 40% of women with pelvic floor disorders fail to achieve a correct pelvic floor muscle contraction after written or verbal instructions alone <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. This fact, along with individualised progression of the PFMT, can be challenging in a group setting.</p><p id="p0265">It can be difficult to blind participants and health care providers when examining a physiotherapeutic intervention. In this trial, instead we seek to blind the participants to the trial hypothesis. The participants are thus not informed, neither verbally nor in writing, that we expect the supervised PFMT to be more efficient than the attention-control massage treatment. It is decided not to ask the attention-control group to refrain from performing PFMT on their own. Attempts to restrict the attention-control group from performing PFMT can reveal the study hypothesis and at the same time it is not possible to control whether the participants in the attention-control group actually refrain from performing PFMT.</p><p id="p0270">The optimal patient-reported outcome for evaluating treatment efficacy for faecal incontinence is debated <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. In this trial, the PGI-I is chosen as the primary outcome. This is because it is recommended to measure treatment efficacy by eliciting the person's subjective impression of symptoms after treatment <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Other trials have used the Vaizey Incontinence Score as their primary outcome. We decided not to do so because the Vaizey Incontinence Score is shown to contain items insensitive to treatment effect <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> and has been criticised for mixing measurement of severity, social impact and coping strategies <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p><p id="p0275">In the absence of an optimal patient-reported outcome for measuring faecal incontinence, we decided to include the three secondary patient-reported outcomes: the Vaizey Incontinence Score, the FISI and the FIQL, all of which we consider to be supportive of the primary outcome. This is in line with the recommendations of including both severity measures, subjective rating of improvements and condition-specific quality of life measures when evaluating treatment efficacy in faecal incontinence <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. It is a weakness that the Danish versions of the PGI-I, the Vaizey Incontinence Score, the FISI and the FIQL used in this trial are not comprehensively validated in a Danish population, but only linguistically validated. The questionnaires are all comprehensively validated in their original language. It is unfortunately beyond the scope of this trial to validate the Danish language versions of these patient-reported outcomes before conducting the trial. Instead, we use the Danish versions that are generally used in Denmark.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Trial status</title><p id="p0280">To date, we have enrolled 102 participants in the trial and have completed the baseline and 16-week assessment (primary endpoint).
