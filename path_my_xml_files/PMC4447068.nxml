Some models of tinnitus pathophysiology suggest that networks associated with attention, memory, distress and multisensory experience are involved in tinnitus perception. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a multisensory attention training paradigm which used audio, visual, and somatosensory stimulation would reduce tinnitus. Eighteen participants with predominantly unilateral chronic tinnitus were randomized between two groups receiving 20 daily sessions of either integration (attempting to reduce salience to tinnitus by binding with multisensory stimuli) or attention diversion (multisensory stimuli opposite side to tinnitus) training. The training resulted in small but statistically significant reductions in Tinnitus Functional Index and Tinnitus Severity Numeric Scale scores and improved attentional abilities. No statistically significant improvements in tinnitus were found between the training groups. This study demonstrated that a short period of multisensory attention training reduced unilateral tinnitus, but directing attention toward or away from the tinnitus side did not differentiate this effect.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Tinnitus is the conscious awareness of sound without an external driving sound. It is believed to arise from an injury to the peripheral auditory system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> resulting in deafferentation; the lack of normal sensory input is thought to trigger a cascade of neuroplastic changes within the subcortical and cortical auditory pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. There is often little direct relationship between the subjectively reported severity of tinnitus and the psychoacoustic matches such as loudness and sensation level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> suggesting the involvement of processes related to attention, emotion, and memory in tinnitus pathophysiology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Support for this assumption is the observation showing that unilateral tinnitus is associated with a marked attention shift towards the tinnitus ear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Participants with a unilateral tinnitus were able to detect target sounds more accurately in the tinnitus ear than the opposite ear but this did not occur in a simulated tinnitus group<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Further support comes from functional imaging studies. Although the evidence is not univocal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> and many of the methods used are still under development, the majority of recent studies using electroencephalography (EEG)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, and positron emission tomography (PET) scans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> have shown altered brain connectivity in tinnitus patients. As an example, Vanneste <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. showed increased EEG gamma connectivity between the left auditory cortex, left insula, left parahippocampus, and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex arguing that these connections may be linked to maintaining consciousness and the enduring attention towards the tinnitus sound. PET in tinnitus patients has revealed increased resting state activity in limbic, frontal and parietal regions and a positive correlation between tinnitus duration and the activity in the right inferior frontal, right ventro-medial prefrontal, and the right posterior cingulate cortices<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p>Multisensory interactions appear to be a ubiquitous property of information processing within the central nervous system. The evidence comes both from behavioural and physiological studies as well as well-known phenomena such as the McGurk effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. For example, an irrelevant auditory cue can modulate the response to a visual target<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and vice versa<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Similarly, irrelevant auditory or visual cues can affect reaction times for tactile targets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. These behavioural data are supported by several neuroimaging and neuroanatomical studies that have identified a convergence of inputs from multiple senses at several cortical and subcortical loci<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> including the auditory cortex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. There is evidence indicating involvement of multisensory interactions in tinnitus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Animal noise studies showed increased bimodal interaction at the dorsal cochlear nucleus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. In humans, various somatosensory manipulations, in particular around the head region, may evoke tinnitus or alter its psychoacoustic characteristics such as pitch and/or loudness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. For example, jaw movements may elicit an increase in tinnitus loudness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> that is associated with increased activation of the auditory brain areas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Another intriguing, although rare, example is a form of tinnitus that can be modulated upon peripheral eye gaze<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. These changes in tinnitus perception have been associated with reduced inhibition and increased activity within the central auditory system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. However, at least one study suggests that multisensory training (learning to play music) has less effect than unisensory training (listening music) in a notched music paradigm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p><p>The proposed involvement of attention and multisensory connection in tinnitus may be related to auditory scene analysis; a process in which the auditory system identifies and differentiates auditory objects and segregates relevant information from background noise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. It has been suggested that auditory scene analysis involves assigning different sound features to a source which is, under normal circumstances, represented by a physical object. Relevant sounds are attended to while irrelevant sounds become habituated. Tinnitus is unusual because, in addition to the strong emotional response it elicits, it does not have a localizable external source and therefore violates the rules of auditory scene analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. This may result in attentional resources being directed towards the tinnitus sound in order to validate its ecological relevance and purpose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> which prevents habituation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. A potential dissociation between auditory cortex and visual cortex in tinnitus patients has also recently been demonstrated in MRI, raising further questions to the role of sensory integration and tinnitus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p><p>Considering the research described, an intervention targeting attention and the multisensory interactions may represent a promising tool for the treatment of tinnitus. Furthermore, it has been shown that results of multisensory perceptual learning are superior to unisensory training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Here, we introduce a novel approach to tinnitus treatment which involves combining attention training with multisensory (auditory, visual and somatosensory) stimulation. We hypothesize that multisensory attentional training will reduce tinnitus within multiple tinnitus severity domains as measured with the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Two possible approaches emerge in light of the proposed role of auditory scene analysis in the pathophysiology of tinnitus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Multisensory stimulation could be used to divert attention away from tinnitus (an <italic>attention diversion approach</italic>) to reduce its salience, or to integrate the sound of tinnitus with other sensory modalities (an <italic>integration approach</italic>). Integration of the tinnitus sound with other senses could provide a &#x0201c;source&#x0201d; for the tinnitus, possibly allowing for habituation. Putatively, both approaches have the potential to relieve the attentional load towards tinnitus and reduce subjective tinnitus annoyance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to assess whether multisensory attention training would reduce the impact of tinnitus (as measured by the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> on participants. Secondary aims were to examine the effect of the multisensory training on attentional abilities and whether attention training type (diversion or integration) had a differential effect on tinnitus.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Participants</title><p>Eighteen participants (7 females, 11 males, mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;59.1 years &#x000b1; 9.6&#x02009;SD) were recruited from the Tinnitus database at The University of Auckland (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). All participants had constant, subjective, predominantly unilateral tinnitus without any active external or middle ear pathology. They had no worse than 80&#x02009;dB sensorineural hearing loss, and had normal or corrected-to-normal near vision (binocular visual acuity at 40&#x02009;cm not worse than 0.3 logMAR). Participant&#x02019;s eligibility was assessed at an initial audiological examination consisting of otoscopy, audiometry, a subjective computer-based tinnitus assessment, and the TFI questionnaire. The detailed methodology of the audiometry examination and tinnitus assessment are described in supplementary methods. The sample size to detect the 13 point difference in TFI was estimated considering previous TFI data from our laboratory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and assuming the power of 0.8. All procedures were in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the Health and Disability Ethics Committees (HDECs), New Zealand. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to data collection.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Multisensory attention training</title><p>The multisensory training relied on repeated completion of a simple visual task that was combined with auditory and tactile stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). At the beginning of each trial, participants were presented with three horizontally aligned white dots on a black background. Participants fixated on the centre dot which changed from a dot to a diamond or a square to indicate that a saccadic eye movement should be made to the left or right target dot. For half of the participants, the diamond signalled a leftward saccade and the square a rightward saccade across all sessions. This was reversed for the other half of the participants. In addition, participants were required to press a key on the left or right of a computer keyboard (one of the two Ctrl keys) which corresponded to the direction of their saccade. Participants were encouraged to achieve the best possible reaction time. One second after the centre dot changed shape, the target dots became hollow indicating that the participant should return their fixation to the centre dot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Participants were encouraged to perform this task as accurately and quickly as possible. Simultaneously with the central cue (a diamond or square), an additional, lateralized visual cue was provided whereby the relevant target dot was flashed. This was accompanied by simultaneous, lateralized auditory and tactile cues. The auditory stimulus was a monaural pure tone presented for 120&#x02009;ms. The tone&#x02019;s pitch was measured and adjusted (&#x0201c;calibrated&#x0201d;) on a day-to-day basis to match the subjective tinnitus pitch. The tactile stimulus comprised of a brief vibration (120&#x02009;ms) delivered to the participant&#x02019;s temple. Each trial lasted approximately 2000&#x02009;ms, depending on each participant&#x02019;s reaction time, and an inter-trial interval of 1000&#x02009;ms was jittered by &#x000b1; up to 500&#x02009;ms.</p><p>Participants were assigned to one of two experimental groups, the <italic>integration group</italic> and the <italic>attention diversion group</italic>. In the integration group, all three lateralized stimuli (auditory, visual and tactile) were presented when the central cue indicated a saccade towards the tinnitus side. No cues were presented when the central cue indicated a saccade towards the non-tinnitus side. This mapping was reversed for the diversion group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). The two groups were matched for age (independent sample <italic>t</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.19, <italic>p</italic> &#x02009;=&#x02009;0.85), tinnitus duration (<italic>t&#x02009;</italic>=&#x02009;0.37, <italic>p&#x02009;</italic>=&#x02009;0.72), baseline TFI score (<italic>t&#x02009;</italic>=&#x02009;0.285, <italic>p&#x02009;</italic>=&#x02009;0.77), gender (Pearson <italic>&#x003a7;</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.234, <italic>p&#x02009;</italic>=&#x02009;0.63), and central cue directionality (diamond means to look left vs. diamond means to look right).</p><p>The treatment consisted of 20 unsupervised daily sessions (approximately 20 &#x02013; 30&#x02009;minutes per session) completed by the participant at home. In each session participants completed 160 trials with equal numbers of left- and right-oriented trials divided into four blocks. To increase the motivation, the average reaction time was presented after each block of 40 trials. Prior to each daily session, participants performed a rapid computer based self-assessment of their tinnitus using a custom software utility within the training program. These data were used to track the effect of treatment on tinnitus perception and adjust the auditory stimulus in pitch and loudness for the training session (see below for more details).</p><p>The training software was programmed using Psychtoolbox (version 3.0.10)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> for Matlab R2012b (MathWorks) and delivered using Dell Latitude E6400 laptops (2.26&#x02009;GHz, 4&#x02009;GB RAM). Auditory stimuli were presented via calibrated MB770G/B Apple earbuds. Tactile stimulation was delivered via Arduino LilyPads (Little Bird Electronics, Lilypad-vibe-board, DEV-11008) vibrating patches sewn into a HALO&#x000ae; Rhythm head band. The patches were positioned at the left and right temples.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Primary outcome measure TFI</title><p>The primary outcome measure was the 25 item version of TFI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> with 11 point numeric scale (from 0 or 0% indicating no problem to 10 or 100% indicating a very big problem). This version has recently been validated for test-retest reliability and internal consistency in New Zealand<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and the UK<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. The TFI was evaluated before (Pre) after (Post) and three weeks after (Post 3w) the training. In addition, it was completed at the initial audiology assessment (Baseline) in order to provide a measure of test-retest reliability within our cohort and to match the two experimental groups for tinnitus severity.

The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> questionnaire was administered to detect any changes in the emotional state of the participants. These questionnaires were completed before (Pre), directly after (Post), and 3 weeks after (Post 3w) the multisensory training.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Comprehensive attention battery (CAB)</title><p>The CAB (NeuropsychWorks, Inc.) is a computer-based test battery which provides an objective assessment of attention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Previous studies from our group have shown that attention-based perceptual training in tinnitus had the greatest effect on a subset of CAB measures, specifically the Discriminate Reaction Time (DRT) and Auditory-Visual Multiprocessing Tests (AVMT)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Therefore these tests were employed in the current study in their visual, audio and mixed sub-versions. The number of hits and hit reaction times were measured before (Pre) and after (Post) the multisensory training. Closer details about these procedures can be found in the supplementary materials.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Eye tracking</title><p>Eye tracking was used to assess the effects of the multisensory training on visual attention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. During eye tracking, participants completed a visual task that was identical to the multisensory training paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) except that no additional lateralized visual, tactile, and auditory stimuli were presented. In these trials, participants responded only by making saccadic eye movements to the dots presented to the left and right of the central dot. Each dot subtended 1.07&#x000b0; and the distance between the centre and each of the side dots was 12&#x000b0; of visual angle. The participants were seated 32&#x02009;cm from the screen with the head secured in a headrest. Where necessary, an appropriate refractive correction was worn.</p><p>Saccadic latency and percent of correct saccades were assessed before (Pre) and after (Post) the multisensory training. Saccadic latency was defined as the time from the presentation of the central cue (diamond or square) to the time at which the saccade began. A saccade was defined as an eye movement that exceeded 3&#x000b0; in magnitude and 30&#x000b0;/sec in speed. Saccades with latency shorter than 80&#x02009;ms were excluded from the analysis as anticipatory saccades<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Accuracy was assessed using the horizontal eye excursion in degrees at the time of the saccade offset which was defined as the point at which saccade velocity dropped below 30&#x000b0;/sec. Peak velocity was measured between saccade onset and offset. Each eye movement trace was inspected to ensure that our custom MatLab routine had identified the saccades correctly. Saccades corrupted by an eye blink and trials with a loss of tracking were excluded from analysis (5.9% of all trials).</p><p>The visual stimuli were programmed using MatLab installed on an Intel Xeon 2&#x02009;GHz, 3&#x02009;GB RAM desktop and presented on a Dell E771p monitor (resolution 1024&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;768, refresh rate 75&#x02009;Hz).

Participants were first asked to identify a tone best matching their tinnitus pitch. Subsequently, they were instructed to match the intensity level of a sound at the tinnitus pitch to the perceived loudness of their tinnitus. Finally, tinnitus was localized along the x, y, and z axes. Pitch, loudness and location were estimated once using a method of adjustment with a visual analogue sliding scale. These data allowed for the auditory stimulus to be matched to the tinnitus sound during training. The loudness of the tone was set by the participant to a &#x0201c;comfortable level&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>As the Pre values for the main outcome measure TFI were not normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), we adopted non-parametric statistics in this study. Friedman Test with a factor of Time (Pre, Post, Post 3w) was conducted to evaluate the overall effect of the training (attention diversion and integration groups&#x02019; data pooled) for the TFI as well as for secondary questionnaire-based outcome measures TSNS, THI and DASS. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test was adopted to compare Pre vs. Post and Post vs. Post 3w, where applicable. The secondary measures CAB (number of hits and reaction time of hits separately for each test) and eye tracking (saccadic latency and percent of correct saccades separately for tinnitus dominant and non-dominant side), and tinnitus characteristics (pitch and loudness) were also assessed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test comparing the Pre and Post values.</p><p>In order to examine potential mechanisms of the training, we conducted secondary analyses. These consisted of Spearman&#x02019;s correlations and Wilcoxon signed rank tests comparing the Pre and Post values separately for each treatment sub-group, and Mann&#x02013;Whitney U tests comparing the Pre-to-Post changes between the groups (attention diversion vs. integration) in measures that had shown an overall significant difference.

We have shown that a group of 18 participants improved in TFI and TSNS scores after a course of 20 days of this training. The training also led to an improvement in auditory, visual and, audio-visual attentional skills as indicated by the CAB and eye tracking measures. Our findings are in agreement with previous data showing that attentional training can improve symptoms of tinnitus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and attentional abilities in people with tinnitus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>.</p><p>The design of the task was motivated by the following requirements. The task should 1. Allow for a presentation of simple visual, auditory and tactile stimulation. 2. Allow for lateralization of the stimulus presentation, 3. Be based on an established paradigm allowing for measurement of horizontal saccadic eye movements. Such task arguably requires far transfer which may be difficult to achieve, particularly, in na&#x000ef;ve observers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. In order to avoid counselling to affect the outcome of the training, participants were na&#x000ef;ve to the rational of the task in the present study. It is therefore possible that participants might benefit from having the rational of the task explained; as understanding of the underlying principles and assumptions of training may enhance far transfer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>.</p><p>A further aim of the current study was to compare the effectiveness of two different multisensory training approaches. The attention diversion approach has been used in previous studies aiming to divert attention away from the tinnitus sound<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. The integration approach, however, is a novel strategy designed to integrate the tinnitus sound with visual and somatosensory stimuli. The aim of the integration approach was to reduce the conflict between the phantom auditory perception and the lack of input from other sensory modalities which has been suggested as a possible source of salience for the tinnitus sound<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. The results indicate that both approaches are equally effective as measured with the TFI and the CAB. This result raises a concern whether laterality of tinnitus and/or stimuli matters in this particular task. Our data cannot directly answer this question. Previous studies showed that a cognitively demanding task irrelevant to tinnitus can temporarily decrease tinnitus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, although other results imply that tasks relevant to tinnitus may be more efficient<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Future studies including participants without strictly lateralized tinnitus and/or involving non-lateralized tasks are warranted.</p><p>The present data showed that the change of TFI scores was not correlated with the change in any of the attentional measures provided by the CAB. This finding implies that mechanisms other than attention were involved in the effects of the training. Participants were challenged to achieve the best possible reaction time and were presented four times with their average score during each training session. This may have provided another competing source of limbic and autonomic system activation whereby the improvement in the reaction time acted as a positive reinforcement which superseded the negative reinforcement originating from tinnitus. It has been shown that autonomic reactions occur at a subconscious level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. It is therefore possible that the multisensory training reduced the negative emotions associated with tinnitus independently from performance on the CAB tests that reflect conscious top-down processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Considering the above, one may also query the key role of the multisensory approach in our study. In other words, it may be possible that the same task performed only within one sensory modality may deliver comparable treatment effects. A study breaking down the individual sensory modalities and comparing their effects alone to the multisensory approach would shed more light on this question.</p><p>Lastly, we were interested whether altered attention in tinnitus affects saccadic eye movements. Cuny <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. found that unilateral tinnitus is associated with an attentional shift towards the tinnitus side. In light of the results of their study, one would expect that the saccadic measures, error rate, latency and velocity would be imbalanced in favour of the tinnitus side<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Our eye tracking data, however, revealed no baseline difference between the tinnitus and non-tinnitus side in any of the saccadic measures. This finding indicates that chronic unilateral tinnitus does not affect performance on a visual attention task relying on a purely oculomotor response. This is in agreement with recent evidence showing a lack of a left-right saccadic asymmetry in unilateral tinnitus participants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Interestingly, in the integration (but not diversion) group, we revealed a decreased number of correct saccades directed towards tinnitus side. This suggests that participants in this group relied more on the auditory cues during the training that was not present during the saccadic measurements. We speculate that this may reflect the integration of the tinnitus sound with the auditory, visual and/or somatosensory modalities; however, the exact neural mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Our data also revealed a task-specific decrease in saccade latency which was comparable for both training approaches. This result is not surprising as the saccadic task was part of the training paradigm that was performed for 20 consecutive days.</p><p>This study does not suggest that multisensory treatment would be more efficacious than other existing therapies. However, the overall improvement in the tinnitus questionnaires (approximately 20%) was achieved in considerably shorter time that in other studies. For example, tinnitus retraining therapy has shown 20% - 33% improvement in questionnaires and visual analogue scale in one year<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, listening to notched music is associated with 20% - 30% decrease in tinnitus loudness in 6 to 12 months<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>, and cognitive behavioural thereby can decrease tinnitus loudness by 16% and annoyance by 37% in 6 weeks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Participants self-reported modest differences in their tinnitus which were consistent with the improvement in the questionnaires and psychoacoustic measures performed each day before the training session. Interestingly, these data show a relatively large decrease in tinnitus pitch after the first day of the training (786.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;234&#x02009;Hz). We cannot rule out that this observation may be&#x02014;at least in part&#x02014;driven by procedural learning. Participants were exposed to the procedure of tinnitus pitch (and loudness) matching at the initial audiology examination as well as the study admission appointment. It is therefore possible that the pitch change after the first day may reflect a combination of the multisensory training and gained confidence in their tinnitus assessment.</p><p>In summary, there is a growing body of evidence that attention training may be an effective therapeutic approach for a variety of cortically based disorders such as amblyopia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>, stroke<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>, and tinnitus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Our preliminary results indicate that multisensory attention training may be a viable therapeutic approach for the management of tinnitus. Although the primary outcome measure (TFI) does not directly address the question whether the training acts upon improvement in emotional state or by changing tinnitus percept, the psychoacoustic data suggest the latter. Although our primary outcome measure showed a statistically significant change with time, the degree of change was modest, and its clinical relevance remains to be determined. A limitation of this study is that it did not include a placebo group. We did, however, administer the TFI at two visits before the training (Baseline and Pre) separated on average by eight weeks. If anything, the TFI scores were larger at the later visit. Studies directed towards understanding the neural correlates of the training effects are warranted, as are randomised controlled trials, before this training can be advocated as a tinnitus therapy.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Spiegel, D.
