The incidence of CVD in people with diabetes is more than twice that observed in nondiabetic people, and the case fatality rate after a first myocardial infarction in people with diabetes is much higher than that in nondiabetic people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). This makes primary prevention of CVD particularly important in people with diabetes. Compelling evidence has accumulated on the effectiveness of optimal blood pressure (BP) management and cholesterol lowering in the reduction of CVD incidence in people with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). A targeted multifactorial intervention involving glucose control and the correction of multiple CVD risk factors substantially reduces CVD and all-cause mortality in people with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). On the basis of this evidence, the disease management approach currently endorsed by international guidelines recommends the correction of all major CVD risk factors to target levels that closely approach values of low-risk populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Notwithstanding the efforts to develop and propagate CVD prevention guidelines, the recommended target values for BP and lipids are achieved only in a small proportion of diabetic patients in clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>); in addition glucose control is often less than optimal, and there is evidence that HbA<sub>1c</sub> may increase with time irrespective of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). It remains debatable whether the evidence resulting from clinical trials can be translated into actual clinical practice, particularly when an intervention strategy targeting multiple risk factors is involved. Such intervention is, in fact, much more demanding for both the patient and the physician than treating a single factor, and it is therefore particularly difficult to implement. The most commonly mentioned factors in poor implementation of guidelines include organizational factors, inadequate perception of the patient&#x02019;s global risk, a clinical inertia resulting in inadequate up titration of therapy when the target is not reached, and poor patient adherence to chronic treatments related to polypharmacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>The Multiple INtervention in type 2 Diabetes.ITaly (MIND.IT) study is a pragmatic, cluster randomized trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> identifier NCT01240070) that compares the usual clinical practice with a protocol-driven treatment strategy aimed at the optimal correction of hyperglycemia and major CVD risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes and no previous cardiovascular events. The study aim is to evaluate in a clinical, practice-based setting the feasibility and the efficacy of a multifactorial intervention designed according to guidelines for primary CVD prevention in people with type 2 diabetes. In this article, we present data on the effects of a 2-years intervention on major CVD risk factors and HbA<sub>1c</sub>.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>The study was a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, open, two-armed intervention trial with the diabetes clinic as the unit of randomization. This study design was used to allow control for contamination of interventions associated with patient randomization when the intervention requires practice changes and the intended effect is at the institutional level.</p><p>The study was conducted in 10 large outpatient diabetes clinics that volunteered to participate. Each center was asked to recruit 250 consecutive patients (men and women) with type 2 diabetes of at least 2 years&#x02019; duration. Additional inclusion criteria were as follows: age 50 to 70 years, no previous cardiovascular events, serum creatinine &#x0003c;1.5 mg/dL. The study consisted of two phases. Phase 1 was designed as a cross-sectional clinical audit study to evaluate the degree of implementation in clinical practice of the guidelines for the primary prevention of CVD in patients with type 2 diabetes; these results have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). After phase 1, one center withdrew participation before randomization; the remaining 9 centers were randomly allocated to carry on the usual care (UC, <italic>n</italic> = 5) or to implement a target-driven interventional protocol of intensive care (IC, <italic>n</italic> = 4) aimed at the optimal control of hyperglycemia, lipids, and BP (phase 2). A few weeks after the start of the trial, one of the centers randomized to IC (Carrara) declared to be unable to comply with the requirements of the study protocol because of staff shortage continued the study according to the UC protocol. In each center, all the patients with a high CVD risk seen in phase 1 were enrolled in the interventional study. High CVD risk was defined as the coexistence of two or more conditions among the following: LDL cholesterol &#x0003e;130 mg/dL, triglycerides &#x0003e;200 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol &#x0003c;35 (males) or &#x0003c;45 (females) mg/dL, and systolic BP &#x0003e;140 or diastolic BP &#x0003e;90 mmHg, regardless of treatment. In the IC centers, the investigators were provided with a multifactorial stepwise protocol to support the application of a treat-to-target approach. This protocol, briefly described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, included a lifestyle intervention in addition to pharmacological treatment. The investigators were free in prescribing and titrating the pharmacological interventions but were required to follow stepwise incremental protocols for the optimal correction of blood glucose, BP, and lipids with the following targets: HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7% (&#x0003c;53 mmol/mol), LDL cholesterol &#x0003c;100 mg/dL, triglycerides &#x0003c;150 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol &#x0003e;40 mg/dL in men and &#x0003e; 45 mg/dL in women, and BP &#x0003c;130/80 mmHg. In addition, weight loss of &#x0003e;5% (if overweight) and the implementation of antiplatelet therapy were to be pursued. Consultation was provided every 3 months. In the UC group, the investigators followed the usual clinical practice. In both study arms, annual visits were scheduled to assess biochemistry, anthropometry, BP, electrocardiogram, and treatment target achievement. This report gives the results of the prespecified analyses performed after all patients had completed 2 years of follow-up.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Brief description of the treatment algorithm to be applied in the interventional group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2566tbl1"/></table-wrap><p>The investigation methods have been described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). At baseline and at each follow-up visit, anthropometry and sitting BP were measured according to a standard protocol; serum total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured by standard methods; HbA<sub>1c</sub> was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography; and LDL cholesterol was calculated according to the Friedewald equation for participants with fasting triglycerides &#x0003c;400 mg/dL. Biochemical testing was performed at each center in a single laboratory. Before enrollment, each participating laboratory underwent an external quality control assessment to verify the reliability and comparability of analytical methods and to reach a standard of quality and traceability among the participating centers. Quality control was monitored thereafter during the whole study period. The external quality control assessment was provided by the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy), which takes part in an international network for the standardization of laboratory methods.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committees. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><sec id="s2"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Data are given as mean &#x000b1; SE or as % (SE). Calculation of intracluster correlation coefficients (ICCs) and between groups comparisons of baseline characteristics were performed as suggested by Donner and Klar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The study outcomes were analyzed by mixed-model regression techniques to account for clustering in a group-randomized trial according to procedures described by Murray et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The SAS procedures MIXED (for continuous variables) and GLIMMIX (for binary variables) with the REML (restricted maximum likelihood) estimation were used with adjustment for baseline and including a time by treatment interaction term. The analysis was conducted according to the intent to treat (ITT) principle. Because of an obvious protocol violation by one center (Carrara), a sensitivity analysis was also performed excluding protocol violations (i.e., as treated per protocol).</p><p>The main outcome was the change from baseline in major CVD risk factors and HbA<sub>1c</sub>. The study had 90% power for detecting minimum differences between the two study arms of 3 mmHg for systolic or diastolic BP and 8 mg/dL for LDL cholesterol and for detecting a 0.5% reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, with &#x003b1; = 0.05 two-sided and assuming an ICC between 0.02 and 0.05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).

A total of 1,461 patients (i.e., 60% of those seen in phase 1) qualified for the intervention study and were enrolled.

These results were confirmed in the as treated per protocol population, which in addition showed a significantly lower systolic BP and a lower diastolic BP in the IC clinics. Notably, the improvement in glucose control was not accompanied by weight gain in the IC arm; on the contrary, a slight but statistically significant reduction in BMI was observed.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of the study population by randomized intervention strategy (ITT and as treated analyses)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2566tbl2"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>HbA<sub>1c</sub> and major CVD risk factors at 2 years&#x02019; follow-up in the two study arms</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2566tbl3"/></table-wrap><p>The proportion of patients achieving the treatment goals after 2 years was systematically higher in the IC clinics than in the UC clinics for all targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

The pattern of antihypertensive medication use was similar in the two study arms, with the ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers being the most frequently prescribed antihypertensive agents, followed by calcium-channel blockers.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Medication use at 2-year follow-up in the two study arms.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2566tbl4"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The study shows that in clinical practice an intervention to promote a target-driven management of diabetes and CVD risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes and high CVD risk is feasible and is associated with significant intensification of treatment and improvement in glucose control and CVD risk factors. At variance with other studies, the improvement in glucose control was not accompanied by weight gain, probably as a result of the inclusion of weight control in the IC management targets. Several studies have documented the gap between the management of diabetes recommended by guidelines and the actual care delivered in the clinical setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Our results demonstrate that a target-driven management protocol for diabetes and CVD risk factors can be implemented in clinical practice, and in a 2-year period can improve the overall quality of care and the CVD risk factors profile beyond results achieved in the usual practice. This suggests a great potential for the primary prevention of CVD in diabetes. The differences achieved between the study arms at the end of 2 years of follow-up for most end points were statistically and clinically significant, and all favored the IC group. It is also relevant that the trial was undertaken against a background of general improvements in the delivery of diabetes care associated with the spreading of evidence-based guidelines and the introduction of national standards of care endorsed by the Italian Diabetes Society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), which may have somewhat narrowed the achievable differences between the treatments groups.</p><p>The quality of care in the IC clinics remained, however, suboptimal. Nearly half of the patients did not achieve the goals for HbA<sub>1c</sub>, only one in three reached optimal BP or LDL cholesterol values, and a very small proportion met all three goals. These results are in keeping with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and underline the difficulty in reaching the desired therapeutic targets in patients with type 2 diabetes in clinical practice. The reasons for the repeatedly documented gap between the ideal and the actual care delivered to diabetic patients are complex. Factors affecting care delivery may be more important than guidelines themselves or the strategies used to spread them; physicians&#x02019; beliefs and patient compliance are also crucial issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Guidelines on their own are not beneficial; effective implementation strategies should accompany their development. Pay for performance programs have been introduced in several countries to improve the quality of care, and there is evidence that the introduction of explicit financial incentives is associated with improvements in the quality indicators for diabetes care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). It is difficult, however, to disentangle the impact of these measures from other concomitant quality initiatives, because few studies have adjusted for underlying trends in quality of care. Furthermore, relevant aspects of diabetes management, such as the patient&#x02019;s empowerment and continuity of care, are not captured by the quality and outcomes framework. In addition, concerns that pay for performance programs might erode equity in the provision of health care have been raised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,31). In our study, quarterly counseling was recommended in the IC clinics; this may ensure sufficient continuity of care and at the same time be compatible with routine clinical practice in most settings. The implementation of this recommendation and the provision of a stepwise protocol to support the application of a treat-to-target approach may have been key factors in the overall improvement of quality of care in the IC group. The improvement of quality of care is similar to what has been reported in clinical practice&#x02013;based programs in the U.K. and in the U.S. (31,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) and was obtained without allocation of extra resources or financial incentives, but rather through a physician-led effort made possible by the commitment of the personnel involved.</p><p>The potential study limitations need to be discussed. Because the intervention was delivered within the setting of routine clinical practice, we randomized the clinics rather than the individual participants to avoid contamination. The study included a limited number of clinics, and those enrolled were selected on the basis of their willingness to participate in the project. This may somewhat limit the generalizability of our findings. The randomized design, however, and the large number of patients recruited in each clinic may partially offset these problems. In addition, we covered a large geographical area, and the participating centers were fairly representative for key characteristics of the diabetes clinics all over Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The study was designed in 2001, and therefore the treatment algorithms, particularly those for the correction of hyperglycemia, are not fully consistent with current recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Finally, in this analysis we only assessed intermediate outcome measures, and no information was collected on the frequency and severity of hypoglycemic events. Whether such intervention would effectively reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular events can only be inferred from changes in the CVD risk factor profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). A similar study conducted to investigate the effect of early multifactorial treatment after diabetes diagnosis by screening showed a small, nonsignificant, difference in the incidence of cardiovascular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The changes in the CVD risk factor profile observed in that study were, however, considerably smaller than those achieved in our study.</p><p>In conclusion, a multifactorial, target-driven intervention for the management of type 2 diabetes is feasible and effective in clinical practice. An intensive intervention strategy delivered at the clinic level is associated with a significant and durable improvement in major CVD risk factors and HbA<sub>1c</sub>, well beyond that achieved with the usual practices.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
