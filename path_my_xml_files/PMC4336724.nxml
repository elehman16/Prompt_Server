After we have received full ethical approval and patient consent, participants will be randomized to receive a series of 24 electroacupuncture or pelvic floor muscle training interventions. The frequency and amount of leakage will be measured as the primary outcome parameters.

Female SUI (FSUI) is a common condition which affects quality of life in women aged 40 to 75&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Any women of old age are at high risk of SUI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Women with SUI are embarrassed to take part in social activities, and as a result their lifestyles are altered putting them at increased risk of lifestyle-related disease, such as osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, coronary disease, mammary cancer, carcinoma of colon, depression, anxiety, and so forth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The International Consultation on Urological Diseases recommend that treatment methods for mild and moderate SUI are lifestyle intervention, behavior therapy, pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training, functional electroacupuncture, and so forth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. PFM training has level A evidence of efficacy, with a curative rate ranging from 30 to 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, training duration should be at least 2&#x000a0;months. In China, PFM training is not as efficient as expected because there are not enough physical therapists, and patient compliance to treatment needs to be improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Primary therapy for moderate and severe SUI is surgery, which carries a high potential for adverse events. A safety communication from the US Food and Drug Administration on serious complications associated with transvaginal placement of a surgical mesh for pelvic organ prolapse was issued on 13 July 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, there is a need to explore other treatment avenues.</p><p>By contrast, acupuncture for FSUI works over a short period with a high curative rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which shows potential advantages for FSUI. In a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], electroacupunture was verified as a more effective therapy for SUI than acupuncture, possibly related to the PFM and nerves. However, the level of evidence was rated as &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>A trial of high methodological quality is needed to determine whether electroacupuncture is effective for FSUI. This trial will evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture and investigate whether electroacupuncture is a better treatment for FSUI than PFM training.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>This study is a double-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled trial using two study arms: an electroacupuncture group and a PFM training group.</p><p>After consent, participants will be allocated to either group (the electroacupuncture group or the PFM training group) using computer generated randomization lists.

Before performing PFM training, patients should learn the position of the PFM. The PFM is the muscle we contract to stop passing water when urinating. Alternatively, vaginal palpation can be used to identify the specific position of the PFM. The patient can insert their finger into the vagina to feel the muscle contraction if convenient. PFM training is performed by standing/sitting/lying on the back with knees bent. Continuously contract the PFM three times, until the patient feels they cannot contract any more strongly; then hold on the contraction, and breathe twice (inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale); then relax the whole body, breathing another two times (inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale). Then contract PFM again.

As identified in a recently published review and a systematic review and meta analysis (Wang Y, Zhishun L, Peng W, Zhao J, Liu B, manuscript accepted), only a few studies have investigated electroacupuncture for FSUI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. None of these was adequately powered to allow valid conclusions on its optimal effectiveness.

Therefore, we are conducting a multicenter, randomized, controlled large-scale trial to clarify whether electroacupuncture is more effective than PFM training in treating SUI.</p><p>There are two different treatment groups in this trial: the electroacupuncture group and the PFM training group. Bilateral Zhong Liao and Hui Yang are applied in the electroacupuncture group, which are regarded as the most common acupuncture prescriptions. The electric stimulator is applied to bilateral BL33 and BL35 with a continuous wave, 50&#x000a0;Hz, 1 to 5&#x000a0;mA electric current, which is expected to be the best therapeutic effect. PFM training has received Level A evidence rating in the treatment of SUI in women, based on meta-analyses of numerous randomized control trials, and is recommended in many published guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus, PFM training is used as the control group.</p><p>In this trial, we use a 1:1 randomization design comparing electroacupuncture to PFM training to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture, and investigate whether electroacupuncture is a better treatment for SUI in comparison to PFM training. The sample size estimation ensures adequate power (90%) to allow valid conclusions. With the high prevalence of SUI and the socioeconomic burden of SUI, there is a demand for effective, safe, non-invasive and low-cost treatment options for this specific patient group.
