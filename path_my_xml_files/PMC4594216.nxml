<bold>Introduction: </bold> One of the major complications in hemodialysis patients is cardiovascular disease. Lipid abnormality is an important factor in the development of cardiovascular disease.
</p><p>
<bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate the effect of omega-3 supplementation on serum lipid profile in hemodialysis patients.
</p><p>
<bold>Patients and Methods:</bold> This randomized clinical trial study included 2 groups of patients: those who received omega-3 supplementation (experimental group; 30 cases) and those who received placebo (control group; 30 cases). They received these for 10 weeks and serum lipid profile (triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein [HDL-C], low-density lipoprotein [LDL-C], and total cholesterol) was assessed 2 times, first before initiating supplementation and then at the end of 10-week study period.
</p><p>
<bold>Results: </bold> Mean (&#x000b1;SD) serum total cholesterol levels at the beginning was 163 (&#x000b1;47) mg/dL in experimental group and 143 (&#x000b1;25) mg/dL in control group (P&#x0003e; 0.05). These values decreased to 124 mg/dL and 132 mg/dL in control and experimental groups (P&#x0003c; 0.05). There was no significant difference of HDL-C, LDL-C, or triglyceride levels between experimental and control groups after 10 weeks of treatment.
</p><p>
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> Omega-3 supplementation in hemodialysis patients only showed significant decrease of serum total cholesterol level, but not other lipids.

Since there is controversy about omega-3 supplementation on lipid profile in patients with hemodialysis patients, we conducted a study to determine the role of omega-3 in such patients. Our results showed that in short-term follow-up omega-3supplementation, the only finding was significant decrease in serum total cholesterol.
</p></sec></boxed-text><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>
The most significant cause of death among hemodialysis patients is cardiovascular disease and one of its primary causes is coronary artery atherosclerosis (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). High concentration of serum lipid, as previously demonstrated in numerous studies, has been considered an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis development (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). With regard to impaired serum lipid profile in hemodialysis patients, this in turn exacerbates development of cardiovascular diseases in these patients. Hence, control, monitoring, and treatment of serum lipid abnormalities can be a necessity for prevention of related mortality in these patients (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Nevertheless, given that lipid-lowering medications alone may not be effective to correct abnormalities of lipid and also considering the side effects of these medications such as gastrointestinal distress, flushing, itching, myositis, and hepatic dysfunction as well as digestive disorders and uremic pruritus in these patients (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), it seems logical to find other methods of preventing and treating hyperlipidemia besides existing medications.
</p><p>
In this regard, several studies have been taken to find agents to manage lipid abnormalities (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). One of these is the effect of supplementation with omega-3 or consuming foods containing omega-3. Fatty acid omega-3 has numerous benefits for hemodialysis patients (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, some studies did not demonstrate beneficial effects of using omega-3 supplementation in terms of lipid profile in hemodialysis patients (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).
</p><p>
With regard to the special geographical position of Kermanshah province which is located in a mountainous area and lack of easy access to the marine resources which are rich in omega-3, as well as not regular consumption of fish in this province, supplementation with omega-3, if demonstrated to be effective in reducing serum lipid levels, will have beneficial effects for hemodialysis patients.
</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Objectives</title><p>
The aim of this study was to assess the effects of omega-3 on the serum lipid profile in hemodialysis patients.
</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s3"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>
This study was double-blind clinical trial performed on patients undergoing hemodialysis and presented to the hemodialysis center Imam-Reza hospital in Kermanshah in 2013 (from October for 10 weeks).
</p><p>
Inclusion criteria were satisfaction and cooperation and their willingness to be studied and passing at least 6 months from the onset of dialysis. Exclusion criteria included the presence of bleeding and taking warfarin, ticlopidine, dipyridamole and clopidogrel, viral hepatitis and other infectious diseases, body mass index (BMI) of less than 18.5 or more than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and supplementation with omega-3, omega-6 and vitamins E and C within the two months preceding the study.
</p><p>
To start the study, 5 cc venous blood in the fasting state and before connection to hemodialysis machine was obtained. After completion of hemodialysis, weight with light clothing using a weight scale with precision of 100 g was measured. Height was also measured without shoes by a meter installed on the wall with precision of 1 mm.
</p><p>
General characteristics of the patients were recorded on data collection sheets. Blood pressure was recorded 2 times (before and after hemodialysis) using sphygmomanometer.
</p><p>
In this study, patients were randomly divided into 2 groups of receiving omega-3 supplementation or placebo.
</p><p>
Patients in omega-3 group (experimental group) took omega-3 for 10 weeks (1000 mg daily) as capsules containing 80 mg of EPA and 120 mg DHA. Patients in placebo group received vitamin E in the form of capsule which was similar in shape and size to omega-3 capsule (one capsule daily).
</p><p>
For more serious implementation of programs and conducting research compliance in the course of a double-blind placebo, at the beginning of the study a set of cans containing supplement or a placebo were coded by a person other than those involved in the study (measuring height and weight and providing the drugs) in the form of A and B. This was done as the researcher could not understand of the study groups. At the end of week 10 of the study, 5 cc blood was obtained before connecting to dialysis machine. Weight and height were also recorded after hemodialysis session. Furthermore, for better and more accurate taking of medications, every night at 9 pm the cases were announced by sending SMS to remind them taking their medications.
</p><p>
Biochemical parameters measured included total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C). These were measured once before starting the study and again after 10 weeks and before connection to hemodialysis machine. The fasting time recommended for patients was 12 hours.
</p><p>
Study population consisted of hemodialysis patients presented to the dialysis center. They were divided into 2 groups of receiving omega-3 or placebo. All the information needed was extracted from a form designed for this study. Sampling method was convenience method. The purpose of this study was to compare experimental and control groups. The sample size was calculated using triglyceride and 25 subjects were selected for each group. Thirty patients were selected so that if there would be drop or some patients will not complete the study, we can achieve 25 subjects. Totally 60 patients were entered into the study. Considering 99% confidence and 95% power, mean (standard deviation) of experimental and control groups was 246 (&#x000b1;25) and 276.7 (&#x000b1;41), respectively and the minimum sample size was 25 cases in each group.
</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>
Ethics issues
</title><p>
The research followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Omega-3 and placebo were free and the results were provided for them. In cases where lipid abnormality was severe and the patients required multi-dimensional treatments (diet, supplements, and medication), necessary treatments were delivered after completion of the study under supervision of dietician and nephrologist. The research was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences.

Statistical analysis
</title><p>
After collecting the data, they were entered into the SPSS software (version 20.0) and for summarizing the results, descriptive indices such as mean, standard deviation, and one-dimensional and 2-dimensional tables were utilized. To analyze the continuous data, independence and paired <italic>t</italic> test and Stata software were applied and the maximum acceptable error less than 0.05 was set as significance level.

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s5"><title>Discussion</title><p>
Hemodialysis patients due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) develop this condition due to various causes. Diabetes is one of the most prevalent contributing factors. These patients lose their renal function and to survive need hemodialysis or renal transplantation. On the other hand, most patients experience worsening of their condition due to complications of renal failure or a chronic disease damaging kidney function or other comorbidities. This process also induces acute or chronic mental problems including depression. This in turn makes management of these patients difficult. One of the main causes of death in these patients is cardiovascular problems and, accordingly, any factor that predisposes to cardiovascular events is a life threatening factor in this population (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).
</p><p>
The current study addresses one of the contributing factors in development of coronary heart disease, which is lipid abnormality. As demonstrated in various studies, serum lipid profile is impaired in hemodialysis patients, especially in those with pre-existing diabetes. This issue plays an apparent role in development and progression of atherosclerosis (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).
</p><p>
Although currently several treatments are available for treatment of lipid disorders, due to the above-mentioned topics including specific conditions in these patients due to chronic disease and mental health problems and consumption of many drugs, finding a way to prevent atherosclerosis progression or serum lipid abnormalities in such patients can have significant role in them.
</p><p>
As noted at the start of this study, consuming food sources whose effects on serum lipids have been confirmed in different studies is one of these ways. Seafood including fish and plankton which contain significant amounts of omega-3 can be a solution for long-term use in such patients and the objective of this study was in fact to confirm this. Geographical situation in the province limit easy access to seafood and ocean resources for all citizens, especially hemodialysis patients. On the other hand, necessary monetary resources may not be available for all patients. Therefore, it is logical that patients consume seafood (if afforded) or take supplements containing omega-3.
</p><p>
But to compare this study with other studies, it is necessary to present the results of some similar studies. Friedman et al, (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) in a study performed in 2006 in the review of 30 studies on the effects of omega-3 in patients found that omega-3 plays a significant role in immune and inflammatory responses, atherosclerosis progression, and blood pressure control.
</p><p>
Rasic et al, in a study on 35 patients who were undergoing hemodialysis for 12 months confirmed the effects of omega-3 on insulin resistance and lowering TNF level (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Poulia et al on 25 hemodialysis patients confirmed the none effect of omega-3 on inflammatory markers and serum lipids (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).
</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>
The obtained findings suggest that although omega-3 consumption, given the numbers before and after the survey, had some effect, with respect to the fact that ultimate goal is the results of statistical analyses, except for serum total cholesterol (<italic>P&#x02005;</italic>=&#x02005;0.045), other items did not differ statistically in this study. The only finding was significant decrease in serum total cholesterol.
