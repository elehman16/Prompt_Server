Eight subjects received MB12066 (lot no M 13001; expiration date, January 2015; KT&#x00026;G Life Sciences Corporation), and three subjects received placebo (lot no P 13001; expiration date, January 2015; KT&#x00026;G Life Sciences Corporation).</p><p>The study consisted of a screening period (days &#x02212;21 to day &#x02212;2), baseline evaluation (day &#x02212;1), admission (days &#x02212;1 and 7), multiple-dose treatment period (days 1&#x02013;8, 100 mg MB12066 or placebo administered twice orally after an overnight fast for &#x02265;10 h), discharge (days 2 and 9), and safety follow-up on days 14&#x02013;18. Subjects were admitted to the study center at 8 pm on days &#x02212;1 and 7. After an overnight fast for 10 h, subjects received the first or the last (at 8 am on day 8) oral dose of MB12066 100 mg or placebo 100 mg with 150 mL of water at 8 am in the morning of days 1 and 8, under the supervision of the investigator. Additional water intake was permitted 2 h after dosing, and food intake was not allowed for 4 h with standardized lunch and evening meals served at 4 and 10 h after the first or last dose. Subjects were hospitalized from 12 h before the first or last dose to 24 h after dose. On days 2&#x02013;7, all subjects came to the study center and received an oral dose of the study medication every 12 h.</p><p>To determine &#x003b2;-lapachone plasma concentration, serial blood samples (5 mL each) were collected from an indwelling intravenous catheter into a sodium heparin-containing tube just before and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 24 h after dosing on day 1, just before dosing on day 5, and also before and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, and 60 h after dosing on day 8. The tubes with blood samples were shaken lightly and immediately chilled on ice for &#x02264;5 min before plasma separation via centrifugation (3,200 rpm for 7 min at 4&#x000b0;C). Plasma samples (150 &#x003bc;L) were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until analysis by the KNUH&#x02019;s analytical laboratory.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>&#x003b2;-lapachone concentration analysis</title><p>&#x003b2;-lapachone plasma concentrations were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC&#x02013;MS/MS). Briefly, 100 &#x003bc;L plasma was pipetted into a polypropylene tube, and 200 &#x003bc;L &#x003b2;-lapachone-d6 (5 ng/mL in acetonitrile) was added as an internal standard. The mixture was then vortexed for 5 min and centrifuged (13,200 rpm, 10 min). A 3 &#x003bc;L aliquot of this solution was injected for analysis. Samples were analyzed by HPLC&#x02013;MS/MS using an Agilent 1200 series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled to an API 5000 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA). Chromatographic separation was performed using a Zorbax XDB-C<sub>18</sub> column (2.1&#x000d7;150 mm internal diameter, 3.5 &#x003bc;m particle size) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The mobile phase consisted of a 30:70 (v/v) mixture of 0.1% formic acid in 5 mM ammonium acetate and acetonitrile. The multiple reaction monitoring transitions for quantification were as follows: <italic>m/z</italic> 243.11&#x02192;187.03 for &#x003b2;-lapachone and <italic>m/z</italic> 249.05&#x02192;159.07 for &#x003b2;-lapachone-d6. Linear calibration curves were established between 0.5 and 200 ng/mL for &#x003b2;-lapachone (<italic>r</italic>&#x02265;0.9950). Intraday % coefficients of variation (CVs) were 3.4, 3.0, 2.1, and 3.6 for 0.5, 1.5, 16, and 160 ng/mL of &#x003b2;-lapachone, respectively. At the same respective concentrations, interday %CVs were 4.0, 4.4, 3.6, and 3.6, respectively. The overall accuracy ranged from 98.8% to 106.0% (intraday) and from 96.2% to 104.3% (interday). The lower limit of quantification was 0.5 ng/mL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>PK analysis</title><p>&#x003b2;-lapachone PK parameters in plasma were determined by non-compartmental methods, using WinNonlin Pro 5.3 software (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA), based on individual subject &#x003b2;-lapachone plasma concentrations, using actual sampling times after the first or last 100 mg maintenance dose administration. Maximum plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>), minimum plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>min</sub>), and time to reach <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> (t<sub>max</sub>) were estimated directly from the observed plasma concentration&#x02013;time data curve. Terminal elimination rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>e</sub>) was determined by linear regression on the final data points (at least three) of log-linear decline. &#x003b2;-lapachone apparent elimination half-life (t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub>) was calculated as 0.693/<italic>k</italic><sub>e</sub>. The area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve over the dosing interval after multiple-dose administration (AUC<italic><sub>&#x003c4;</sub></italic>) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method.

Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate) were assessed at screening, on days 1 and 8 (before and at 4 and 24 h after administration of the first and the last dose), and at the follow-up visit. Body temperature was measured at screening and at the follow-up visit. A full physical examination was performed at screening, on days 1 and 8 (before dosing), days 2 and 9 (before discharge), and at the follow-up visit. The following laboratory tests were conducted at screening and follow-up visits at an accredited laboratory (Department of Laboratory Medicine, KNUH, Daegu, Republic of Korea): blood hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell, platelet, and white blood cells with neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil, and basophil counts), urinalysis (specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketone, bilirubin, occult blood, urobilinogen, nitrite, and microscopic examination [red and white blood cells]), and serum chemistry (fasting glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, &#x003b3;-glutamyltransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase). A 12-lead ECG was conducted at screening and at the follow-up visit.</p><p>Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as those that occurred on or after administration of the first dose.

MB12066 is a synthetic version of &#x003b2;-lapachone. Based on a literature review (PubMed key terms: &#x003b2;-lapachone, PK, healthy volunteer [August 2016]), there were no research reports that addressed &#x003b2;-lapachone PK in healthy volunteers.</p><p>The mean ratio of AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> (area under the plasma concentration vs time curve from 0 to the last quantifiable time point)/AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> (area under the plasma concentration vs time curve from 0 to infinity) after repeated dosing for 8 days was 90.8% in our study, indicating that the sampling schedule was adequate to provide a reliable estimate of exposure extent (eg, at least 80% AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>).</p><p>Following single-dose 100 mg MB12066 administration, the <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> values for &#x003b2;-lapachone (3.56&#x000b1;1.55 ng/mL and 16.16&#x000b1;4.93 ng&#x000b7;h/mL, respectively) from the present study were not compatible with those reported in the investigator&#x02019;s brochure (1.56&#x000b1;0.50 ng/mL and 19.74&#x000b1;11.92 ng&#x000b7;h/mL, respectively). There may be several reasons for these differences; the sampling times in the study from the investigator&#x02019;s brochure were different (just before and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h after dosing). Furthermore, as the second dose was administered 12 h after the first dose on day 1 in our study, the last time point for AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> was 12 h after the first dose. Accordingly, the AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> and t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> values could not be exactly calculated after a single dose. Following multiple-dose MB12066 (100 mg twice daily) administration for 8 days in this study, <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> values for &#x003b2;-lapachone were significantly higher than those after a single dose (14.96&#x000b1;15.56 ng/mL and 85.97&#x000b1;32.59 ng&#x000b7;h/mL, respectively; <italic>p</italic>=0.21 and <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, respectively). Furthermore, the accumulation index for &#x003b2;-lapachone calculated in this study was 2.72&#x000b1;0.37, indicating that there was considerable accumulation in plasma with twice-daily administration.</p><p>In the present study, the median t<sub>max</sub> values ranged between 3 and 5 h post dose, compatible with those reported in the investigator&#x02019;s brochure (2.5&#x02013;5.0 h). The mean t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> value following multiple dosing in this study was 18.16&#x000b1;3.14 h. The reported t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> values in the preclinical study and the investigator&#x02019;s brochure after oral administration with 10&#x02013;400 mg of MB12066 in healthy volunteers showed similar t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> values (10.4&#x02013;24.6 h) as seen in our study.<xref rid="b19-dddt-11-2719" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>In our study, interindividual variability seen in the PK values for &#x003b2;-lapachone was considerable. For single- and multiple-dose administrations, the CV% for <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> values was 43.6% and 104.9%, respectively. The CV% for AUC ranged from 30.5% to 58.8%. According to the investigator&#x02019;s brochure, the CV% for <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, when MB12066 was administered to 50 healthy volunteers in a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose, dose-escalation clinical trial, ranged from 31.9% to 99.5% and from 30.2% to 106.9%, respectively (unpublished data; KT&#x00026;G Life Sciences Corporation). As &#x003b2;-lapachone is predominantly metabolized by NQO1-mediated quinone reduction and subsequent UGT-catalyzed glucuronidation, NQO1 or UGT polymorphisms or mutations could have had a plausible impact on the large interindividual variability seen.<xref rid="b21-dddt-11-2719" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-dddt-11-2719" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Among 22 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NQO1 gene, the NQO1*2/*2 homozygote frequency with negligible NQO1 enzymatic activity ranged between 4.4% and 20.3% and NQO1*1/*2 heterozygote frequency with activities between that in the wild-type NQO1*1/*1 and mutant NQO1*2/*2 homozygotes ranged from 33.8% to 52.2%.<xref rid="b23-dddt-11-2719" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b26-dddt-11-2719" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>According to the investigator&#x02019;s brochure, 15 of 50 subjects who received the study drug experienced 34 AEs. Of these 34 AEs, 20 events were considered to be related to the medication and mild in severity. AEs that corresponded to more than one event included diarrhea, abdominal pain, and dizziness. MB12066 was well tolerated in normal healthy volunteers enrolled in this study, and the observed AEs that occurred following multiple-dose administration were not severe or serious.</p><p>There were several limitations in this study. First, even though a small number of subjects per treatment group are generally acceptable for Phase I clinical trials, the sample size of this study was relatively small. Second, the results were obtained from healthy male subjects. The PK of MB12066 might differ depending on the patient population or in relation to gender or age. Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate MB12066&#x02019;s PK and tolerability in other population subgroups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results demonstrate that MB12066 was safe and well tolerated in healthy male volunteers during this study with no serious adverse effects. In addition, the accumulation in plasma with twice-daily administration was associated with an accumulation ratio of 2.72.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by the grants from the Korea Health Technology R&#x00026;D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI), funded by the Ministry of Health &#x00026; Welfare, Republic of Korea (HI15C0001, HI14C2750); the Bio &#x00026; Medical Technology Development Program of the National Research Foundation (NRF), funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT &#x00026; Future Planning, Republic of Korea (NRF-2013M3A9B6046416); and the Industrial Core Technology Development Program (10051129, development of the system for ADME assessment using radiolabeled compounds), funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry &#x00026; Energy (MOTIE, Korea).
