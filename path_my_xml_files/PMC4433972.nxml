facilitation (NJF) training is superior to NJF distal resistance training at improving the
ROM and proprioceptive acuity of the neck. [Subjects] 10 healthy subjects (8 males, 2
females) participated in this study. [Methods] The participants were allocated to three
groups: 10 in the control group, 10 in the NJF distal resistance training group, and 10 in
the NJF training group. A miniature wireless motion recorder was used to record the
maximum cervical range of motion and joint position error (JPE) before and after the
interventions. The three interventions were tested on different days. [Results] No
difference of ROM was observed among the three groups. A significant pre- to
post-intervention decrease in JPE in extension was identified in the NJF group. No other
significant differences were observed among the three groups. [Conclusion] The NJF
training conferred remarkable benefits on the cervical JPE of healthy people. This result
suggests that the best way to improve proprioceptive acuity is intervention together with
proximal resistance training, such as NJF training.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Neck</kwd><kwd>Joint position sense</kwd><kwd>Neuromuscular joint facilitation (NJF)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patients with neck pain often have impaired proprioception of the neck and reduced ROM, for
which proprioception training and ROM training are usually prescribed in rehabilitation
protocols. More and more researchers and clinicians are interested in the assessment<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup> and treatment of strength<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, endurance, range of motion and
proprioception<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> of the cervical spine.
Cervical ROM has been used to evaluate the severity of impairment or disability of patients
as it is related to cervical disorders and injuries. It has also been used as part of the
clinical criteria for classification of disease as well as the evaluation of the efficacy of
a rehabilitation program<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The joint position error (JPE) test is considered the primary measure of neck
proprioception and has been widely used as an outcome measure for patients with chronic neck
pain<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Abnormal JPE has been detected in
patients with neck pain using either tests of ability to relocate the neutral head posture
after an active movement or to actively relocate a position within a movement plane<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Neuromuscular joint facilitation (NJF) is a new therapeutic exercise based on kinesiology,
and it integrates with the facilitation element of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation
(PNF) with the joint composition movement, aiming to improve the movement of the joint
through passive exercise, active exercise and resistance exercise. It is also used to
increase the function of the neck. The NJF technique uses the same motion pattern as PNF,
but NJF changes the resistance part. NJF applies proximal resistance to the spinous process
of the neck<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to examine the immediate effects of NJF training and NJF

All the subjects were able to independently perform activities of daily
living. They all agreed to participate in the study, after the researchers had given them a
verbal explanation of the study method and aims. This study was approved by the Research
Ethics Committee of the International University of Health and Welfare. The Ethics Review
Number is 13-Io-118.</p><p>The subjects were divided into three groups: 10 in the control group, 10 in the NJF distal
resistance training group, and 10 in the NJF training group. A miniature wireless motion
recorder was used to record the maximum cervical ROM and JPE before and after the
interventions. Two miniature wireless motion recorders (MVP-RF8-GC, Microston Corperation,
Japan) were used in this study to measure the angle change of the neck. One was placed on
the middle of the forehead, and the other one was placed on the manubrium sterni. The tests
and performance were based on similar tests used in previous studies which investigated the
neck proprioception<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subjects were
comfortably positioned by sitting with their feet flat on the ground with their head in the
neutral resting position. They were requested to focus on a target positioned at eye level.
Subjects were familiarized with the tasks by performing a few practices in each test
direction: extension, left rotation, and right rotation. For the formal tests, subjects were
blindfolded, and their neutral head position was automatically set to zero by the sensor. In
the three testing directions, the neck and head moved to the end of their range and returned
as accurately as possible to the starting position. Three trials were performed of left and
right neck rotation, and extension. Before each trial, subjects were allowed to remove the
blindfold, open their eyes and face a big mirror to relearn the neutral position. Then, they
were blinded again, and the head was repositioned back to the starting position the subjects
by themselves. Prior to each new direction, the subject was able to recenter his starting
position with the help of the mirror before being blindfolded again. Data were collected for
two seconds at the starting &#x02018;neutral&#x02019; position, the positions of maximum rotation (and
extension), and the end position after the return to the &#x02018;neutral&#x02019; position. The differences
in angle between the starting and the maximum range positions were calculated to deduce the
ROM of each movement at each sensor site. The differences in angle between the starting and
the end range position were calculated to deduce the neck joint position error of each
movement at each sensor site. JPE and ROM were calculated as the average data for the three
trials in each direction (extension, right rotation, and left rotation). The test method
followed those described in previous studies. The method that Gwendolen J<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> et al. used was the three directions method
of the present study. It is considered that left and right lateral flexion allows the trunk
muscle to affect the neck movement. It interferes too much with the proprioceptive sense of
the neck, so it was not used in the present study. The focus of the present study was
proprioception sense. In the cervical region, most of proprioceptors are distributed in the
deep flexion muscle groups of the neck<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Test of neck position sense after the neck extension then back to the neutral position,
involving neck flexion muscle group&#x02019;s activation, would be more persuasive for neck position
ability in the present study.</p><p>The interventions for control group was two minutes&#x02019; rest, for NJF distal resistant
training group was NJF distal resistance training and for the NJF group was NJF neck flexion
pattern training. Three interventions and tests were performed on different days.</p><p>Two-way repeated measures anova was used to compare joint position error between before and
after the intervention. The two factors were group and intervention. If a significant
interaction among groups was found, the Two-way repeated measures anova with the Bonferroni
was performed to investigate the differences between before and after intervention. All
statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Ver. 17.0 for Windows. A value of p&#x0003c;0.05
was accepted as indicating statistical significance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>No difference in ROM was observed among the three groups (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of ROM before and after intervention (&#x000b0;)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1"/><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Extension </td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NJF </td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.42&#x000b1;12.44</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67.20&#x000b1;15.31</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NJF-D </td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64.53&#x000b1;11.30</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.88&#x000b1;15.04</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control </td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67.57&#x000b1;12.25</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.85&#x000b1;13.23</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1"> Left rotation</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NJF </td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">74.94&#x000b1;13.83</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">77.29&#x000b1;15.81</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NJF-D </td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.25&#x000b1;14.62</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.92&#x000b1;15.30</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control </td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.45&#x000b1;14.92</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.10&#x000b1;13.88</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Right rotation </td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NJF </td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">74.25&#x000b1;17.13</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.61&#x000b1;14.09</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NJF-D </td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.98&#x000b1;12.54</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">75.21&#x000b1;15.01</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control </td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">76.36&#x000b1;12.52</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">74.39&#x000b1;15.36</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are mean &#x000b1; SD.

study groups. This finding may be due to the subjects being healthy individuals without any
neck problems, who do not have any abnormal limited range motion of the cervical joint.
Cervical spine studies have suggested that warm-up exercises which simulate the actual
testing procedure can increase the compliance of neck soft tissues and minimize the process
of creep related to repetitive measurements<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Before the test and the intervention,
therefore, subjects were allowed to practice the task and perform movements in each
direction, to warm up the neck muscle to avoid tight muscles. Therefore, it is reasonable to
assume that healthy people would have the similar normal cervical joint range of motion at
both pre and post intervention. The joint position is based on the proprioceptive function.
If a method improves the proprioceptive function of the neck, the positioning ability of the
neck should show more acuity. The result of this study indicate that NJF training provides
proprioceptive acuity that is superior to NJF distal resistance training. This is because,
in NJF, proximal resistance is exerted, promoting the contraction of the neck multifidus
thereby activating more proprioceptors. There was a pre- to post-intervention decrease in
JPE of extension, possibly due to the patterns of NJF training, with focus much more on the
directions of extension and flexion of the neck, and less on the left and right rotation.
According to the results of our study, it is evident that NJF training can promote the
proprioceptive function of the neck. NJF is suitable for neck dysfunction rehabilitation
training and neck proprioceptive function disorder rehabilitation training. This finding is
of great significance for rehabilitation training. Nevertheless, further investigations are
necessary to find out the best approaches for improving proprioceptive function, and to
investigate the different effects of different training programs after long-term
interventions for healthy people and neck disorder patients. NJF training had remarkable
benefits for cervical JPE of healthy people. This result suggests that the better way to
improve proprioceptive acuity is an intervention together with proximal resistance training,
such as NJF training.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Strimpakos</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The assessment of the cervical spine.
