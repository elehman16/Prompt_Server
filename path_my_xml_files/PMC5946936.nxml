In a large survey from 2012, an estimated 126.1 million adults in the United States reported at least some pain in the prior three months, with 23.4 million of these adults reporting &#x0201c;a lot&#x0201d; of pain [<xref rid="pnx195-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Opioid analgesics are well recognized as effective therapy for appropriately selected patients with moderate to severe pain [<xref rid="pnx195-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pnx195-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Prescribing of opioids has increased dramatically in the last two decades, with an estimated 259 million prescriptions dispensed in 2012 [<xref rid="pnx195-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This increase in opioid prescribing has been mirrored by a well-documented and concerning increase in opioid abuse, diversion, and overdose deaths [<xref rid="pnx195-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In 2014, for example, the Centers for Disease Control estimated that nearly 19,000 overdose deaths in the United States were associated with prescription opioids [<xref rid="pnx195-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Among approved prescription opioids, immediate-release (IR) hydrocodone combination products are the most commonly prescribed, with approximately 90 million prescriptions dispensed in 2015 [<xref rid="pnx195-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Not surprisingly, IR hydrocodone combination products are also subject to the highest level of abuse and diversion among all the opioid products [<xref rid="pnx195-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Abuse of IR hydrocodone combination products is most prevalent via the oral route of administration, with more than 80% of individuals being evaluated for substance abuse treatment endorsing this route [<xref rid="pnx195-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, 23% of adults and 43% of adolescents reported abuse of these products by the intranasal (IN) route within the last 30&#x02009;days [<xref rid="pnx195-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Hydrocodone combination products appear to have been the first opioid abused by many individuals being evaluated for substance abuse treatment, and initial abuse of such products is associated with progression to more potent opioids and riskier, nonoral routes of administration [<xref rid="pnx195-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Frequent intranasal abuse of IR hydrocodone combination products has been associated with significant morbidity that can include perforated septa, serious fungal and bacterial infections, and, in some instances, oronasal fistulas [<xref rid="pnx195-B10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;13</xref>]. Opioid products are manipulated for abuse to obtain a more intense and faster onset of effect, as reflected by an increase in peak plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and/or a shorter time to C<sub>max</sub> (T<sub>max</sub>). In human abuse potential studies, these altered pharmacokinetics are associated with subjective reports of higher drug liking and greater desire to take the drug again [<xref rid="pnx195-B14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;18</xref>].</p><p>Attempts to reduce abuse of hydrocodone-containing combination analgesics have included restricting access by rescheduling these controlled substances from schedule III to the more restrictive schedule II classification, changing product labeling by adding warnings for prescribers, creating new guidelines that recommend shorter courses of therapy (usually&#x02009;&#x02264;3&#x02009;days and rarely&#x02009;&#x0003e;7&#x02009;days), and implementing prescription monitoring plans [<xref rid="pnx195-B19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref>]. The development of abuse-deterrent forms of IR hydrocodone combination products would afford an additional strategy to reduce abuse and diversion of these products. In the extended-release (ER) class of opioids, which account for only approximately 10% of all opioid prescriptions, there are a number of hydrocodone-, oxycodone-, and morphine-containing formulations that have been approved with abuse-deterrent product labeling [<xref rid="pnx195-B21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;28</xref>]. Given the widespread prescribing and availability of IR opioids and that abusers report a preference for IR over ER opioids due to their fast onset and ease of product manipulation [<xref rid="pnx195-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], there is an unmet need for IR opioids with abuse-deterrent features.</p><p>Benzhydrocodone is a hydrocodone prodrug that has been combined with acetaminophen (APAP) in a novel IR compound, benzhydrocodone/APAP. Chemically, benzhydrocodone is a new molecular entity formed by a covalent bond between hydrocodone and benzoic acid. The pharmacologically inactive prodrug benzhydrocodone is designed to quickly and effectively release its active hydrocodone component through esterase metabolism in the intestinal tract following oral administration. However, in vitro stability and human pharmacokinetic studies indicate that bypassing presystemic metabolism, as occurs with nonoral administration, results in significantly reduced conversion to hydrocodone [<xref rid="pnx195-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pnx195-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. While this means that benzhydrocodone is still susceptible to oral abuse, it may be a poor candidate for nonoral routes of abuse.</p><p>Here we report results of a trial to assess the relative bioavailability, IN abuse potential, and safety of benzhydrocodone/APAP compared with commercially available hydrocodone/APAP in nondependent recreational opioid users.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the 2015 FDA guidance on the evaluation of abuse-deterrent opioids [<xref rid="pnx195-B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This was a single-center, randomized, double-dummy, double-blind, two-part study comprising a Dose Selection phase (Part A) and a Main Study (Part B) to assess the IN abuse potential for benzhydrocodone/APAP. Part A was designed to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of crushed benzhydrocodone/APAP and crushed hydrocodone/APAP to be used in Part B.</p><p>The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, as outlined in the International Conference of Harmonisation Guidelines governing protection of human subjects and the obligations of clinical investigators, as well as in compliance with the FDA Code of Federal Regulations and Health Canada regulations. The study complied with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. Before study start, the protocol was reviewed and approved by an institutional review board (IRB). Prior to entry into the study, each subject was required to read, sign, and date an IRB-approved informed consent form.</p><sec><title>Subject Eligibility</title><sec><title>Screening</title><p>At screening, subjects were eligible if they were experienced opioid users with a history of opioid use for nontherapeutic reasons on 10 or more occasions within the past year and at least once in the 12&#x02009;weeks prior to the study. Subjects were eligible if they were male or female, 18 to 55&#x02009;years of age, and were not currently physically dependent on opioids, per the criteria listed in the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, 4th ed., text revision [<xref rid="pnx195-B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Eligible subjects were required to be experienced with IN insufflation (defined as&#x02009;&#x02265;3 IN uses in the year before screening).</p><p>Subjects were ineligible if they had chronic respiratory disease, clinically significant systemic disease, an anatomic nasal deformity (e.g., deviated or perforated septum), or ongoing rhinorrhea or nasal infection. Subjects with a history of drug or alcohol dependence or who had participated in, were currently participating in, or were seeking treatment for substance-related disorders (excluding nicotine and caffeine) were ineligible. Identical screening procedures were implemented for Part A and Part B, and subjects who participated in Part A were allowed to join Part B.</p></sec><sec><title>Qualification Phase</title><p>Eligible subjects in either Part A or Part B underwent an in-clinic naloxone challenge (to confirm the absence of physical opioid dependence) [<xref rid="pnx195-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and a Drug Discrimination Test (to ensure that the subject could identify active drug effects). In the Drug Discrimination Test, subjects received double-blind single IN doses of active drug and placebo, separated by at least 24&#x02009;hours. The active drugs administered during the Drug Discrimination Test were hydrocodone bitartrate powder (40&#x02009;mg) and crushed hydrocodone/APAP tablets (at the MTD) in Part A and Part B, respectively. Weight-matched microcrystalline-cellulose powder was given as placebo in both parts.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study Procedures</title><p>Part A was a randomized, double-blind, dose escalation (or reduction) trial in cohorts of eight subjects. Subjects of each cohort were assigned to one of two dose escalation sequences (four subjects each) testing IN administration of either crushed benzhydrocodone/APAP or hydrocodone/APAP vs placebo, administered on consecutive days, separated by approximately 24&#x02009;hours. Subjects were not permitted to blow their noses for two hours following dosing. After completion of each cohort&#x02019;s dosing, the resulting data were unblinded to evaluate the need for further cohorts.</p><p>The following three criteria were considered for the selection of the dose to be used in Part B: 1) The dose must be safe, well tolerated, and be completely insufflated by at least two of four subjects in each subcohort. 2) There must be a peak difference of 15 or more points vs placebo on the bipolar visual analog scale (VAS) for Drug Liking in at least two of the four subjects. 3) There must be no treatment-related, moderate to severe adverse events (AEs) that would pose a significant safety/tolerability concern and no clinically significant respiratory depression.</p><p>In Part B, all enrolled subjects received five in-clinic treatments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pnx195-T1">Table 1</xref>) separated from each other by a minimum 96-hour washout period and administered in one of 10 crossover sequences; each subject was assigned treatments by a computer-generated randomization scheme with a Williams design. Each treatment included a crushed IN dose and an oral intact capsule in a double-dummy design. Subjects were not permitted to blow their noses for two hours following dosing.

A linear mixed-effects model was used to analyze the natural log-transformed pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (C<sub>max</sub> and AUCs). The least squares (LS) geometric mean ratios (test/control) along with the corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. An additional post hoc measure of the abuse quotient (AQ&#x02009;=&#x02009;C<sub>max</sub>/T<sub>max</sub>) was calculated for each active treatment arm [<xref rid="pnx195-B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacodynamic Analyses</title><p>During Part B, Drug Liking was assessed at five minutes and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24&#x02009;hours postdose. At each of these time points, subjects were asked, &#x0201c;Do you like the drug effect you are feeling now?&#x0201d; Subjects responded on a 100-point, bipolar VAS anchored at 0 by &#x0201c;strong disliking,&#x0201d; at 50 by &#x0201c;neither like nor dislike,&#x0201d; and at 100 by &#x0201c;strong liking.&#x0201d; Ease of insufflation (&#x0201c;snorting&#x0201d;) was assessed at within five minutes postdose. For this rating, subjects utilized a 100-point, unipolar VAS anchored at 0 by &#x0201c;very easy&#x0201d; and at 100 by &#x0201c;very difficult.&#x0201d;</p><p>The study&#x02019;s primary pharmacodynamic (PD) end point was Drug Liking peak effect (E<sub>max</sub>). Secondary end points included time to peak effect (TE<sub>max</sub>) and area under the Drug Liking effect curve (AUE), which was calculated for time 0 to 0.5&#x02009;hours (AUE<sub>0&#x02013;0.5</sub>), 1&#x02009;hour (AUE<sub>0&#x02013;1</sub>), 2&#x02009;hours (AUE<sub>0&#x02013;2</sub>), 4&#x02009;hours (AUE<sub>0&#x02013;4</sub>), 8&#x02009;hours (AUE<sub>0&#x02013;8</sub>), and 24&#x02009;hours (AUE<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>).

For Part B, statistical analysis of the PD primary end point Drug Liking E<sub>max</sub> was performed using a mixed-effects model of ANOVA for the completer and the per-protocol populations. The model utilized SAS PROC MIXED to perform the analysis and included treatment (five levels), period (five levels), and sequence (10 levels) as fixed effects, and subject-nested-in-sequence as random effect. The five treatment levels were placebo, IN crushed benzhydrocodone/APAP, oral intact benzhydrocodone/APAP, IN crushed hydrocodone/APAP, and oral intact hydrocodone/APAP.</p><p>Based on the analysis of the ANOVA model, pairwise comparisons of LS means between individual treatments were conducted at the significance level of 0.05 (two-sided) for consistency, using a model-based <italic>t</italic> test. The differences of pairwise LS means were reported for each comparison. Based on equivalent dose, the primary null hypotheses of no difference in Drug Liking E<sub>max</sub> between the reference drug and test drug were tested for the following comparisons: IN hydrocodone/APAP vs IN benzhydrocodone/APAP and oral intact hydrocodone/APAP vs oral intact benzhydrocodone/APAP.

Treatment doses included one to four crushed tablets. For benzhydrocodone/APAP, two-tablet doses were the highest that could be reliably insufflated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pnx195-T2">Table 2</xref>).

Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal AEs reported after IN dosing in the treatment phase of Part B are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pnx195-T6">Table 6</xref>. Subjects who received IN benzhydrocodone/APAP reported these AEs more frequently than those who received IN hydrocodone/APAP, particularly with regard to AEs of nasal discomfort, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and throat irritation.

While there were no significant differences in the primary end point of Drug Liking E<sub>max</sub>, there were notable pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences that are likely to provide less incentive for IN abuse of benzhydrocodone/APAP vs hydrocodone/APAP. For example, pharmacokinetic data demonstrate an approximate 11% decrease in C<sub>max</sub> for IN benzhydrocodone/APAP compared with IN hydrocodone/APAP and a 15% to 50% reduction in cumulative hydrocodone exposure at early time intervals up to two hours. Correspondingly, subjects receiving IN benzhydrocodone/APAP showed significant reductions in Drug Liking VAS over the same early time intervals. Nasal irritant effects of IN benzhydrocodone/APAP were markedly greater compared with IN hydrocodone/APAP across several different nasal effect measures, a finding that may also contribute to a lower abuse potential of this novel prodrug combination.</p><p>The lack of differences in Drug Liking E<sub>max</sub> between benzhydrocodone/APAP and hydrocodone/APAP warrants further consideration. Due to the large volume of powder insufflated (1,100&#x02009;mg for benzhydrocodone/APAP and 850&#x02009;mg for hydrocodone/APAP) and in light of the fact that subjects were not permitted to blow their nose for the first two hours after administration, it is very likely that a significant portion of the intranasal dose was swallowed for both treatments. The swallowed portion of the benzhydrocodone dose was rapidly converted to hydrocodone in the intestinal tract and was therefore orally bioavailable. The portion of the benzhydrocodone dose that was absorbed via the nasal mucosa, however, was converted much less efficiently, and thus did not significantly contribute to early systemic hydrocodone plasma concentrations and Drug Liking effects. Consistent with this interpretation are findings from a study in which pure benzhydrocodone and hydrocodone active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) were administered intranasally. Under these conditions, there were marked reductions in all indices of hydrocodone exposure and Drug Liking for IN benzhydrocodone API relative to IN hydrocodone API [<xref rid="pnx195-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These collective findings confirm that benzhydrocodone retains its prodrug properties when absorbed via the nasal mucosa, regardless of whether it is derived from crushed tablets or the pure API.</p><p>With respect to the slower rise in drug plasma concentrations and Drug Liking observed in the current study for IN benzhydrocodone/APAP relative to hydrocodone/APAP, a longstanding and established literature suggests that this profile would correspond to a potential product that is less abusable. Across a range of psychoactive drugs, including opioids [<xref rid="pnx195-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pnx195-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], stimulants [<xref rid="pnx195-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], benzodiazepines [<xref rid="pnx195-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and barbiturates [<xref rid="pnx195-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the rate of rise of drug concentrations has been found to be a critical determinant of abuse potential. Specifically, a more rapid rate of rise in drug concentration corresponds to greater abuse potential. In a study by Comer et al., oxycodone engendered high levels of Drug Liking when infused intravenously over a two-minute interval but was not differentiated from placebo when infused over 15-, 30-, 60-, or 90-minute intervals [<xref rid="pnx195-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Such findings indicate that relatively small differences in rate of onset&#x02014;on the order of minutes&#x02014;can have marked effects on the overall abuse potential of an opioid formulation. It is important to note that differences in time to peak concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) have also shown to correspond to different Drug Liking scores between two formulations, even when peak concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>) were comparable [<xref rid="pnx195-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pnx195-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>These above-referenced findings are also consistent with a large behavioral economics literature documenting that drug abusers display impulsive behaviors relative to non&#x02013;drug abusers. That is, abusers steeply discount future rewards, generally preferring smaller, immediate rewards relative to larger, delayed rewards [<xref rid="pnx195-B35" ref-type="bibr">35&#x02013;37</xref>]. This inability to delay rewards has been described as a core feature of substance abusers. As such, an opioid formulation such as benzhydrocodone/APAP that significantly delays the onset of positive subjective effects can be expected, over time, to be a less preferred drug compared with similar IR opioids with rapid onset after intranasal administration.</p><p>To the extent that the abuse-related effects of opioids are a composite of both positive and negative pharmacodynamic effects, the finding of greater nasal effects for benzhydrocodone/APAP may also contribute to lower abuse potential relative to hydrocodone/APAP. At odds with this interpretation are Take Drug Again data indicating that, despite these aversive nasal effects, subjects reported similar willingness to take both opioid combinations again. A more comprehensive understanding of the abuse potential of these two drug combinations could be gleaned from additional studies that utilize drug choice as the dependent measure rather than relying solely on verbal reports of Drug Liking and Take Drug Again after a single drug administration. Experimental designs such as the multiple choice procedure, in which abusers make a choice between two drugs or between a drug vs money, can provide additional information on a drug&#x02019;s reinforcing effects that is pertinent to predicting real-world abuse [<xref rid="pnx195-B38" ref-type="bibr">38&#x02013;40</xref>]. Choice procedures have proven valuable for identifying differences in the relative abuse potential of opioids even under conditions where few or no differences in positive subjective effects were observed [<xref rid="pnx195-B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. For immediate-release opioids that must be orally bioavailable within a very short period of time to provide analgesia, such study designs may prove to be more informative than Drug Liking paradigms.</p><p>This study has a number of limitations. Subjects in this study were asked to insufflate relatively large volumes of the powdered drug combination within a short period of time. The exact proportions of nasal vs oral absorption under these conditions are not known, and it is therefore not possible to fully disentangle the relative contributions of each route to the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects. Anecdotal reports indicate that some individuals may prefer to insufflate small portions of powder in discrete intervals over time, a practice that may limit the volume of powder that is swallowed. It is also possible that abusers combine routes of administration within a single episode, insufflating one tablet of crushed hydrocodone/APAP while also taking one or more intact tablets orally. Understanding these abuse patterns may inform the development of future abuse potential studies of IR hydrocodone combinations. Subjects in this study were nondependent, recreational opioid abusers who administered opioids for nonmedical purposes 10 or more times in the past year and were experienced with the intranasal route of administration. These results, therefore, may not be generalizable to other populations such as na&#x000ef;ve abusers or opioid-dependent subjects.</p><p>In summary, benzhydrocodone/APAP showed lower systemic exposure to hydrocodone and lower Drug Liking in early time intervals (up to 2&#x02009;hours) compared with hydrocodone/APAP. Benzhydrocodone/APAP also produced greater adverse nasal effects than hydrocodone/APAP. This profile can be expected to provide a level of deterrence to the intranasal route of abuse for this combination.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Beatrice Setnik, PhD, of INC Research, for contributions to the design and conduct of the study.
