The aim of this study was to assess the impact on the HDL protein cargo of the intake of virgin olive oil (VOO) and two functional VOOs, enriched with their own PCs (FVOO) or complemented with thyme PCs (FVOOT), in hypercholesterolemic subjects. Eligible volunteers were recruited from the IMIM-Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (Spain) from April 2012 to September 2012. Thirty-three hypercholesterolemic participants (total cholesterol &#x0003e;200mg/dL; 19 men and 14 women; aged 35 to 80 years) were randomized in the double-blind, controlled, cross-over VOHF clinical trial. The subjects received for 3 weeks 25 mL/day of: VOO, FVOO, or FVOOT. Using a quantitative proteomics approach, 127 HDL-associated proteins were identified. Among these, 15 were commonly differently expressed after the three VOO interventions compared to baseline, with specific changes observed for each intervention. The 15 common proteins were mainly involved in the following pathways: LXR/RXR activation, acute phase response, and atherosclerosis. The three VOOs were well tolerated by all participants. Consumption of VOO, or phenol-enriched VOOs, has an impact on the HDL proteome in a cardioprotective mode by up-regulating proteins related to cholesterol homeostasis, protection against oxidation and blood coagulation while down-regulating proteins implicated in acute-phase response, lipid transport, and immune response. The common observed protein expression modifications after the three VOOs indicate a major matrix effect.</p><sec id="sec001"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN77500181">ISRCTN77500181</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by: the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (AGL2012-40144-C03-02; AGL2012-40144-C03-01 and AGL2012-40144-C03-03 projects and, AGL2009-13517-C03-01 and AGL2009-13517-C03-03 project), CIBEROBN, FPI fellowship (BES-2010-040766), ISCIII and Departament de Salut joint contract (CP06/00100).

Results from the European EUROLIVE study [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] showed that an increase in plasma HDL cholesterol, and a decrease of LDL oxidation, took place in a direct relationship with the phenolic compound (PC) content of the OO administered. These findings provided evidence to recommend the use of PC-rich OO, i.e. virgin olive oil (VOO), in order to achieve beneficial effects improving lipid profile and conferring protection from oxidative damage. The difference of PC content between OO and VOO is due to the elaboration process (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.internationaloliveoil.org">www.internationaloliveoil.org</ext-link>). To date, studies have been focused on hydroxytyrosol because it has been reported as being the most biologically active PC in OO [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In fact, the European Food Safety Authority considers that the health claim may be used only for OO which contains at least 5mg of hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives per 20g of OO [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As the phenolic concentration in most of the VOOs available on the market is too low to provide this daily amount of hydroxytyrosol, the enrichment of VOO with its own PCs could be a possible approach to assure the consumption without increasing caloric intake [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, the enrichment of VOO with its own PCs could lead to a bitter organoleptic taste caused by the presence of secoiridoids (hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives; oleruopein and ligstroside aglycones) [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, in terms of biological effects, synergistic effects with stronger improvements have been reported when different PCs are combined in comparison to single treatments [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For these reasons, the enrichment of a VOO by complementing its own phenols with PCs of aromatic herbs has been done in order to improve its nutritional profile and organoleptic characteristics. Thyme could enhance perfectly these features of a phenol-enriched VOO because it is one of the richest sources of flavonoids, such as naringenin, eriodictyol and apigenin and phenolic acids such as rosmarinic acid, ferulic acid and caffeic acid [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Approximately one hundred different proteins, not considered to be apolipoproteins (APO), have been identified as being associated with the HDL particle [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and linked to its cardioprotective properties. Analysis of the HDL protein cargo is, however, still in its early stages, and data concerning the HDL proteome as a biomarker for disease or functionality are limited. Moreover, studies with respect to the impact of dietary interventions on the HDL proteome are scarce [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and the effects of OO PCs on the complex structure of the HDL protein cargo have not yet been evaluated.</p><p>In this context, we hypothesized that sustained consumption of PCs from VOO, or functional phenol-enriched VOO, could modify the HDL proteome, which in turn could be related to their cardioprotective benefits. The objective of the current study was to assess the impact on the HDL protein cargo of a dietary intervention supplemented with a VOO or two different functional VOOs enriched with their own PCs (hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives; oleuropein and ligstroside aglycones) or complemented with thyme PCs (flavonoids, monoterpens, and phenolic acids), in hypercholesterolemic subjects from the VOHF study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Subjects and study design</title><p>The VOHF study aimed at assessing whether functional VOOs, enriched with their own PCs or with them plus complementary phenols from thyme, could have a nutraceutical effect on HDL lipoprotein functionality.

The random allocation sequence was generated by a statistician, participant enrolment was carried out by a researcher, and participants&#x02019; assignment to interventions according to the random sequence was done by a physician. Due to the fact that all participants received each one of the three VOOs, restrictions such as blocking were unnecessary. Intervention periods were of 3 weeks and VOOs were consumed daily distributed among meals. There was a 2-week washout period prior to VOO interventions during which a common OO was consumed. A 3-day dietary record was administered to the participants at baseline and before and after each intervention-period. A nutritionist personally advised participants to replace all types of habitually consumed raw fats with the olive oils, and to limit their PC-rich foods consumption during the clinical trial. A set of portable containers with the corresponding 25 mL of VOO for each day of consumption were delivered to the participants at the beginning of each VOO administration period. The participants were instructed to return the containers to the center after the corresponding VOO consumption period in order to register the amount consumed. Moreover, the metabolites hydroxytyrosol sulfate, hydroxytyrosol acetate sulfate, thymol sulfate and hydroxyphenylpropionic acid sulfate were measured in 24-h urine in order to monitor the compliance after the intake of two phenol-enriched VOO [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

Finally, two aliquots of the sample were analyzed by two different MS techniques, nano LC-MALDI MS/MS and nano LC-ORBITRAP-ESI MS/MS, to provide reliability and robustness (<xref rid="pone.0129160.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). The files generated with the two mass spectrometers were combined in order to identify the HDL-associated proteins. The final identified proteins were required to present more than one peptide-spectrum match (PSM), or to have a minimum confidence score &#x0003e; 30% and coverage &#x0003e; 10%, in order to ensure accuracy in the assignment of protein identifications. In addition, intracellular and cell surface proteins were removed as being possible contaminants. In order to identify the differentially expressed proteins after interventions with respect to first visit- baseline, only samples analyzed by nano LC-ORBITRAP-ESI MS/MS were used due to the precision of this method. Relative expression levels were calculated for each protein as a ratio by Proteome Discoverer; biological replicates from the three iTRAQ sequences were then combined in an Excel spreadsheet and the mean of the ratios of all proteins calculated. Proteins with a differential expression of at least 0.8-fold change, or 1.3-fold change relative to baseline, were considered differentially expressed. In addition, a cut-off inferior to 0.5, or superior to 1.5, was applied to establish the most relevant protein expression changes observed after each intervention, defined as stronger effects.

Significance levels were assessed with Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). The differentially expressed proteins were overlaid with IPA-curated canonical pathways to explore possible metabolic and cell signaling pathways that were over- or under-represented by the experimentally determined genes. Specifically, we analyzed the proteins that overlapped the three VOO interventions in order to investigate potential common OO PCs mechanisms. In addition, possible connections between mapped genes were evaluated and graphical networks were algorithmically generated. Nodes representing genes and gene products were linked by biological relationships. Networks were ranked by a score that defines the probability of a collection of nodes being equal to or greater than the number in a network achieved by chance alone.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Immunodetection assays</title><p>Apo A-I and Apo A-II, in the HDL pools, were determined using immunoturbidimetry assays (Horiba, Montpellier, France) in an autoanalyzer Cobas-Mira Plus (Roche Diagnostic System, Madrid, Spain).

Compared to baseline, significant increases were also observed in plasma Apo A-I and HDL-c after the three VOO intervention periods. However, no significant differences between the three VOO interventions, either in basal levels or in post interventions levels, were observed suggesting that in the present study, the enrichment of VOO with PC might not affect the ability of the VOO to increase different biochemical parameters and that the common matrix of the three VOO produced the key changes.

The fold-changes observed using immunodetection methods were in the same way than those observed in proteomics analysis, even though they did not reach the same fold-change values. We observed an increase tendency for Apo AI and Apo AII proteins and a decrease tendency for Clusterin and Haptoglobin, in agreement with the MS findings, although these tendencies did not achieve statistical significance probably due to the low sample size. Moreover, these results confirm that proteomics analyses are more sensitive to detect minimum changes in HDL proteome.</p><fig id="pone.0129160.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0129160.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Expression levels of Apo A-I, Apo A-II, Clusterin and Haptoglobin.</title><p>Expression levels of Apo A-I and A-II were measured by immunturbidimetry assays and clusterin and haptoglobin by ELISA assays in 10 HDL pools.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0129160.g005"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Clustering and pathway analysis</title><p>IPA analysis was performed to reveal the canonical pathways significantly affected (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) by OO phenols.

The greatest expression modifications were observed in 15 of the 127 proteins identified in the HDL fractions which were commonly up- or down- regulated after the three VOO interventions and might lead to a CVD protective HDL profile. A finding that encouraged us to highlight the effect of the fatty acid composition and the role of the PCs (lignans) of the common matrix of the three VOO tested on HDL remodeling. Moreover, IPA analysis revealed that several signaling pathways related to CVD were affected by OO PCs consumption. These data emphasize the key role of OO PCs in modifying pathways and conferring cardioprotective properties. PCs of VOO could be capable of transcriptional gene regulation inducing the down or up-regulation of proteins involved in functions related to cardiovascular risk [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Farr&#x000e0;s et al.[<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] observed how PCs from OO could exert an in vivo nutrigenomic effect on genes related to cholesterol efflux in humans. Moreover, PCs can modulate enzyme activities which may represent relevant antioxidant mechanisms by which dietary olive phenolic could have beneficial impact on cardiovascular health [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Phenol metabolites from olive have been observed to be incorporated to HDL particles where they could exert a local antioxidant protection and contribute to a functional enhancement of the HDL particle [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In concordance with these results, we observed that thyme phenols were also incorporated to HDL after FVOOT intervention and that olive phenol metabolites were higher after FVOO intervention compared to baseline and also to VOO. Furthermore, it has been recently reported that hydroxytyrosol contribute to the protection of endothelium reticulum (ER) stress which could cause unfolded or misfolded proteins and is considered as a new emerging risk factor for CVD. This newly described effect of hydroxytyrosol on ER stress could represent an alternative pathway through which olive oil phenols can modulate cell signaling and could impact HDL proteome and functionality [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first HDL proteomic study in humans that assesses the effects of PCs on the HDL protein cargo.</p><sec id="sec023"><title>Common effects of VOO interventions</title><p>Two well-known proteins related to cholesterol homeostasis, Apo A-I and Apo A-II, were significantly augmented after the three VOO interventions.

The increase in Apo A-I concurred with the results observed by Sol&#x000e0; et al. [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] in high CVD risk subjects after following a Mediterranean diet rich in VOO. PC could increase the expression and secretion of Apo-AI by regulatory mechanisms involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The increment of Apo-AI observed could lead to a possible improvement of HDL functionality by enhancing HDL cholesterol efflux via ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 and HDL antioxidative properties, because Apo A-I is the major HDL component involved in these activities [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Two proteins related to blood coagulation, SERPIND1 and A2M, were up-regulated after the three VOO interventions thus increasing the cardioprotective activity of the HDL particle.</p><p>PON3, which is an antioxidant enzyme associated to HDL and with lactonase activity [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], was up-regulated after all VOO interventions.

The effect of olive and thyme PCs on the main activities of these antioxidant enzymes should be further studied.</p><p>AHSG, ORM1, SERPINF2, and HP are acute-phase response proteins which were down-regulated after all VOO interventions.

Both proteins were down-regulated after all VOO interventions.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Stronger effects of each VOO intervention</title><p>In addition to the commonly modulated proteins, specific strong effects on the HDL protein cargo were also observed after each intervention. For instance, after the intervention with VOO, Apo C-I, Apo A-I, CETP, and PON3 were markedly up-regulated. Among these changes the up-regulation of CETP is noteworthy. This protein facilitates the transport of cholesteryl ester from HDL to Apo B-100 containing lipoproteins, and its plasma activity has been suggested to be inhibited after a PC intervention [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. To our knowledge, data concerning the effects of PCs on the expression and activity of CETP directly determined in HDL samples instead of plasma samples are limited. Changes in some immunoglobulins after VOO intervention were also reported. Immunoglobulins, which are secreted proteins related to innate immune response, could be plasmatic contaminants [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Nevertheless, the possibility that the HDL particle could act as a transporter of these proteins cannot be discarded and their role should be further studied.</p><p>From all the marked expression changes observed after the FVOO intervention, we would like to emphasize the up-regulation of the PON3.</p><p>We also highlight the strong up-regulation of Apo A-I, Apo A-IV, Apo C-II, and Apo C-III among the changes observed after the FVOOT intervention. Apo A-IV is mainly related to cholesterol homeostasis and oxidative protection, and has been associated with the cardioprotective properties of the HDL particle [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Although Apo C-III protein is present in HDL, it is also a major protein in VLDL. Chang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] showed positive associations between HDL- Apo C-III and the presence of CVD, suggesting that high levels of Apo C-III in the HDL particle may represent a class of dysfunctional HDL. Such results are, however, still controversial [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A redistribution of APOs between proatherogenic lipoproteins such as LDL to cardioprotective HDL could have been possible during the FVOOT intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Limitations and strengths</title><p>The pooling sample approach employed for the proteomic analysis, which was used to focalize primarily on the whole protein response and also to optimize the associated research expenses, constitutes the limitation of our study. Because of the methodological process used, the results of this work represent an exploratory analysis about the effect of a dietary intervention supplemented with a VOO or two different phenol enriched VOOs on the HDL proteome. However, the analysis is not sufficiently robust to draw conclusions about which of the three VOO tested has had the stronger effect on the HDL protein cargo. Future studies which analyze individual samples instead of pooling samples should be done to better assess the difference in the impact produced by the three types of VOO tested.</p><p>Moreover, HDL isolation is a key methodological point for proteomic analysis of HDL. Currently, the gold standard method for the HDL isolation is still under discussion and future attempts will be targeted towards improving isolation procedures [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Whilst sequential ultracentrifugation may alter HDL functionality, composition, and lead to a loss of lipid-poor Apo A-I it continues to be the most commonly used procedure in these studies. To date, nearly all proteomic studies of HDL have utilized density gradient ultracentrifugation based on methods for the isolation of HDL from human plasma [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the possibility exists that non-HDL plasmatic contaminants could have been present in the isolated HDL fraction.</p><p>One of the strengths of this study is its randomized and crossover design, which permitted the participants to ingest all VOO types. Moreover, the identification of the HDL-associated proteins was done by with two different MS techniques, Orbitrap and Maldi, which provide reliability and robustness to our identification results. Furthermore, it is important to note the novelty of the subject studied. The dietary modifications used in this study were very specific considering that only the concentration and the source of PCs of VOO administrated changed between interventions. The observed changes in the HDL proteome are smaller than those found when comparing a healthy population with patients with acute coronary syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or with hemodialysis treatment [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, our results are of great importance in the clinical practice meaning that small dietary changes can cause a remodeling of the HDL protein cargo improving the functionality of this particle.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec026"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of our study illustrate the potential of HDL proteomics to lead to new biomarkers for CVD prevention. These HDL proteomics findings help to understand the improvement of the HDL functionality by measuring the effectiveness of nutritional interventions in a similar manner to pharmacological treatments as proposed by Birner-Gruenberger [<xref rid="pone.0129160.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In conclusion, consumption of VOO, or phenol-enriched VOOs, has an impact on the HDL proteome in a cardioprotective mode that could enhance HDL functionality by up-regulating proteins related to cholesterol homeostasis, protection against oxidation, and blood coagulation while down-regulating proteins involved in acute-phase response, lipid transport, and immune response. The common protein expression modifications reported after the three VOOs indicate an important effect of the fatty acid and PC composition present in the common matrix of these VOO on the HDL remodeling. Further studies are needed, however, in order to assess the specific effects of each VOO incorporating different phenolic contents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0129160.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0129160.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0129160.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>TRIAL Protocol.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0129160.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0129160.s003"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Protein-protein interaction network for the 15 commonly differentially expressed proteins after the three VOO interventions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.string-db.org">http:www.string-db.org</ext-link>).</title><p>Proteins were presented with their gene encode symbol.
