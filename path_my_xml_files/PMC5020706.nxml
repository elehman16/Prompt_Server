Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor used to prevent gout that also has several positive effects on the cardiovascular system. The ALL-HEART study aims to determine whether allopurinol improves cardiovascular outcomes in patients with IHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The ALL-HEART study is a multicentre, controlled, prospective, randomised, open-label blinded end point (PROBE) trial of allopurinol (up to 600&#x02005;mg daily) versus no treatment in a 1:1 ratio, added to usual care, in 5215 patients aged 60&#x02005;years and over with IHD. Patients are followed up by electronic record linkage and annual questionnaires for an average of 4&#x02005;years. The primary outcome is the composite of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or cardiovascular death. Secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality, quality of life and cost-effectiveness of allopurinol. The study will end when 631 adjudicated primary outcomes have occurred. The study is powered at 80% to detect a 20% reduction in the primary end point for the intervention.

Patients with IHD often have reduced quality of life due to symptoms, limitation of activities and psychological impact of the disease. IHD is usually treated with a combination of medications, some of which improve symptoms and some of which improve survival. In addition, interventional procedures such as angioplasty, coronary artery stenting and coronary artery bypass grafting are used in selected patients.</p><p>Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that lowers uric acid levels and is licensed for the prevention of gout, but is not currently indicated for treating asymptomatic hyperuricaemia. Allopurinol is usually given in doses of 100&#x02013;900&#x02005;mg daily. Xanthine oxidase promotes oxidative stress which inactivates the antiatherosclerotic substance nitric oxide. Xanthine oxidase levels are raised in several conditions including coronary artery disease.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Allopurinol has several beneficial effects in CV disease. It improves endothelial function in patients with heart failure,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;13</xref> Allopurinol reduces the troponin rise in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention following ST elevation myocardial infarction (MI), which is strong evidence that downstream ischaemic cardiomyocytes stay alive better during an ischaemic insult in the presence of allopurinol therapy.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In patients with angina and angiographically documented coronary artery disease, allopurinol 600&#x02005;mg daily has anti-ischaemic activity in that it increases exercise time and reduces chest pain.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>In earlier observational studies in patients with hyperuricaemia<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and heart failure,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> allopurinol use was associated with reduced mortality. In recent case&#x02013;control studies, allopurinol use was associated with a reduced risk of MI<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and a reduced risk of non-fatal MI.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In a recent cohort study in patients with hyperuricaemia, patients on allopurinol treatment had a lower risk of MI, stroke or CV death and a lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with non-users of allopurinol.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> A study conducted in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink in patients aged over 65&#x02005;years with hypertension showed that allopurinol use was associated with a significantly lower risk of stroke and cardiac events than in non-exposed control patients. In this study, treatment with higher dose allopurinol (defined as 300&#x02005;mg daily) was associated with a significantly lower risk of stroke and cardiac events than treatment with a lower dose of allopurinol.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In patients with hypertension and impaired renal function, allopurinol use was associated with a lower risk of developing CV disease and all-cause mortality.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> A long-term follow-up study of a 2-year randomised trial of 113 patients with chronic kidney disease showed that long-term treatment with allopurinol may slow the rate of progression of kidney disease and reduce CV risk.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Various mechanisms have been suggested as to how allopurinol may improve CV outcomes. Xanthine oxidase is a major source of reactive oxygen species.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Allopurinol profoundly reduces oxidative stress by reducing superoxide anions and other free radicals, which reduces cardiac hypertrophy, increases tissue oxygenation and reduces atherosclerotic plaque rupture which is involved in MI.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;30</xref> Allopurinol may also reduce cardiac afterload by improving arterial compliance through reduced wave reflection and improved endothelial function. It is not clear whether it is uric acid lowering or other effects of allopurinol that are important, although in one study comparing allopurinol with the uricosuric agent probenecid, effects on endothelial function were only seen with xanthine oxidase inhibition and not by reducing uric acid with probenecid.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Finally, by inhibiting xanthine oxidase activity, allopurinol increases levels of hypoxanthine, which might increase ATP levels and thus energy availability to tissues. Extra ATP and oxygen availability produced by allopurinol might prevent downstream ischaemic cardiomyocytes from infarcting and thereby leading to heart failure during an ischaemic insult such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS).<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Some studies have suggested that higher doses of allopurinol (often 600&#x02005;mg daily) are necessary to achieve some of the positive CV effects,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref>

<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> which is why a dose of 600&#x02005;mg daily was selected for participants with normal renal function at baseline for the current study. It has previously been demonstrated that this can be given safely in patients with angina.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Most of the papers in this field still conclude that there is a need for large randomised controlled trials to answer the question of whether allopurinol is beneficial in patients with CV disease. The ALL-HEART study is the key outcome study that will provide the answer to this question in patients with IHD, in addition to providing robust data on any improvements in quality of life and an analysis of the health economics of the use of allopurinol in the UK National Health Service (NHS) in patients with IHD.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of the study is to determine whether the addition of allopurinol (up to 600&#x02005;mg daily) to usual therapy improves CV outcomes. The secondary objectives are to determine the cost-effectiveness of adding allopurinol to usual therapy, to determine whether allopurinol improves quality of life and to determine the safety and tolerability of giving allopurinol to patients with IHD (without a history of gout).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome is the composite CV end point of non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke or CV death. The secondary outcomes are non-fatal MI; non-fatal stroke; CV death; all-cause mortality; all CV hospitalisations; hospitalisation for ACS (includes hospitalisation for MI and for troponin-negative cardiac chest pain); coronary revascularisation; hospitalisation for ACS or coronary revascularisation, hospitalisation for heart failure, quality of life (EQ-5D and Seattle Angina Questionnaire); cost-effectiveness of allopurinol. Data will also be collected on the safety and tolerability of allopurinol in patients with IHD, in particular, discontinuations of allopurinol due to adverse events including gout flares and serious adverse skin reactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Ethics and trial registration</title><p>The study received approval from the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), local research and development departments and the national Caldicott guardian in Scotland.

The EQ-5D is a standardised instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. The Seattle Angina Questionnaire is a disease-specific self-administered functional status measure for patients with coronary artery disease. It measures five clinically important dimensions of health in patients with coronary artery disease (anginal stability, anginal frequency, physical limitation, treatment satisfaction, quality of life) and is sensitive to clinical change over time. The (UK) English version is used.</p><p>Data are recorded on a secure dedicated electronic case report form (eCRF) and study web portal with a central database at the Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow. Patients are randomised via a web portal based at the Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow or interactive voice response system in a 1:1 ratio to either allopurinol or no drug to be given in addition to their usual medications. No placebo is used in the study; the comparator arm is usual care. Randomisation is stratified by primary care practice, history of MI and history of stroke, with treatment group allocated according to randomly permuted blocks of variable size. The allopurinol (oral tablet) is prescribed generically by the primary care physician.</p><p>In patients with screening visit blood results showing eGFR&#x02265;60&#x02005;mL/min, allopurinol is started at 100&#x02005;mg daily for 2&#x02005;weeks, then titrated to 300&#x02005;mg daily for 2&#x02005;weeks, then 600&#x02005;mg daily (given as 300&#x02005;mg twice daily) if tolerated. Allopurinol is then continued at 600mg daily, given as 300mg twice daily, (or the maximum tolerated dose if lower) throughout the duration of the study for up to 5 years. In patients with screening visit blood results showing eGFR 30&#x02013;59&#x02005;mL/min, allopurinol is started at 100&#x02005;mg daily for 2&#x02005;weeks, then titrated to 300&#x02005;mg daily if tolerated. Allopurinol is then continued at 300&#x02005;mg daily (or the maximum tolerated dose if lower) throughout the duration of the study for up to 5&#x02005;years.</p><p>Patients with screening visit blood results showing eGFR 30&#x02013;59&#x02005;mL/min were only included in the study from 4 April 2016 onwards following implementation of a protocol amendment that aimed to improve recruitment, enrich the study population and increase the generalisability of the results. Owing to a temporary UK shortage of allopurinol 100&#x02005;mg tablet supply experienced in 2014, the protocol was amended to allow patients to start on 100&#x02013;150&#x02005;mg allopurinol for the first 2&#x02005;weeks. The dose was then uptitrated as above. The usual starting dose of allopurinol for the majority of patients in the study was 100&#x02005;mg.</p><p>Blood tests are sent to local NHS laboratories and results are checked and entered into the eCRF by study nurses. General practitioners (GPs) are alerted to any abnormal blood results. All patients are asked to report any adverse events, particularly rash or gout flares. GPs are also asked to report any serious adverse events that come to their attention during the trial. Patients experiencing a rash that could be due to allopurinol are withdrawn from allopurinol therapy. Patients withdrawing from allopurinol therapy are encouraged to still complete the planned follow-up within the study. Reasons for withdrawal from randomised therapy are recorded. Temporary withdrawals of allopurinol therapy are allowed at the discretion of a physician and reasons are documented. Dose changes are also allowed at the discretion of a physician at any time during the study (up to the maximum doses specified within the protocol). Any dose changes are recorded on the study eCRF and reasons documented. Patients undergo usual concomitant care during their participation in the trial and no interventions are prohibited during the trial.</p><p>Adverse reactions in association with allopurinol are rare in the overall treated population and mostly of a minor nature. The incidence of adverse reactions is thought to be higher in the presence of renal and/or hepatic disorders. The most common adverse reaction to allopurinol is rash (affects around 1% of patients). Usually this is a minor rash that resolves on stopping therapy. Rarely, the rash may be more serious and occasionally serious skin reactions such as Stevens Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis may occur. In the event of a serious skin reaction, allopurinol therapy should be stopped immediately and should not be restarted. Other possible adverse reactions to allopurinol include gastrointestinal disturbance such as nausea or vomiting, asymptomatic increases in liver function tests, hypersensitivity, angio-oedema and hepatitis. The summary of product characteristics lists other possible adverse reactions to allopurinol.</p><p>All serious adverse events are collected (whether thought to be related to randomised therapy or not). Non-serious adverse events (non-serious adverse reactions) are only collected if thought to be possibly, probably or definitely related to randomised therapy. Data on occurrence of skin rashes and gout flares are collected from all patients in the study. If any patients randomised to the non-allopurinol arm of the study later start allopurinol therapy for clinical reasons, this is recorded on the eCRF along with the reasons.

The final trial data set will be available to the trial statisticians and ALL-HEART investigators. The primary analysis will be intention-to-treat. The primary outcome and its individual components (CV death, non-fatal stroke and non-fatal MI) will be analysed as cause-specific time to event outcomes using Cox proportional hazards models. Treatment effects will be estimated in the form of HRs (allopurinol vs no treatment) with 95% CIs and p values (Wald statistic). Results will be summarised graphically using cumulative incidence functions. Prespecified subgroup analyses will be carried out by investigating the effects of treatment within each subgroup with heterogeneity of treatment effect across subgroup levels assessed by fitting interaction terms to the overall Cox models. Prespecified subgroups will include patients with high or normal urate at baseline, patients with eGFR&#x02265;60&#x02005;mL/min versus patients with eGFR 30&#x02013;59&#x02005;mL/min at screening visit, patients with CV or any hospitalisation within the year prior to entry to the study, patients aged &#x0003c;70&#x02005;years versus those aged 70+ years. Results for other CV outcomes and all-cause mortality will be analysed in a similar manner. Time to discontinuation of allopurinol treatment will be described.

Transition probabilities will be estimated from the trial data and used to make projections over the lifetime of the patients.</p><p>As described above, data will be collected on CV events, quality of life (using EQ-5D) and hospital admissions, as well as other resource use. We will estimate costs using sources such as Healthcare Resource Groups costs for England and Monthly Index of Medical Specialities for medicines.</p><p>Imputation techniques will be used to estimate the values for missing data based on the characteristics of the patient.</p><p>Prespecified subgroup analyses will include patients with higher than normal range uric acid at baseline versus patients with normal uric acid at baseline, patients aged &#x0003c;70&#x02005;years versus those over 70&#x02005;years, and patients with a CV or any hospitalisation in the year prior to entry to the study versus those without such a hospitalisation.</p><p>There will be uncertainty in the data, including sampling variation where data can be measured directly, and the selection of data from previous studies (eg, costs and disutility of events).

It will also provide important information on quality of life, safety of allopurinol in this patient population and health economics.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold> On behalf of the ALL-HEART study group.
