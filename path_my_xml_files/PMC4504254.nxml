This results in large datasets accumulated on the patient's devices, which can be used for individualized feedback. The effect of such feedback is investigated in this article.</p><p><bold><italic>Materials and Methods:</italic></bold> We developed an application that included a data-driven feedback module known as Diastat for patients on self-measured blood glucose regimens. Using a stepped-wedge design, both groups initially received an application without Diastat. Group 1 activated Diastat after 4 weeks, whereas Group 2 activated Diastat 12 weeks after startup (T1). End points were glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level and number of out-of-range (OOR) measurements (i.e., outside the range 72&#x02013;270&#x02009;mg/dL).</p><p><bold><italic>Results:</italic></bold> Thirty patients were recruited to the study, and 15 were assigned to each group after the initial meeting. There were no significant differences between groups at T1 in HbA1c or OOR events. Overall, all patients had a decrease of 0.6 percentage points in mean HbA1c (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and 14.5 in median OOR events over 2 weeks (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p><bold><italic>Conclusions:</italic></bold> The study does not provide evidence that data-driven feedback improves glycemic control. The decrease in HbA1c was sizeable and significant, even though the study was not powered to detect this. The overall improvement in glycemic control suggests that, in general, mobile phone-based interventions can be useful in diabetes self-management.</p></abstract><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="3"/><ref-count count="21"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s001"><title>Introduction</title><p>I<sc>t is well known that digital tools</sc> such as mobile applications (apps) can benefit patients in their management of chronic diseases.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Many such apps are available, in particular targeted toward diabetes management,<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and the potential for improved self-management is substantial.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;7</xref></sup> However, relatively few of the available apps are properly validated and evidence based.</p><p>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a disease that requires a large effort on behalf of the patient, as well as being one that the patient needs to actively manage at all times. Using continuous glucose meters may improve glycemic control in patients,<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> but the cost and discomfort of these devices mean many patients still manage their disease through self-measured blood glucose (BG) regimens. Also, although closed-loop systems may be technologically feasible, they are unlikely to be offered as a solution for patients for many years to come. Hence self-management of diabetes will continue to be the key part of the daily life for many patients worldwide. Thus, with the proliferation of smartphones and suitable apps, patients are likely to use these as part of their disease management in the foreseeable future.</p><p>Meta-analyses suggest that telemedicine is an effective method for managing diabetes, particularly in terms of reducing glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels,<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> with one study estimating a pooled effect of 0.44% (95% confidence interval, 0.61&#x02013;0.26%) reduction.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> As an example, the TeleDiab-1 study did show a substantial decrease in HbA1c level using a combination of an analytics system suggesting insulin and teleconsultation.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In a follow-up study it was shown that the insulin suggestion system was effective when used alone.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Because, by the nature of the disease, the apps are to be used long term, they need to be designed with this in mind. In particular, ease of use and low intrusion while still being perceived as useful are key factors to maintain usability.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Patients need to take a large number of variables into account in everyday situations in order to make good decisions in their disease management. In particular, counting carbohydrates can improve insulin administration and BG control, which in turn can improve patients' quality of life.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The proliferation of mobile phone-based digital diaries means that many patients carry a large volume of data on their disease and past management. Designing and utilizing a system for using these data, it would be possible to provide data-driven decision support to the patients, as a complement to a knowledge-driven approach.</p><p>The current study investigates whether a data-driven feedback module can improve self-management for T1D. To this end, a mobile phone-based diabetes diary was developed, and an additional feedback module called Diastat, which could be enabled on the device, was implemented. Thus users could use the diary without this module during an initialization period such that baseline characteristics could be measured before Diastat was enabled.</p><p>The goal of the self-management in T1D is to maintain a stable BG concentration within prescribed limits, usually 72&#x02013;180&#x02009;mg/dL, through balancing factors of current BG concentration, insulin administration, carbohydrate intake, and other factors such as physical activity. The process requires knowledge of the disease and controlling factors, awareness, and self-efficacy. How each individual manages these factors are largely left to the patients themselves. Hence, the main hypothesis of this study was whether providing feedback mechanisms through analysis of the patient's own data could be a useful way to make the patient more knowledgeable about his or her own disease and disease management, in turn reducing HbA1c and out-of-range (OOR) measurements. The system tested in this study aimed at increasing the knowledge and self-efficacy and providing advice at the critical time in disease management. The design was user-driven in the sense that feedback from previous studies was used, and test users were given the opportunity to give feedback on the components of the system.</p><p>The status of diabetes management is often measured in terms of HbA1c, which reflects the long-term BG level of the patients. However, more recently measures of variability have been shown to be important qualities that affect the overall health status of the patients.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In data from continuous glucose meters, variability is often quantified in terms of mean amplitude of glucose excursions, but this is hard to compute consistently based on self-monitoring of BG data. In the current study we have therefore chosen to focus on the number of OOR measurements during a prefixed period as a crude measure of variability. Patients who manage their diabetes better should experience fewer OOR events, and along with the HbA1c level this yields a more complete picture of the patient's diabetes management than any one of them alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s003"><title>Design</title><p>The trial was designed as a randomized stepped-wedge trial with two groups.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> After a run-in period of 5 weeks, Group 1 served as an intervention group, and Group 2 served as a control group for 8 weeks. Subsequently, Group 1 was dismissed, and Group 2 served as an intervention group for 10 weeks.

Inclusion criteria were as follows: older than 18 years of age; have had a diagnosis of T1D for at least 1 year prior to enrollment; and have basic familiarity with mobile phones and use a mobile phone on a daily basis.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were as follows: pregnancy; inability to understand or conform to the guidelines when presented with the app; and severe complications attributed to the diabetes that would render participation unethical or medically challenging, as determined by a physician. Use of insulin pumps or continuous glucose meters was not an exclusion criterion.</p><p>The study was presented to and a waiver was received from the Regional Ethics Committee of North Norway (protocol number 2011/1939-3).

This was achieved by pairing the mobile phone with a Bluetooth<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Bluetooth SIG, Kirkland, WA) adapter connected by wire to a BG meter.</p><p>Additionally, we created a data-driven feedback module called Diastat that was designed based on feedback and data in a preceding study.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The Diastat module consisted of three parts:

When sufficient BG data points were recorded in DD, a smoothed daily graph and weekly graph were presented to the users as a representation of their typical daily or weekly BG level, respectively. The graph was computed as a smoothed regression with periodicity. The main line was computed using a Nadaraya&#x02013;Watson estimator:

Empirically, we set &#x003c3;=(1, 4) h for the daily and weekly graphs, respectively. Adjustments to ensure continuity across midnight or end of the week were used. Hence, a patient who often had an elevated BG level at a certain time of day would get that presented as a spike in his or her graph. In addition, a gray area indicating uncertainty was overlaid to reflect variance. An underlying assumption of homoscedasticity (i.e., constant variance through each period) leads to the SD being estimated as<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>

A merging is applied to the trends to avoid cluttering the display such that only distinct trends were visible to the user. Because the trends were multiscale, a user could simultaneously have an increasing and decreasing trend or any other combination.

time T1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). The difference between the groups at T1 was not significant for either OOR or HbA1c level. If Diastat were an effective intervention, we would expect that Group 1 would have had a larger decrease in OOR events and HbA1c level than Group 2. At T1 the difference in mean between the groups was 0.51 percentage points in HbA1c (Group 1 higher, <italic>P</italic>=0.51) and in median 3.5 events in OOR (Group 1 higher, <italic>P</italic>=0.96). The difference in decrease between the groups from baseline to T1 was significant for OOR, with Group 2 having the largest decrease (<italic>P</italic>=0.012). This difference was not significant for HbA1c (<italic>P</italic>=0.86). Further details are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.</p><p>Overall, the patients had a drop of 0.60 percentage points in HbA1c level from baseline to T1. This was most clearly pronounced in Group 1 but was still significant in Group 2. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>, the effect is pronounced and fairly consistent across all the patients. There was a corresponding drop in OOR measurements, although this was most pronounced in Group 2. Running a linear regression model on the difference between HbA1c at baseline and T1 using age, sex, group, and baseline value showed that only the latter was significant. A larger decrease was observed in those with higher baseline (regression coefficient <italic>r</italic>=&#x02212;0.30, <italic>P</italic>=0.004). A corresponding analysis for OOR showed a significant effect of group (<italic>P</italic>=0.019) and baseline OOR (<italic>r</italic>=&#x02212;0.23, <italic>P</italic>=0.002) but not baseline HbA1c.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s011"><title>Discussion</title><p>There was little to no difference between the groups, and thus the study does not provide evidence that data-driven feedback to patients is useful in terms of medical indications. This does not mean that such feedback is not useful, only that the specific kinds of feedback considered in this study do not have the necessary impact to generate a difference between our two groups.</p><p>The study shows that the patients benefited from using the designed diabetes diary as an aid in controlling their diabetes in terms of both HbA1c and OOR measurements. Indeed, the decrease in HbA1c level is substantial and significant, which is remarkable given that the study was not powered to detect this difference. The overall effect can be attributed to study enrollment and thorough documentation of carbohydrate intake, activity, and insulin as well as training in carbohydrate counting. It is obviously not possible to disentangle the effect of the different factors in this study.</p><p>It is well known that interventions of any kind tends to improve health outcomes, and the decrease reported here from baseline to T1 is in line with other telemedical interventions.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The effect on HbA1c level reported here is at the higher end of what is seen in studies with educational interventions<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and meta-analyses,<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> indicating that the tool provides good support in diabetes management.</p><p>It is notable that the design of the app and Diastat was not guided by theory or models on health behavior. The main driving force behind development was patient input and considerations on which analytical methods were applicable to these data.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The lack of model guidance has been noted as a problem for the design of interventional tools with mobile technology.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> However, the rapid pace of technological development means that applying theoretical guidance in this domain is challenging. It should nevertheless be done to the extent possible. The intervention was a combination of three different modules, which makes it impossible to distinguish which elements were more or less effective. Trend detection and periodicity were aimed at informing and thus empowering the patient as a means of behavioral change. If one of these showed a disadvantageous pattern, the patient should take corrective action, such that the feedback acts as a cue to action. The situation matching was a method to provide decision support at the relevant time, as a &#x0201c;just in time&#x0201d; intervention. In all cases, using the patient's own data was intended to be motivational. The failure of effectiveness could be a combination of several factors where lack of theoretical guidance in the design process, too complex a system, and a heterogeneous study population are likely to be main contributors. A theory-driven design targeted at applicable groups could be a way to improve these techniques.</p><p>The design of the DD as a whole and the Diastat components in particular was performed with usability and ease of use in mind, and patient feedback was requested throughout the process. Thus, we believe that the resulting app was usable and effective.</p><p>We chose OOR events as absolute values rather than rate as an outcome in order to try to get the most accurate picture of the actual number of undesirable events. This choice is arguable, but because the intervention itself is likely to alter the patients' recording habits, changes in actual events may be masked if using rates as outcome. The patients were encouraged to record when they suspected hypo- or hyperglycemic events, and thus the number of OOR events should reflect the glycemic control.</p><p>The study has some limitations. The interventions were designed using participatory design with a limited number of patients but were not validated in terms of how the users perceived the information and if they correctly understood it and the implications. The target sample size was not reached, and hence there could be effects of the intervention that the study is underpowered for. There were relatively many patients who were withdrawn from the study in terms of HbA1c level. In the intention-to-treat analysis, any bias resulting from this should in principle be removed. The study population may not be representative of the diabetes patient group but be biased toward patients with a technological interest and interest in improving their condition. Thus the results may not generalize to groups that are less motivated or less technically inclined.</p><p>We included users of continuous glucose meters in the study so as not to deplete the patient pool. This choice may induce a bias, although it is not clear which way. These patients may be more technologically induced and interested in contributing to the study, or they may not see an added benefit and consider the system as an additional burden in an already complex disease management.</p><p>One of the major questions relating to digital tool for chronic disease management is the long-term effect of the tools. It is likely that there is a wear-out effect for many patients, hints of which may also be seen in our trial as the outcomes do not improve and indeed deteriorate after the first 3-month period for Group 2. Digital solutions need to be designed such that the tools are easy to use and have low intrusion while they are perceived as useful for the user.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>No adverse effects were reported.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s012"><title>Conclusions</title><p>There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of HbA1c or OOR measurements, and thus this study does not provide evidence that the data-driven feedback module described here is effective in diabetes management. The overall reduction in HbA1c level strengthens conclusions from other studies that simply providing patients with tools leads to short-term improvement of disease management.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s013" sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The study was funded by the Regional Health Authority of North Norway for 2012&#x02013;2014 (ID number 6934/HST1065-12).
