However, intraoperative blood loss estimation is inaccurate in most cases; therefore, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has defined it as a drop of hematocrit value of more than 10&#x000a0;% from the predelivery value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. PPH accounts for most cases of maternal morbidity and mortality in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The causes of PPH include trauma, retained placenta, abnormal coagulation that may be congenital or acquired, and atonic uterus, which is one of the preventable causes of primary PPH and accounts for more than 80&#x000a0;% of cases of primary PPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>In March 1997, Lynch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] published his brace suture for controlling PPH when other primary measures failed. The procedure was simple and effective with the primary goal to compress the uterus without occluding the uterine arteries or uterine cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

If this method fails, the next step will be vascular ligation (uterine, ovarian and hypogastric) or hysterectomy as a last resort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the current literature, a new modified technique of classic B-Lynch has been reported that has more effective compression on the uterus with added hemostatic effect of uterine artery ligation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Method</title><p>This prospective clinical trial was performed in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital, Cairo, Egypt, between January 2013 and October 2015.

It may occur after vaginal delivery (4&#x000a0;%) or caesarean births (6&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The most important step in the management of PPH is to identify and correct the underlying cause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Most of the cases of PPH can be controlled by traditional treatment modalities like uterotonics, uterine massage, bimanual compression and balloon tamponade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Uncontrolled PPH is usually managed by different uterine suture techniques (modified B-Lynch, and square suture) or with stepwise devascularization surgical procedures. These techniques have reported variable outcomes and many of the patients finally require emergency hysterectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A review of peripartum or cesarean hysterectomy reported an average mortality rate of 4.8&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This does not mean that hysterectomy caused this high maternal mortality, but critically ill situations requiring this surgery may eventually cause it. Indeed, cesarean hysterectomy is one of the most difficult obstetric surgeries and is always challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The surgical method of controlling uterine bleeding by inserting B-Lynch suture has been developed to reduce the incidence of emergency hysterectomy and to preserve fertility in these patients. Because of simplicity of application and less time taken to put the modified B-Lynch stitch, it should be the preferred choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Various parameters in the current study are compared as follows</title><p>In Khatoon et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], B-Lynch stitch was applied in 9 cases, i.e. 60&#x000a0;% after vaginal delivery and on 6 cases i.e. 40&#x000a0;% during cesarean section. In the current study the new technique of the B-Lynch stitch was taken on 160 cases during cesarean section, but actually, in our institute the new technique is now being performed on cases also after vaginal delivery and on the closed uterus to avoid the additional bleeding on incision of the uterus but this is still under trial.</p><p>In a prospective study of Hackenthal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], Hb difference is 3gm% after using the modified B-Lynch technique and in the current study, the mean intraoperative blood loss was 568&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;209&#x000a0;ml after classical technique and 324&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;105&#x000a0;ml after the new technique with a highly significant difference between the two groups.
