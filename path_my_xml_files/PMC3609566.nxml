To gain insight into mechanisms underlying these observations, we applied comprehensive lipidomic profiling to specimens collected from healthy adults enrolled in a randomized, crossover trial comparing a high-PA diet to a low-PA/high-OA (HOA) diet. Effects on insulin sensitivity (S<sub>I</sub>) and disposition index (DI) were assessed by intravenous glucose tolerance testing. In women, but not men, S<sub>I</sub> and DI were higher during HOA. The effect of HOA on S<sub>I</sub> correlated positively with physical fitness upon enrollment. Principal components analysis of either fasted or fed-state metabolites identified one factor affected by diet and heavily weighted by the PA/OA ratio of serum and muscle lipids. In women, this factor correlated inversely with S<sub>I</sub> in the fasted and fed states. Medium-chain acylcarnitines emerged as strong negative correlates of S<sub>I</sub>, and the HOA diet was accompanied by lower serum and muscle ceramide concentrations and reductions in molecular biomarkers of inflammatory and oxidative stress. This study provides evidence that the dietary PA/OA ratio impacts diabetes risk in women.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Western-style diets that are high in fat content have been linked to increased risk of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The two most prevalent fatty acids (FAs) in this diet are palmitic acid (PA; C16:0) and oleic acid (OA; C18:1), each present in approximately equal amounts as a percentage of dietary energy. Although total dietary fat consumption is comparably high in Mediterranean countries, epidemiological studies show that these populations have a paradoxically low prevalence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Owing to liberal use of olive oil, the typical Mediterranean diet is rich in OA and low in PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Numerous studies in cultured cells suggest that exposure to high PA disrupts insulin action and provokes proinflammatory signaling events, whereas OA mitigates these adverse responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). However, exposure of cells to high concentrations of PA may not reflect normal physiology, raising doubts about the clinical relevance of such experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Progress toward a clearer understanding of the role of specific dietary FA in conferring cardioprotective and/or antidiabetic benefits requires carefully controlled dietary intervention studies. Although previous dietary trials have attempted to elucidate the distinct metabolic properties of PA and OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), most of these studies relied on prescribed diets and/or did not actually measure the impact of the experimental diets on the FA composition of circulating and cellular lipids. As a result, the current literature on this topic is conflicted and difficult to interpret. In this study, we present new findings testing the hypothesis that replacing dietary PA with OA would impact insulin sensitivity. Because a previous study found sex differences in lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), we also sought to consider sex as a factor that might influence metabolic responses to a change in dietary FA composition.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Subjects, screening, and overall design.</title><p>This study was approved by institutional committees associated with the University of Vermont General Clinical Research Center (GCRC).</p><p>Healthy men (<italic>n</italic> = 9) and women (<italic>n</italic> = 9), aged 18&#x02013;40 years, with a BMI &#x0003e;18 and &#x0003c;30 were recruited for this study. These 18 volunteers constituted the cohort for all results in this article, except for studies of muscle protein expression and muscle ceramide content performed in an additional 10 volunteers (5 women and 5 men), who also participated in the same protocol (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db12-0363/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>).</p><p>Exclusion criteria included regular aerobic exercise training, dyslipidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), and evidence of type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).

After screening, all subjects ingested a low-fat/low-PA, baseline/control diet for 7 days (protein, 19.7% kcal; carbohydrate, 51.6% kcal; fat, 28.4% kcal; PA, 5.3% kcal; and OA, 15.9% kcal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). On the morning of day 8 of the baseline/control diet, fasting blood and muscle tissue were collected at 0700 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), and 3 h after a breakfast (one-third daily kcal), muscle biopsy and blood collection were repeated. Then, the subjects participated in a crossover study of 3-wk diet periods, consisting of a diet resembling the habitual diet and high in PA (HPA; fat, 40.4% kcal; PA, 16.0% kcal; and OA, 16.2% kcal) or a diet low in PA and high in OA (HOA; 40.1% kcal; 2.4% kcal; and 28.8% kcal, respectively) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db12-0363/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). These diets were separated by a 1-week period on the baseline/control diet. Repeat blood collection and muscle biopsy in the fasted and fed state were carried out on the 22nd day of each experimental diet (HPA and HOA). Further details concerning the diets were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db12-0363/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>.</p><p>In women, postexperimental diet evaluations took place in the luteal phase of the cycle prior to menstruation.

On the 21st day of each experimental diet, after an overnight fast in the GCRC, we completed a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). We used a modified version of the MINMOD program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) to estimate the following parameters: glucose effectiveness (Sg), the capacity of glucose to mediate its own disposal; acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg); insulin sensitivity index (S<sub>I</sub>), the capacity of insulin to promote glucose disposal; and disposition index (DI): AIRg * S<sub>I</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).

While verifying the adequacy of the data from the intravenous glucose tolerance test, we noted that some women seemed to exhibit lower nadirs for blood glucose concentration during one of the diets. Since we knew that some of these women were more physically fit than others, we elected to explore the correlation of peak oxygen consumption with cycling exercise (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) with diet change in S<sub>I</sub>. VO<sub>2peak</sub> was measured at screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).

Because lipid metabolism fluctuates dramatically in response to acute changes in nutrient and/or hormonal status, biological specimens were collected in both the fasted and postprandial states. The heat maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref> provide compelling evidence that even a short-term change in dietary fats can have broad-ranging effects on circulating as well as muscle lipids. Thus, when comparing the HOA to the HPA diet, the PA/OA ratio was increased in nearly every lipid pool analyzed including muscle TAG, DAG, and phosphatidylcholine (PC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). The impact of the diets on the FA composition of lipids was universally evident in every subject, and in general, this effect was more robust in the fed than the fasted state. Notably, the diet also affected the PA/OA ratio measured in circulating NEFAs, which are derived principally from lipolysis of adipose tissue TAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). Likewise, the pronounced diet-induced shift in the PA/OA ratio of mitochondrial-derived AC metabolites, both in the circulation and in muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic> and <italic>F</italic></xref>), indicates that the diets had a strong influence on the types of FA undergoing &#x003b2;-oxidation, not only in the fed state but also during fasting.

In women, a diet-induced shift favoring less saturation and more monounsaturation of cellular lipids (lower PA/OA ratio) was associated with improvements in both DI and S<sub>I</sub>. All women were studied in the postluteal phase of the menstrual cycle, verified by measurements of estrogen and progesterone. Considering that estrogen can alter expression of genes linked to regulation of lipid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), these results may not necessarily be generalizable to nonovulating women. Whereas a diet effect on S<sub>I</sub> was evident in women, results in men were variable, implying that sex influences the interplay between dietary FA composition and clinical outcomes. However, due to insufficient power, we are unable to form firm conclusions regarding gender specificity.</p><p>Both candidate and unbiased lipidomic profiling approaches were used to gain a comprehensive view of how the experimental diets impacted systemic lipid composition. Remarkably, we found that a relatively short-term change in the quality and quantity of specific dietary FA affected the FA composition of nearly every class of biological lipids evaluated in blood and muscle biopsy specimens. We also targeted several prominent lipid metabolites previously implicated as mediators and/or strong markers of insulin resistance. Notably, the HPA diet increased circulating levels and muscle content of ceramides, thus resembling abnormal ceramide metabolism observed in subjects with insulin resistance and/or type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). These exciting results provide the first demonstration that a shift in dietary FA composition can actually alter systemic and cellular ceramide metabolism in humans. Surprisingly, however, our analysis failed to detect a convincing association between ceramides and S<sub>I</sub>, suggesting that short-term changes in these lipid molecules do not necessarily influence insulin action.</p><p>Intriguingly, in women, the HPA diet also increased muscle and blood concentrations of MCAC measured in the fed state. Moreover, the circulating concentration of MCAC in the fed state emerged as a strong negative correlate of S<sub>I</sub> when women were consuming the HPA diet. Earlier studies likewise identified a link between insulin resistance and MCAC assessed in human muscle and primary human skeletal myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Most MCAC are generated in the mitochondrial matrix and originate from medium-chain acyl-CoA intermediates of the &#x003b2;-oxidation pathway. Accordingly, we measured muscle mRNA abundance of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase but did not find a diet effect on expression of this gene (not shown), pointing to other explanations for the HPA diet-induced rise in MCAC content.</p><p>Yet unclear is whether the AC can act as signaling molecules or if these metabolites are strictly reporting on changes in mitochondrial substrate flux and/or load. Although convincing evidence that AC play a direct role in mediating insulin resistance is lacking, support for this possibility comes from a recent study showing that exposure of RAW264.7 cells to low micromolar concentrations of MCAC stimulated activity of the stress-sensitive transcription factor nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Alternatively, these metabolites might serve as markers of mitochondrial stress and/or cellular events that are known to influence insulin action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). For example, accumulation of lipid-derived medium chain acyl-CoAs might reflect a mitochondrial environment that is conducive to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), perturbations in cellular redox balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), and/or inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).</p><p>Fitting with potential shifts in cellular stress, we speculate that the HOA diet lowered oxidant and inflammatory stress in women but not men. In support of this possibility, we found that serum concentrations of IL-6 and ferritin were lower in women during the HOA diet. Circulating levels of IL-6 are elevated in patients with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes, although the role of this cytokine as a direct mediator of insulin resistance remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Ferritin, best known as a major iron storage protein, is also recognized as an acute-phase protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Its expression is upregulated by cytokines and ROS during conditions of infection and ramped inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Under these conditions, the robust increase in circulating ferritin serves to reduce iron bioavailability, thereby mitigating ROS production and oxidant damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Because iron intake was identical during the two diets and the treatment order was randomized, we surmise that increased ferritin levels in women consuming the HPA diet might reflect heightened oxidative and/or inflammatory stress. It is also important to consider that the distinct antioxidant properties of the vegetable oils used to formulate the HOA and HPA diets might have contributed to the overall effects of the two experimental regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Notably, however, with the exception of the virgin olive oil added to the HPA diet, the oils used in this study were highly purified (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db12-0363/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>).</p><p>Although the molecular mechanisms linking lipid dysregulation, inflammation, and/or oxidative stress to insulin resistance are still unfolding, strong evidence implicates a role for JNK1, a member of the mitogen-activated family of serine kinases that serves as a major hub for several discrete signaling pathways involved in monitoring metabolic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). In both cultured cells and animal models, JNK1 is activated in response to IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, ROS, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and exposure to surplus lipids, resulting in serine phosphorylation and consequent inhibition of IRS-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Most compelling, prolonged high-fat feeding increases JNK phosphorylation in rodents, and genetic ablation of JNK1 protects against obesity-induced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Likewise, in the current study, the insulin-sensitizing properties of the HOA diet in women were accompanied by a reduction in muscle levels of pJNK. Our findings suggest that a shift in the FA composition of the diet was sufficient to modulate JNK activity, which in turn contributed to corresponding changes in insulin action. At this stage, we are uncertain as to whether JNK was responding to fluctuations in ROS production, inflammatory tone, endoplasmic reticulum stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), and/or other lipid-sensitive signaling molecules. Perhaps subtle perturbations in multiple pathways converged at the JNK nexus.</p><p>Interestingly, in women but not men, physical fitness was identified as a strong, positive modifier of changes in cellular lipid composition as well as S<sub>I</sub>. These results suggest that the extent to which dietary FAs penetrate cellular lipids and affect glucose homeostasis in women depends on physical activity. Because exercise promotes metabolic wellness, a common assumption is that physically inactive individuals have the most to gain by improving dietary habits. Instead, we found that the most active, physically fit women gained the greatest benefit from replacing PA with OA, suggesting that exercise and dietary OA acted synergistically on a common molecular target. Whereas a previous study found that OA increases the energy cost of exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), perhaps by promoting mitochondrial uncoupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), investigations to delineate the distinct uncoupling properties of specific FAs have produced conflicting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Exercise also decreases the saturation index of muscle lipids and promotes synthesis, storage, and turnover of intramuscular TAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Thus, the strong interaction between diet and physical activity might relate to adaptations in muscle lipid droplet metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Hinting at this possibility, we found that diet-induced changes in the fractional OA content of muscle TAG correlated positively with VO<sub>2peak</sub> in women.</p><p>In summary, this investigation supports the notion that palmitate imposes a heavy metabolic burden on subcellular machinery, including muscle mitochondria, which was most evident in women during the period after consumption of an HPA meal. In simple terms, when women were consuming the HPA meals, we found less FA safely sequestered into muscle TAG and more FA routed toward the production of AC and ceramides. In women, the metabolic effects of the HPA diet were dependent on physical fitness and associated with decreased insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. Still uncertain is whether the results of this study point toward sexually dimorphic responses to the experimental diets or, alternatively, if larger cohorts, longer exposures, and/or interventions in populations at risk for diabetes might reveal comparable effects in men and women. These are important questions that highlight the need for additional dietary trials to better establish the efficacy of replacing palmitate with oleate as a nutritional strategy to combat chronic metabolic disease.</p></sec>
