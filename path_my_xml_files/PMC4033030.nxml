The institutional review boards of all participating centres approved the study protocol; all patients provided written informed consent before entering into the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Patients and procedures</title><p>The design of the REFLEX trial has been described in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Briefly, eligible patients were aged 18&#x02013;50&#x02005;years with an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 0.0&#x02013;5.0, had experienced a single demyelinating event suggestive of MS within 60&#x02005;days prior to study entry and had &#x02265;2 clinically silent lesions on a T2-weighted brain MRI scan with a size of at least 3&#x02005;mm, at least one of which is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Based on these characteristics, these patients were considered to be at high risk of conversion to MS.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to receive the serum-free formulation of IFN &#x003b2;-1a, 44&#x02005;&#x000b5;g subcutaneously three times a week or once a week, or placebo for 24&#x02005;months or until conversion to CDMS, as defined by either a second event suggestive of MS or a 3-month sustained increase (&#x02265;1.5 points) in Expanded Disability Status Scale score. The double blind (DB) period was defined as the interval between randomisation and conversion to CDMS, or study discontinuation, or 24&#x02005;months, whichever occurred first. The primary end point of the study was time to McDonald MS (2005 criteria),<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and has previously been reported.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>MRI assessments</title><p>MRI assessments were made every 3&#x02005;months from baseline to Month 24. For patients who converted to CDMS before Month 24, MRI scans were subsequently performed at 6-month intervals at predefined time points with respect to the baseline MRI (at Month 6, Month 12, Month 18 and Month 24). The same MRI machine at each centre was used for all scans for each patient throughout the study. Analysis and evaluation of MRI scans were performed centrally at the VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.</p><p>The main MRI end point of the study was the mean number of combined unique active (CUA) lesions per patient per scan (main secondary endpoint). A CUA lesion was defined as a new or persisting gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesion on T1 MRI or a new or enlarging lesion on T2 MRI (non-enhancing on T1 MRI), and lesions identified in both scans were only counted once. Additional secondary end points described in this paper were: mean number of new non-enhancing T2 lesions per patient per scan, mean number of new Gd+ lesions per patient per scan, T2 lesion volume, mean number of new T1 hypointense (non-enhancing) lesions per patient per scan, T1 hypointense (non-enhancing) lesion volume, T1 Gd+ lesion volume, and brain volume determined at yearly intervals. The effect of treatment on the percentage change in brain volume from baseline was assessed using the Structural Image Evaluation using Normalisation of Atrophy method.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Clinical assessments</title><p>Clinical assessments, including the monitoring of relapses, have been described previously.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Efficacy analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which consisted of all randomised patients, analysed by their original allocation.</p><p>Analysis of CUA lesions per patient per scan was part of the hierarchical statistical testing process described previously,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and consisted of the pairwise comparison of the three treatment groups at the 0.05 significance level using a non-parametric analysis of variance on ranks model, including treatment and randomisation stratification factors as covariates. The main MRI-based secondary end point analysed in the confirmatory analysis was the mean number of CUA lesions per patient per scan from randomisation to Month 24 or conversion to CDMS, whichever occurred first (DB period). The mean number of CUA lesions per patient per scan over the whole study period (from randomisation to Month 24, irrespective of conversion to CDMS) was considered an exploratory analysis.</p><p>Treatment effect sizes with corresponding 95% CIs were estimated using an adjusted negative binomial model that included treatment and randomisation factors as covariates. Treatment effects are given as ratios because of the logarithmic structure of the model used. The other MRI end points (T2, T1 hypointense and Gd+ lesions) were analysed in the same manner as CUA lesions. Brain and lesion volume were reported using descriptive statistics.</p><p>The patient baseline subgroups analysed were all predefined and comprised those used to stratify the randomisation process (age &#x0003c;30&#x02005;years or &#x02265;30&#x02005;years, steroid use or not at first attack, monofocal/multifocal presentation of first attack, presence or absence of Gd+ lesions at baseline) and other subgroups of interest (sex, &#x0003c;9 or &#x02265;9 T2 lesions at baseline). A post hoc analysis was performed to test the treatment-by-subgroup interactions. A negative binomial model was fitted with treatment, each of the six subgroups and the six treatment-by-subgroup interactions. Backward elimination was used to select the model with the best fit.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patients, conversion to MS and safety</title><p>A total of 701 patients were screened and 517 were randomised (ITT population: subcutaneous&#x000a0;IFN &#x003b2;-1a three times a week, n=171; subcutaneous&#x000a0;IFN &#x003b2;-1a once a week, n=175; placebo, n=171); 515 patients received the study drug or placebo.

The extension to the REFLEX trial will provide additional insight into the long-term effects of the three times a week and once a week dosing regimens of IFN &#x003b2;-1a, 44&#x02005;&#x000b5;g subcutaneously;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> however, previous studies suggest that MRI outcomes are useful measures of later clinical outcomes and that IFN &#x003b2; therapy is likely to maintain. Longer-term studies in patients with relapsing MS or CIS have found that the benefits of IFN &#x003b2; are maintained beyond 2&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Also, MRI outcomes after short-term therapy with IFN &#x003b2; were predictive of both relapses at later time points<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and disability (in combination with the number of relapses).<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>A growing body of evidence suggests that earlier IFN &#x003b2; treatment of patients with MS or with CIS is associated with improved clinical and paraclinical outcomes compared with delayed treatment.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The REFLEX trial demonstrated that early subcutaneous IFN &#x003b2;-1a treatment delayed the time to CDMS, with additional benefit of the higher-dose regimen over the lower-dose regimen.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This secondary analysis of REFLEX found improved MRI outcomes in patients treated with both dosing regimens compared with placebo, and also found additional benefit of the higher-dose regimen. Together, these data support the rationale for early subcutaneous IFN &#x003b2;-1a treatment of patients with CIS suggestive of MS; however, these potential benefits of early treatment have to be balanced against the risk of treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jnnp-2013-306289-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1267" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Paul Wilmott of Caudex Medical, Oxford, UK, for editorial assistance (supported by Merck Serono SA Geneva, Switzerland, a subsidiary of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> NDS, GC, LK, MSF: drafting/revising manuscript for content, including medical writing for content; study concept or design; analysis or interpretation of data; acquisition of data; study supervision or coordination.
