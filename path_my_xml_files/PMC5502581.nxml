Briefly, 4&#x02013;6-month-old, bacille Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) vaccinated, healthy infants were recruited, but excluded and referred in writing to public clinics for IPT, which is provided free of charge, if they had LTBI, TB disease or household contact with TB disease. Study staff were not empowered to enforce clinic attendance, IPT prescription or adherence to IPT. IPT was not a trial intervention but was provided as part of routine care. Public clinics are staffed by nurses and use standardised IPT and TB treatment algorithms. International and South African national guidelines do not recommend QuantiFERON<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-TB GOLD In-Tube (QFT; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) screening of young children as an indication for IPT in high TB burden countries. IPT consisted of 6 months of 10&#x02013;15 mg/kg isoniazid (INH) taken five times weekly. Infants were randomised to receive MVA85A vaccine/placebo and followed for a median of 5 years for incident TB disease using a hierarchy of three endpoint definitions.<xref rid="i1027-3719-21-7-778-b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This analysis uses the clinical endpoint definition&#x02014;treatment for TB disease&#x02014;to standardise the outcome of interest during and after the trial.</p><p>LTBI was defined as being positive on QFT or the tuberculin skin test (TST; positive if diameter &#x02a7e; 10 mm) performed at enrolment, at day 336 and at the end of the trial for all children and at investigation for suspected TB disease. &#x02018;Date of LTBI&#x02019; was defined as the earliest date of a positive test.

We performed an exploratory analysis to examine a possible rebound in risk of TB disease occurring 1.5&#x02013;2.5 years after the documented start of IPT in LTBI children. Compared with LTBI children who did not receive IPT, there was no statistically significant difference in risk over this period (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our findings confirm that infant MVA85A boost vaccination neither provides added protection to BCG against TB disease nor does it adversely affect TB disease risk up to 5 years after vaccination.<xref rid="i1027-3719-21-7-778-b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This study population had an exceedingly high incidence of TB disease, which was greatest in children with LTBI who bore more than one third of the disease burden. Although IPT was 85% protective, IPT did not completely reduce the TB risk in LTBI children to that of non-infected children; children with LTBI who received IPT were still 2.5 times more likely to develop TB disease than non-LTBI children. Furthermore, the protective effect of IPT waned rapidly beyond 6 months after the expected date of completion of IPT. Children who became infected, but who did not receive IPT, were at highest risk of TB disease between the ages of 1 and 2.5 years, after which time TB disease risk approximated that of IPT recipients. It is also notable that racial ancestry played an important part in susceptibility to childhood TB in this region, with children of mixed-race ancestry having more than twice the risk of TB disease by the age of 5 years than Black African children, even after adjusting for IPT. This finding is supported by our previous data from a large cohort study of adolescents in the same study community.<xref rid="i1027-3719-21-7-778-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>The high cumulative risk of TB disease among children with LTBI who were not documented to have started IPT (33%) is similar to that reported by Trauer et al.<xref rid="i1027-3719-21-7-778-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> (36%) and Sloot et al.<xref rid="i1027-3719-21-7-778-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> (33%). Pre-chemotherapy-era studies also showed that 10&#x02013;30% of young children with LTBI develop disease.<xref rid="i1027-3719-21-7-778-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The impact of IPT, which has clear protection against TB disease and is thus ethically mandatory for LTBI children, should therefore be considered carefully when estimating TB case accrual and sample size in future TB efficacy vaccine trials. Although we showed a modest difference in the effectiveness of IPT by study arm, with IPT being approximately 20% less effective in the placebo arm, we are unable to explain this observation, which may be a chance finding. We estimate that IPT prevented 62 TB cases among LTBI children in this trial, whereas an additional 127 TB cases could potentially have been prevented if there had been 100% IPT uptake. However, given the modest uptake of IPT in this study despite written referral and adherence support, health systems in developing countries may struggle to achieve optimal coverage. It must also be acknowledged that current international and South African national guidelines do not recommend the use of QFT screening as an indication for IPT in young children living in TB-endemic countries. High rates of TB transmission in high TB burden countries also lead to the risk of reinfection starting immediately following completion of IPT, resulting in a limited impact of IPT after completion of treatment.<xref rid="i1027-3719-21-7-778-b14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;17</xref></p><p>We previously reported a lower effectiveness of IPT (52%) among a smaller group of infants with a history of household TB exposure and/or LTBI.<xref rid="i1027-3719-21-7-778-b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Differences in these estimates might be explained by differences in study population and the denominator and a clinical trial effect, whereby participants in this study were more rigorously followed and investigated for TB disease. However, the 85% effectiveness of IPT among children with LTBI reported here is equivalent to the 88% reported by Trauer et al.<xref rid="i1027-3719-21-7-778-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>The message for national health systems and TB control programmes in high-burden developing countries is clear: IPT administration to children with LTBI reduces the risk of TB disease from 16-fold to 2.5-fold that of non-infected children, with one case of TB disease prevented for every four children with LTBI who were documented to have started IPT. This important finding should act as a powerful stimulus for more rigorous and effective implementation of TB contact tracing and IPT policies to prevent childhood TB in high-burden countries.</p><p>Our finding that MVA85A boost vaccination did not alter TB disease risk up to 5 years of age is based on the third, least rigorous clinical trial case definition: provision of anti-tuberculosis treatment by an attending clinician.<xref rid="i1027-3719-21-7-778-b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This was a pragmatic approach, as post-trial follow-up relied on health service data and we did not have access to standardised clinical, radiographic and microbiological investigations to apply the most rigorous case definitions. TB incidence in the post-trial period may therefore have been underestimated by the use of passive surveillance compared with the in-trial incidence obtained from active surveillance. However, we do not anticipate that this approach would have biased estimation of the vaccine or IPT effects, which would have been affected equally. It is also possible that the clinical TB case definition included false-positives in estimates of TB disease rates and tend to negate true differences in incidence between groups. It is therefore notable that the clinical TB disease endpoint was sufficiently robust to detect statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences in TB disease incidence in IPT recipients and non-recipients, and in children from different parent-reported racial ancestries.</p><p>The higher risk of TB disease among mixed-race children than in Black African children persisted after adjusting for confounders. A small number of studies have reported a genetic predisposition to TB disease.<xref rid="i1027-3719-21-7-778-b18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;22</xref> This has been attributed to the <italic>NRAMP1</italic>, <italic>VDR</italic> and <italic>MBL</italic> genes, among others,<xref rid="i1027-3719-21-7-778-b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> although results have been inconsistent,<xref rid="i1027-3719-21-7-778-b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> possibly because non-genetic host factors, environmental factors and pathogen virulence factors obscure true genetic associations.</p><p>A limitation of our analysis is that LTBI was defined using TST and QFT results obtained during the follow-up period of the trial. It is certain that additional LTBI occurred in the post-trial period and may have been associated with observed TB disease cases. This factor might have resulted in overestimation of TB incidence rates in non-LTBI children and underestimation of rates in LTBI children, but is unlikely to have impacted the association between racial ancestry and TB disease, or impact of IPT. We believe that the transient beneficial effect of IPT is explained by the high level of infection in our setting, which may limit the generalisability of our findings to populations with much lower rates of TB transmission. The nature of data obtained from the ETR did not allow us to precisely define the follow-up time. Post-trial changes in key identifiers, such as names, might have resulted in missing case records and corresponding underestimation of TB disease incidence. IPT was administered in non-trial conditions and adherence data were not available, nor were data on potential confounders other than sex, age and race; we therefore adjusted only for these available potential confounders. We also assumed that all children who did not develop TB disease survived until the date of censorship.</p><p>Despite these limitations, our data send a powerful message to public health officials in TB-endemic, resource-limited countries. IPT has the potential for a six-fold reduction in TB disease rates among young children with LTBI and should be implemented optimally and without further delay. The message for childhood TB research programmes is equally clear. IPT is integral to the standard of care for children in TB-endemic countries and the impact of IPT must be carefully considered in the design of TB vaccine clinical trials.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the study participants in the MVA85A 020 infant vaccine trial, their parents and guardians, and the trial team at the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative.
