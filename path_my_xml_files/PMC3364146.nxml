Participants complete pre-study, post-study and monthly surveys about their health and utilisation of health services. A post-study clinical audit will be conducted to validate self-reports about influenza vaccination and visits to the university health service due to influenza-like illness (ILI) amongst a subset of participants. 600 participants older than 18 years with monthly access to the Internet and email will be recruited. Participants who (i) discontinue the online registration process; (ii) report obtaining an influenza vaccination in 2010 before the commencement of the study; or (iii) report being influenced by other participants to undertake influenza vaccination will be excluded from analysis. The primary outcome measure is the number of participants obtaining influenza vaccination during the study. Secondary outcome measures include: number of participants (i) experiencing ILI symptoms, (ii) absent from or experiencing impairment in work or study due to ILI symptoms, (iii) using health services or medications due to ILI symptoms; (iv) expressing positive or negative attitudes or experiences towards influenza vaccination, via their reasons of receiving (or not receiving) influenza vaccine; and (v) their patterns of usage of <italic>Healthy.me </italic>(e.g., frequency and timing of hits, duration of access, uptake of specific functions).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will provide new insights about the utility of online social networking and PCHMS for public health and health promotion.

Despite the unpredictable nature of influenza severity and spread on a population scale, understanding the behaviour of individual patients during seasons of respiratory disease has become essential for the planning and execution of successful public health interventions. However, current knowledge is based largely on observational studies, and randomised controlled experiments that test different public health interventions are urgently needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The pandemic of Influenza A H1N1 (Swine Flu) in 2009 and 2010 provided a major challenge to health services around the world. Similar to previous pandemics, it has led to significant aberrations in consumer behaviour, such as the stockpiling of goods, the victimisation of specific population groups, the cancellation of travel and the boycotting of particular foods (e.g., pork). Furthermore, large regional differences in risk estimation and risk perception have potentially affected the uptake of vaccination and other public health measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The pandemic prompted search for novel and innovative containment interventions as many traditional public health measures failed to control the spread of influenza infection. In particular, increasing the uptake of vaccination and ensuring compliance with containment policies have become a major challenge for public health and health authorities. The clinical picture in severe cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza was also markedly different from the disease pattern seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza, in that many of those affected were previously healthy young adults with complex social interaction patterns. This group represents users of healthcare services who are most likely to be receptive to personal health records (PHRs), offering an opportunity to study and potentially modify healthcare information seeking and service utilization behaviour in young adults.</p><p>Online social networking and personally controlled health management systems (PCHMS) offer a new opportunity for developing innovative interventions to prevent diseases of public health concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Health promotion programs based on PCHMS can be used in a variety of settings targeting a large range of health issues, including the prevention of influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Consumers are increasingly using such online systems to inform health decisions and manage their health. The uptake of PCHMS is likely to vary in different social groups under different conditions and within different contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], but few comparative studies are available about patterns of use and impact of these systems.</p><p>It is thus important to ensure that design of studies to test the impact of online PCHMS adequately reflects the increased complexity of such interventions. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) will make a specific and significant contribution to our understanding on the efficacy of using a web-based PCHMS called <italic>Healthy.me</italic>, developed at the University of New South Wales, in improving the uptake of influenza vaccination in a university setting.</p><sec><title>Study aims and hypotheses</title><p>Specific hypotheses to be tested in this study are that:</p><p>1. Consumers using a PCHMS are more likely to comply with public health recommendations, as measured by their rates of seeking and obtaining influenza vaccination;</p><p>2. PCHMS that provides online facilities to schedule encounters with a health service provider will increase the utilisation rate of those services.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>A randomised controlled trial with a two-group parallel design (with intervention allocation ratio 1:1) is used to evaluate the efficacy of <italic>Healthy.me</italic>, reported in accordance to the 2010 CONSORT statements (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]:</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Overview of RCT process</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6963-12-86-1"/></fig><p>&#x02022; Participants randomised to the <italic>intervention </italic>group will have immediate access to <italic>Healthy.me </italic>from the date they are recruited in addition to health care of usual standard.</p><p>&#x02022; Participants randomised to the <italic>control </italic>group will receive usual care.

Exclusion criteria are applied post-study. Hence, participants who self-identify as meeting inclusion criteria proceed to first providing informed consent before commencing the pre-study survey.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Eligibility criteria for participants</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Inclusion criteria</th><th align="left">Exclusion criteria</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">1.

Weekly and monthly advertisements circulated in online and print newsletters and magazines to staff and students.</p><p>2. Online announcements circulated for students and staff on UNSW home page, myUNSW home page, UNSW elearning portals and UNSW career websites.</p><p>3. Online annoucements circulated on Walls and discussion forums of Facebook accounts associated with UNSW student clubs and societies on campus.</p><p>4. Email invitations sent to Heads of Schools, Heads of UNSW departments, Heads of residential colleges, and delegates of UNSW student clubs and societies for dissemination to staff and student mailing lists.</p><p>5. Paper posters and leaflets placed on billboards across the university campus.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical concerns and consent</title><p>Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the UNSW Human Research Ethics Committee.

The only difference between the 2 arms is exposure to the intervention. Whilst there are clear annual differences in flu and vaccination rates, our study should detect if in a given year we are able to change consumer behaviour. It is likely that in different years the degree of effect will differ, and only long term and longitudinal studies would help us understand the underlying trend. Such studies would be contemplated after strong evidence from this study that the intervention in principle is capable of impacting behaviour in a single season.</p><sec><title>Description of intervention</title><p>The intervention in this trial is a web-based PCHMS called <italic>Healthy.me</italic>, which consists of the following features (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>):</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Features of <italic>Healthy.me </italic>(<sup>&#x000a9; </sup>University of New South Wales, 2009-2012)</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6963-12-86-2"/></fig><p>1.

Schedule, to-do list and reminders: An online schedule to self-record and keep track of health-related appointments, to-do items, which sends email reminders.</p><p>4. Team: A feature that allows the self-recording of clinical and non-clinical personnel looking after one's health.</p><p>5. Journeys: Consumer-specific care pathways that provide knowledge in an actionable way. A feature that describes the different stages in the management of health conditions that can be used to personalise other PHR sections in the system, and provides advice on what to expect and how to prepare for each stage. (Participants in this study had access to an influenza vaccine journey).</p><p>6. Social features for this study included: (i) a profile for each member to store and customise their personal information, (ii) the ability to send and receive messages with other members on <italic>Healthy.me</italic>.</p><p>Studies suggest that by addressing both knowledge-based (e.g. lack of awareness) and system-based (e.g. inconvenience) barriers in accessing health services, patients and consumers are more likely to uptake preventative health measures, such as influenza vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Our PCHMS is designed to address both knowledge-based and system-based barriers faced by consumers when accessing and utilising health services.</p><p>The PCHMS thus integrates a number of tools to address knowledge and system barriers that influence consumers' engagement with health services. Our PCHMS contains a PHR, as well as online social networking mechanisms that allow participants to interact with healthcare professionals at the service provider and other consumers, and additional tools to support consumer decision making and subsequent task management. In addition, it is integrated with consumer-specific care pathways (called "journeys") that provide knowledge in an actionable way. For example, at the point that a consumer encounters advice to seek influenza vaccination, they are immediately able to book an appointment with a medical practitioner, or set themselves a reminder.</p><p>The PCHMS was previously tested in a small trial with women undergoing in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), to demonstrate system usability and acceptance. Interview data from this trial provided evidence that the system positively impacted consumer advice-seeking behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The influenza vaccine journey in <italic>Healthy.me </italic>was iteratively developed and validated in consultation with the University Health Service (i.e. university's general practice) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). It utilises government-endorsed evidence-based consumer education material that had been tested in the previous year to inform the UNSW community about seasonal influenza and pandemic H1N1 influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Top page of <italic>Healthy.me </italic>influenza vaccine journey (<sup>&#x000a9; </sup>University of New South Wales, 2009-2012)</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6963-12-86-3"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Intervention group and exposure</title><p>The period of access to <italic>Healthy.me </italic>will vary depending on the date of participant registration.

A conservative estimate of 600 participants with 300 in each group is needed to detect a 10% difference in influenza vaccination rate between the control group (15%) and the intervention group (25%). This estimate is calculated at 5% level of significance, 80% power (two-sided test), with an anticipated participant dropout rate around 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The effect size estimate is based on a review assessing the effectiveness of patient reminder systems in improving immunization rates, which can range from 5 to 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The baseline rate estimate of influenza vaccination was informed by our audit conducted at the University Health Service, showing 16% of patients at the practice received FluVax or PanVax between 5/3/2009 to 5/11/2009. This estimate is also supported by literature reporting 18 to 30% of university students and healthy adults (18 to 49 years old) obtaining influenza vaccination in a year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> outlines the primary and secondary outcome measures in this study.

The duration of the study is expected to be six months from May 2010 to October 2010.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Stages of study procedure</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Stage of study</th><th align="left">Procedure</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Online registration</td><td align="left">- Participant registration, study consent and Healthy.me tutorial (self-completed online)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Baseline</td><td align="left">- Pre-study survey (self-completed online)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">- Data from de-identified clinical audit from previous 12 months: electronic extraction (collected post-study)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Follow-up procedures</td><td align="left">- Monthly one-minute surveys (self-completed online)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">- Post-study survey (self-completed online)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">- Patterns of <italic>Healthy.me </italic>use (computer logs and data entered by participants)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">- De-identified clinical audit at study completion: electronic extraction (collected post-study)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Email will be the primary channel to communicate with participants for study information and reminders about survey completion. From the time participants are recruited until study completion, all participants (control &#x00026; intervention) will receive an email in the first week of each month to complete a one-minute survey about their health in the past month. At study completion, all participants will receive an email asking them to complete a post-study survey. Two follow-up emails five days apart from each other will be sent to remind those who have not completed each survey to ensure the completeness of data collection.</p><sec><title>Randomisation and allocation concealment</title><p>After consent each participant is randomly allocated to the intervention or control group, facilitated by a computerised centralised allocation process which forms part of the online registration procedure. Eligible healthcare consumers are randomly assigned to the intervention or control group using a computer generated random number sequence in randomly assigned blocks (block sizes 2, 4 and 8) with intervention allocation ratio of 1:1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The randomisation sequence generation, participant registration, and group allocation processes are computerised online and do not involve human interventions from the investigators. The block randomisation sequence is pre-generated by a member external to the research team using a computerised random-number generator before commencing participant recruitment. As each participant completes the online registration procedure, he/she receives the next consecutive allocation in the sequence, which automatically assigns the consumer to the intervention or control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding and assessment</title><p>Since <italic>Healthy.me </italic>is a behavioural intervention it is not possible to completely blind participants to the intervention. The group allocation is revealed to participants only after obtaining their consent to participate in the study and completion of the pre-study survey. However, investigators and clinicians involved in the study are blinded to group allocation. To minimise contamination of control participants who might interact with participants who are part of the intervention group, participants in the intervention group are asked not to share their <italic>Healthy.me </italic>access details with other people. Further, participants who self-reported to have been influenced by others participating in the study to obtain (or not obtain) influenza vaccination will be excluded from analysis. To assess the success of blinding, administrative staff at the University Health Service will be consulted at study completion to confirm whether clinicians involved in assessing patient outcomes and/or administrating influenza vaccination are able to distinguish patients who booked an appointment using <italic>Healthy.me</italic>.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Health promotion and surveillance have received unprecedented recognition because of newly emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases with epidemic potential, new cycles of pandemics, and the threats of bioterrorism. Influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI) are important contributors to population and individual morbidity and mortality. The recent influenza pandemic with novel H1N1 has highlighted the need for a better understanding of patients' healthcare seeking behaviour and perceptions and attitudes towards vaccination. Findings of our study will help to facilitate health promotion and surveillance in technology savvy populations as well as to enhance healthcare professionals' and governments' capacity to predict and prepare for the subsequent epidemics and pandemics.</p><p>The study will further explore the role of clinical illness case definitions for influenza as methods used to define influenza seasons have varied substantially. These differences often result in differing levels of sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value for the case definitions used. Furthermore, these differences affect the estimation of influenza vaccine effectiveness, safety and cost benefit analyses in healthy working adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>There are several potential limitations in this study:</p><p>&#x02022; <italic>Number of eligible participants</italic>: Recruitment may be affected by an overlap between the start of respiratory season in Australia and the student examination period, potentially affecting student and staff availability and interest to participate in research studies. The number of participants meeting exclusion criteria at study completion might be significant because staff members are eligible for free influenza vaccination offered by UNSW one week prior to study commencement. As free vaccination would be a confounder if included in this trial, we explicitly ran our campaign independently of the university program.</p><p>&#x02022; <italic>Self-reports of influenza vaccination and health service utilisation</italic>: Since clinical audits will only be conducted at the University Health Service, and not other GP practices, the study is dependent on participants' self-reporting of their influenza vaccination and health service utilisation. Self report has shown to be acceptably accurate in numerous studies examining days of absence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], influenza symptoms, and vaccination status for diverse patient cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We will minimise the risk of recall bias by conducting short one-minute monthly follow-up surveys on the first week of each month.</p><p>&#x02022; <italic>Representative of general healthcare consumers</italic>: The study may be more appealing to consumers who are interested or literate in computers, the Internet, or health-related topics. These participants may be more enthusiastic about health and the Internet than the general health consumer population. In addition, participants from a university setting are more likely to be open and positive to new research ideas and willing to participate in research studies. Further, generalisability of findings could be limited by recruiting participants from one university.</p><p>&#x02022; <italic>Social influence and access to Healthy.me</italic>: The social networks of individual participants may span the intervention and control arms of this study, and see intervention subjects un-blind control subjects with information obtained from the intervention. As this is a pragmatic trial in the real world, such effects cannot be controlled for. Indeed participants' social networks are likely to influence access to Healthy.me if the intervention was in routine use. We will attempt to measure this effect by asking participants in the control arm if they have been in contact with intervention arm subjects. If a significant group is identified, we will conduct separate analyses to estimate the impact of any such effect on overall trial results.</p><p>&#x02022; <italic>Baseline comparisons</italic>: As this is a pragmatic trial of a multifaceted intervention in a complex environment, it is possible that baseline variables associated with subjects might also influence the outcome. For example, having a prior history of obtaining influenza vaccination may predict future vaccination rates, independently of any additional intervention. We will identify potential baseline variables that might influence outcome, including gender, and test for unequal distribution of these variables in the intervention and control populations. Should there be a significant difference in their distribution due to chance bias, these will be fitted in an analysis of covariance to model their impact on any observed differences between the two arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><sec><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Our design of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) focuses on the comparison of outcomes that unequivocally reflect a change in consumer behaviour, and takes into account the complexity of intervention. Results of this study will offer new insights about the utility of online social networking for public health and health promotion. Our findings will provide specific answers to whether using a web-based PHCMS, with connectivity to a health service provider, containing information and self-management tools that facilitate consumers to act on a decision, will improve the uptake of preventive health services amongst students and staff in a university setting.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The university and some of the researchers involved in this project could in the future benefit from any commercialisation of <italic>Healthy.me </italic>or its technologies, but no such commercial plans have been developed.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AL and EC conceptualised and designed the study.
