It is an acquired pigmentary disorder characterised by more or less symmetrically distributed, medium- to dark-brown macules with well-defined geographic borders, affecting sun-exposed areas particularly forehead, cheeks, temples and upper lip.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>The precise cause of melasma remains unknown. Multiple etiological factors implicated such as exposure to ultraviolet radiation, pregnancy, contraceptive pills, hormone replacement therapy, cosmetics, phototoxic and anti-seizure medications.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] In addition to the UV light itself, photo-induced hormones, growth factors, and chemical mediators of inflammation, which influence the function of melanocytes directly or indirectly, might contribute to the UV-induced pigmentation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Different treatment modalities such as topical depigmenting agents,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] chemical peels,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] dermabrasion and laser therapies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] have been utilised in different studies with varying, not so satisfactory outcomes.</p><p>The results of recent clinical trials using localised intradermal microinjections of tranexamic acid (TA)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] and transepidermal delivery of TA using microneedling[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] in the treatment of melasma are promising. In this study, we compare intradermal microinjections to microneedling in transepidermal delivery of TA in melasma patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A prospective, randomised, open-label study was conducted with a sample size of 60, thirty each in each of the treatment arms, for 1 year from March 2010 to March 2011, after approval from the Ethical Committee of the Institutional Review Board (IRB).</p><p>Adult males and females between 18 and 50 years of age with moderate-to-severe bilaterally symmetrical distribution of melasma were included in the study after obtaining written informed consent. Pregnant/lactating females, patients on hormone replacement therapy or oral contraceptives, history of bleeding disorders, concomitant use of anticoagulants, any known drug allergy especially to the study drug, associated medical illnesses, and history of any other depigmenting treatment in the past 1 month were excluded from the study.</p><p>After obtaining detailed personal and medical history, Wood's lamp examination was performed to classify the type of melasma. A modified MASI scoring system was used to assess the severity of melasma [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Modified MASI scoring</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCAS-6-139-g001"/></fig><p>Tranexamic acid is available as 5 mL ampoule containing 500 mg of the drug. About 4 mg of TA is drawn in a 100 U/mL insulin syringe (about 4 units) and diluted with normal saline up to 1 mL (up to 100 U) to get a concentration of 4 mg/mL of TA.</p><p>After gentle cleansing, topical EMLA cream was applied over the area to be treated for about 45 to 60 min. The subjects in Arm 1 were treated with multiple microinjections of TA (4 mg/mL) intradermally into the melasma lesions at 1 cm intervals, depending on the extent of involvement, to a maximum of 8 mg to the entire affected area, using a 100 U/mL insulin syringe with a 4-mm mesoneedle.</p><p>The microneedles used had a width of 2 cm, studded with 192 fine needles of medical-graded stainless steel. The needle length was 1.5 mm and diameter 0.25 mm. According to the pressure applied, the needles penetrate the skin from 0.1 to 1.3 mm.</p><p>For the subjects in Arm 2, the skin was stretched and microneedling was carried out in vertical, horizontal, and both diagonal directions for about four to five times. Tranexamic acid, 0.5 to 1 ml (4 mg/mL), was applied over this area, and the procedure was repeated four to five times in the above-said directions. Ice packs were applied over the treated areas. The subjects were instructed to follow strict photo-protective measures.</p><p>The procedures were done three times at monthly intervals (0, 4 and 8 weeks) and followed up for further 3 months at monthly intervals. To assess the clinical response, clinical photographs were taken at the beginning of the therapy and then serially. MASI scoring, physician global assessment (PGA), and patient global assessment (PtGA) were performed at monthly intervals and any adverse events and complications were recorded.</p><p>The response to treatment in each patient was graded at the end of the study: No response, no improvement; mild response, &#x0003c;25% improvement; moderate response, 25% to &#x0003c; 50% improvement; good response, 50% to &#x0003c; 75% improvement; very good response, &#x0003e;75% improvement. Each case was followed up for 3 months to look for further improvement/relapse, if any.</p><p>The Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis (nonparametric ANOVA) test was used to compare the means of MASI scores at each visit and follow up after treatment in each group. The unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test with Welch correction was used to compare means of MASI scores between the microinjections and microneedling group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Out of 60 patients in the study, 41 (68.33%) patients belonged to the age group 30&#x02013;50 years and the number of females (54) was more compared to males (6) in both the treatment arms [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. All patients had Fitzpatrick skin type of 4 or 5 [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Most patients had a centrofacial or malar pattern of distribution of melasma [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Forty-six (80%) patients had mixed type of melasma, 5 (8.33%) had epidermal type and 7 (11.67%) had dermal type [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Sun exposure was a risk factor in about 37 (61.67%) patients. Twenty-one (70%) patients had a history of melasma in their family. None of them were on any phototoxic drugs. Seven (11.67%) in the microinjection group and 8 (13.33%) in the microneedling group had undertaken treatment for melasma in the form of chemical peels, skin-lightening agents and some native medicines in the past. Two patients (3.33%) in the microinjection group and 3 (5%) in the microneedling group had concomitant dermatological disease such as Dermatosis papulosa nigra, freckles and palmoplantar psoriasis. Fifteen patients in the microinjection group and 16 in the microneedling group were using moisturisers.

Recent studies have revealed that topical <italic>trans</italic>-4-(aminomethyl) cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (<italic>trans</italic>-AMCHA, TA), a plasmin inhibitor, prevents UV-induced pigmentation in guinea pigs. Topical <italic>trans</italic>-AMCHA inhibits UV-induced plasmin activity in keratinocytes by preventing the binding of plasminogen to the keratinocytes, which ultimately results in decreased free arachidonic acid and a diminished ability to produce prostaglandins, which in turn decrease melanocyte tyrosinase activity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Human keratinocytes secrete the urokinase-type plasminogen activator, which increases the activity of melanocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>. The blockade of this effect may be due to the mechanism by which TA reduces hyperpigmentation in melasma patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] By injecting TA intradermally, it may be possible to treat the dermal-type melasma in addition to the mixed type.</p><p>Microneedle technology offers a minimally invasive and painless route of drug delivery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] This technology involves the creation of channels in the skin with micron-sized dimensions, thereby enabling the delivery of a broad range of therapeutic molecules including proteins which would not otherwise cross intact skin.</p><p>Localised microinjections, the so-called &#x0201c;mesotherapy,&#x0201d; were introduced in France by Pistor.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Mesotherapy is a widely used technique in medicine. This technique consists of intradermal or subcutaneous microinjections of 0.05 to 0.1 mL of highly diluted drug mixtures or a single drug, at the sites of body having medical or aesthetic problems. All intravenously injectable compounds may be used, except for alcoholic and oily solvents. It is aimed at applying an adequate amount of medication directly at the problematic area and avoiding oral medications. Furthermore, direct injection to the involved sites allows lower dosage of drugs to be used.</p><p>The microneedling device is a simple, handheld instrument consisting of a handle with a cylinder studded all around with fine, stainless steel needles of 0.5 to 2 mm in length. To achieve therapeutic benefits, this needle-studded cylinder is rolled on the skin in multiple directions to create microchannels. Hence, the technique is named &#x0201c;microneedling&#x0201d;.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] It is currently used in the cosmetic industry to treat several skin conditions such as pigmentation problems, wrinkles, acne and post-burn scars, and also in facial rejuvenation as a part of collagen induction therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>In this study, we have used localised microinjections (mesotherapy) and microneedling to deliver the study drug TA. We compared both these modes of drug delivery, the safety and efficacy in the treatment of melasma. The MASI scores, PtGA, and PGA showed a significant decreasing trend from the baseline to the fourth, eighth, and twelfth week of treatment with TA in both the treatment arms. The scores showed better improvement in patients treated with microneedling than with microinjections though the difference was not statistically significant. This can be attributed to the fact that microneedling delivers the medication more evenly and deeper into the skin. All scores remained almost the same during the next 3 months of follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>On the basis of the findings, TA can be used as potentially a safe, effective, and promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of melasma. The medication is easily available and affordable. It is an office-based procedure with relatively quick results, no significant side effects, and almost no downtime.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Loreal Research Grant</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grimes</surname><given-names>PE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Melasma: Etiologic and therapeutic considerations</article-title><source>Arch Dermatol</source><year>1995</year><volume>131</volume><fpage>1453</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7492140</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Morelli</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name><name><surname>Norris</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Influence of inflammatory mediator and cytokines in human melanocyte function</article-title><source>J Invest Dermatol</source><year>1993</year><volume>100</volume><fpage>191S</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8381839</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name><name><surname>Gover</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name><name><surname>Nouri</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The treatment of melasma: A review of clinical trials</article-title><source>J Am Acad Dermatol</source><year>2006</year><volume>55</volume><fpage>1048</fpage><lpage>65</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17097400</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bentley-Phillips</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Bayles</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cutaneous reactions to topical application of hydroquinone.
