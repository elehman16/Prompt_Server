Participants were randomized to intravenous elamipretide (0.01, 0.1, and 0.25 mg/kg/h or placebo for 2 hours in a dose-escalating sequence). The primary efficacy measure was the change in distance walked in the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) after 5 days of treatment.

The sample size was based on precedent set by other phase I/II studies of a similar nature and design and the number chosen to allow appropriate pharmacokinetic studies. Eligible participants were &#x02265;16 and &#x02264;65 years of age with PMM caused by either a nuclear DNA or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation known to affect mitochondrial respiration (table e-1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/WNL/A309">links.lww.com/WNL/A309</ext-link>). The investigators reviewed both the genetic and phenotypic findings in each participant to unanimously affirm the molecular pathogenicity and genotype-phenotype correlation (table e-2). The inclusion criterion for muscle symptoms was defined as a score of &#x02265;2 (able to walk &#x0003c;1,000 m on a flat surface; restricted on inclines or stairs; rest needed after 1 flight [12 steps]) on Section I, question 9 (exercise tolerance) or a score of &#x02265;2 (mild but clear proximal weakness in hip flexion and shoulder abduction [Medical Research Council score 4 of 5]; minimal weakness in elbow flexion and knee extension [Medical Research Council score 4+ of 5, both examined with the joint at 90&#x000b0;]) on Section III, question 5 (myopathy) of the Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale (NMDAS).<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Participants also had to be able to complete a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Medications and dietary supplements were required to be unchanged for at least a month before randomization and were to be continued during the trial. Those with either uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or significant cardiac (i.e., conduction abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, uncontrolled hypertension) or neurologic (scores &#x02265;4 on selected neurologic questions of the NMDAS) disorders were excluded from the trial (i.e., severe ataxia, prior strokes with deficit, active seizures).</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Randomization and masking</title><p>Assignment to treatment groups within each cohort was determined by a computer-generated random sequence using an Interactive Web-Response System to assign identical glass vials containing either the elamipretide or a placebo, which consisted of the same formulation without elamipretide. The pharmacists, trial staff, sponsor, and participants were blinded to the treatment given.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Procedures and outcomes</title><p>Participants were randomized within 40 days of the screening visit. Baseline evaluation of functional, participant-reported, and safety assessments was completed within 24 hours of treatment. Three escalating doses (0.01, 0.10, and 0.25 mg/kg/h) were infused intravenously over 2 hours for 5 consecutive days in each of the 3 consecutive escalating-dose cohorts, after which the same measures obtained at baseline were completed for the analyses of efficacy. Follow-up testing was also done 2 days after treatment cessation.</p><p>The primary efficacy measure was the change in distance walked in the 6MWT. The 6MWT was chosen as the primary outcome because physical fatigue and exercise intolerance are among the most common symptoms of patients with PMM, regardless of the underlying genetic defect.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> In addition, skeletal muscle requires high levels of ATP synthesis for minimal activity, and those needs increase as much as 30-fold during exercise.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Additional efficacy measures included change in physiologic parameters measured during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and changes in the values of exploratory biomarkers (serum glutathione levels, fibroblast growth factor-21 [FGF-21], urine 8-isoprostane, and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine).</p><p>CPET is a complete assessment of aerobic functional performance providing an integrated assessment of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and skeletal muscle physiologic reserve capacity. It was performed on a stationary upright bicycle with ECG and hemodynamic monitoring. Blood samples to measure serum lactate were collected before and within 10 minutes of completion of the exercise. Because of the physical demands of the test, it was performed at the option of the participant.</p><p>Participant-reported changes in symptoms were obtained with 2 tools. The modified NMDAS (a rating scale to allow evaluation of the progression of mitochondrial disease symptoms and quality of life in adults) consisted of Sections I and III, with the exception of Section III, question 10 of the NMDAS. The Daily Symptom Questionnaire was also completed, evaluating 6 symptoms on a 0 to 10 scale (0 = none/no symptoms and 10 = very severe symptoms): abdominal pain, limitation of activities, muscle pain, muscle weakness, physical fatigue, mental fatigue.</p><p>Apart from the Daily Symptom Questionnaire, all other efficacy assessments were performed at baseline (day 1), at the end of treatment (day 5), and at the end of the trial (day 7).</p><p>Safety and tolerability endpoints included adverse events and changes from baseline in vital signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory evaluations.

In general, placebo was pooled across dosing cohorts. The primary analysis for efficacy used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that included treatment as a factor and baseline as a covariate. In addition, for the change in the 6MWT distance, a mixed model for repeated-measures analysis that included treatment, visit, distance walked at screening, distance walked at baseline, and a treatment-by-visit interaction was conducted. This model was also used to test a linear dose effect. A post hoc analysis was also completed on the primary efficacy endpoint of change in 6MWT distance to determine whether other covariates beyond baseline distance contributed to the change in distance walked. Covariates considered included treatment, baseline 6MWT distance, a baseline 6MWT distance-by-treatment interaction, screening 6MWT distance, sex, height, weight, and randomization cohort. A backward elimination approach was used to include only those factors with a significance level equal to <italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.1 in the final model.

These results support preclinical animal studies in which elamipretide improved exercise performance in aged mice.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In these preclinical animal studies, improved exercise performance was observed only in animals with decreased performance, not in normally functioning animals. This finding was also observed in this trial. The final post hoc ANCOVA model derived with the backward elimination approach included a baseline 6MWT-by-treatment interaction as one of the factors. The inclusion of this interaction as a factor is supportive of participants with a greater degree of impairment having a greater improvement in distance walked in the 6MWT after treatment with elamipretide. This was also suggested by a similar prespecified subgroup analysis in which participants treated with elamipretide who walked &#x0003c;350 m at screening showed greater improvement (i.e., a greater increase in distance walked) on day 5 (range 8.40&#x02013;32.57 m) compared to those who walked &#x02265;350 m at screening (range 2.19&#x02013;9.91 m).</p><p>The 6MWT was selected as the primary efficacy assessment because of its relevance to the day-to-day functioning of patients with PMM. Muscular weakness, cardiovascular limitations, and gait disorders can influence 6MWT performance, and any or all can be present in PMM. Limitations of the 6MWT are its variability and the ability of the technician coaching during the test to influence the participants. The trial minimized these concerns by excluding participants with severe cardiovascular or neurologic impairments and using a standardized protocol for performing the test. Some initial training effect has been observed for the 6MWT in neuromuscular and chronic conditions.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> A screening 6MWT was done for each participant before the baseline test as a way to reduce the likelihood of observing a training effect in the evaluation of the effect of elamipretide after the 5-day treatment period.</p><p>The trial also evaluated the potential effect of elamipretide on numerous CPET parameters. Interpretation of the CPET results is complicated by participants dropping out (missing data from 7 participants), by several other participants stopping the test before reaching their maximal predicted heart rate because of muscle symptoms and fatigue, and by technical problems at the sites. There was a correlation between the change in distance walked in the 6MWT and peak oxygen consumption in all the participants, similar to what has been observed in other advanced chronic conditions such as heart disease.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>Two participant-reported tools were used in this trial, the NMDAS and the Daily Symptom Questionnaire. The NMDAS was created to measure the chronic progression of mitochondrial disease. The tool was not created or validated for the PMM patient population or for the purpose of measuring a short-term treatment effects. Likewise, the Daily Symptom Questionnaire is a symptom assessment without any prior validation. The further evaluation of elamipretide with a fit-for-purpose, specific symptom assessment tool might be more sensitive to detect clinically meaningful changes in clinical trials.</p><p>In addition, several biomarkers, including FGF-21, glutathione, and urinary isoprostanes, were measured. These biomarkers are limited by their lack of specificity and unproven ability to discriminate treatment effects.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>Other factors may have clouded the interpretation of the trial results. Numerous supplements and antioxidants were taken long term by the enrolled participants. Only some of these compounds have been tested in clinical trials, with no clear proven efficacy or positive effect (e.g., dichloroacetate, creatine, dimethylglycine, CoQ10, and idebenone).<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In addition, while participants were instructed to maintain their normal diet, daily caffeine, and fiber intake, as well as their normal activity/exercise level throughout the trial period, baseline differences in these participant attributes could have an impact on functional performance and treatment benefit results. There were too few participants in this trial to determine any differential effect resulting from the use of these supplements.</p><p>Finally, the small number of participants in this trial created a challenge in determining whether differences in efficacy responses were affected by the different genetic abnormalities or the degree of heteroplasmy present in those with mtDNA encoding abnormalities. Heteroplasmy was not measured in all participants, and of those participants with heteroplasmy levels available, it was determined in various tissues, making meaningful comparisons challenging.</p><p>There was no significant improvement in distance walked in the 6MWT when the participants were retested 2 days after the cessation of treatment. This could be the result of the short half-life of the drug. Larger studies are required to determine whether longer periods of treatment will further enhance exercise performance and to determine the duration of the effect of elamipretide. In addition, long-term daily intravenous administration is not practical in patients with PMM. A subcutaneous formulation of elamipretide for long-term use is being studied.</p><p>The improvements in exercise performance and the well-tolerated safety profile of elamipretide in this trial are encouraging. Despite the inherent limitations of a small phase I/II trial, this trial supports the proposed mechanism of action of elamipretide, improving ATP synthesis regardless of the underlying genetic defect impairing mitochondrial respiration. The results justify a larger prospective trial to determine the effect of long-term administration of the drug. This trial should include other measures of physical functioning and assessment of the disabling symptoms of fatigue and exercise intolerance in this patient population.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>Class of Evidence: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://NPub.org/coe">NPub.org/coe</ext-link></p></fn><fn fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>CME Course: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://NPub.org/cmelist">NPub.org/cmelist</ext-link></p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Editorial, page <related-article id="d35e1438" related-article-type="commentary" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1212/WNL.0000000000005243" vol="90" issue="14" page="633">633</related-article></p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>Amanda Remse and Anthony Aiudi, Stealth BioTherapeutics, edited the manuscript and tables for nonintellectual content.
