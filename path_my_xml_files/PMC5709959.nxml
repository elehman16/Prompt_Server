Passive surveillance systems provide opportunity for health care personnel to confidentially and voluntarily report incidents, including adverse events, occurring in their work environment. Active surveillance systems systematically monitor patient encounters to seek detailed information about adverse events that occur in work environments; unlike passive surveillance, active surveillance allows for collection of both numerator (number of adverse events) and denominator (number of patients seen) data.</p><p id="Par2">Chiropractic manual therapy is commonly used in both adults and children, yet few studies have been done to evaluate the safety of chiropractic manual therapy for children. In an attempt to evaluate this, this study will compare adverse event reporting in passive versus active surveillance systems after chiropractic manual therapy in the pediatric population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par3">This cluster randomized controlled trial aims to enroll 70 physicians of chiropractic (unit of randomization) to either passive or active surveillance system to report adverse events that occur after treatment for 60 consecutive pediatric (13&#x000a0;years of age and younger) patient visits (unit of analysis). A modified enrollment process with a two-phase consent procedure will be implemented to maintain provider blinding and minimize dropouts. The first phase of consent is for the provider to confirm their interest in a trial investigating the safety of chiropractic manual therapy. The second phase ensures that they understand the specific requirements for the group to which they were randomized.</p><p id="Par4">Percentages, incidence estimates, and 95% confidence intervals will be used to describe the count of reported adverse events in each group. The primary outcome will be the number and quality of the adverse event reports in the active versus the passive surveillance group.

There are numerous manual therapy variations with the velocity, amplitude, loading frequency, choice of lever, location, direction of load, and treatment frequency changing widely amongst the variations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Spinal manipulation therapy (SMT), a type of manual therapy, is regulated for use in many professions (e.g., doctor of osteopathy, medical physicians, and physical therapists), but doctors of chiropractic (DCs) are the most likely to use SMT on a regular basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. According to a 2015 practice analysis of United States DCs, 17.1% of chiropractic patients are 17&#x000a0;years of age or less; this increases to 38.7% amongst DCs who specialize in pediatrics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Adverse events after manual therapy, including SMT, have been investigated more thoroughly in adult patients than in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Several reviews of adverse events in children following manual therapy have identified rare serious adverse events, although the studies have been primarily case reports. The main conclusion from these reviews was that there is insufficient primary research on this topic in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient safety performance &#x02013; surveillance systems</title><p id="Par15">To measure safety performance, including reporting of adverse events, many health care settings have implemented surveillance systems to report and learn from adverse events. When established, such systems can provide learning opportunities based on the information gathered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">These patient safety surveillance systems vary according to their purpose. <italic>Active surveillance</italic> systematically collects information from the provider about patient encounters, including adverse events, which enhances reporting and demonstrates a health care organization&#x02019;s commitment to patient safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although active surveillance can generate higher quality and quantity of reports because both numerator and denominator data are known, the time and resources needed to properly execute an active surveillance reporting system are often limitations to its successful implementation.</p><p id="Par17">
<italic>Passive surveillance</italic> voluntarily collects adverse event information from the provider and is more commonly utilized throughout health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Typically, passive surveillance systems are conducted confidentially and sometimes anonymously, and some have been modified for Internet-based fora. These systems can also promote quality improvement by allowing for reporting of adverse events, near misses (an event that could have caused an adverse event, but did not), and unsafe conditions. Passive surveillance systems are relatively easy to implement and can collect reports from a broad range of topics and individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, their major limitations include under-reporting (quantity of reports), inadequate information (quality of reports), and limited knowledge of how many patients were exposed (denominator data). Practitioners involved with passive surveillance systems have reported that they commonly forget to write-up their report, are too busy to review others&#x02019; reports, are not sure who is responsible to write-up a report, or do not report an event because it seemed trivial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study justification</title><p id="Par18">Within the chiropractic profession, active surveillance reporting systems are not used routinely. A passive surveillance system for chiropractic care, called the &#x0201c;Chiropractic Patient Incident Reporting and Learning System&#x0201d; (CPiRLS), is currently being used in Europe and Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although CPiRLS does not have any age restrictions, to date only limited pediatric data have been reported into the system, despite multiple calls for high-quality safety data about pediatric chiropractic manual therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Both active and passive surveillance methods have distinct advantages and limitations. The need for a direct comparison of the ability of active versus passive surveillance to report adverse events, and the need to better understand the patient safety performance in the use of chiropractic manual therapies for the pediatric population, led to the development of this cluster randomized clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study aim and hypothesis</title><p id="Par20">Study aim: to compare the quantity and qualify adverse event reports after chiropractic manual therapy in children 13&#x000a0;years of age or under, using passive versus active surveillance reporting systems. <italic>Hypothesis: DCs randomized to the active surveillance system will report more adverse events and will have better quality reporting than those randomized to the passive surveillance system.</italic>

DCs in private practice who treat children will be the unit of randomization with random allocation in a 1:1 ratio to active or passive surveillance reporting systems. Cluster randomization was chosen for practical reasons with the unit of analysis being reports from the individual chiropractic patient visits. The University of Alberta&#x02019;s Research Ethics Board reviewed and approved this study (Pro00027903). The trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02268331).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention arm: active surveillance</title><p id="Par24">For 60 consecutive child patient visits, the parents/caregivers will be given an Information Sheet and asked to complete a pre-treatment form before the child sees the DC. As described in the Information Sheet and as stated on the top of all data collection forms, consent will be implied if the data collection forms are completed and returned. This ensures patient confidentiality. Patients and providers will each be given a post-treatment form to complete. The patient&#x02019;s post-treatment form is to be completed within 1&#x000a0;week and returned directly to the investigators using a postage-paid envelope. The DC&#x02019;s post-treatment form is to be completed immediately after the patient&#x02019;s visit. A more detailed form documenting adverse events will be completed by the provider if a moderate, serious or severe adverse event (see definitions in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) occurs immediately following treatment or is reported to the DC at a later date.

Like the primary analyses, Poisson regression with log links will be used in GEE analyses to account for cluster-specific methods. Patient safety attitudes will be measured before and after participation and compared across surveillance groups.</p><p id="Par36">Other planned secondary analyses are designed to identify factors associated with adverse events from the data gathered in the active surveillance group. Potential factors for adverse events include patient characteristics (e.g., age, presenting condition, sex, health history), provider characteristics (e.g., years in practice, specialty training), and treatment provided (e.g., high-velocity, low-amplitude or other). With the adverse event reports categorized by their severity (i.e., none, mild, moderate, severe, serious), logistic regression analyses will be used to model&#x000a0;factors associated with the adverse events. If the number of moderate, severe, and serious events are small, the outcome will be dichotomized as any adverse event versus no adverse event. If numbers of moderate, severe and serious events are sufficiently large, multivariable polytomous logistic regression will be used.</p><p id="Par37">Planned exploratory analyses include: (1) subgroup analysis for providers with a specialty pediatric certification and number of reported adverse events (i.e., the primary outcome); (2) assessment of the feasibility to implement a surveillance system within chiropractic offices&#x000a0;from individual provider feedback; and (3) review of debrief interview to gain insight into participating DCs&#x02019; overall thoughts on the study, including barriers to implementation, perceived benefit of participating, and being blinded to intervention.

We assumed a passive surveillance reporting rate of 0.53%, based on prior academic literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A one-sided significance level was utilized as it seems reasonable to believe that passive surveillance will result in under-reporting of adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We calculated that a sample size of 35 providers in each group, with each DC collecting data from 60 pediatric patient visits, and 5% one-sided significance level, would lead to 80% power. This includes an anticipated loss to follow-up of 11% of DCs and 20% of patient visits.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par39">This study will be the largest prospective evaluation of adverse events reported after chiropractic manual therapy in the pediatric population, which has been identified as a major gap in the academic literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This randomized cluster trial assesses the effectiveness of two different surveillance methods to collect observational safety data on a topic that is clinically relevant. To our knowledge, this is the first study to do a direct comparison of active versus passive surveillance reporting of adverse events.</p><p id="Par40">The chiropractic profession treats children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; therefore, it has a responsibility to ensure proper safety evaluations. The attitudes and opinions of DCs, who are interested in pediatric treatment, for implementing safety performance systems were evaluated in 2014. The survey identified a robust patient safety climate with time pressure as the barrier of most concern to participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Time pressure is a common barrier for health care provider participation in research, as &#x0201c;busy-ness&#x0201d; is seen as a socially acceptable excuse for declining &#x0201c;extra&#x0201d; activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Our study protocol took this concern into consideration. When pilot tested, passive surveillance was found to add 30&#x000a0;s per patient visit while active surveillance added only 2&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Aside from reports of actual adverse events that are collected in this study, each surveillance method also collects additional patient safety information. While not the primary outcome, this study will also clearly describe and report these differences. Such examples from the passive surveillance group includes administrative, incidental patient safety incidents (e.g., use of the wrong clinical file or tripping over office equipment) or &#x0201c;near misses&#x0201d;/events, which could have caused an adverse event, but did not. For the active surveillance group, information will be sought not only from the DC, but also directly from the patients; patient-provided information can be compared to that information known by the provider. These differences are unique to each surveillance group and should be taken in consideration when an organization is deciding on what method to use to evaluate adverse event.</p><p id="Par42">Beyond the significance of the study&#x02019;s specific aims, the study procedures also include several notable methodological considerations, such as the attention to outcome measurement and a modified enrollment process to maintain participant blinding. This study started with a content validation of the data collection instruments to ensure that they will collect the intended information and that it will be easily understood by the chiropractic pediatric patient&#x02019;s parent/caregiver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Modified enrollment procedures have been utilized most commonly to avoid biases that occur with non-placebo-controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This study will use a modified enrollment procedure, a two-stage consent process, to ensure that provider blinding is maintained and dropouts minimized. To avoid ethical concerns regarding enrolling and randomizing providers without their consent, consent is sought in two stages: first, providers consent to participation in a study on pediatric patient safety and chiropractic manual therapy. The second consent will give full disclosure of their specific study procedures. When participant&#x02019;s complete the study, a debrief interview will unveil the two groups and the purpose for not disclosing this information earlier.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Barriers to study completion</title><p id="Par44">Possible barriers to the study&#x02019;s implementation will be the willingness of DCs to participate in research and their adherence to study procedures. Adherence will be addressed by actively following up on DCs interested in this study&#x02019;s topic, engaging front desk personnel in study processes, and assuring that the study protocol is understood. Despite these precautions, compliance is expected to be challenging, specifically for chiropractic practices that are assigned to the active surveillance group. Dropouts have been taken into account in the sample size calculations.</p><p id="Par45">Another concern regarding the study&#x02019;s implementation is the possibility of a low response rate for the active surveillance arm&#x02019;s post-treatment form, to be completed by the patient&#x02019;s caregiver. The pilot study found that DCs who encouraged their patients to complete the data collection instruments had a better response rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par46">This is the first version of the study protocol.
