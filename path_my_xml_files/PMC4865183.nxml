These profiles were applied to expression data obtained from pretreatment formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue from 636 stage III colon cancer patients enrolled in the PETACC-3 prospective randomized clinical trial.

The effect of the 5-FU profile remained significant in a multivariable Cox Proportional Hazards model, adjusting for several relevant clinicopathological parameters.

The 5-FU predictor was prognostic in stage III patients in PETACC-3 but not in stage II patients with no adjuvant therapy. This suggests a potential predictive ability of the 5-FU sensitivity profile to identify colon cancer patients who may benefit from 5-FU, however, any biomarker predicting benefit for adjuvant 5-FU must be rigorously evaluated in independent cohorts. Given differences between the two study cohorts, the present results should be further validated.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>SNF 320030_135421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delorenzi</surname><given-names>Mauro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008363</institution-id><institution>Kr&#x000e6;ftens Bek&#x000e6;mpelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>project grant 31176</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008363</institution-id><institution>Kr&#x000e6;ftens Bek&#x000e6;mpelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buhl</surname><given-names>Ida Kappel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The work was partially supported by grant SNF 320030_135421 of the Swiss National Science Foundation.

In treatment of metastatic CRC, 5-FU is currently combined with either the topoisomerase-1 inhibitor irinotecan as FOLFIRI regimen or with oxaliplatin as a FOLFOX regimen [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Competing variables on both tumor cell level and patient level may ensure or corrupt the efficacy of 5-FU [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and/or irinotecan [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and with many patients not obtaining the benefit but only the side effects of such treatment, there is an unmet need for predictive biomarkers [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Research on predictors of 5-FU response has mainly focused on thymidylate-synthase (TS) as a target for 5-FU and of levels of the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) which metabolizes 5-FU in the liver [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

Similarly, despite many attempts, no irinotecan predictive biomarkers have reached a level of evidence allowing for routine clinical use [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>We approached the problem of predicting 5-FU or irinotecan benefit based on gene expression data by comparing associations between gene expression profiles and efficacy of the drugs in question in the National Cancer Institute US cell line repository NCI60 [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Models of sensitivity for these drugs were developed prior to the present study by the Medical Prognosis Institute (MPI), Denmark [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A second step included filtering the identified gene expression profiles against mRNA expression from a collection of 3200 human tumors. Only genes being differentially expressed in the clinical tumor material were retained in the models. An analogously constructed prediction method has recently been externally validated by biostatisticians from MD Anderson for methotrexate in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, for ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) in Hodgkin&#x02019; s lymphoma and for epirubicin in breast cancer in three separate pre-specified clinical data sets [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Similar models were recently tested for fulvestrant in breast cancer [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubuicin, vincristine, prednisone) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we assessed a 5-FU and an irinotecan MPI sensitivity predictor. We used gene expression and clinical patient data from the PETACC-3 colon cancer (CC) patient subpopulation [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and from a population of stage II CC patients who had undergone surgery but received no adjuvant therapy [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] profiled on the same microarray platform. In the PETACC-3 prospective randomized clinical trial, the primary objective was to investigate whether the addition of adjuvant irinotecan to adjuvant 5-FU + leucovorin (LV5FU) would improve relapse-free survival (RFS). The study concluded that adding irinotecan to LV5FU did not significantly improve survival, but they observed a statistically non-significant trend in favor of treatment with irinotecan in addition to LV5FU [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Conclusions from the present study were that there was no association between the irinotecan sensitivity predictor and patient outcome while the data suggest the 5-FU response profile does correlate with outcomes of patients receiving 5-FU-based adjuvant therapy. These data justify further clinical evaluation of the 5-FU response profile.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Predictor development based on in vitro assays</title><p>The in vitro based MPI method to develop a predictor of drug response has been described previously [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Briefly, it is an algorithm based on growth inhibition values (GI50) of the NCI60 cell lines [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] subjected to treatment with either 5-FU, irinotecan or SN-38. SN-38 is the active metabolite of irinotecan. Gene expression measurements were performed with an Affymetrix HG-U133A array. After logit normalization, genes with a Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient to GI50 above 0.25 or below -0.25 were considered as potential biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to treatment and retained to contribute to the profiles for 5-FU, irinotecan or SN-38, respectively. To sort away genes only active in the in vitro setting mRNA measurements from more than 3200 snap frozen clinical tumor samples were then applied to each profile. Hereby, only markers already known to be present in patient tumors contributed to the final profiles. Each signature consists of two sets of genes (up- and down-regulated features). The profile scores were defined as the difference between the averages of the two groups of features for each of the drugs. The scores were then scaled to cover the range from 0 to 100. A sample was classified as sensitive to a treatment, if the corresponding normalized profile score was larger than 50. All other samples were considered to be resistant.</p><p>The array (Almac Diagnostics Colorectal Cancer DSA) used for analysis of mRNA in the FFPE patient samples is different from the array (HG-U133A) used for deriving the mRNA profile in vitro. That required an additional translation of the profile from one array type to another which was done by MPI before the profile was tested externally by SIB in the two study populations.</p><p>The NCI has obtained the 60 cell lines from their sources as described <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dtp.cancer.gov/default.htm">https://dtp.cancer.gov/default.htm</ext-link> [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Data sets and arrays</title><p>For the PETACC-3 data set, the gene expression profiles were generated from FFPE colorectal cancer slides.

The profile conducted at Medical Prognosis Institute was sent to the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics for all statistical analysis to be conducted there with a fully fixed testing procedure defined in an analysis plan prior to the execution.</p><p>Relapse-free survival (RFS) was used as main end point to compare the results on both data sets. RFS is defined as the time from the date of random allocation to the first date of relapse (local, regional, or distant), the occurrence of a second primary CC, or death. Overall survival (OS) as a secondary objective is defined as the time from the date of randomization to death of any cause.</p><p>Additional variables in the multivariable analyses were treatment group, age, gender, tumor site, T stage (T1-2, T3, and T4), N stage (N1 and N2) and tumor grade (G1-2 and G3-4), KRAS mutation, BRAF mutation and microsatellite instability (MSI) when the variables were available.</p><p>The analysis plan was designed to look for associations between prediction scores and clinical outcome. Patients were discriminated in 2 groups based on the computed profile score. Patients with a 5-FU profile score smaller or equal to 50 were labeled as poor prognosis (resistant). The other patients were considered as good prognosis (sensitive) in relation to 5-FU treatment.</p><p>A log-rank test was used to test the profile as a discrete variable comparing the survival curves of patients predicted sensitive to those predicted resistant. Second, the plan was to fit (multivariable) Cox Proportional Hazards models using the continuous profile scores.</p><p>Further, the hazard ratios for the 5-FU profile for relapse-free survival in the PETACC-3 and the Kennedy cohort were compared using a z-test. This is based on the assumptions that with the null hypotheses that the two HR are equal, that the error distribution of the estimates are normally distributed and that the two populations are comparable. However, it must be stressed that the two populations represent two distinct cohorts with all the differences this can lead to.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec010"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Expression arrays and cell-line sensitivity data</title><p>The irinotecan profile derived from the NCI60 cell lines consisted of 38 positively correlated genes and 32 negatively correlated genes.

The resulting gene expression profile of genes can explain the differential sensitivity in vitro. But this gene expression profile is not directly predictive in a clinical setting. To predict patient responses to the same drug, a translation from the in vitro profile to a clinical profile is necessary. MPI filters the in vitro profile through a systems biological network derived from analysis of patient samples.</p><p>For application to the clinical studies, the genes found to be markedly up- or down-regulated in the profiles were translated by the MPI laboratory to corresponding ALMAC probe sets in order to be tested in the two clinical data sets.</p><p>Using a prospective-retrospective trial design is considered necessary to reach a sufficient level of evidence to determine clinical utility when validating predictive biomarkers [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The design of the PETACC-3 trial allows for a direct validation of irinotecan predictive biomarkers while it lacks an untreated arm to test biomarker candidates to predict benefit from 5-FU treatment. A total of 636 stage III CC patients from the PETACC-3 study were included in the present study.</p><p>The most interesting finding of the present study was that the 5-FU response profile significantly separated the PETACC-3 patients into a larger group (79% of the patients) of good and a smaller group (21% of the patients) of poor prognosis independently from the known prognostic clinicopathological parameters TN stage, MSI/MSS-status, site, grade, and activating mutations in KRAS and BRAF. In contrast, the irinotecan expression profile did not lead to a statistically significant split. When dividing the present patient cohort according to treatment arm, similar results were obtained, meaning that the irinotecan profile did not provide predictive nor prognostic information.</p><p>The scaling of the profile was a linear transformation that does not affect the distribution but only the interpretability of the score. The cutoff of 50 is close to the median in many populations, but in the stage III PETACC population it was far from the median. We had to stick to the cutoff of 50, however, because this was defined in the statistical analysis plan before looking at the clinical data.</p><p>Since patients in both treatment groups of the PETACC-3 trial received 5-FU, it is not possible to distinguish a profile indicative of smaller intrinsic risk from a profile predictive of a survival benefit due to 5-FU efficacy. A purely prognostic profile should recognize different risk groups also in untreated populations. However, we did not observe any statistically significant prognostic effect in the Kennedy cohort, not even a trend. This could be interpreted as the difference between good and poor survival groups in the PETACC-3 cohort as identified by the 5-FU profile, is mainly due to difference in benefit from 5-FU.</p><p>An alternative interpretation is that the profile has a strong purely prognostic value in stage III (PETACC-3) but not in stage II (Kennedy), or that the observation is due to other and unknown differences between the two patient cohorts cannot be excluded.</p><p>A comparison of biomarker validation results from multiple data sets has several limitations. In this study, first, the PETACC-3 subpopulation consisted of stage III CC patients, the Kennedy cohort of stage II CC patients. Second, the set of available covariates was different and some important characteristics, such as MSI status, were not always available. In the PETACC-3 subpopulation there is an overrepresentation of male patients while in the Kennedy cohort this is better balanced. Furthermore, the balance of left- versus right-sided tumors in the PETACC-3 cohort and the Kennedy cohort differ (with many missing data on primary tumor location for the patients of the Kennedy cohort).</p><p>It should be noted that finding suitable data sets to assess a potential predictive ability of a biomarker for adjuvant 5-FU and/or irinotecan treatment in CC patients is difficult. Most studies comparing treatment with 5-FU to untreated patients were conducted many years ago and the patient populations would not be representative of today&#x02019;s CC patients anymore. For example, among many improvements, surgical procedures have been significantly further developed.</p><p>Despite the two cohorts being different, we asked if there was a significant difference in the hazard ratios for the 5-FU profile for RFS in PETACC-3 (HR = 0.54; 95% CI = (0.41, 0.71)) and in the Kennedy cohort (HR = 0.92; 95% CI = (0.64, 1.33)) with a test comparing the two hazard ratios which demonstrated a significant difference (z-test, p = 0.02). However, due to major differences between the two analyzed cohorts, this result needs further clinical validation in tumor material obtained from an appropriately designed clinical study.</p><p>The irinotecan profile failed to demonstrate any significant separation of the PETACC-3 patients or the Kennedy cohort. One explanation to this finding is that, since there was no significant effect of adding treatment with irinotecan in the original PETACC-3 study, any subpopulation that would benefit from adding irinotecan might be too small to be detected with the available patient samples. Another explanation that cannot be excluded is that there is no benefit from adjuvant irinotecan treatment in stage III CC. This latter explanation is supported by the CALGB 89803 study which had a similar design as the PETACC-3 study and which also failed to demonstrate any significant benefit from addition of irinotecan to LV5FU [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Adjuvant treatment of CC patients in stage II or III has stagnated even with many attempts of introducing new drugs during the past decade [<xref rid="pone.0155123.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Biomarkers to assist the physician in regards of prognosis, of prediction of treatment efficacy and expected severe toxicities to antineoplastic treatment of CC have long been eagerly awaited. Only few prognostic biomarkers have been implemented clinically and no biomarkers for 5-FU or irinotecan sensitivity have been developed to a stage where they can be used in routine treatment of CC. An important issue with the validation of biomarkers in adjuvant treatment of CC is that patients not experiencing a disease recurrence could either have been cured by the primary surgery (representing sensitive or resistant tumors) or by the subsequent chemotherapy (representing sensitive tumors), while patients having disease recurrence are considered to have resistant tumors. This is an inherent problem to which there is no satisfying solution when analyzing predictive biomarkers in the adjuvant setting.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study presents a novel 5-FU mRNA expression profile which could separate the stage III subpopulation of the PETACC-3 patient cohort into subgroups with statistically significant different outcome. By also applying this profile to a cohort of untreated CC patients, we here provide suggestions for a possible association between the 5-FU profile and benefit from adjuvant 5-FU treatment in stage III CC patients. We are currently seeking to validate our 5-FU data in an independent patient cohort.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0155123.s001"><label>S1 Doc</label><caption><title>Data Processing in PETACC-3 data.</title><p>The document describes human sample material and data processing with R statistical software on the PETACC-3 data.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0155123.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0155123.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>PETACC-3 subpopulation of patients stratified by their irinotecan profile score.</title><p>Patients with an irinotecan profile score smaller or equal to 50 were labeled as poor prognosis, the other ones as good prognosis in relation to 5-FU treatment.

For example, the KRAS mutation status was not assessed in most of the samples (1395 missing values). Hence, the information that only 24% of the samples are wild-type is somewhat misleading: In italics, one can see that among the assessed samples, 60.4% were found to be wild-type and 39.4% to be KRAS mutated. <bold>Part B.
