Various adjuvants such as fentanyl, midazolam, and clonidine have been tried along with local anesthetics, to prolong the intraoperative block and postoperative analgesia.</p><p>A most common problem during infraumbilical surgeries under subarachnoid block is visceral pain, nausea, and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Addition of an adjuvant to the intrathecal local anesthetics will improve the quality of the intraoperative block and early postoperative analgesia. The addition of opioids to local anesthetics has disadvantages, such as pruritus and respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting.</p><p>In recent years, &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor receptor gains wide popularity as an anesthetic adjuvants and also as analgesics. Their primary effect is sympatholytic. They reduce peripheral norepinephrine release by the stimulation of prejunctional inhibitory &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptors. They also inhibit the central neural transmission in dorsal horn by presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanism. They also have direct sympatholytic effect on spinal preganglionic sympathetic neurons. Sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic properties of alpha agonists favor the wide clinical use. The addition of dexmedetomidine to the local anesthetics provides effective analgesia for acute and chronic pain.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha 2 agonist when compared to clonidine (affinity for alpha 2 receptor is 1600:1, clonidine 200:1). Hence, it is used in clinical practice as an adjuvant to regional, local, and general anesthesia. Dexmedetomidine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration as an intravenous (IV) additive for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation, but recently, it is widely used an adjuvant to the local anesthetics. The addition of dexmedetomidine for intrathecal local anesthetics prolongs the duration of both sensory block, motor block, and postoperative analgesia without severe sedation. This effect is due to the sparing of supraspinal central nervous system so that it reduces the requirement of immediate postoperative analgesics.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>It produces dose-dependent sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia without respiratory depression. Activation of the receptors in the brain and spinal cord inhibits neuronal firing causing hypotension, bradycardia, sedation, and analgesia.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The previous studies revealed prolongation of spinal block by intrathecal 5 and 10 &#x003bc;g dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant with no significant effect on blood pressure or heart rate (HR).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Not many studies have been done to compare the effect of different doses of dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant with intrathecal bupivacaine in infraumbalical surgeries, and hence, we designed this study to evaluate the effects of different doses of dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to hyperbaric bupivacaine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>After obtaining the Institutional Ethical Committee approval, ninety patients of either sex of 18&#x02013;60 years of age were scheduled for lower abdominal surgeries.
