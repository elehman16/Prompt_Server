In light of our own findings in a recently performed randomized controlled trial (RCT) with milk fat globule membrane (MFGM)-supplemented infant formula in Swedish infants, we would like to make a few comments.</p><p>Billeaud et al evaluated two MFGM-supplemented formulas: one with a lipid-rich MFGM concentrate (MFGM-L) and one with a protein-rich MFGM concentrate (MFGM-P). In a primary pairwise analysis, there was no significant difference in proportion of infants with eczema between the control group and any of the MFGM-supplemented groups. However, in a post hoc analysis with all three groups, the incidence of eczema was higher in the MFGM-P group (13.9%) compared to the control (3.5%) and MFGM-L (1.4%) groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Eczema was assessed based on parental reports, daily records, and physician examination. It is not clear at which age during the first 12 months these figures refer to.</p><p>We performed an RCT comparing infants fed an MFGM-enriched formula with the same whey-based MFGM concentrate as the MFGM-P group in the study by Billeaud et al (Lacprodan MFGM-10; Arla Foods Ingredients, Viby, Denmark) or standard formula from inclusion at zero to two months of age until six months of age. We found a significantly higher cognitive score at 12 months of age<xref rid="b2-cmped-9-2015-063" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and a lower incidence of otitis media<xref rid="b3-cmped-9-2015-063" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> up to 6 months of age in the group fed MFGM-supplemented formula. Our results suggest that MFGM supplementation of infant formula may be important to narrow the gap in performance between breast-fed and formula-fed infants. We concluded that further high-quality RCTs need be performed, in different settings, with different concentrations and different MFGM concentrates for a robust scientific base for future recommendations on MFGM supplementation of infant formulas.</p><p>In our study, we assessed skin reactions by a prospective parental diary where parents were asked to mark each day the infant had a rash. We found no difference between the groups during the intervention period. The incidence of rash was 17% and 26% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.22), the median of the longitudinal prevalence was 0.0% and 0.8% of days, and the 95th percentile of the longitudinal prevalence was 4.8% and 15.6% of days (<italic>P</italic> = 0.21) for the group fed MFGM-supplemented formula and control formula, respectively. For the breast-fed reference group, 30% of the parents reported rash, the median longitudinal prevalence was 4.1% of days, and the 95th percentile of the longitudinal prevalence was 36% of days. Thus, we did not find an increased risk of skin reactions in our MFGM-supplemented group.</p><p>We fully agree with Billeaud et al in their conclusion that their finding of a higher incidence of eczema in the MFGM-P group should be interpreted with caution. Both the limited number of observations and the lack of a systematic eczema scoring system in both studies make the results uncertain. We believe that more, sufficiently powered, high-quality RCTs assessing the safety and effects of MFGM supplementation of infant formula are required before firm conclusions can be drawn. In future studies, we suggest that a systematic scoring system should be used to assess the morbidity of eczema.<xref rid="b4-cmped-9-2015-063" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-cmped-9-2015-063"><p><bold>ACADEMIC EDITOR:</bold> Praveen Kumar, Editor in Chief</p></fn><fn id="fn2-cmped-9-2015-063"><p><bold>FUNDING:</bold> Authors disclose no funding sources.</p></fn><fn id="fn3-cmped-9-2015-063"><p><bold>COMPETING INTERESTS:</bold> NT discloses grants from Hero/Semper, outside the submitted work.
