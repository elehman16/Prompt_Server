</xref> Preclinical research has shown that the addition of atypical antipsychotics such as aripiprazole can reverse the suppression of firing of norepinephrine neurons produced by selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors through their antagonism of serotonin 2A (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>) receptors.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Both mechanisms may help to explain the adjunctive effects of atypical antipsychotics in MDD. The efficacy of atypical antipsychotic agents in monotherapy is not well established.

</xref> Similar evidence for aripiprazole is not available. However, aripiprazole has other mechanisms of action that potentially could improve depressive symptoms but are not related to its pharmacodynamic interaction with an antidepressant. As a dopamine D<sub>2</sub> partial agonist, aripiprazole may increase dopamine levels in hypo-dopaminergic states; as a 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> partial agonist, it may enhance serotonergic transmission; and as a 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> partial agonist, it may increase extracellular dopamine and norepinephrine concentrations.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Full details of the study design and methods have been reported previously. In brief, eligible patients were aged 18&#x02013;65 years, with a diagnosis of major depressive episode (according to the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, 4th Edition, Text Revision [DSM-IV-TR]) lasting &#x02265;8 weeks and a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17) Total score &#x02265;18. All patients reported an inadequate response to 1&#x02013;3 prior ADTs. An inadequate response was defined as less than a 50% reduction in severity of depressive symptoms, as assessed by the Massachusetts General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire. Patients were enrolled in an 8-week, prospective antidepressant monotherapy phase (Phase B), and received 1 of 5 antidepressants (fluoxetine, paroxetine [either immediate- or controlled-release [CR] formulation], sertraline escitalopram, or venlafaxine extended release [ER]), flexibly dosed, along with co-administration of a single-blind placebo. Patients with an inadequate response to the prospective antidepressant monotherapy at the end of Phase B then entered a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase (Phase C). An inadequate response to treatment in Phase B was defined as a &#x0003c;50% reduction in HAM-D17 Total score, a HAM-D17 Total score of &#x02265;14, and a Clinical Global Impression&#x02013;Improvement score of &#x02265;3. Patients were randomized to receive either adjunctive aripiprazole or placebo, while continuing on the same open-label ADT at an unchanged dose. This <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis focused on the subset of patients randomized in Phase C whose MADRS score increased during initial treatment in Phase B.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="general"><title>Medication doses</title><p>In the prospective phase, the following ADT doses were targeted: escitalopram (10 or 20 mg/day), fluoxetine (20 or 40 mg/day), paroxetine CR (37.5 or 50 mg/day; paroxetine 30 or 40 mg/day if paroxetine CR unavailable), sertraline (100 or 150 mg/day), or venlafaxine ER (150 or 225 mg/day). No ADT dose increases were permitted after Week 4.</p><p>In the randomized phase, aripiprazole dosing was started at 5 mg/day and was increased to 10 mg/day after the first week of treatment (Week 9) if tolerated, with a maximum dose of 15&#x02013;20 mg/day.

On average, symptoms of these patients worsened by a clinically relevant 3&#x02013;4 points on the MADRS scale during ADT monotherapy. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis to analyze the impact of any atypical antipsychotic or adjunctive agent for the treatment of a patient population experiencing a worsening of depressive symptoms. Interestingly, the response and remission rates for ADT-Worseners receiving adjunctive aripiprazole treatment were similar (36.6% and 25.4%, respectively) to the response (36.0%) and remission rates (24.0%) of ADT-Minimal Responders,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> suggesting that adjunctive aripiprazole may be an effective intervention across the spectrum of patients with an inadequate response to ADT.</p><p>In the current analysis, fewer of the weekly change scores and the weekly response and remission rates were significant in the ADT-Worseners subgroup than in the ADT-Non-worseners. Mean change from baseline on the SDS at endpoint was not significantly different between ADT-Worseners receiving adjunctive aripiprazole and placebo, whereas there was a significantly greater mean reduction from baseline at endpoint in ADT-Non-worseners receiving adjunctive aripiprazole versus adjunctive placebo. The sample size of ADT-Worseners, however, was considerably smaller than the subset of ADT-Non-worseners (n = 160 vs n = 905, respectively), and this may have limited the number of significant differences in the ADT-Worsener group. The magnitude of differences appeared to be relatively similar in the two groups. For example, change in MADRS Total score for patients receiving adjunctive aripiprazole compared with those receiving placebo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) was similar in ADT-Worseners and ADT-Non-worseners. In addition, the NNTs to achieve response and remission were also similar for both ADT-Worseners and ADT-Non-worseners.</p><p>Clinical practice and certain guidelines have favored augmentation therapy in patients with a partial response to ADT, but with a preference for switching to alternative antidepressants in patients with minimal response. The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatment guidelines recommend increasing dose or switching to an alternative ADT when patient improvement on a depression rating scale is &#x0003c;20% and augmentation for patients with a response to ADT &#x0003e;20%.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref> However, in the past, such guidelines have been based on rational or practical grounds rather than evidence of efficacy, or lack thereof. The argument for switching medication is strengthened in patients whose symptoms worsen during ADT. However, the findings of the current analysis challenge this consideration and suggest that adjunctive aripiprazole is effective in ADT-Worseners.</p><p>Every change in treatment requires additional practical considerations, including safety and tolerability considerations and patient preference. A practical advantage of using adjunctive aripiprazole in the treatment of MDD is the fact that changes occur quickly and are highly predictive of final effectiveness.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Because aripiprazole is a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and CYP2D6, dose adjustments of aripiprazole are necessary when used with strong CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 (eg, fluoxetine, paroxetine) inhibitors; however, aripiprazole does not affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics of escitalopram, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, or sertraline.<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>The current analysis has interesting neuropharmacologic implications relative to mechanism of action for adjunctive aripiprazole in MDD. In this study, the addition of aripiprazole resulted in symptomatic improvement in patients who exhibited no improvement on the initial antidepressant and, in fact, experienced some worsening of symptoms. This suggests that either the initial antidepressant monotherapy may have had neuropharmacologic effects that acted synergistically with the addition of aripiprazole, or that aripiprazole has independent antidepressant properties. There is no definitive evidence to support either hypothesis, and it is conceivable that both mechanisms could play a role.</p><sec id="sec4-1" sec-type="general"><title>Limitations</title><p>The current analysis has limitations, including its <italic>post-hoc</italic> nature and small sample sizes; the power for some analyses may be insufficient to detect statistical significance. None of the analyses presented here were pre-specified, and all <italic>P</italic>-values reported represent nominal <italic>P</italic>-values without adjustment for multiplicity. This is a retrospective analysis, and, although the 3 trials included in this retrospective analysis were not designed to assess the outcomes in patients who showed worsening of symptoms with an initial ADT, the similar design of the 3 studies allowed the pooling of data. Although an objective threshold of any worsening was elected as &#x0003e;0% change in the MADRS score, 48% of patients had a &#x0003c;10% increase in MADRS score, and this increase may reflect fluctuations in MADRS score rather than meaningful deterioration; future studies might incorporate additional outcome measures assessing symptoms such as anxiety or compare degree of worsening using larger sample sizes. The adjunctive treatment phase in the 3 trials was relatively brief (6 weeks), perhaps underestimating the full effect of augmentation during a longer trial. In addition, these short-term trials do not address whether response and remission rates in the short term will be sustained in the long term. The strict inclusion/exclusion criteria used in patient selection for these trials may limit the generalizability of the findings to clinical practice.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results presented here suggest that adjunctive aripiprazole is an effective intervention across the spectrum of patients who show an inadequate response to antidepressant monotherapy, including patients whose symptoms worsen during antidepressant monotherapy. This finding challenges the view that the benefits of adjunctive treatment are limited to patients with MDD who have had a partial response to ADT, and suggests that augmentation may constitute a viable treatment strategy among ADT-Worseners.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Disclosures</title><p>During the past 3 years, J.
