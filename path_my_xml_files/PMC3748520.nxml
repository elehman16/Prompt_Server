Uganda was one of the first countries to implement this strategy in 2002. In this strategy, community medicine distributors (CMDs), also known as community drug distributors or community health workers, treat children with fever in the community with antimalarial drugs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> The CMDs lacked formal medical training but were trained for at least five days in management of fever as a symptom of malaria. The proportion of children receiving prompt and appropriate treatment increased with this strategy, but was nevertheless below the 2000 Abuja targets of 60%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> and its use was low.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Furthermore, some children with other illnesses (e.g., pneumonia) were treated with antimalarial drugs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> because of symptom overlap or co-infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></p><p>Integrated community case management of childhood illnesses (ICCM) was recommended in 2004 and has been adopted by some countries, including Uganda. In ICCM, CMDs use an evidence-based algorithm to treat children at the community level with antimalarial drugs, antibiotics, and oral rehydration salts. More drugs are accessible to the community under ICCM than under HBMF and this increased acccessibility may improve treatment patterns of children. However, easy access to drugs could also promote drug misuse, leading to wasting of resources and development of resistance to antibiotics. In Zambia, ICCM improved pneumonia treatment of children treated by CHWs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> However, it remains unclear whether this new strategy will improve use and appropriateness of treatment compared with what has been achieved with the HBMF strategy in other settings with different care-seeking and treatment practices. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the effect of ICCM and HBMF strategies on use of CMDs and community drug use patterns in children 6&#x02013;59 months of age.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and setting.</title><p>A cross-sectional study was conducted during January&#x02013;February 2011 in Iganga-Mayuge Health and Demographic Surveillance Site in eastern Uganda. The population in the area is approximately 70,000 persons living in 13,000 households in 65 villages, where approximately 90% live in rural areas. Malaria is endemic to the area, and there are two main transmission seasons (March and September). The population of children less than five years is approximately 11,000 and the mortality rate in children less than five years of age is 128 per 1,000 live births.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> The study area has 10 government and 3 non-governmental organization health facilities, 122 drug shops and private clinics, and 132 CMDs. A cluster randomized trial to evaluate the impact of integrated presumptive management of malaria and pneumonia with antimalarial drugs and antibiotics on mortality in children less than five years of age has been ongoing in the area since 2009 (trial registration no. ISRCTN52966230).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Description of cluster randomized trial.</title><p>The 65 villages in the area were aggregated into 8 urban and 18 rural clusters, which were then randomized to either intervention arm or control arm. Each village has two CMDs that treat children less than five years of age. The basic criteria for working as a CMD are that one is able to read and write, is chosen by the community, and has received short-term training in treatment of children. The CMDs were all trained initially for one week in the management of malaria. In the intervention arm, the CMDs received additional training in the management of pneumonia for one week. Finally, CMDs in both arms receive monthly refresher training. In the intervention arm, CMDs treat children with fever using antimalarial drugs (artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine [AL]). Children with non-severe respiratory symptoms according to Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses guidelines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> are also treated with antibiotics (amoxicillin). In the control arm, CMDs treat children with fever using antimalarial drugs (AL), and those with respiratory symptoms of any severity are referred to health facilities. In both arms, children with severe respiratory or severe malaria symptoms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> are referred to health facilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The medicines used by the CMDs were pre-packaged in age-specific doses. Health workers from the nearest health center or hospital conduct monthly support supervision of CMDs in both arms to assess drug storage, treatment practices, and record keeping. Before the start of the study, community sensitization seminars about the intervention, recognition of illness in children, and prompt care seeking were conducted.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Algorithm for treatment of children by Community Medicines Distributors in Iganga-Mayuge health and demographic surveillance site. + Cough or difficult breathing with fast breathing (i.e. &#x02265; 50 breaths per minute for child aged 4-12 months; &#x02265; 40 breaths per minute for child aged 12--59 months). * Cough or difficult breathing with chest indrawing or noisy breathing.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="tropmed-87-36-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Participants and sampling.</title><p>We sampled 1,400 children 6&#x02013;59 months of age from the health and demographic surveillance site database by using random sampling stratified by intervention and control villages to obtain equal numbers from each arm of the cluster randomized trial.

This finding confirms the findings of a qualitative study from Uganda, which showed that persons from the poorest quintile were more likely to use free public health facilities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> However, our findings contrast with those of a study in western Uganda in which children in the least poor quintile were more likely to receive medicines from CMDs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> The differences in the study findings may be caused by differences in availability of other sources of health care, e.g., private clinics that the caregivers of higher socioeconomic status are more able to afford.</p><p>Caregivers with more knowledge of malaria preventive strategies and danger signs of illness were more likely to seek care for their children from CMDs than those with less knowledge. This finding may reflect transmission of knowledge from CMDs to caregivers when the caregivers seek care for their children from CMDs. It could also be explained by caregivers having more knowledge about illness being more aware that they can get effective drugs for the illness from CMDs and therefore seek care from them. Knowledge has been shown to influence treatment practices in other studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></p><p>The findings of rational use of medicines among CMDs in our study are similar to those of studies in western Uganda, rural Senegal, and Zambia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> All children treated for malaria symptoms by CMDs received the recommended drug. However, only 37% of them received prompt and appropriate treatment. The children treated for malaria by CMDs had much better results than those treated by other health providers, for which only 38% received the correct drug and 9% received prompt and appropriate treatment. The main challenges of treatment for CMDs and other health providers were in dosing schedules and treatment duration. These challenges might be caused by dosing errors or inadequate information on drug administration given to caregivers by health providers, or misinterpretation of instructions by caregivers. In children treated by other health providers, there was an additional problem of prescription of ineffective medicines, which calls for stronger drug regulation to avoid having these drugs on the market. The proportion of children receiving prompt and appropriate treatment in our study was slightly higher than that found in a previous study in western Uganda under the HBMF strategy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> and in rural Senegal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></p><p>It is more difficult to interpret the results for the treatment of pneumonia symptoms from our study. We could only get self-reported pneumonia symptoms, and it is well known that not all children with self-reported pneumonia symptoms have objective signs of pneumonia and therefore should be treated with antibiotics. The CMDs have been trained to promote rational use of antibiotics through respiratory rate assessment before prescription. The proportion of children treated with recommended antibiotics did not differ between CMD users and non-CMD users in the intervention arm, which suggested that CMDs may perform as well in provision of appropriate medicines for pneumonia as other health care providers. Furthermore, the concern that CMDs may increase overuse of antibiotics does not seem to be correct. However, there is a need to ensure that their skills in respiratory assessment are adequate and that they are not failing to diagnose pneumonia in children. This finding is supported by findings from a study among CMDs in Uganda where classification of pneumonia was inadequate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> Further studies of pneumonia treatment by CMDs are needed in which objective measurements of pneumonia are included.</p><p>Surprisingly, the use of pre-packed antibiotics did not result in better dosing among children treated by CMDs for self-reported pneumonia symptoms. Pre-packaged drugs have been reported to result in better drug use.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> These findings may result from caregiver's non-adherence to dosing instructions either because of misunderstanding of the instructions or of wrong perceptions about how the medicines should be administered to children. The dosing range for the amoxicillin used by CMDs is 1&#x02013;3 tablets. This number of tablets is quite high compared with what caregivers are used to for treatment of common conditions in these age groups. This finding may explain why many of the children not treated with recommended doses had used does that were too low. This hypothesis may need to be explored with further studies. However, we also cannot not rule out incorrect dosing by CMDs, or misreporting of how medicines were administered because of problems in recall because we used caregiver reports of medicines used for illness in the past two weeks.</p><p>Having CMDs that provide amoxicillin increases the use of a more effective oral drug against pneumonia instead of cotrimoxazole, which most other health providers are prescribing but to which high levels of resistance have been demonstrated elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> Approximately half of the children who were treated with antibiotics received cotrimoxazole. However, approximately half of those that received amoxicillin received it from CMDs.</p><p>We had hypothesized that ICCM would improve drug use patterns for pneumonia because of the improved access to medicines, having pre-packaged medicines delivered by trained CMDs, and general improvement in practices especially of health workers that supervise the CMDs. However, our study did not find a significant difference in the proportions of children that received prompt and appropriate treatment for self-reported pneumonia symptoms in the intervention and control arms. Nevertheless, there were higher proportions of children in the intervention arm that received drugs in the correct frequency and duration. The non-significant difference in overall practices in the intervention and control arms may have been caused by insufficient power to detect differences because of the low numbers that were ill with pneumonia and subsequently the low numbers receiving appropriate treatment. It is likely that the influence of ICCM on the community drug use patterns may have been small, therefore requiring large sample sizes to detect it.</p><p>We used caregivers reports of illness in children in the two weeks before the interview, which may have led to inclusion of illness that occurred earlier than the two weeks. This finding may explain the high illness rate (74%) reported in our study. In addition, we did not have sufficient power to detect differences in pneumonia treatment practices between study arms because of the small number of children with pneumonia symptoms who received prompt and appropriate treatment. Measurement bias may have occurred because of misreporting of symptoms or treatments in children by caregivers, and misinterpretation of fast breathing. However, we showed caregivers posters of commonly used drugs in the area to aid recall and also examined prescriptions and dispensed drugs when these were available.</p><p>Use of CMDs increased in the intervention arm, suggesting that CMDs who can treat pneumonia, in addition to malaria, increase uptake of their services. However, overall CMD use is still quite low and private clinics and drug shops are still preferred. Nevertheless, CMDs may have greater effect in districts where private clinics and drug shops are less numerous. Because most children in our study sought care from other sources, especially private clinics, interventions to improve the management of malaria and pneumonia should be introduced in the private sector. Malaria treatment was much better among CMD users than non-CMD-users, whereas no difference could be seen in the treatment of self reported pneumonia symptoms. However, prompt and appropriate treatment of malaria and pneumonia is poor and mainly caused by inappropriate drug use. The CMDs are championing the use of effective antimalarial drugs and antibiotics in a situation in which children continue to receive ineffective medicines.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank the study participants and Iganga-Mayuge Health and Demographic Surveillance Site administration and staff, most notably Edward Galiwango, Judith Kaija, Jane Mirembe, and James Kalungi for making this study possible; and the research assistants and data entrants for their hard work during this research.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="supported-by"><p>Financial support: This study was supported by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency and the United Nations Children's Fund/ United Nations Development Program/World Bank/World Health Organization Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases.</p></fn><fn id="FN2" fn-type="present-address"><p>Authors' addresses: Joan N.
