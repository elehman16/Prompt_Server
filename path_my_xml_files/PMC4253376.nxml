This paper examines routine GP care within the <italic>lifestyle approach to managing panic</italic> (LAMP) study. The aim of this paper is to describe/discuss routine GP care for panic disorder (PD) patients within both study arms in the LAMP study. An unblinded pragmatic randomised controlled trial in 15 East of England GP practices (2 primary care trusts). Participants met <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition</italic> criteria for PD with/without agoraphobia. Follow-up measures recorded at 20 weeks/10 months following randomisation. Control arm, unrestricted routine GP care (practice appointments, referrals and prescriptions). Trial arm, occupational therapy-led lifestyle treatment comprising lifestyle review of fluid intake, diet pattern, exercise, caffeine, alcohol and nicotine. Primary outcome measure: beck anxiety inventory. At baseline, participants attended 2&#x02013;3 times more GP appointments than population average, reducing at 10 months to 1.6 times population average for routine GP care and 0.97 population average for lifestyle arm. At 10 months, 33% fewer referrals (6 referrals; 0 mental health) than at baseline (9 referrals; 2 mental health) were made for lifestyle arm patients compared with 42% increase (from 12 referrals; 8 mental health at baseline to 17 referrals; 7 mental health) in GP care arm. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were prescribed most often. Benzodiazepines and beta-blockers were prescribed more often than tricyclic against current clinical guidelines. In conclusion, we found that PD patients at baseline were high healthcare resource users. Treatment in both study arms reduced resource use. Routine GP care requires further review for this patient group.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words:</title><kwd>clinical trial</kwd><kwd>panic disorder</kwd><kwd>lifestyle</kwd><kwd>primary care</kwd><kwd>occupational therapy.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Usual or routine general practice (GP) care has often been used as a comparator, but is fully discussed in very few papers, despite its importance in considering cost-effectiveness of interventions.

Prior approval for the study was provided by the relevant Local Research Ethics Committees. Participants were aged between 16 and 65 years and were recruited from 15 GP practices in the East of England between 2001 and 2003. Participants met the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition</italic> criteria for PD with/without agoraphobia,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and provided written informed consent including access to their GP practice data. Stable medication dosage was required for at least 4 weeks before entry into the study. Eligible participants were stratified for agoraphobia and for lifestyle factors (caffeine/alcohol/fluid intake, and smoking). After stratification, participants were randomly assigned to either routine GP care or to the occupational therapy-led lifestyle approach. Random allocation was carried out using sealed envelopes prepared in advance by the principal researcher. A power calculation using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) as the primary outcome measure, estimated that 485 referrals were required to achieve 90% power to detect a 5 point difference on the BAI, including an estimate of 50% participation from referrals received, and 30% loss to follow-up. Intention to treat analysis and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using SPSS v12 for Windows were used to report mean difference and 95% confidence intervals as an appropriate indicator of study power and significance of results.</p><p>Routine GP care in this study was described from data from GP practice records over the 3 month period before baseline, and before follow-up at 20 weeks and 10 months, to include the:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>average number of GP appointments</p></list-item><list-item><p>average number of non-GP practice appointments</p></list-item><list-item><p>total number of referrals to other agencies or specialisms</p></list-item><list-item><p>total number, type and cost of prescriptions.</p></list-item></list><p>The lifestyle intervention used lifestyle review of diet, fluid intake, exercise and habitual lifestyle drug use (caffeine, alcohol and nicotine), providing up to 10 intervention sessions over a 16-week period, delivered in four stages:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>lifestyle review using self-report mood and lifestyle diaries</p></list-item><list-item><p>education to increase patient awareness of health behaviours with potentially detrimental (such as smoking and poor diet pattern) and beneficial (such as sufficient exercise and sufficient fluid intake) health effects</p></list-item><list-item><p>negotiation of specific lifestyle changes (in diet, fluid intake, exercise or habitual lifestyle drug use) between therapist and patient</p></list-item><list-item><p>monitoring and review of agreed lifestyle changes and changes in symptomatology.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S3"><title>Results</title><p>One hundred ninety-nine referrals were received, unevenly distributed across participating GP practices (minimum 1 referral; maximum 32 referrals; mean=13.3 referrals).

This represented a 42% increase in total referrals compared with baseline, and a 12% reduction in mental health referrals (from 8 to 7). In the lifestyle arm 22% (2/9) specific mental health referrals were made, increasing to 50% (2/4) at 20 weeks and reducing to 0% (0/6) at 10 months.

At 10 months a further 210 prescriptions were made to GP care arm patients (30% reduction from baseline). In the lifestyle arm, a further 100 prescriptions were made (58% reduction from baseline). Over the full 10 month period of the research, patients in the GP care arm received 663 prescriptions, compared with lifestyle arm patients who received 340 prescriptions.</p><p>Throughout the research period, 210 different medication/dosage combinations were prescribed. It was often impossible to determine, without individual review of each patient with their GP, which medications were prescribed as a direct result of the patient's PD. Analyses were therefore based on the 10 most favoured medications used in the three month period before each assessment. Fourteen medication types were identified as being the most favoured by GPs in the trial. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> shows that four antidepressant types were most commonly used with PD patients in the following order of preference; SSRIs, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and noradrenergic and serotonergic antidepressants, and that beta-blockers were the third most preferred medication type used.</p><p>

Minor between-group differences were observed for SSRI prescriptions (lifestyle arm 113; GP care arm 133), while over two and a half times as many prescriptions for benzodiazepines were given to GP care arm patients (lifestyle arm 24; GP care arm 62). Almost 3 times as many prescriptions for beta-blockers (63 prescriptions, 11%) were given to GP care arm patients compared with lifestyle arm patients (46 GP care arm; 17 lifestyle arm). A substantial proportion of GPs therefore prescribed beta-blockers for PD against the available evidence and advice. Approximately equal numbers of prescriptions for TCAs were given in both study arms (total prescriptions 33, 6%: lifestyle arm 14; GP care arm 19). Four prescriptions for one other antidepressant, mirtazepine (a noradrenergic and serotonergic antidepressant), were recorded. The remaining 35% of prescriptions were related to other medical problems such as asthma, gastro-intestinal disorders and diabetes. In the lifestyle arm, 16 prescriptions were made for medication targeted at smoking cessation (7 before baseline, and 9 at 10 months) compared with none in the GP care arm.</p><sec><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><p>The reporting of main study results using ANCOVA and 95% confidence intervals provides an appropriate and valid method of assessing actual study power in an otherwise underpowered study.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Routine GP care was reported using a wider range of variables than in previous studies of PD. It was often not possible to determine whether referrals made were specifically related to PD. The number of appointments made within each speciality was not recorded and may underestimate resource use.</p><p>The UK guidelines for the treatment of PD, and those from Australia and New Zealand, were published after the end of the trial. It is possible therefore that prescribing and referral practices may have changed since the end of the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>Links between the existing literature for GP practice appointments and referrals have been made throughout. Recommendations for appropriate medication for PD have been produced in practice guidelines by the American Psychiatric Association,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists and the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In the UK guidelines, SSRIs, imipramine or clomipramine, are primarily recommended, with other classes of antidepressant medication to be used only if there is no improvement. The American guidelines recommend that treatment decisions should be <italic>guided by considerations of adverse effects and the physician's understanding of the patient's personal preferences [&#x02026;] and other aspects of the clinical situation</italic> (12 p 570). They are cautious about combining medication and psychological therapies. However, the Australian and New Zealand guidelines, and those from the UK support the use of TCAs and SSRIs as being equal in efficacy, with both being preferred to benzodiazepines,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and that behaviour therapy should accompany drug treatment. Recent evidence suggests that beta-blockers continue to be regularly prescribed for PD patients,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> despite, no support being given for the use of beta-blockers or calcium-channel blockers in the treatment of PD in any of the stated clinical guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for future research or clinical practice</title><p>Only 2 referrals for psychologist input and no specific referrals for CBT were made. Clinical guidelines suggest that psychological therapies are currently considered the most effective form of treatment, followed by medication and self-help,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> despite recent evaluations that appear to query the overall efficacy of the Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies initiative.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Reasons for such persisting referral patterns require further investigation, although anecdotal evidence from discussions with GP practices during the trial suggest that, while the picture is improving, low levels of access and long waiting lists may contribute.</p><p>Beta-blockers appear to remain a relatively common medication used with PD patients, when their use has not been recommended in any published guidelines. Benzodiazepines were also favoured over TCAs. Further examination of prescribing practices is therefore required.</p><p>The lifestyle intervention was found to be at least as cost-effective as routine GP care over 10 months, but needs further investigation with a larger sample size to establish whether the clinical and economic gains observed during the LAMP study can be repeated.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements:</title><p>to the grant awarding bodies whose financial support made the research possible.
