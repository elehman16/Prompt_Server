The study was conducted in the Capital Medical University-Affiliated Beijing Chaoyang Hospital from January 2015 to January 2017. Chronic periodontitis was diagnosed based on the Classification System for Periodontal Diseases and Conditions published in 1999, and the clinical symptoms include periodontal pocket &#x0003e;3 mm, bleeding on probing, attachment loss, and/or tooth mobility.<xref rid="b13-ppa-12-359" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The patients with chronic periodontitis who were capable of performing daily oral cleaning and regular communication were recruited from our dental clinic and randomly assigned to either a control group or a test group. We excluded the patients with only gingivitis, patients who were not able to perform daily oral cleaning, or patients who were unconscious or incapable of communication. All the enrolled patients in the current study signed the informed consent agreements.</p><p>We designed and administered our procedure based on the CONSORT guidelines.<xref rid="b14-ppa-12-359" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Prior to the treatment, HQ and oral health status of the participants were evaluated and recorded by the nurses in our clinic. The nurses have been trained to deliver oral health instructions oral health instructions and calibrated for survey administration and HQ scoring. Both groups received standard periodontal treatments. After the standard periodontal treatments, patients in the control group received regular oral hygiene instructions, while the test group received the HQ training. The HQ training contents included personalized plans for oral health maintenance (eg, effective methods for brushing and flossing), relevant knowledge of systemic diseases and chronic periodontitis, as well as the importance of early nursing intervention and patient compliance. In the follow-up period, participants in the test group received one phone interview for 15 minutes. We evaluated the HQ score and oral health status at multiple time points: after 2&#x02013;4 sessions of periodontal scaling, as well as at the 3-month and 6-month posttreatment follow-up appointments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Survey tools and statistical analysis</title><p>Sociodemographic information of the participants, including gender, age, education level, family income, and medical history, was collected. The HQ self-reported questionnaire was applied to record participants&#x02019; holistic health status. There are five dimensions (self-care, health knowledge, lifestyle, and mental health) with 20 questions in each dimension.<xref rid="b7-ppa-12-359" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> There are seven options for each question, ranging from extremely disagree (0 point) to extremely agree (6 points). There are 600 points in maximum in this HQ questionnaire. HQ index of a particular factor is defined as the score of each section divided by three. The score is positively correlated with patients&#x02019; health status. Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14), a validated questionnaire derived from OHIP-49 in 1997, was also utilized in the study.<xref rid="b15-ppa-12-359" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> There were fourteen self-reported questions to evaluate the associations between sociodemographic status and oral health variables, ranging from never (0 point), seldom (1 point), and sometimes (2 points) to often (3 points) and always (4 points).<xref rid="b15-ppa-12-359" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The higher score indicates the poorer oral health.<xref rid="b15-ppa-12-359" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Data were analyzed using a two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test or one-way analysis of variance, and the differences were considered statistically significant when <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Clinical features</title><p>One hundred and five patients were enrolled in this study, including 53 male and 52 female participants. The mean age of our enrolled patients was 41.5 years, with most of them being in the 45 to 59-year age group (65 patients, 61.5%), followed by the 35 to 44-year age group (39 patients, 38.5%). In our study, the education level of 48 patients (45.7%) was below junior high school, followed by college graduates or beyond (34 patients, 32.4%) and senior high school (23 patients, 21.9%). Monthly income (RMB/month/person) of our patients varied from 500 to 1,000 (20 patients, 19.1%), 1,000 to 3,000 (30 patients, 28.5%), 3,000 to 5,000 (40 patients, 38.1%), and more than 5,000 (15 patients, 14.3%).

In addition, HQ stands for the consciousness, knowledge, and ability of health maintenance. HQ can be further divided into body quotient, moral quotient, relationship quotient, and spiritual quotient. HQ is composed of five dimensions: self-care, health knowledge, lifestyle, mental health, and life skills. The self-care dimension evaluates illness management skills, holistic health awareness, and positive personality.<xref rid="b7-ppa-12-359" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The health knowledge dimension assesses the understanding of health-related topics, the health care system, and health maintenance issues.<xref rid="b7-ppa-12-359" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The lifestyle dimension checks a wide range of life habits, such as substance abuse, sleep patterns, and exposure to environmental hazards.<xref rid="b7-ppa-12-359" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The mental health dimension examines mental, psychological, and emotional status; personal beliefs; and stress level.<xref rid="b7-ppa-12-359" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The life skills dimension evaluates social care, social support, and critical life skills.<xref rid="b7-ppa-12-359" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Maintenance of high HQ helps patients keep their healthy habits.<xref rid="b12-ppa-12-359" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, the current understanding for patients with chronic periodontitis was limited.</p><p>Our study investigated the HQ status in patients with chronic periodontitis. The results can guide nursing staff to develop a personalized health educational program and help patients improve their self-management in oral health. Our results indicated that personalized HQ education can improve the overall oral health in patients. HQ has become a popular topic in health education. According to the HQ theory, it is beneficial for an individual to transform the attitude and knowledge of health into daily habits.<xref rid="b9-ppa-12-359" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11-ppa-12-359" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Based on the principles of health education, there is a discrepancy (16%) between knowledge awareness and behavior incidence. To increase the HQ level, we need to emphasize health education from multiple aspects. In nursing practice, we should actively provide personalized health educational programs to the middle-aged patients with chronic disorders.<xref rid="b17-ppa-12-359" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Through the effective health education, patients will be more aware of their health status, and more capable of building up their health knowledge.<xref rid="b17-ppa-12-359" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-ppa-12-359" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Eventually, the overall HQ level will be enhanced.</p><p>Thus far, there was no study applying HQ on the patients with chronic periodontitis.<xref rid="b18-ppa-12-359" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Our study demonstrated a positive impact of HQ on holistic health status, both at the individual and group level. The research has shown that it is effective to help patients with chronic disorders maintain their healthy habits by the HQ educational programs. However, the workload in our dental clinic is beyond the capacity of dentists. It is challenging for the dentists to provide comprehensive oral hygiene instructions with the follow-up sessions in addition to the clinical routines. In this regard, it is critical to establish an effective multidisciplinary health care team. We can further enhance patients&#x02019; understanding of disease prevention, and thus improve patients&#x02019; compliance to periodontal treatments. This strategy will efficiently slow down the progression of chronic periodontitis and alleviate the damages to other organ systems.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results revealed that personalized educational programs targeted patients&#x02019; individual needs, and provided them better guidance in maintaining optimal oral health status. Moreover, personalized educational programs significantly improved patients&#x02019; compliance to periodontal treatments. This effective strategy not only decreased the severity and progression of chronic periodontitis but also alleviated distant tissue damages.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
