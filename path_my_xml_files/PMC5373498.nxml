Endurance exercise, with or without weight loss, reduces insulin resistance (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, the role of diet composition on insulin sensitivity, particularly the effect of the glycemic index (GI) of the diet is somewhat controversial. Recent data on dietary GI concluded that a low glycemic diet did not improve insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In contrast, we previously reported that when combined with exercise, both high and low-glycemic diets induce similar improvement in peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Skeletal muscle is a key site in the regulation of metabolism and insulin-regulated glucose uptake, and is exquisitely responsive to environmental changes, such as nutritional status and physical activity. The adaptations are largely caused by changes in muscle mitochondrial size, content and number, and are associated with changes in fat transport and oxidative enzymes, and oxidative respiratory components that can contribute to ATP production. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3; coactivator-1&#x003b1; (PGC-1&#x003b1;) is a transcriptional coactivator that plays a central role in regulating mitochondrial function and oxidative capacity (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) by augmenting the expression of proteins that promote transcription of both nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and mitochondrial DNA (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Suppression of skeletal muscle PGC-1&#x003b1; is associated with increased energy intake (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and the development of obesity, diabetes and metabolic diseases (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). On the other hand, exercise is associated with increased expression of PGC-1&#x003b1; and has been shown to facilitate skeletal muscle mitochondrial adaptations, including enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, bioenergetics, dynamics and oxidative capacity (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Fat transport and utilization in skeletal muscle also plays an integral role in metabolic homeostasis. Long-chain fatty acid transport across the plasma membrane is controlled by protein-mediated mechanisms that include CD36, fatty acid binding protein (FABP), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B (CPT1B). Recently, Kawaguchi et al. (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) reported that differences in muscle FABP expression may affect insulin sensitivity, while Kim et al. (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) reported that deletion of one allele of CPT1B in mice caused impairment of muscle insulin signaling that led to severe insulin resistance upon high fat feeding.</p><p id="P8">Exercise is a widely prescribed physiological intervention for treating and preventing insulin resistance (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Some of the improvement in glucose homeostasis that is seen following exercise training is attributed to mitochondrial adaptations in skeletal muscle, including enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, bioenergetics, dynamics and oxidative capacity (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, whether dietary carbohydrate quality has an impact on exercise training induced expression of PGC-1&#x003b1; in relation to insulin sensitivity is not known. Carbohydrate quality may be important since high glycemic diets promote hyperinsulinemia and down-regulate genes related to fat metabolism (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), while low glycemic diets have been shown to increase fat oxidation, thus improving glycemic control (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) . Previous experiments in lean healthy individuals suggest that when low glycemic meals are consumed prior to exercise there is a shift in substrate utilization that favors fat as the main fuel during exercise (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Thus, it appears that exercise, independent of diet composition, may induce changes within skeletal muscle that restore metabolic flexibility thereby correcting muscle metabolism. However, to date this hypothesis has not been tested.</p><p id="P9">The objective of this study was to determine whether an intervention program that included low or high glycemic diet plus exercise would induce differential change in expression of genes and proteins related to mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism, and whether these adaptations would be associated with improved insulin sensitivity and/or fat metabolism. We hypothesized that participants provided a low glycemic diet would have greater improvements in the expression of fatty acid transport (FAT/CD36 and FABP3) and oxidative enzymes (CPT1B and &#x003b2;-HAD), as well as the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1&#x003b1;) and whole body glucose and lipid homeostasis (PPAR&#x003b3;), and this improvement would correlate with increased whole body fat oxidation and insulin sensitivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Experiment Design and Method</title><sec id="S7" sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p id="P10">Nineteen older (64&#x000b1;1 year), previously sedentary humans who were obese (BMI: 34&#x000b1;1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) were recruited to participate in a 12-week diet and exercise intervention.

Our data show that a lifestyle intervention that included supervised exercise and either a fully provisioned high- or low-GI diet increased PGC-1&#x003b1; expression, downstream fat transport and oxidation, as well as peripheral insulin sensitivity. The improvement in skeletal muscle fat transport/oxidation gene expression was positively correlated with increased insulin sensitivity and fat oxidation, and importantly, weight loss. The amount of weight loss was consistent with energy expenditure during the supervised exercise program. These data highlight the effect of lifestyle intervention featuring both exercise and controlled dietary intake on cellular and molecular changes in skeletal muscle that lead to important mitochondrial adaptations that are known to regulate insulin sensitivity. These outcomes are more influenced by exercise and weight loss than the GI of the diet.</p><p id="P30">Although several investigators report positive effects of a low glycemic diet on substrate oxidation and insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), these observations have not been universal (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Some of the inconsistencies may be explained by differences in experimental design, subject population, weight loss, and control of confounding variables. In the current study, improvements in metabolic parameters were followed by changes at the molecular level in skeletal muscle, and all of these responses were independent of dietary glycemic content. However, there was significant weight loss in both groups. The magnitude of weight loss was remarkably consistent with energy expenditure from exercise. The duration and intensity of the exercise program was designed such that the expected energy expenditure was 500 kcal per exercise session. Thus, subjects were expected to expend approximately 30,000 kcals during the 12-week program. From an energy balance perspective, the 8&#x02013;10 kg weight loss would require a 24&#x02013;30,000 kcal deficit, and tracks closely with the prescribed energy expenditure from the exercise program. It should be noted that energy intake in this study was fixed and was based on measured resting metabolic rate adjusted for a sedentary activity level. Thus, these data support the view that exercise causes significant weight loss in humans when they do not engage in compensatory eating practices. The data also support the view that when humans lose significant amounts of weight, metabolic outcomes are improved regardless of the GI of the meals that are being consumed. These observations have important implications for dietary counseling and clinical management of obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p><p id="P31">The underlying mechanisms that contribute to the improvement in insulin sensitivity, substrate utilization, and fat oxidation in our study are partly evident from skeletal muscle adaptations at the molecular level, and in the main pathways that control mitochondrial biogenesis and function. We focused specifically on the coordinated actions of PGC-1&#x003b1;, which is known to control gene programs that optimize cellular bioenergetics, and genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative metabolism, and substrate metabolism (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). It is known that one way to enhance skeletal muscle capacity to handle fatty acids is by increasing proteins and enzymes involved in fatty acid transport (FAT/CD36 and FABP3) and oxidation (CPT1B) (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Using genetically engineered mice, Summermatter et al. (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) have shown that overexpression of muscle PGC-1&#x003b1; specifically induced expression of FAT/CD36, FABP3, and CPT1B. Exercise also robustly activates PGC-1&#x003b1; expression in skeletal muscle, and this is associated with improvement in metabolic parameters and weight loss (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Exercise also increases total muscle FABP3 and FAT/CD36 in mitochondria and sarcolemma as well as CPT1B and these adaptations lead to increased mitochondrial content (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). We observed a significant increase in nuclear factors: PPAR&#x003b3; and PGC-1&#x003b1;, fat transport genes: FAT/CD36 and FABP3, and lipid oxidation gene: CPT1B and long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase after both interventions. Notably, these responses appear to be more influenced by exercise and weight loss than the GI of the diet. The correlation between increased PGC-1&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b3;, FABP3, and CPT1B in our study is consistent with previous reports showing that exercise training increases lipid utilization by improving transport and entry of fat into the mitochondria (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). We also observed that the increase in fat transport (i.e. FABP3 and CPT1B) was correlated with increased whole body basal fat oxidation. Combined these observations point to the likelihood that increased insulin sensitivity after these interventions is a result of better coupling between &#x003b2;-oxidation and the Krebs cycle, leading to more complete lipid oxidation (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), and/or reduced lipid intermediates in skeletal muscle (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In either case, our findings suggest a strong link between oxidative gene expression and insulin sensitivity after exercise induced weight loss.</p><p id="P32">One of the major strengths of this study was implementation of a controlled diet and supervised exercise training intervention with monitored energy intake for 12-weeks in individuals who were obese, insulin resistant. Compliance with the program was excellent. In addition, insulin sensitivity was assessed using the gold-standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. However, this study has some limitations that may impact interpretation. First, we cannot exclude the possibility that at least some of the lifestyle-induced improvement in insulin sensitivity is not due to a PGC-1&#x003b1; related mechanism (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). However, the consistent association between PGC-1&#x003b1;, fat transporters and lipid utilization strongly suggests that enhanced mitochondrial function contributes in some manner to the increase in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake after the interventions. Second, we did not directly measure fat oxidation in skeletal muscle. While our whole-body calorimetry measures include skeletal muscle fat oxidation this is only a fraction of the total oxidation and increased oxidation in other tissues such as adipose tissue cannot be discounted. Third, we did not measure parameters related to mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle, therefore we cannot establish a causal link between the observed molecular changes and increased insulin sensitivity. Fourth, due to a limited amount of available tissue, we could only measure gene and total protein expression, and could not determine protein concentrations at the sarcolemma and mitochondrial level as described by others (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Lastly, we cannot conclude whether the increases in gene expression are the net result of increased mRNA synthesis or mRNA stability. In either case, the directionality of the changes in gene expression coupled with increased insulin sensitivity and fat metabolism suggests that these participants who were obese had effectively lowered their diabetes risk.</p><p id="P33">In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a combination of exercise training and controlled diet reduced body weight and induced molecular changes in the PGC-1&#x003b1; pathway that upregulates fat transport and oxidation in skeletal muscle of individuals who were older, obese and insulin-resistant. The metabolic effects were not influenced by the GI of the diet. These observations highlight the importance of weight loss for improved insulin sensitivity regardless of the GI of the meals provided during the intervention.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><p id="P34">We thank the CRU staff, the participants for their dedication and contributions to the study, and the exceptional organizational assistance of Julianne Filion, R.N., B.S.N.</p><p id="P35">Funding Agencies: This research was supported by NIH Grants RO1 AG-12834 (JPK) and NIH National Center for Research Resources, 1UL1RR024989, Cleveland OH.
