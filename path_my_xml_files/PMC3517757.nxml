Seventy subjects post primary total hip arthroplasty will be randomized into either an experimental group (n=35), or to a control group (n=35). The experimental group will attend a functional exercise class twice weekly for a six week period from week 12 to week 18 post surgery. The functional exercise group will follow a circuit based functional exercise class supervised by a chartered Physiotherapist. The control group will receive usual care. The principal investigator (BM) will perform blinded outcome assessments on all patients using validated measures for pain, stiffness, and function using the Western Ontario and Mc Master Universities Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC). This is the primary outcome measurement tool. Secondary outcome measurements include Quality of life (SF-36), 6 min walk test, Visual Analogue Scale, and the Berg Balance score. The WOMAC score will be collated on day five post surgery and repeated at week twelve and week eighteen. All other measurements will be taken at week 12 and repeated at week eighteen. In addition a blinded radiologist will measure gluteus medius cross sectional area using real time ultrasound for all subjects at week 12 and at week 18 to determine if the functional exercise programme has any effect on muscle size.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This randomised controlled trial will add to the body of evidence on the relationship between muscle size, functional ability, balance, quality of life and time post surgery in patients following total hip arthroplasty.

Approximately 24,253 THR surgical procedures were performed in Canada in 2008/09 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] with almost one million hip and knee replacements undertaken in the U.S in the same time-frame. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] In England and Wales 53,462 hip replacements were undertaken in 2009 including both primary and revision joint procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These figures have been projected to grow with the aging population and with the increased prevalence of arthritis in the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Improvements in prosthetic design and higher community expectations for quality of life have made THR more appropriate for both older and younger age groups resulting in an increased population and healthcare demand for surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In recent years the shift towards reductions in the length of stay for patients following THR has caused a subsequent shift in rehabilitation services from &#x02019;in hospital&#x02019; to out patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Within the outpatient setting however a number of authors have reported functional limitations for patients post surgery. Pain, physical impairment, reduced range of motion and reduced muscle strength persisting for one year have been documented in subjects who had also received early stage physiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It is currently unclear from the literature which therapeutic exercises performed over what period of time are either effective or necessary to improve muscle strength or ensure optimal return of patient function. Anecdotally therapeutic exercise programmes appear to be largely based on clinical experience and surgeon preference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Some evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] has demonstrated that an eight week exercise programme with an emphasis on strengthening and stability resulted in a statistically significant improvement in all measurements of self perceived function and muscle strength in patients between four and twelve months post THR. It has been suggested in this study that patients should continue their functional strengthening exercise programme for at least one year and that this programme should be further progressed as their function improved.</p><p>Another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] compared differences in the isometric hip strength of patients five months after THR with older adults without hip surgery and demonstrated lower peak torque in the hip flexors of the hip surgery group. Specific rehabilitation programmes are needed to address these strength deficits at this phase post surgery although few studies to date have evaluated this subject.</p><p>The gluteus medius muscle is critical to the provision of abduction force across the hip and the strength of the muscle is specifically relevant to the provision of stability in the hip joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Post operative function is determined by regaining the optimal strength in this muscle and many rehabilitation programmes include strengthening of gluteus medius. The strength of this muscle provides lateral stability to the trunk and pelvis and is essential during one legged stance and also during the stance phase of gait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However there is a paucity of evidence in the literature examining specific changes in this muscle despite anecdotal evidence that reduced strength in this muscle is responsible for gait impairment and reduced balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Recognizing the difficulties in measuring rehabilitation of glutei dysfunction it has been suggested that future studies on the glutei muscles should evaluate each muscle in functional activities preferably using multiple parameters for example evaluation of muscle size together with functional assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Recently real time ultrasound imaging has been utilized as an accurate and reliable means of measuring muscle parameters in a non invasive manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Ultrasound imaging is a fast and inexpensive tool that produces excellent images of the musculoskeletal system without the need for radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The primary aim of this research project is to evaluate the efficacy of a specific functional exercise programme to improve pain stiffness and physical function in patients between 12 and 18 weeks post THR when compared with a group following usual care. In addition this project aims to measure the effect of a functional exercise programme on the secondary outcomes of quality of life, balance, function and muscle size. Muscle size measured by real-time ultrasound was selected as an additional secondary outcome in order to examine specific changes in the gluteus medius muscle.</p><p>In preparing this protocol a full systematic review and meta-analysis of previous work has been completed. This review found there was low grade evidence that late stage rehabilitation demonstrated significant improvement in gait speed indicating improved walking ability in patients post total hip arthroplasty and there was limited low grade evidence for improved hip abduction strength in patients following a programme which included low resistance strength training. However the full extent of the impact of late stage rehabilitation in patients post total hip arthroplasty has not yet been established. These issues were considered in designing this randomized controlled trial.</p><p>Other preparatory work to prepare this protocol included preliminary clinical patient evaluation in a single elective orthopedic centre. A telephone questionnaire of 120 patients in 2009 at 12 weeks post surgery demonstrated approx 30 % of patients contacted reported persistent limping and gait abnormalities at 12 weeks. These patients were not previously referred to Physiotherapy. A second telephone survey evaluated ten centers nationally which carry out elective hip arthroplasty and demonstrated a wide diversity of rehabilitation offered across the country and a paucity of evidence based practice guidelines for this client group.</p><p>The primary aim of this research project is to evaluate the efficacy of a specific functional exercise programme to improve pain, stiffness and physical function in patients between 12 and 18 weeks post total hip replacement when compared with a group following usual care. In addition this project aims to measure the effect of a functional exercise programme on the secondary outcomes of quality of life, balance, function and muscle size. Muscle size measured by Real time ultrasound was selected as an additional secondary outcome measuring specific changes in the gluteus medius muscle. There is a paucity of evidence in the literature examining specific changes in this specific muscle despite anecdotal evidence that reduced strength in this muscle is responsible for gait impairment and reduced balance.</p><sec><title>Primary hypotheses</title><p>A six week functional exercise programme from week 12 to week 18 in patients post total hip replacement will be more efficacious in improving pain, stiffness and function than the usual care programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary hypotheses</title><p>A six week functional exercise programme from week 12 to week 18 in patients post total hip replacement will be more efficacious in improving balance, gait speed, quality of life and muscle size than the usual care programme.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>This will be an assessor blinded two arm randomized controlled trial of a six week involving twelve functional exercise class interventions.

Following a standard interview process patients will be given a written description of the study and information with regard to the exercise class commitment involved. A screening record will be kept to document criteria eliminating those deemed to be ineligible. All patients will all be assessed using the WOMAC questionnaire on day 5 prior to discharge and they will be randomized to one of two treatment groups. The functional exercise intervention begins at week 12 and all patients will complete the Primary and Secondary outcome assessments at this point. All assessments are repeated for both groups at week 18. Patients allocated to the functional exercise class will attend a six week functional exercise programme twice weekly from week 12 to week 18. The control group will receive the standard usual post surgery care as outlined in the patients&#x02019; information booklet given to all patients on admission. This care is given to all patients post surgery by the Physiotherapist working on the ward. This study is one comparing usual treatment with an intervention of functional exercise. All patients randomised to the usual care group will be offered the chance to attend the exercise group at week 18 post evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>This study obtained ethical approval from the HSE Research Ethics Committee Dublin North East Area in December 2011 for the clinical sites at Our Lady&#x02019;s Hospital, Navan, Cavan General Hospital and Monaghan General Hospital.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>Both outcome assessors will be blind to group allocation and will not be involved in the interventions nor will they attend any of the functional exercise classes. The physiotherapists supervising the functional exercise classes are not blinded.

They will also be given stamped addressed envelopes to post back written consent. Following obtainment of written consent random allocation using sequentially numbered envelopes to both groups will be carried out by a third party Lara Bourton Cassidy (LBC) who is not involved in the study. The number sequence will be generated using a computer generated random number table generated by Dr Tim Grant and communicated directly to LBC. Subjects will be randomly allocated either to a functional exercise class from week 12 post op to week 18 or to a control group receiving usual post operative care. Allocation of patients to the treating therapists will be established by e mail contact from LBC to the Physiotherapist&#x02019;s responsible for conducting the classes. These therapists have been identified previously. Patients will be asked not to discuss their group allocation and all blinded outcome assessment examinations will take place in Our Lady&#x02019;s Hospital, Navan.</p></sec><sec><title>Physiotherapists</title><p>Three experienced physiotherapists one at each site will be trained to supervise the functional exercise classes. Training will comprise a one hour practical workshop and all physiotherapists will be provided with a written illustrated manual of the training workshop.</p></sec><sec><title>Exercise interventions</title><p>This functional exercise class is designed to strengthen the hip muscles and incorporates exercises commonly used in clinical practice. It is based on previous work that shows that such an exercise programme improves pain and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Twelve exercises aimed to strengthen the quadriceps, hamstrings, and hip abductor muscles and improve functional balance will be taught to participants by the Physiotherapist. See Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. At the end of the exercise session the physiotherapist will monitor proper form and exercise intensity and will progress the exercises as necessary. Each Physiotherapy session will be 30 minutes in length. Intensity will be determined by the participant&#x02019;s ability to complete 10 repetitions for a given exercise.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Functional Hip Exercise circuit</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Exercise</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Description and progression</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sit to stand<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sit to stand exercise from chair.

Specifically the patient group now requiring joint replacement in Ireland as in the rest of the developed world comes from that demographic bulge in the population previously dubbed the &#x02018;baby boomer&#x02019; generation. Need for joint replacement surgery together with their increased expectation of quality of life and the economic reality of shorter inpatient length of stay will shape reformation of rehabilitation needs post total hip replacement for this group in the future.</p><p>This research project aims to assess the effect of a functional exercise programme in the THR patient group incorporating specific assessment of balance, quality of life and gluteus medius size using real time ultrasound as the secondary outcome measurements. This is very relevant to the specific patient population post total hip replacement. It is critical to the improvement of health and social gain in terms of improving post surgical functional ability and the subsequent ability of people following THR to contribute to society in a meaningful way.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare they have no competing issues.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the development and writing of the protocol.
