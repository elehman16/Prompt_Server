The aim of this study was to evaluate whether this reduced dose of rTM achieves effective drug concentrations that are comparable to those of the standard dose in treating sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) during continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF).</p></sec><sec id="ST2"><title>Methods</title><p>Eight patients in an intensive care unit were randomized to receive either reduced-dose (0.02&#x02009;mg/kg, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) or standard-dose (0.06&#x02009;mg/kg, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) rTM. We evaluated the effect of standard dose in comparison to that of reduced dose on the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of rTM for the sepsis-induced DIC patients receiving CHDF. Patients received rTM during a 30-min infusion for six consecutive days. PK parameters of rTM were analyzed using the one-compartment model.</p></sec><sec id="ST3"><title>Results</title><p>The elimination half-life, clearance (T1/2), and distribution volume of sTM were similar between the reduced and standard doses. The maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC) of sTM were approximately 2.5 times higher with standard-dose daily infusions than that with reduced-dose drip infusions (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.041 and 0.062, respectively). The time when the blood concentration of sTM was &#x0003e;500&#x02009;ng/mL, i.e., the holding time, was significantly longer with standard-dose infusions than those with reduced dose (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.039).</p></sec><sec id="ST4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>rTM displayed dose-dependent PK behavior at clinically relevant doses. During CHDF, effective blood concentration of rTM was not achieved with the reduced dose, and rTM was found to not bioaccumulate. Therefore, this pilot study suggests that reducing the rTM dose is unnecessary, even in sepsis-induced DIC patients who require CHDF. However, we need to perform a definitive study to determine the dosage of rTM for the case.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>coagulopathy</kwd><kwd>acute kidney injury</kwd><kwd>renal dysfunction</kwd><kwd>renal replacement therapy</kwd><kwd>sepsis</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="23"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="5166"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Severe sepsis continues to be life threatening and the most common cause of death in intensive care units (ICUs) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Mortality from sepsis remains high; therefore, new therapies are urgently needed. In the pathophysiology of severe sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has been recently recognized to play a key role and to be a therapeutic target. However, antithrombin-III (ATIII) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor had no effect on mortality in clinical trials (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Moreover, one of the anticoagulation factors, activated protein C (APC), was promoted as an antiseptic agent (i.e., Xigris&#x02122;) but was later withdrawn owing to the negative results in the PROWESS SHOCK trial (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Currently, there is no natural anticoagulant for the treatment of sepsis-induced DIC. However, recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rTM, or ART-123) was reported to be a promising &#x0201c;sepsis drug&#x0201d; and was found to regulate inflammation and coagulopathy (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). rTM promotes protein C activation by thrombin, resulting in the formation of APC. Thereafter, APC inhibits thrombin generation by inactivating coagulation factors Va and VIIIa to interrupt activation of blood coagulation (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). APC also has anti-inflammatory properties, interfering especially with the activation of complement and the inactivation of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a late phase death mediator in severe sepsis (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Recombinant human sTM has been marketed as a novel anticoagulant for DIC in Japan since 2008. Continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) is widely accepted as an effective modality for patients with severe sepsis as a countermeasure against hypercytokinemia and renal dysfunction (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Indeed, in a study of 29,269 critically ill patients, 47.5% of patients with acute renal failure had simultaneous septic shock (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Despite widespread use of rTM for management of coagulopathy in patients with severe sepsis in Japan, little is known about its pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and dosing in the subset of critically ill patients experiencing coagulopathy during CHDF.</p><p>Nakashima et al. reported that mean urinary recovery of rTM within the first 48&#x02009;h was between 54.3 and 59.8% of dose, which means rTM is excreted by the kidneys (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Therefore, the recommended dose for patients with renal impairment is one-third the standard dose. A number of reports suggest that the reduced dose for patients with renal impairment is too conservative, resulting in underdosing. As underdosing is a serious problem, we investigated the PKs of standard- and reduced rTM with sepsis during continuous hemofiltration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>After approved by the institutional ethics committee, written informed consent was obtained from patients or their next of kin.

The operation of the CHDF system was monitored with a personal bedside console (JUN-500/505; Junken Medical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). CHDF was performed using a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) membrane hemofilter with a membrane surface area of 1.0&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup> (Hemofeel CH-1.0N; Toray Medical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Nafamostat mesilate (Futhan; Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), a synthetic protease inhibitor with anticoagulant properties, was used as an anticoagulant, with the dose adjusted to maintain an activated coagulation time of 150&#x02013;170&#x02009;s.

This result suggests that the efficacy of reduced-dose rTM was insufficient to regulate the coagulation system in this setting. The elevation of baseline sTM levels was also assessed after daily administration of rTM. The T1/2, CL, and Vd of rTM were similar between the reduced and standard doses, although the maximum concentration (Cmax) and the AUC of rTM were approximately 2.5 times higher with the standard dose. Therefore, rTM was found to not bioaccumulate in this setting.</p><p>Hayakawa et al. demonstrated that the CL of rTM in patients with severe renal impairment was similar to that in those without renal impairment (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, they analyzed the PK based on concentrations of rTM after a single infusion of the drug. We evaluated the PK of rTM using multiple sampling times (i.e., PD, day 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6) with a daily infusion regimen, which is generally recommended in the clinical setting. In contrast, Mouksassi et al. reported that a 0.06&#x02009;mg/kg dose of rTM should result in drug exposure within the therapeutic range, with minimal risks of bleeding in patients with normal and impaired renal functions (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, the PK during CHDF was unclear prior to the present study.</p><p>Tsuruta et al. reported a formula for CL of rTM as follows: 0.00162&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;WT&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;CLcr<sup>0.175</sup> &#x000d7;&#x02009;(&#x02212;0.0117&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Hct&#x02009;+&#x02009;1)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;(&#x02212;0.00374&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Age&#x02009;+&#x02009;1) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). We compared the predicted CL using that formula with the actual CL in our patients. There was an apparent discrepancy between the actual and predicted CLs of rTM (data not shown). Creatinine clearance (CLcr) was regarded as a significant covariate for CL, which is supported by the fact that this drug is predominantly excreted by the kidney. However, CLcr did not significantly correlate with CL in our data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A), and the CL of rTM was not affected by CHDF in the results of the present study.</p><p>In order to elucidate the mechanism of CL in renal impairment, we compared CL with the other clinical parameters by means of Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A, ATIII activity most significantly correlated with CL among the 20 cofactors evaluated. Both CL and ATIII activities could be associated with the hyperpermeability of patients with severe inflammation because of the similarity in their molecular weights (i.e., 62 and 63&#x02009;kDa, respectively). Leakage of both molecules to the extravascular space could cause unexplainable CL of rTM in sepsis-induced DIC patients with kidney injury. In this regard, it was reported that APC could preserve the expression of junction proteins, such as VE-cadherin for adherens junctions and occludin for tight junctions. rTM is known to promote protein C activation by thrombin, resulting in the formation of APC (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Therefore, sufficient dosing of rTM may regulate the hyperpermeability caused by severe sepsis.</p><p>A large phase 3 study in subjects with severe sepsis and coagulopathy is currently in progress to evaluate survival benefits of rTM (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">http://ClinicalTrials.gov</uri> ID: NCT01598831, accessed 11 November 2016) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The present study should provide great impact on the future regimen of rTM. Results from a recent report suggest that dose adjustments, which are widely accepted clinically, are not necessary in patients with sepsis and DIC, regardless of renal impairment (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The present study provides novel information that dose adjustment in patients with sepsis-induced DIC during CHDF is unnecessary, despite CHDF not being able to clear rTM.</p><p>The present study has some limitations. First, the patient numbers included in this study were smaller than initially planned. After starting the present study, we decided to participate in another large-scale study, where similar patients with DIC were to be included (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01704001?term=ART-123&#x00026;rank=1">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01704001?term=ART-123&#x00026;rank=1</uri>; accessed on January 14, 2017). In addition, we found that the rTM holding time was significantly shorter in the reduced-dose group in preliminary analyses. Therefore, we decided to discontinue reduced-dose treatments in consideration of patient benefits and improved rTM dosage for future studies. While the number of patients included in the present study is small, these PK data are valuable because they were collected on multiple days (i.e., PD, day 0, 1, 5, and 6) from patients under such life-threatening conditions. Forty-eight sTM concentrations were included for evaluation. Furthermore, Cmax and holding time were found to be significantly different between the reduced-dose and standard-dose groups, even with the small number of patients. Second, neither clinical outcome nor complications were evaluated because of the heterogeneous patient characteristics, which are typical in ICU patient cohorts. Again, our focus was simply to study the PK of rTM during CHDF for sepsis-induced DIC. Third, the only hemofilter that we used in this study was composed of PMMA. In general, PMMA membranes have stronger adsorbing properties than other types of membrane (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Intriguingly, despite these strong adsorbing properties of PMMA, the concentration of rTM was higher in the hemofilter outlet than in the inlet because adsorption was minimal (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This means that the hemofilter could not remove rTM during CHDF through adsorption.</p><p>Currently, anticoagulation therapy for sepsis-induced coagulopathy is recognized as a useful therapeutic strategy that is highly relevant in a small percentage of septic patients (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), although this is not discussed by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). As a practical matter, the proper use of rTM, including target illness severity and dosage, as evaluated in the present study for sepsis-induced DIC patients during CHDF, is still obscure. This is true even in Japan, where rTM has already gained greater acceptance in the marketplace. Due to the anticoagulant properties of rTM, the most important concern in treating DIC patients, who are susceptible to bleeding, is a serious hemorrhage due to abrupt increases in plasma concentration of this drug. Exacerbating this concern, it is usually necessary for patients who receive CHDF to be infused with additional anticoagulant (e.g., nafamostat mesilate). The highest concentration of rTM with no bleeding event in the non-clinical toxicology studies was 5400&#x02009;ng/mL, which was originally carried out in monkeys (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Also, Shirae et al. recently reported that the highest individual simulated Cmax of the patients who received regular dose of rTM was 4730&#x02009;ng/mL even though they included patients with severe renal impairment on hemodialysis in their study population (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). As for the therapeutic range, it is regarded the trough level of rTM as of &#x0003e;500&#x02009;ng/mL on the strength of the result of phase 2 study, although there is no published report evaluating the dose effectiveness in a clinical study (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Therefore, the baseline level of rTM is regarded as &#x0003e;500&#x02009;ng/mL in clinical settings, although there is no report evaluating the dose effectiveness in a clinical study. Therefore, a larger cohort study that includes sepsis-induced DIC patients of varying severity is warranted to validate the necessity of dose titration (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin displayed dose-dependent PK behavior with the range of doses used in clinical settings. Effective blood concentration of rTM was not achieved with reduced-dose administration during CHDF; rTM was found to not bioaccumulate in this setting. Therefore, it might not be necessary to reduce the dose of rTM, even if sepsis-induced DIC patients are on CHDF. A prospective comparison of the clinical efficacy of the two-dose regimens using a larger patient cohort is warranted.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceived and designed the experiments: EW and SO.
