INTRODUCTION</title><p>The minimal invasive therapies for ureteral stone are now the accepted gold standards. Many advances in endourological techniques and instrumentation have largely diverted the management of ureteral stones by open surgeries to either minimal invasive methods, like ESWL (Extracorporeal wave lithotripsy) ureterorenoscopic removal of stones, or to watchful waiting. Nevertheless, these techniques are not risk-free, are quite expensive and are not widely available in the developing countries. Minimally invasive interventional (e.g., ESWL and ureteroscopy) as well as expectant (watchful waiting) treatment exist for the management of lower ureteric calculi. But the choice of the ideal method to be taken up largely depend on the type of equipment available, type and size of stone, needs of the patient and the skills of the surgeon (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have reported excellent results relating to medical expulsive therapy (MET) for distal ureteral calculi, in terms of stone expulsion and control of ureteral colic pain, using drugs (e.g., nifedipine and prednisolone) that can modulate the function of the ureter obstructed by the stone. Recently, an a1A receptor blocker to be used in this regard is tamsulosin.</p><p>Most of the work on the efficiency of tamsulosin in lower ureteral calculi expulsion has been done in affluent western countries with variable results. The disease spectrum in a developing country like ours, is different from that in developed countries, mainly because of delay in diagnosis, delay in investigations and lack of awareness which tend to modify the outcome in case of ureteral stones or of any disease for that matter. More so, advanced interventional facilities in this part of the world are not easily available. A prospective study was thus planned to compare the tamsulosin group with a control group in our setup to evaluate the efficiency of tamsulosin for lower ureteral calculi expulsion within a few days without the need for hospitalization, common endoscopic treatment or shock wave lithotripsy (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2. MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted in the Department of Urology, University Clinical Centre of Kosova. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Prishtina, and the research was conducted in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants before inclusion in the study.</p><p>From the 104 patients, the youngest was 18 years of age, while the oldest was 65 years of age. This study included patients with a diagnosis of a symptomatic, unilateral, solitary lower ureteral stones (stone present at the level of ischial spine or below), proved either on a skiagram or sonography of the KUB (Kidney-Ureter-Bladder) with size &#x02265;4 mm and &#x02264;10 mm (in major axis). Prior to study, complete hemogram, blood urea, serum creatinine, complete urine examination, urine culture sensitivity, was done for participating patients.</p><p>Stone presence and its characteristics were diagnosed by kidney-ureter-bladder X-ray (KUB), abdominal ultrasonography and intravenous urography (IVU), or computed tomography when necessary. All patients with active urinary tract infection, fever, acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, history of urinary surgery or endoscopic treatment, uncorrected distal obstruction and marked hydronephrosis, diabetes, history of hypersensitivity to &#x003b1;-blockers and pregnant women, were excluded.</p><p>Total 104 symptomatic cases of lower ureteric stones were divided randomly into a study group I (Tamsulosin) and control group II.</p><p>Study group I (Tamsulosin): The 52 patients in this group were given Tabl. Tamsulosin 0.4 mg in the morning, half hour after breakfast for a maximum period of 28 days or until spontaneous passage of stone, (which ever was earlier). High fluid intake and analgesic (Caps. diclofenac 75 mg), were given on demand during the study period.</p><p>Group II (Control): The 52 patients included in this group were advised of high fluid intake along with analgesic (Caps diclofenac 75 mg), on demand during the study period.</p><p>The patients were followed up with a weekly sonography KUB and fortnightly X-ray KUB and final evaluation was done after completion of four weeks. Successful results were defined by complete stone passage. The failure was considered if the patient failed to pass the stone at the end of four weeks.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>2.1. Statistical analysis.</title><p>Processing of date is done with the statistical package InStat 3. The obtained data has been presented through tables. The index of the structures has been calculated from the statistical parameters, arithmetical average and standard deviation. Testing of the quantitative data has been performed with X<sup>2</sup>-test, or the Fisher test. Testing of the quantitative data is done with the T-test. Verification of tests is done with degree of reliability 99.7% (P&#x0003c;0.01) and with reliability of 95% (P&#x0003c;0.005).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>3. RESULTS</title><p>Our study comprised 104 patients, with the youngest patient being 18 years of age and the oldest 65 years of age.

We have reached similar structure with the distribution of cases according to groups and age-group. We have reached similar structure with the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test, too, which means that we have not reached difference in statistical significance (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>=0.334, P=0.987), (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Age and sex distribution</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MA-71-137-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Average age of the patients included in the research was 35.5 years (SD &#x000b1; 10.9 years old).

DISCUSSION</title><p>Many minimally invasive interventional (e.g., ESWL and ureteroscopy), as well as expectant (watchful waiting) treatment, exist for the management of lower ureteric calculi. But the choice of the ideal method to be taken largely depends on the type of equipment available, type and size of stone, needs of the patient and the skills of the surgeon (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The stone burden remains the primary factor in deciding the appropriate treatment for a patient with ureteral calculi (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). &#x003b1;<sub>1D</sub> receptors are found in abundance in the detrusor and the intramural part of the ureter. &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>1D</sub> adrenergic receptors are present more densely in the distal 1/3 of ureter (including intramural part) than other adrenergic receptors. When stimulated, they inhibit the basal tone, peristaltic wave frequency and the ureteral contractions even in the intramural part of lower ureter. &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> antagonists have a crucial impact in spontaneous painless elimination of the stones smaller than 8 mm located in the uretero-bladder junction (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>According to Smaller, more distal and right sided stones are more likely to pass spontaneously (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, the expectant approach may result in complications, such as infection of the urinary tract, hydronephrosis and renal function defects (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Spontaneous passage depends upon stone size, shape, location and associated ureteral edema (which is likely to depend on the length of time that a stone has not progressed). Ureteral calculi 4&#x02013;5 mm in size have a 40&#x02013;50% chance of spontaneous passage. In contrast, calculi &#x0003e;6 mm have less than 5% chance of spontaneous passage. Majority of stones that pass do so within a 6 weeks period after the onset of symptoms (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>In our study we have not reached significant difference between groups, according to their gender or age. In the present study, average size of the stones of the patients included in the research was 6.5 mm (SD &#x000b1; 1.6 mm). Avarage size of the stones of the patients of the first group was 6.5 mm (SD &#x000b1; 1.6 mm), whereas the avarage size of the stones of patients included in the second group was 6.6mm (SD &#x000b1; 1.5). With T-test we have not reached a difference with important statistical signigicance (T=0.23, P=0.996), (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). In 53.8% of the cases, stones were located on the right side and in 46.2%, in the left side. In both groups, the stones were more often localized on the right side (X&#x000b2;=0.03, P=0.844).</p><p>Cervenakov <italic>et al</italic>, concluded that the treatment by &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> blockers considerably decreased not only lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) but also helped to accelerate the passing of minor calculi from the terminal parts of the ureters of 80.4% of patients. They also suggested that &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> blockers potentiate the spasm analgesic action of drugs used in standard methods of treatment (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Dellabella <italic>et al</italic>, used tamsulosin as a spasmolytic drug during episodes of ureteral colic due to juxta vesical calculi, observed an increased stone expulsion rate and with a decrease in stone expulsion time, the need for hospitalization and endoscopic procedures, and provided particularly good control of colic pain, the expulsion rate was 90 % (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, a stone expulsion rate of 90.4 % (47 out of 52 patients) was observed for Group I and 71.2% (37 out of 52 patients) in group II. Group I showed a statistically significant advantage in terms of the stone expulsion rate (Fisher test, <italic>P</italic>=0.023). The average time of the expulsion of stones in the first group was 9.6 days (SD &#x000b1; 7.1 days), and in the control group 13.7 days (SD &#x000b1; 7.3 days). With T-test we have reached difference with important statistically significant, based on the timing of expulsion of stones according to groups (P=0.034).</p><p>In our study, the main amount of analgesic dosage (in mg) was 63.7 mg (SD &#x000b1; 45.2 mg), in group I, while the control group II is 109.2 (SD &#x000b1; 53.3). With T-test we have reached difference with important statistically significant among doses of analgesics used according to groups (P=0.019).</p><p>From 28 stones of the size 4-6 mm of the first group, 25 or 89.2% were expulsed while from the second group have been 23 or 82.1%. This difference has no important statistical significance (Fisher test, P=0.704). From the 24 stones of the size 7-10 mm of the first group, 20 or 83.3% were expulsed, whereas in the second group, from 24, 12 or 50% were expulsed. This means that we have reached difference with important statistically significant (Fisher test, P= 0.03).</p><p>They may work on the obstructed ureter by inducing an increase in the intraureteral pressure gradient around the stone, that is, an increase in the urine bolus above the stone (and consequently an increase in intraureteral pressure above the stone), as well as decreased peristalsis below the ureter (and consequently a decrease in intraureteral pressure below the stone) in association with the decrease in basal and micturition pressures even at the bladder neck, thereby an increased chance of stone expulsion. Furthermore, the decreased frequency of phasic peristaltic contractions in the obstructed ureteral tract induced by tamsulosin might determine a decrease in or the absence of the algogenic stimulus (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>5. CONCLUSION</title><p>Our study reveals that tamsulosin is efficient for the treatment of distal ureteral stones. The use of tamsulosin in our patients decreased the number of ureteral colic episodes and the intensity of pain during spontaneous passage at the lower ureteral calculi, increased and hastened stone expulsion rates, decreased days of stone expulsion and reduced analgesic dose usage. Tamsulosin should be considered for uncomplicated distal ureteral calculi before ureteroscopy or extracorporeal lithotripsy. Tamsulosin may have benefits of reducing the number of interventional procedures. Tamsulosin should therefore be offered as part of medical expulsive therapy, as one of the primary treatment modalities for distal ureteral stones.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>&#x02022; Conflict of interest:</bold> none declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lotan</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Gettman</surname><given-names>MT</given-names></name><name><surname>Roehrborn</surname><given-names>CG</given-names></name><name><surname>Cadeddu</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Pearle</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Management of ureteral calculi: A cost comparison and decision making analysis</article-title><source>J Urol</source><year>2002</year><volume>167</volume><fpage>162</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>NS</given-names></name><name><surname>Bulstrode</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name></person-group><source>The kidneys and ureters.
