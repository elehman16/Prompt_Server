Fabricated in clear heat cure acrylic resin (Triplex, Ivoclor, Vivadent) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. A preliminary cast was fabricated using indirect impression technique. In-order to obtain uniform spacer, 3 mm even spacer was adapted onto the primary cast and the impression made and spaced primary cast was obtained [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. Ten custom trays (five per group) with windows in the anterior region were made using light cure acrylic resin sheets Sheet (Plaque Photo, W + P Dental, Hamburg, Germany) of 2 mm in thickness [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. All the custom trays are uniformly spaced. To ensure dimensional stability of custom tray, the trays are left undisturbed for 24 h prior to impression making.

The open tray copings where splinted with dental floss (Oral B waxed dental floss, India). Autopolymerizing resin (GC pattern resin, Osaka, Japan) was mixed in the ratio of 2 g&#x02013;1 ml. When the resin reached the dough stage, it was packed around the impression posts and the dental floss thus they were splinted together. The splint was allowed to polymerize for 4 min. The splint was then sectioned in-between the impression posts using a thin separating disc to relieve the stresses caused due to polymerization shrinkage. The cut sections were joined using the same resin by applying it using brush bead method [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>]. This was again allowed to polymerize for 4 min.

The shrinkage of the material is lesser than autopolymerizing resin, so the splints were not sectioned in-between the impression posts. The bis-&#x02013;GMA (Pro-temp 4 3M ESPE, India) was just syringed using an automix gun (3M ESPE, India) into floss matrix formed between the impression post [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>]. It is allowed to set for about 7 min as per the manufacturer's instructions.

Polyether has been advocated as an impression material for multiple implant-supported prosthesis for edentulous patients.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Medium-body polyether was used as the impression material.</p><p>The overall accuracy of the impression depends on all the four parameters in the X, Y, Z axis, and angulation of implant/replicas axis to its horizontal plane.</p><p>Rotation of impression copings in the impression during fastening of the implant analog is one of the drawbacks of the direct impression technique. In an absolute distortion analysis, an external reference point is used, while in relative distortion analysis one implant/replica is used as reference for measuring distortion. Because the prosthesis connects all the implant together, the amount of strain on the implant is related to the relative positions of the implants to one another.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Therefore, relative distortion analysis was done in this study by measuring the inter implant distances and angulations in reference to replica no. 1.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>The errors in the resin splinting group could be attributed to the minimal shrinkage of the pattern resin used and the technique of splinting. Since the splint was sectioned in between the copings and then reunited, it could have minimized the polymerization shrinkage. Therefore, the amount of resin used for initial splinting could have not influenced the inaccuracy, whereas the dimension of the section made could have influenced the accuracy as it was joined again with resin before making impression. Further research on the dimensions of the splint and the dimensions of the section would shed light on the influence of resin shrinkage on the accuracy of impression. Also, the technique of resin splinting has differed among various studies done so far.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Since bis-GMA (Pro-temp 4) has not been tested for accuracy as a splinting material, data regarding the accuracy of this material for splinting purpose is lacking. Thus, the values obtained for these materials in this study have to be compared with the values obtained with the resin splinting group only (since enormous studies had been conducted for the resin splinted copings). The range of differences obtained in bis-GMA splinted group in all the axis was almost in the similar range when compared to the resin splinted group. In X and Y axis both the Groups A and B exhibits no differences with the reference model. However, in Z-axis and the implant angulation to the horizontal plane, both the Groups A and B exhibited significant differences with the reference model in the similar range of difference. These differences could be attributed to the rigidity of the splinting material that was used to prevent the movement of copings in the vertical dimension during connection of the implant replica to the impression coping.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] This <italic>in vitro</italic> study gives the amount of rotational distortion of impression copings in the Z-axis, which can occur when multiple implant impressions were made with polyether showed little discrepancies. From these data obtained, the inference of the study might probably application of polyether adhesive, rigidity of polyether impression material, rigidity of the splinting materials, tolerance between implant components and torque employed during fastening of the implant replica could determine, either individually or collectively the extent of distortion.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>Although splinting might rigidly hold the impression copings together, the time consumed for impression making is considerably greater when compared to the nonsplinting impression technique. This preliminary effort to study is the accuracy of master cast obtained using direct impression technique with different splinting materials has yielded positive results especially in relation to the use of bis-GMA (Pro-temp 4 &#x02013; syringable temporary crown material), so this material can be used as the splinting material in lesser time in a more comfortable syringable mode. Thus, further research on the use of this material for splinting purpose might be of use to enhance the accuracy of impression techniques. The results obtained in this study are <italic>in vitro</italic> and so future clinical studies are required to evaluate the effect of intra oral conditions on the materials used for splinting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The following conclusions were arrived within the limitations of this <italic>in vitro</italic> study, which evaluated the accuracy of master cast using direct implant impression techniques with conventional and newer splinting material for multiple implant impression.</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>On comparison of the accuracy of implant impressions made by direct technique using resin splinted impression copings and bis-GMA splinted impression copings yielded master casts which had their readings very close to the reference model and within the clinical limits</p></list-item><list-item><p>Both the splinting material showed the same amount of variation from the reference model and these splinting materials were statistically similar to each other and falls in same homogenous subsets in all the three dimensional X, Y, and Z axis</p></list-item><list-item><p>Thus, both the splinting material exhibit similar accuracy in impression, so bis-GMA (Pro-temp 4 3M ESPE) as a splinting material is easy for handling, less time consuming, less technique sensitive, readily available material in clinics, and more rigid material can be used. However, selection of impression technique can be based only on the clinical situation and the personal clinician's choice.</p></list-item></list>
