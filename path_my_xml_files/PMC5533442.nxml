These SAEs have remained unclear and a programmatic impediment to the advancement of community directed treatment with ivermectin. The pathogenesis of these SAEs following ivermectin has never been investigated experimentally. The <italic>Loa</italic>/baboon (<italic>Papio anubis</italic>) model can be used to investigate the pathogenesis of <italic>Loa</italic>-associated encephalopathy following ivermectin treatment in humans.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>12 baboons with microfilarial loads &#x0003e; 8,000mf/mL of blood were randomised into four groups: Group 1 (control group receiving no drug), Group 2 receiving ivermectin (IVM) alone, Group 3 receiving ivermectin plus aspirin (IVM + ASA), and Group 4 receiving ivermectin plus prednisone (IVM + PSE). Blood samples collected before treatment and at Day 5, 7 or 10 post treatment, were analysed for parasitological, hematological and biochemical parameters using standard techniques. Clinical monitoring of animals for side effects took place every 6 hours post treatment until autopsy. At autopsy free fluids and a large number of standard organs were collected, examined and tissues fixed in 10% buffered formalin and processed for standard haematoxylin-eosin staining and specific immunocytochemical staining.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Mf counts dropped significantly (p&#x0003c;0.05) in all animals following ivermectin treatment with reductions as high as (89.9%) recorded; while no significant drop was observed in the control animals. Apart from haemoglobin (Hb) levels which recorded a significant (p = 0.028) drop post treatment, all other haematological and biochemical parameters did not show any significant changes (p&#x0003e;0.05). All animals became withdrawn 48 hours after IVM administration. All treated animals recorded clinical manifestations including rashes, itching, diarrhoea, conjunctival haemorrhages, lymph node enlargement, pinkish ears, swollen face and restlessness; one animal died 5 hours after IVM administration. Macroscopic changes in post-mortem tissues observed comprised haemorrhages in the brain, lungs, heart, which seen in all groups given ivermectin but not in the untreated animals. Microscopically, the major cellular changes seen, which were present in all the ivermectin treated animals included microfilariae in varying degrees of degeneration in small vessels. These were frequently associated with fibrin deposition, endothelial changes including damage to the integrity of the blood vessel and the presence of extravascular erythrocytes (haemorrhages). There was an increased presence of eosinophils and other chronic inflammatory types in certain tissues and organs, often in large numbers and associated with microfilarial destruction. Highly vascularized organs like the brain, heart, lungs and kidneys were observed to have more microfilariae in tissue sections. The number of mf seen in the brain and kidneys of animals administered IVM alone tripled that of control animals. Co-administration of IVM + PSE caused a greater increase in mf in the brain and kidneys while the reverse was noticed with the co-administration of IVM + ASA.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The treatment of <italic>Loa</italic> hyper-microfilaraemic individuals with ivermectin produces a clinical spectrum that parallels that seen in <italic>Loa</italic> hyper-microfilaraemic humans treated with ivermectin.

These reactions, which can result in the death of many of those affects and cause permanent mental damage in others, inflicts considerable disruption to the important mass treatment programs to control and eliminate filariae where ivermectin is used. The recently described baboon model of hyper-microfilariaemia has been used here to study the pathological changes occurring after ivermectin treatment; the clinico-pathological presentation following treatment in baboons appears to be closely related to those seen in humans. The tissue changes seen suggest that the primary pathological event following ivermectin treatment is a vasculopathy associated with intra-vascular microfilarial destruction within smaller blood vessels that damages them and leads to changes in the tissues supplied by these vessels. The effects of cortisone and aspirin on these changes are also addressed in this study.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Mectizan Donation Program</institution></funding-source><award-id>No number available</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wanji</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by Merck &#x00026; Co via the Mectizan Donation Programme (MDP).

Loiasis has two very characteristic clinical features: Calabar swellings, corresponding to an angioedema of allergic nature [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and the passage of an adult worm under the conjunctiva (eyeworm). Other complications, though rare, include nephropathy [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], cardiomyopathy [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], retinopathy [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], arthritis [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], lymphangitis [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], peripheral neuropathy [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and encephalopathy [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Loiasis is an infection of public health importance, essentially not because of its own clinical manifestations, but because it is associated with serious adverse events (SAEs) following the administration of ivermectin. These SAEs have a negative impact on the ongoing control of onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis with ivermectin distribution in areas of co-endemicity with <italic>Loa</italic>. The occurrence of <italic>Loa-</italic>associated SAEs with programs for these two major filariae (onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis) in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>loa</italic> endemic areas has been increasingly reported over the past decade. Clinical problems seen include severely disabling and potentially fatal, encephalopathy as well as other permanent clinical changes. Current observations have indicated that the risk of developing marked or serious reactions is significantly higher when the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>loa</italic> loads exceeds 8,000mf/mL; the severity of these reactions becomes more common in patients with the risk of these happening and being severe much higher in patients with &#x0003e; 30,000 mf/mL, with the risk of problems being very high with loads above with &#x0003e; 50,000mf/mL [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Although the epidemiological mapping and clinical description of these Loa-associated SAEs is now well known, the pathogenesis and the optimal approaches to treatment still remain obscure. An increase in the presence of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>loa</italic> in the brain tissue has been proposed as an important feature of the condition, and a central role for vascular pathology in the adverse reaction also proposed [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Understanding the mechanism of pathogenesis of the post-ivermectin events in these heavily infected individuals is an important step towards the development of better treatments and responses to this unfortunate pathology. The lack of data from human cases and especially the lack of autopsy material have hindered the progress in the treatment and prevention of this condition. The previous lack of a relevant experimental model also contributed to the lack of solid information on these adverse reactions and delay in developing suitable clinical treatment protocols. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of this post-treatment condition is urgently needed.</p><p>After several consultation meetings held by the Scientific working Group on SAE in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>loa</italic> endemic countries, [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], it was strongly recommended that a non-human primate (NHP) animal model of <italic>Loa</italic> encephalopathy be developed. Non-human primates (NHP) are therefore considered the best models for the much needed investigation in human loiasis, especially as suitable <italic>in vitro</italic> models for loiasis have not yet been developed, and indeed such artificial models are not easily extrapolated to humans [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although the drill is an excellent experimental host, there are ethical concerns with using this protected animal for research, and it is no longer used in biomedicine. The use of <italic>Patas</italic> monkeys also is limited as the parasite behaves differently from the same way that it does in the more human-like drill [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>As recently described, the baboon (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>anubis</italic>) is a potentially useful model for studying the mechanisms behind the SAEs that develop in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>loa</italic> infected people as the parasite in this animal behaves essentially in the same way as it does in the drill. The use of baboons in biomedical research is accepted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and so Wanji <italic>et al</italic> developed a hyper-microfilaraemic <italic>Loa</italic>/baboon (<italic>Papio anubis</italic>) experimental model and characterized it parasitologically, haematologically and biochemically [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this model microfilariaemia increases steadily in all infected animals and reaches a peak at 18 months post infection (MPI); by 10 MPI &#x0003e;70% of animals have mf &#x0003e; 8,000 mf/mL, at 18 MPI &#x0003e;70% of animals have mf &#x0003e;30,000mf/mL and 50% of animals have mf &#x0003e;50,000mf/mL. In this study, the three most significant alterations seen were: increased eosinophil, creatinine and gamma-GT levels. An intriguing question that now emerges is whether these specific alterations bear any role in the development of the post ivermectin SAEs. It also remains to be demonstrated whether if these <italic>Loa</italic> hyper-microfilaraemic baboons are treated with ivermectin-IVM (i) There will be a drastic drop in microfilariae load? (ii) Treatment will lead to serious clinical manifestations? (iii) There will be changes in blood chemistry and haematological parameters? (iv) Microfilariae will be seen in the different tissues and their distribution? (v) Which lesions will be seen and what are their characteristics (vi) and if the co-administration of ivermectin with either aspirin or prednisone will affect points i-v above. Therefore, this present study was carried out to treat <italic>Loa</italic> hyper-microfilaraemic animals such as to validate the model as a surrogate for the human condition, and to provide answers to the questions above.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Animals</title><p>The acquisition, care and ethical concerns on the use of these animals have already been described in the preceding paper [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The animals for this study were gotten from the 15 baboons that had been characterised parasitologically, biochemically and haematologically in the preceding paper [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Eligibility criteria and randomization into trial groups</title><p>Baboons to be included in the trials were chosen amongst the experimentally infected 15 animals. The inclusion criterion for animals to enter the drug treatment phase was a microscopically confirmed microfilariaemia of &#x0003e;8,000mf/mL whilst the exclusion criterion was a microfilariaemia of &#x0003c;8,000mf/mL. Ultimately, 12 infected splenectomised baboons were included in this phase of the study. The 12 baboons were randomised into 4 arms, with each treated group consisting of three animals. Eligible baboons were randomly assigned to the different treatment arms using a computer generated randomisation list. The randomisation was performed by a statistician not otherwise engaged in the study.

Animals were assessed for general agility, meningeal signs, discharges, papillary reflex, diarrhea, weakness, conjunctival haemorrhage, dyspnea, itching (excoriations), muscle aches, restlessness, gland pain and gland tenderness, presence of rashes, pinkish ears, joint pain and swollen face. The agility and playing habits of the monkeys were assessed by the animal caretaker who was familiar with the normal behaviour of these baboons. Rashes were considered absent when none were found on the body of the animal, mild when &#x0003c; 3%, moderate when 3&#x02013;10%, severe when 11&#x02013;50% and unbearable when &#x0003e; 50%, of the body surface was affected.

Gland pain/tenderness was assessed by palpating collections of lymph nodes in the neck, axillae and inguinal regions, and were considered as absent if no enlarged nodes were found; mild when the enlarged nodes were localized i.e. 1&#x02013;2 enlarged nodes were found in one body area; moderate if 3&#x02013;5 enlarged nodes were found in one body area; severe when 3&#x02013;7 enlarged lymph nodes were generalized i.e. found in 2 or more body areas and unbearable when &#x0003e; 10 enlarged lymph nodes were generalized. Restlessness was assessed by counting the number of times the animals could not sit still; restlessness was considered absent when the animals sat still all the time, mild when it could not be still for less than 5 times, moderate when it could not be still for about 8&#x02013;15 times, severe when it could not be still for 15 times and unbearable when the animal could not remain sitting still. Vital signs like rectal temperature, pulse rate (PR) and respiratory rate (RR) were also recorded. Animals in Experiment 1 were monitored every 6 hours for 5 days for a period of 120 mins, those in Experiment 2 every 6 hours for 7 days for a period of 168 mins while those in Experiment 3 were monitored every 6 hours for 10 days for 240 mins before autopsy.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Pathology</title><p>The animals were euthanized by the administration of 10 mL of 5mg ketamine (Imalgene, Merial, France) and autopsies performed immediately.

After treatment with ivermectin, microfilaraemia decreased significantly in all treated animals with up to 98.4% reduction in one animal (Bab 05). This finding confirms the findings of earlier authors who had shown ivermectin to have a marked microfilaricidal effect on <italic>L</italic>. <italic>Loa</italic>. A study by Kamgno <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] demonstrated that one month after a single dose with ivermectin, microfilarial loads fall to &#x0003c;20% of their initial values and this suppression of microfilaraemia can persist for at least a year [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The reduction of microfilariae numbers in peripheral blood could probably be due to the fact that ivermectin treatment induces the <italic>Loa</italic> microfilariae to flee from the blood circulation into other body fluids such as the pleural and peritoneal fluids as a result of vascular breaking or due to the death of these mfs.</p><p>The drastic killing of circulatory mf could lead to the blockage of blood vessels in the different tissues and organs. When this happens, an inflammatory reaction sets in activating the fibrin pathway whereby fibrin clots are deposited in the tissues. The release of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-17 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) which have been incriminated as being part of pathological signal cascades in brain diseases [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] could have been released in these animals, although these cytokines were not measured. The formation of fibrin clots could result in the blockage of blood vessels in the different tissues and organs causing tissue anoxia and finally death.</p><p>It is not clear as to the significant changes between the pre and post treatment haemoglobin levels. However, no animals were found to be clinically anaemic, and as the animals were fed on a rich protein-diet it is likely that this variation in parameter was not a major characteristic of ivermectin&#x02019;s effect on haemoglobin. In all treated animals, there was an increase in the total white blood cell counts, eosinophils, and neutrophils. The increase in WBC counts is similar to what Ducorps <italic>et al</italic>. found out in their study [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This increase is probably due to an enhancement in the production of many more leukocytes to reduce the severity of Mazzotti reaction and to fight the infection in general. The increase in eosinophils in this study is similar to what Martin-Prevel <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] noticed where treatment with ivermectin causes an increase in eosinophils. The global changes in eosinophil counts recorded after treatment with ivermectin in patients harbouring <italic>L</italic>. <italic>loa</italic> is similar to those observed in onchocerciasis patients after treatment with ivermectin or DEC [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This could probably be due to the preponderant role of eosinophils in the development of the Mazzotti reaction whose severity is associated with eosinophil sequestration and activation-degranulation [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The increase in neutrophils observed is probably because these cells are the hallmarks of acute inflammation given the fact that the migration and degranulation of eosinophil in the skin releases parasite specific antigens during cell death that induces a pro-inflammatory response. The general increase observed in SGPT, SGOT and &#x003b3;-GT levels after ivermectin treatment could probably be due to hepatocellular damage or obstruction in bile flow cholestasis [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Generally, this drug has not been associated with acute or chronic liver injury, although Veit <italic>et al</italic>., [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] realised that treatment with a single dose of ivermectin resulted in mild hepatotoxicity. Elevations in SGPT and SGOT in blood are increased in conditions in which cells are damaged or dead. It is also important to note that the elevations in serum liver enzymes can also be secondary to enzyme induction without hepatic pathology [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The elevations of creatinine post-treatment in control animals was not surprising because during the course of infection after inoculation of mfs into these animals, its&#x02019; levels were already high. This could probably be related to kidney dysfunction [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] as a malfunction in glomerular filtration results in the retention of substances including urea and creatinine. Generally, creatinine levels dropped in all animals that took ivermectin alone, or ivermectin together with other treatments. This decrease is probably due to the fact that the kidneys were more efficient in excreting the compound. The elevated serum glucose level observed may have resulted from increased mobilization of glucose for metabolism or may be due to reduced glucose uptake into cells caused by ivermectin [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] or a possible modulation of the capacity of the renal tubule by the drug to reabsorb glucose actively from the blood [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The decrease in potassium levels in untreated animals could probably be due to a reduced intake in their diet [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] or a decreased sensitivity of the nephron to aldosterone and other mineralocorticoids responsible for reabsorption and retention of electrolytes, respectively. However, the drop in potassium levels in animals administered ivermectin and prednisone is probably due to the fact that prednisone is known to cause more urination as more blood moves to the kidneys. It is probable that as more urine is sent out, more potassium ions are also lost along with it from the body in these animals or reduced intake in their diet [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The changes in calcium ions pre and post treatment could probably be related to variations in diet intake of this mineral [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Generally, all animals administered ivermectin became withdrawn 48 hours following treatment. This observation is in line with the results of earlier studies [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] which revealed that symptoms appeared within two days of ivermectin treatment in patients who were previously healthy. This withdrawal attitude could be due to stress that developed due to loss of coordination, reduced alertness that can progress to stupor or coma. A withdrawn attitude is a neurological manifestation that is related to blockage and reduced blood flow supplying nutrients and oxygen to the cells that could be due to the destruction or death of mf in the brain and other tissues. A possible scenario for the pathogenesis of the animal that died 5 hours after ivermectin treatment could be that at the time of ivermectin treatment, this animal harbored a <italic>Loa</italic> mf load (124,700mf/mL) greatly exceeding the threshold associated with the risk of post-ivermectin Loa encephalopathy. The initial <italic>L</italic>. <italic>loa</italic> microfilarial load has been demonstrated to be the main risk factor for the development of serious reactions and an association has been found to exist between <italic>L</italic>. <italic>loa</italic> load and the occurrence of marked or serious reactions has been found to be significant above 8,000mf/mL with the association being close and stable [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>In all animals treated with ivermectin, there was the development of body rashes and itches in otherwise healthy animals just one day after treatment. The development of rashes could probably be due to an enhancement in the production of many more leukocytes (such as eosinophils and neutrophils) to reduce the severity of Mazzotti reaction and to fight the infection in general; these cells being the hallmarks of acute inflammation. The presence of haemorrhages with evidence of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>loa</italic> mf seen in the brain, eyes and other organs of treated animals could probably be due to the fact that ivermectin results in rapid killing of Loa mf in these tissues. The obstruction of blood capillaries by these dead worms in these organs could lead to an ischemic reaction, increased pressure within the capillaries, rupture of the affected vessel(s) and haemorrhagic suffusion. This observed vasculopathy with evidence of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>loa</italic> as a likely etiology in the brain tissue therefore confirms the definite case of <italic>Loa</italic> encephalopathy as put forth by the group of independent experts who consulted for MDP immediately after the first cases of SAEs were noticed in the 1990s. Lymphadenopathy was present in all baboons that received ivermectin. Enlarged lymph nodes generally result from the accumulation of leucocytes within the lymph glands. Ivermectin, has been shown to cause an increase in the total white blood cell counts, number of eosinophils, and neutrophils [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Our results suggest that the pathogenesis of <italic>Loa</italic> encephalopathy is as a result of the death of mf in the blood vessels in the brain. This event causing inflammation to set in with the activation of the fibrin pathway with fibrin clots being deposited and these blocking the blood vessels in the brain and other tissues. This deposition of fibrin clots damages the walls of these blood vessels as a result of the release of inflammatory cytokines and these overall pathologic processes affecting the local tissues through tissue anoxia and other detrimental changes that eventually result in the permanent damage and in some cases the death of the host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005576.g011">Fig 11</xref>).</p><fig id="pntd.0005576.g011" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0005576.g011</object-id><label>Fig 11</label><caption><title>Potential pathogenesis of Loa encephalopathy following the ivermectin treatment of Loa hyper-microfilaraemic individuals.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pntd.0005576.g011"/></fig><p>For the first time, this study has provided information on the tissues and body fluids where mf could be found after ivermectin treatment of <italic>Loa</italic> heavily infected individuals. Generally, organs that normally receive large amounts of blood were noticed to be harbouring many more microfilariae than those less irrigated. Given that <italic>Loa loa</italic> is a blood dwelling filarial worm, its presence in these highly irrigated organs is to be expected. It is not known as to why aspirin and prednisone lead to a decrease or an increase in the number of tissue sections. The presence of microfilariae in other body fluids (peritoneal and pericardial) collected at autopsy could probably be due to the fact ivermectin treatment induces the <italic>Loa</italic> microfilariae to flee from the blood circulation. This is an important finding which indicates that in those humans who suffer from SAEs, the serious events noticed could be due to breathing difficulties due to the accumulation of fluid in the lungs or complications such as ascites which might cause difficulties in compressing the diaphragm leading to breathing difficulties. The discovery of the presence of these effusions could serve as an important step in managing the SAEs clinically as these fluids could be drained and an intravenous infusion administered to these patients to balance fluid and electrolytes.</p><p>The primary lesions seen in the untreated infected animals were peri-portal accumulation of lymphocytes; as present in all of the animals. It is likely that in addition to the spleen, this organ and the peri-portal region is a common location for the degeneration of microfilariae. It is also possible that this occurs as a result of the initial removal of the spleen as part of the infection process, and the liver has become the default site for microfilarial destruction. It is clear that a major pathogenic event following ivermectin is a vasculopathy associated with the death and degeneration, with a cellular response, and all of this taking place intravascularly. Although there is on occasion clear damage and the resulting haemorrhaging of vessels, it is more likely that this vascular blockage results in acute parenchymal damage or dysfunction in the brain that results in the clinical condition.</p><p>Generally, in this study we found out that animals administered aspirin showed milder symptoms compared to those that received prednisone. Aspirin is part of a group of medications called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but differs from most other NSAIDs in the mechanism of action. It produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It is probable that the lipoxins produced by this drug aid in alleviating the symptoms observed in animals after treatment with ivermectin. The finding that prednisone aggravates the clinical manifestations observed corroborates the assertions made by Boussinesq <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pntd.0005576.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] that corticosteroids do not have any beneficial effect on the course of these clinical manifestations because they might lead to iatrogenic lethal complications.</p><p>The influx of significant number of eosinophils into the tissues shortly after ivermectin treatment is likely to be a significant contributor to the pathogenesis of the condition or at least the clinical presentation. Release of toxic mediators from the activation of eosinophils would probably be an important factor in the pathogenesis of this condition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings presented from this study have revealed that the ivermectin treatment of <italic>Loa</italic> hypermicrofilaraemic animals induces a drastic reduction in mf numbers with an 80% decrease observed in some animals. Hb was the only observed parameter that recorded a slight significant value pre and post treatment. Clinical manifestations observed after treatment are similar to what have been observed in humans such as rashes, itching, haemorrhagic conjunctiva, increased temperature, increased pulse and respiratory rates, diarrhoea, lymph node enlargement, pinkish ears, swollen face and restlessness. Macroscopic changes noticed were primarily those of a vasculo-pathologic nature (e.g. haemorrhages) seen in all groups given ivermectin, occurring at various levels, except in the untreated. Microscopically, the major cellular changes seen, and present in all the ivermectin treated animals, were: the presence of microfilariae of varying degrees of degeneration associated with either fibrin deposition, endothelial alteration (cellular swelling) including damage to the integrity of the blood vessel and the presence of extravascular erythrocytes (haemorrhage), the increased presence of eosinophil leucocytes and other chronic inflammatory types in certain tissues and organs, sometimes in large numbers and local evidence of microfilarial death. Highly vascularised organs like the brain, heart, lungs, and kidneys were observed to have more microfilariae in tissue sections. The number of mf seen in the brain and kidneys of animals administered IVM only, tripled that of control animals. Co-administration of IVM + PSE caused an increase in mf in the brain and kidneys while the reverse was noticed with the co-administration of IVM+ASA. The ivermectin treatment of Loa hyper-microfilaraemic baboons has revealed that the formation of fibrin clots and the presence of pleural and peritoneal effusions could probably be related to the development of the pathological conditions noticed in those <italic>Loa</italic> hypermicrofilaraemic humans who were administered ivermectin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0005576.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Biochemical findings in each treatment group.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0005576.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0005576.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Biochemical parameters pre and post treatment.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0005576.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Mrs. Ngie Hene, Mr. Aladji Hussaini, Mr. Syangkalbe Bernard and Mr. Oben Bruno, for their excellent technical assistance.
