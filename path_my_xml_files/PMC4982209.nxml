Patients admitted to ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), an inflammatory lung condition, are particularly resource-intensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], have high mortality and morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and survivors report lower quality of life than other critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Patients with ARDS often require mechanical ventilation (MV), a particularly costly life-sustaining therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As MV itself can cause lung injury, inflammation and even death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], alternative ventilation strategies that better protect the lungs have been called for. Recent large trials have examined the effectiveness of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) as compared to conventional ventilation in patients with ARDS but have not demonstrated any improvement in short-term mortality with the use of HFOV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A comprehensive evaluation of these alternative therapies requires the assessment of long-term mortality outcomes and the consideration of resource use and patient quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The volume of high quality data arising from recent research in this area presents new opportunities for knowledge generation beyond the core objectives of those studies.</p><p>Following discharge, recovery is challenging for survivors of ARDS as physical and neuropsychological disabilities may persist for years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the long run, health-related quality of life (HRQL) of the survivors of ARDS and other critically ill patients has been found to be significantly lower than for the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To date, economic studies of patients with ARDS mostly focused on ICU and hospital costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and few studies have examined the long-term costs among ICU survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Survivors of ARDS may require on-going treatments and rehabilitation following hospital discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] as well as extensive support from carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which may lead to an important economic cost to the health sector and the society as a whole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The measurement and reporting of costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in ICU populations is vital to allow health service and policy advances.</p><p>In this paper, we used in-hospital trial data and follow-up questionnaires of a prospective cohort of patients with ARDS to examine 1-year healthcare utilisation and quality-of-life outcomes, enabling the calculation of costs and QALYs. The economic and quality-of-life data were collected alongside the OSCAR trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], a multi-centre randomised, controlled trial of HFOV as compared with conventional mechanical ventilation, conducted in England, Wales and Scotland. We assessed the economic costs and benefits within the initial year following randomisation and estimated detailed costs for various parts of the care pathway (initial ICU stay, hospital stay following first ICU discharge and post-hospital resource use) and patient groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient population</title><p>The data used in this study come from the OSCAR study, a multi-centre, randomised, controlled trial of HFOV as compared to conventional MV in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS. Patients (&#x0003e;16&#x000a0;years) who were undergoing MV were recruited in different-sized ICUs from 29 hospitals across England, Wales and Scotland and were randomised to either HFOV or conventional MV. Patients were eligible if they were expected to require at least two more days of MV and met the definition of moderate or severe ARDS. Patients were excluded if they had been on ventilation for 7&#x000a0;days or more. Inclusion criteria for OSCAR and patient recruitment have been described in detail in Young et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The study was approved by national ethics review committees and research governance departments at each centre. Patients or their representatives provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Data collection</title><p>Characteristics such as age, gender, ventilation prior to enrolment, physiology and other information required to assess illness severity were collected at the time of randomisation. The Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score was used to measure the severity of illness within the first 24&#x000a0;h after the patient was admitted to an ICU. The APACHE II score is based on several physiological measurements and pre-admission health status and ranges from 0 to 71, with higher scores corresponding to more severe illness. The baseline ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was also recorded as a measure of the severity of ARDS. Case report forms (CRFs) were completed by the medical and nursing staff for each day a patient was in ICU. The CRFs recorded the use of antibiotics, sedatives and muscle relaxant drugs as well as information on support for organ systems. Serious adverse events and whether the patient required a chest drain or presented radiological evidence of barotrauma were also recorded. ICU discharge date and location, ICU readmissions and hospital discharge date were available.</p><p>Following hospital discharge, questionnaires were sent to surviving patients and their carers at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. Patients were asked about their use of medical services during the previous 6&#x000a0;months, including primary- and community-based health and social services and residential inpatient stays. The questionnaires also contained questions related to the use of aids and equipment, gross loss of earnings and other major expenses. Patients&#x02019; questionnaires also recorded quality of life using the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Carers&#x02019; questionnaires recorded the cost of travel to and from medical services, major expenses and loss of earnings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Quality of life</title><p>Patients&#x02019; HRQL was measured at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months using EQ-5D. Health utility weights for each patient were derived from EQ-5D responses using the standard UK specific tariffs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. For each time period, mean utility scores were compared to those of an age- and sex-matched reference population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>To obtain mean QALYs at 1&#x000a0;year, quality of life and survival data were combined into a single metric. Patients&#x02019; histories were partitioned into several periods from randomisation to 1&#x000a0;year, and a utility value was assigned to each of these periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. For the ventilation period, we multiplied the average number of days ventilated by the utility weight of an unconscious patient reported in the EQ-5D scoring manual (&#x02212;0.4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. We then calculated the mean utility scores of survivors at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months using all available questionnaires and, assuming a linear change in HRQL between assessments, we calculated mean utility scores at two additional mid-points (3 and 9&#x000a0;months). The mean time in each period was obtained by calculating the area under the relevant Kaplan-Meier survival curve. The sum of the mean survival time in each state multiplied by the utility weights provided an estimate of the quality-adjusted survival at 1&#x000a0;year, expressed in QALYs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Costing methodology</title><p>We used a bottom-up micro-costing approach where we assigned unit costs to volumes of resource use for each patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. We analysed costs from the perspective of the health and social care sector (NHS) and from a broader societal perspective. Costing was undertaken for the various pathways of care following ICU admission: initial ICU stay, hospital stay following first ICU discharge, post-hospital NHS resource use and societal costs. ICU and hospital costs were assessed using the bottom-up approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>Resource use associated with initial stay in ICU was assessed daily based on the number of organs supported, respiratory support, whether the patient was on renal replacement therapy, whether he/she required X-rays (to check for barotrauma) or a chest drain (pneumothorax) and use of medicines. The quantities of resource use were multiplied by their corresponding unit costs, and the sum per patient for the entire stay was calculated. The unit costs of ICU resources including cost per organ supported, radiology and the cost of pneumothorax were taken from the National Schedule of Reference Costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The costs of medicines used were taken from the British National Formulary (BNF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The daily cost of ventilation was based on a fixed and per patient cost. We assumed that ventilation machines would be used for 5&#x000a0;years; annual maintenance and the costs of single use circuits were also included.</p><p>Once patients were discharged from ICU, the cost of step-down and the cost of ICU readmissions were calculated using the number of days until death or discharge multiplied by the cost of the level of care required, based on various nationally available references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. If a patient was discharged to another hospital following ICU, the cost of transport was taken as that of an emergency transfer. Serious adverse events and corresponding unit costs were assessed on an individual basis. Patient-reported data on resource use were collected at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. NHS resource use included further inpatient care, outpatient care, primary- and community-based care and aids and equipment provided by the NHS. The costs of attendance at medical services were calculated using national reference costs multiplied by the number of times a patient attended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Inpatient stays were based on the number of days admitted multiplied by the corresponding unit cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The cost of aids and equipment was taken from the NHS supply chain cost for each individual item. Costs incurred by patients and their carers included cost of travel, loss of earnings and patient out-of-pocket expenses for aids, equipment and extra expenses (home adaptations). The cost of travel to and from appointments for both carers and patients was based on the distance in miles provided in the questionnaires multiplied by the cost per petrol mile as provided by HM Revenue &#x00026; Customs (HMRC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Patients and carers were asked to give the gross amount lost in earnings in the 6&#x000a0;months covered by each questionnaire. Cost of aids and equipment purchased by patients was directly reported in the patient questionnaire. All costs were adjusted to 2012 prices using the Hospital and Community Healthcare Services (HCHS) index published by the Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Unit costs used in the analysis and more details on the costing strategy are provided in the supplemental appendix.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcomes were 1-year survival, quality of life and resource use. Resource use was measured in terms of duration of treatment in both the ICU and the hospital and in terms of health care and societal costs at 1&#x000a0;year, divided into the various care pathways, i.e. ICU stay, hospital stay and post-discharge period. These outcomes were presented for various subgroups of patients based on baseline demographic, physiological, and clinical characteristic, including ventilation strategy (HFOV or conventional ventilation). Total cost per 1-year survivor was obtained by dividing the sum of ICU, hospital, and post-hospital costs for all patients by the number of patients remaining alive 1&#x000a0;year post-randomisation. The 1-year incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of HFOV as compared to conventional MV was also calculated. The ICER was obtained by dividing the difference between the average 1-year costs in the HFOV group, and the average 1-year cost in the conventional ventilation group by the difference between average health outcomes (QALYs) gained in the HFOV group and those gained in the conventional ventilation group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Patient characteristics are presented using means and standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables and proportions and percentages for categorical variables. We compared baseline characteristics of 1-year survivors and non-survivors using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> tests for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables. No corrections were made for multiple testing. Cost data are presented using means, 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals, median and interquartile range. HRQL at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months and quality-adjusted survival were summarised using means and 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals. HRQL of survivors was compared to population reference values using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> tests. We first estimated mean post-hospital costs based on complete cases. To obtain total costs at 1-year for each patient, missing data on post-hospital costs among 1-year survivors was addressed by multiple imputation using chained equations. We used a truncated model in which costs were constrained to be equal or above zero and generated ten datasets. Estimates from each imputed dataset were combined following Rubin&#x02019;s rule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. All <italic>p</italic> values were two-sided, and a significance level of less than 0.05 was used. R 3.0.2 and Stata 12 (Statacorp, College Station, TX, USA) were used for the analyses.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 795 patients underwent randomisation. A flow chart of the study population is presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Among the 795 patients included in the analysis, 343 patients died in ICU and 47 died in hospital after ICU discharge (in-hospital mortality rate of 49.1&#x000a0;%). Of the 405 remaining patients, 17 died between hospital discharge and the 12&#x000a0;months follow-up. Thus, the 1-year mortality rate was 51.2&#x000a0;%. A total of 234 patients completed the cost and quality-of-life questionnaires at 6&#x000a0;months, and 205 patients completed the questionnaires at 12&#x000a0;months (response rate of 58.9 and 52.8&#x000a0;%, respectively). Overall, 170 1-year survivors and 95 carers completed both the 6-month and the 12-month questionnaires. Baseline patient characteristics are displayed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The mean age was 55&#x000a0;years and most patients were male (62.3&#x000a0;%) and had pneumonia identified as the primary cause of ARDS (58.6&#x000a0;%). The mean ICU length of stay (+/&#x02212; SD) was 17.0+/&#x02212;16.5&#x000a0;days, and the mean hospital length of stay was 33.6+/&#x02212;43.1&#x000a0;days. Compared to 1-year survivors, non-survivors were older, had a higher APACHE II score, lower PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio and were less likely to have been admitted in surgery. 1-year survivors who have completed both 6 and 12&#x000a0;months questionnaires were younger and had lower APACHE II scores than 1-year survivors with incomplete information (unreported analysis).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of study population</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40560_2016_178_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline patient characteristics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>All patients (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;795)</th><th>1-year survivors (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;388)</th><th>1-year non-survivors (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;407)</th><th>

Higher 1-year mortality was observed among older (&#x02265;&#x02009;65) patients (OR 3.98, 95&#x000a0;% CI 2.86&#x02013;5.55) and patients with higher (&#x0003e;26) APACHE II score (OR 2.55, 95&#x000a0;% CI 1.80&#x02013;3.63), after adjustment for sex and PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio by logistic regression. The shape of the Kaplan-Meier curve suggests that the largest differences in mortality rates between these groups are observed within the first 30&#x000a0;days from randomisation and that, after 60&#x000a0;days, mortality rates were relatively low and stable in all groups. There was no significant difference in 1-year survival in the HFOV group as compared to the conventional ventilation group (OR 1.06, 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.79&#x02013;1.43).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Kaplan-Meier survival plots at 12&#x000a0;months</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40560_2016_178_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>Health-related quality of life of survivors in the different age groups and for an age- and sex-matched population of reference is displayed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, separately for the 6 and 12&#x000a0;months follow-up.

<sup>a</sup>Total societal costs estimates based on imputed data for patients with missing post-hospital cost</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this multicentre study conducted in 29 hospitals across England, we found that adults admitted to ICU with moderate-to-severe ARDS had high 1-year mortality (51.8&#x000a0;%) and incurred high hospital costs (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x000a3;37,626; CI &#x000a3;34,866&#x02013;&#x000a3;40,385). Our results are comparable to those obtained in a multi-country study where the reported daily ICU costs ranged from &#x020ac;1168 to &#x020ac;2025 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. However, previous ICU costing studies gave rise to a wide range of daily ICU cost estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] due to an important variation in methodological approaches and underlying assumptions. Analyses among survivors revealed lower than normal quality of life and non-negligible resource use and costs following hospital discharge. These were equally split between health and social care costs (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x000a3;3935; CI &#x000a3;2917&#x02013;&#x000a3;4953) and costs to the patient and their carers (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x000a3;3556; CI &#x000a3;2332&#x02013;&#x000a3;4780). The cost per 1-year survivor was &#x000a3;90,206 (CI &#x000a3;84,536&#x02013;&#x000a3;96,134), which is higher than figures previously published in ARDS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] possibly due to higher in-hospital mortality in our sample. These figures will be of use to health economic modellers in the future when evaluating ICU interventions; especially given existing evidence for the UK is scarce. Our study revealed heterogeneity in costs across patient groups, especially regarding age and disease severity, but these results were mostly driven by higher short-term mortality in older and more severely ill patients. In line with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], we found that hospital costs accounted for the largest share of the economic burden of ARDS at 1&#x000a0;year (81.6&#x000a0;%) and that the length of ICU stay was the main cost driver. However, as previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], costs can still be important following hospital discharge. Survivors required extensive community-based and social care services, specific aids and equipment and incurred extra expenses related to home adaptations. In addition, indirect costs such as lost earnings caused by employment reductions and the economic value of support from caregivers were non-negligible.</p><p>The 1-year mortality was 51.8&#x000a0;% in our sample, which is in line with results reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The mean health-related quality of life of 1-year survivors was significantly lower than the age- and sex-matched reference values, and the difference was particularly marked among younger patients. When survival and quality of life were combined in the full sample, we found low quality-adjusted survival at 1&#x000a0;year. Specifically, we found that 100 patients admitted in ICU with ARDS are expected to accrue 27 QALYs in 1&#x000a0;year, in line with previous estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Overall, high mortality combined with poor quality of life among survivors gives rise to low benefit per patient 1&#x000a0;year post-ICU admission and high cost per survivor.</p><p>The data used in this study were collected alongside the OSCAR trial of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), as compared to conventional ventilation. The clinical results of the OSCAR trial have shown no significant effect of HFOV on 30-day mortality and showed no short-term benefits or harm of HFOV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this longer term economic analysis, we found no difference in survival between the HFOV and conventional ventilation group, but we found that patients in the HFOV arm had better quality of life at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months and had higher average costs. A comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis alongside the OSCAR trial was published elsewhere and found no evidence of cost-effectiveness of HFOV as compared to conventional ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p>Our study has several limitations that should be noted. First, data on the use of community-based health and social care among survivors were collected retrospectively using self-completed questionnaires, which may have affected the accuracy of the data due to reporting and recall bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. As is inherent with most questionnaire-based research, our study suffered from incomplete return of the quality-of-life and resource use questionnaires. Although partially mitigated against by multiple imputation, our results may therefore be biased if the return rate depends on patient health status. Specifically, if missing data are more prevalent in sicker patients, our cost estimates are likely to be biased downwards and our quality of life estimates upwards. Also, both costs and quality of life estimates were based on a linearity assumption as we had to rely on two data collection points for their calculation. Finally, we restrained our analysis to costs and outcomes incurred over 1&#x000a0;year. Several studies have assessed the long-term benefits of intensive care and found that ICU was a reasonably good use of resources, especially in low-risk patients, i.e. patients with lower disease severity and higher short-term survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p>The results presented here are based on longitudinal trial data collected in a large sample of ARDS patients treated in 29 different-sized ICUs, which improves external validity. In addition, the 1-year follow-up period enabled us to capture on-going risk of death beyond the typical &#x0201c;short-term&#x0201d; follow-up periods of similar studies. Additionally, we are among the first to provide estimates of societal costs following ARDS. The estimates presented in this paper, broken down in several patient groups and care settings, will be of use to health economic modellers requiring cost and utility estimates to populate decision-analytical models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Given the high costs and low health-related quality of life identified, there is significant scope for further research aimed at improving care in this in-need patient group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>APACHE, Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation; ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; BNF, British National Formulary; CRF, case report form; EQ-5D, EuroQol-5D; FiO2, fraction of inspired oxygen; HCHS, Hospital and Community Healthcare Services; HFOV, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation; HMRC, HM revenue &#x00026; Customs; HRQL, health-related quality of life; ICER, incremental cost effectiveness ratio; ICU, intensive care unit; MV, mechanical ventilation; NHS, National Health Service; NIHR, National Institute for Health Research; PaO2, partial pressure of arterial oxygen; PSSRU, Personal Social Services Research Unit; QALY, quality-adjusted life year; SD, standard deviation</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the study participants and the research team involved in the OSCAR trial.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This research was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (Award Number 06/04/01); OSCAR Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN10416500.
