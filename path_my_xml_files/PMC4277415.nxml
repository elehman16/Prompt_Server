The characteristic shape, location and orientation of a cheiloplasty scar mark the patient for life as having been born with a cleft lip deformity. Such facial scars are conspicuous and difficult to conceal. Most patients with facial scarring harbor dissatisfaction and would value even a minor improvement <xref rid="pone.0115690-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>The muscles of facial expression lie superficially, do not have bony attachments and create expressions by altering the tension of adjacent skin. However, skin tension that is perpendicular to an incision or laceration is known to increase the risk of unfavorable scarring as a result of the distracting forces exerted on the healing wound <xref rid="pone.0115690-Gassner1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Therefore, reductions in facial muscular activity that result in decreased skin tension during healing may improve facial scarring. Gassner et al found that botulinum toxin injections tended to improve facial scars <xref rid="pone.0115690-Gassner2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, their study involved the use of different mechanisms of injury, suture materials and wound orientations, each of which is a factor known to affect scar quality independently <xref rid="pone.0115690-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Moreover, scar outcomes were only assessed subjectively.</p><p>A standardized method of cleft lip scar revision (CLSR) has been established for more than a decade at our center. The design of incisions, sutures used and postoperative care are all protocolized. CLSR incisions are unavoidably perpendicular to the direction of pull of the underlying orbicularis oris muscle, which therefore exerts unfavorable forces across the sutured wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115690-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). We routinely use taping to try to control against this pull, and routinely apply topical silicone sheeting, which is known to improve scarring <xref rid="pone.0115690-Atkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>; however, despite these efforts, we still observe hypertrophic scarring following CLSR. There remains a need to improve scarring so that the lifelong stigma endured by patients of having obvious evidence of cleft lip repair can be reduced.</p><fig id="pone-0115690-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0115690.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Contractions of the orbicularis oris muscle are believed to inflict repeating micro-trauma to the healing wound, causing an initially narrow scar to slowly widen.</title><p>Lower right: A patient in the control group exhibiting an elevated scar after suture removal.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0115690.g001"/></fig><p>We hypothesized that temporary paralysis of the orbicularis oris muscle with botulinum toxin may improve the CLSR scar and tested this with a randomized, double-blinded, prospective, vehicle-controlled clinical trial.

If treatment could improve VSS score by 1, which was considered clinically significant, approximately 26 patients per group would have been necessary to provide a result with a real significance (using the same SD and considering the standard &#x003b1; error of 0.05 and a power of 0.8). Assuming a 10% non-compliance rate for follow-up evaluation, the sample size was increased to 30 per group.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Patients and Randomization</title><p>Between July 2010 and March 2012, sixty consecutive patients were enrolled for randomization having satisfied the following criteria.

All CLSRs were performed at the Craniofacial Center of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan.</p><p>A specialized nurse, who was independent of the study, prepared the encoded vials.

Briefly, the scar of the lip and nasal floor was marked and the scar tissue narrowly excised. The orbicularis oris muscle was excised wider than the width of scar; this maneuver reduces tension across the overlying skin repair, since the muscle repair causes slight redundancy of the skin. The first stitch taking lateral orbicularis muscle was sutured to the nasal septum; thereafter, the lateral orbicularis muscle was interposed and sutured overlapping the medial orbicularis muscle for philtral column reconstruction. Interrupted sutures used were as follows: 4&#x02013;0 and 5&#x02013;0 polydioxanone (PDS II; Ethicon/Johnson-Johnson, New Brunswick, New Jersey) for muscle and subcuticular layers, respectively; 6-0 nylon (Unik, Taipei, Taiwan) for skin <xref rid="pone.0115690-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

Cutaneous scars are generally distinguished from surrounding normal skin by differences in color, thickness, contour, compliance, overall cosmesis and functional detriments such as contracture formation. Young et al found that patients were usually dissatisfied with their surgical scars, irrespective of patient gender, age, ethnicity or geographical location, and that 91% of them would value even a small improvement in their scar <xref rid="pone.0115690-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Hence, surgeons frequently recommend and prescribe scar modulation practices and treatments, particularly in susceptible ethnicities such as Orientals for whom the incidence of unfavorable scarring is higher than in Caucasians <xref rid="pone.0115690-Atiyeh1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Synergistic contractions of the facial muscles are responsible for facial expressions. Since these muscles do not have bony insertions and lie very superficially, their actions exert tension across adjacent skin and subcutaneous tissue. If a wound is orientated perpendicular to the direction of the underlying facial muscle fibers, the muscular tension exerts a distracting effect on the healing wound edges and increases the risk of an undesirable hypertrophic or widened scar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115690-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Consequently, reducing tension around a wound is important for improving scar quality and reducing the incidence of hypertrophic scars <xref rid="pone.0115690-Gurtner1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0115690-Ogawa1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>A secondary cleft lip deformity is one that arises despite primary surgical treatment of the cleft lip. The principles of CLSR are cleft scar excision, anatomical repair of the orbicularis oris muscle, and correction of asymmetries noted in the Cupid bow and philtral columns. Unfortunately, CLSR wounds are unavoidably orientated perpendicular to the line of pull of the subjacent orbicularis oris muscle, which is in constant use during daily life for speech, eating, drinking, blowing, sucking, and a variety of facial expressions. These repetitive bouts of distracting tensional forces inflict micro-trauma to the healing wound, leading to prolongation of the inflammatory response and ultimately increased fibrosis <xref rid="pone.0115690-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In contrast to other facial wounds, the incidence of hypertrophic scars affecting the upper lip is high, ranging between 12% and 27% in the mixed population, and increasing when controlled for ethnicities to 32.2% in Hispanics and 36.3% in Asians. Intraoperatively, we therefore create a degree of skin redundancy with the interposing and overlapping orbicularis oris muscle repair both for philtral column restoration as well as reducing tension across the skin repair. Additionally, postoperatively we employ a routine scar management protocol in further attempts to reduce skin tension as much as possible.</p><p>Firstly, taping of the skin is commonly used for its splinting effect, which is known to improve scarring by protecting healing cutaneous wounds from tensional forces <xref rid="pone.0115690-Atkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. We therefore firmly tape the upper lip as well as the cheeks following CLSR routinely to counteract not only the distracting forces of the orbicularis oris but also other adjacent muscles of facial expression (such as risorius and zygomaticus major/minor). Secondly, we also apply silicone sheeting routinely overnight, given its proven utility in reducing scar hypertrophy <xref rid="pone.0115690-McCarty1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Despite meticulous surgery and these rigid postoperative wound care practices, we are still frequently disappointed by hypertrophic scarring following CLSR. We therefore sought a new scar modulation strategy.</p><p>Botulinum toxin causes chemical muscular paralysis <xref rid="pone.0115690-Stevens1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Function returns over several months with nerve sprouting and growth of new neuromuscular junctions. Scott found that injections of botulinum toxin could temporarily weaken extraocular muscles and used small doses to treat patients with strabismus <xref rid="pone.0115690-Scott1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The observation by Carruthers and Carruthers that patients treated with botulinum toxin for blepharospasm had improvements in their dynamic glabella rhytides sparked its widespread cosmetic use <xref rid="pone.0115690-Carruthers1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. They showed that injections of small quantities of botulinum toxin into specific facial expression muscles caused their temporary paralysis and a concurrent reduction in overlying skin tension, thus improving dynamic wrinkles for a period of 2&#x02013;6 months.</p><p>The same effect may also be exploited to reduce tension around healing facial wounds. Gassner et al demonstrated that botulinum toxin injections improved scarring from facial wounds in non-human primates <xref rid="pone.0115690-Gassner1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Other authors have since reported apparent improvements in scars treated with botulinum toxin in humans, but their conclusions were significantly limited by the lack of controls in their studies <xref rid="pone.0115690-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0115690-Gassner3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Although Gassner et al's study was prospective, blinded, randomized and placebo-controlled, they included widely differing wounds (varying in length from 2.0 to 12.0 cm, caused by a variety of mechanisms, including traumatic lacerations and excisional cancer ablations) which were managed in non-standardized fashion (using different suture materials and suturing techniques performed by emergency physicians, otolaryngologists or plastic surgeons each with different postoperative management routines) and therefore subject to equally variable possible scar outcomes that may or may not have been directly related to the botulinum toxin or placebo <xref rid="pone.0115690-Gassner2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Additionally, although they limited the location of wounds to the forehead, the orientation of the wounds was not considered despite it being critically important to final cosmetic outcome. Scars were only subjectively assessed using a visual analogue scale, with the added complexity that the two assessors were asked to consider the cosmetic outcome of the wound at six months with respect to their subjective opinion of the condition of the wound at closure. Furthermore, the forehead is less dynamic than the upper lip and hence at less risk of unfavorable scarring. Indeed, there is only one paper reporting two case reports of botulinum toxin injection for lower facial wounds <xref rid="pone.0115690-Gassner3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Both wounds, however, had intrinsically favorable scarring characteristics from their outset, with the first being almost completely limited to the vermilion of the lower lip and the second being almost exactly aligned with the relaxed skin tension lines of the cheek. The benefit of botulinum toxin on scarring from both of these favorable wounds was therefore unclear and assumed.</p><p>The present trial was therefore carefully limited to CLSR as a consistent model of lower facial wounding with a known risk of hypertrophic scarring and consistent perpendicular orientation to underlying expressive musculature. These patients and wounds were standardized in terms of ethnicity, mechanism of sharp incisional injury, CLSR design and resultant wound orientation, repair method, sutures and suturing techniques used, suture removal time, postoperative taping and silicone application, and lack of postoperative complications that affect scarring, such as dehiscence, infection and hematoma. The critical difference was the content of the randomized post-repair injections. Postoperative subjective assessments were semi-quantitatively performed using the validated VSS and VAS, and objective quantitative measurements were performed using two modalities that each presented high inter- and intra-observer consistency. Accordingly, we were able to draw a robust conclusion that the botulinum toxin injections resulted in significantly improved CLSR scars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115690-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), due to temporary chemical orbicularis oris paralysis and a consequent reduction in overlying skin tension forces.</p><fig id="pone-0115690-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0115690.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>The upper row illustrates scarring of three patients in the experimental group (botulinum toxin) and lower row illustrates the scars of three vehicle-control group patients at six months' follow-up.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0115690.g006"/></fig><p>Limitations of this study include, firstly, that interpretation of the absolute boundaries of a cutaneous scar is not binary and therefore may be subject to variation when performing scar width measurements.
