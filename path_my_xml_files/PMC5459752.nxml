We aimed to establish whether 52-week referral to an open-group weight-management programme would achieve greater weight loss and improvements in a range of health outcomes and be more cost-effective than the current practice of 12-week referrals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this non-blinded, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, we recruited participants who were aged 18 years or older and had body-mass index (BMI) of 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or higher from 23 primary care practices in England. Participants were randomly assigned (2:5:5) to brief advice and self-help materials, a weight-management programme (Weight Watchers) for 12 weeks, or the same weight-management programme for 52 weeks. We followed-up participants over 2 years. The primary outcome was weight at 1 year of follow-up, analysed with mixed-effects models according to intention-to-treat principles and adjusted for centre and baseline weight. In a hierarchical closed-testing procedure, we compared combined behavioural programme arms with brief intervention, then compared the 12-week programme and 52-week programme. We did a within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis using person-level data and modelled outcomes over a 25-year time horizon using microsimulation. This study is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN82857232.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between Oct 18, 2012, and Feb 10, 2014, we enrolled 1269 participants. 1267 eligible participants were randomly assigned to the brief intervention (n=211), the 12-week programme (n=528), and the 52-week programme (n=528). Two participants in the 12-week programme had been found to be ineligible shortly after randomisation and were excluded from the analysis. 823 (65%) of 1267 participants completed an assessment at 1 year and 856 (68%) participants at 2 years. All eligible participants were included in the analyses. At 1 year, mean weight changes in the groups were &#x02212;3&#x000b7;26 kg (brief intervention), &#x02212;4&#x000b7;75 kg (12-week programme), and &#x02212;6&#x000b7;76 kg (52-week programme). Participants in the behavioural programme lost more weight than those in the brief intervention (adjusted difference &#x02212;2&#x000b7;71 kg, 95% CI &#x02212;3&#x000b7;86 to &#x02212;1&#x000b7;55; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001). The 52-week programme was more effective than the 12-week programme (&#x02212;2&#x000b7;14 kg, &#x02212;3&#x000b7;05 to &#x02212;1&#x000b7;22; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001). Differences between groups were still significant at 2 years. No adverse events related to the intervention were reported. Over 2 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; compared with brief intervention) was &#x000a3;159 per kg lost for the 52-week programme and &#x000a3;91 per kg for the 12-week programme. Modelled over 25 years after baseline, the ICER for the 12-week programme was dominant compared with the brief intervention. The ICER for the 52-week programme was cost-effective compared with the brief intervention (&#x000a3;2394 per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) and the 12-week programme (&#x000a3;3804 per QALY).</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>For adults with overweight or obesity, referral to this open-group behavioural weight-loss programme for at least 12 weeks is more effective than brief advice and self-help materials. A 52-week programme produces greater weight loss and other clinical benefits than a 12-week programme and, although it costs more, modelling suggests that the 52-week programme is cost-effective in the longer term.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>National Prevention Research Initiative, Weight Watchers International (as part of an UK Medical Research Council Industrial Collaboration Award).</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p>The burden of disease attributable to excess bodyweight places considerable strain on health-care resources across the world.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Behavioural weight-management programmes are the first-line method to aid weight loss in people who are overweight or obese, and although there is good evidence that some programmes can be effective, other programmes have not been shown to be effective.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> This variation in effectiveness might be due to differences in content and format of interventions, including how long support is provided. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence public health guidance<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> recommends that behavioural weight-management programmes should last a minimum of 12 weeks, which is the standard length of the most commonly commissioned interventions.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> However, there is conflicting evidence about whether longer treatment (&#x0003e;12 weeks) duration would be more effective.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis was done in November, 2012, to synthesise data from 37 trials of behavioural weight-management programmes delivered in a context that could be replicated in routine clinical practice. Three studies investigated primary care referral to a commercial open-group programme compared with a control group and pooled results showed a mean difference of 2&#x000b7;22 kg in favour of the intervention group, but no consistent effects on markers of cardiovascular risk. The quality of the evidence was assessed as moderate. These interventions lasted 12, 52, and 104 weeks with no studies comparing effectiveness with different durations of treatment. Indirect comparisons across all 37 studies found no effect of duration of intervention on weight loss at 12 months. However, findings from a previous systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparisons between interventions of different lengths, mostly from controlled research studies, showed that interventions providing extended care led to 3&#x000b7;2 kg less weight regain than control interventions over a mean follow-up period of 17&#x000b7;6 months after initial weight loss. We did an updated search of PubMed and Scopus with search terms for &#x0201c;overweight&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;obesity&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;diet&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;exercise&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;weight-loss interventions&#x0201d;, for papers published up until Jan 12, 2017, and found no new direct comparisons of treatment duration.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>We found that referral to a commercial, open-group behavioural programme for 12 weeks or 52 weeks resulted in more weight loss than a brief self-help intervention. This finding extends previous findings by showing that referral for 52 weeks achieves greater weight loss than standard 12-week referrals currently used in the UK National Health Service over 2 years. Contrary to common criticisms that these interventions could exacerbate health inequalities, there was no evidence that the outcome of treatment is affected by socioeconomic factors such as sex, education, and income. We also show, for the first time to our knowledge, that this extended referral achieves improvements in fasting glucose concentration and glycated haemoglobin equivalent to more intensive health professional-led interventions. Using microsimulation modelling, we show for the first time that, over a 25-year period, the 12-week programme is cost-saving compared with a brief intervention, and that the 52-week programme is cost-effective compared with the 12-week programme.</p><p><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p>Referral to a commercial open-group behavioural weight-loss programme for 12 weeks is an effective weight-loss intervention and could be cost-saving for adults in the general population in the long term. Extending the referral length from 12 weeks (UK standard) to 52 weeks could increase the clinical effectiveness of these programmes, by achieving increased weight loss and reductions in risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease compared with the 12-week programme. Although the 52-week programme is more expensive in the short term, the programme is likely to be cost-effective in the longer term because of greater reductions in disease incidence.</p></boxed-text></p><p>Open-group, behavioural weight-loss programmes are among the most commonly commissioned programmes in the UK and evidence suggests that these programmes are both clinically effective and cost-effective.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> We aimed to establish whether 52-week referral to an open-group weight-management programme would result in significantly greater weight loss and improvements in a range of secondary health outcomes in participants and be more cost-effective than the current practice of 12-week referrals.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a multi-centre, non-blinded, multi-arm randomised controlled trial with imbalanced randomisation. The full protocol has been described elsewhere.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Briefly, participants were recruited from 23 primary care practices in England between Oct 18, 2012, and Feb 10, 2014. Recruitment and follow-up was done in three research centres: Medical Research Council (MRC) Human Nutrition Research (Cambridge; coordinating centre), the University of Liverpool, and the University of Oxford. Research teams at Cambridge and Liverpool recruited local practices and research staff did study visits at the research centre. The research team at Oxford recruited practices across southern and eastern England and practice staff (usually a research nurse) did study visits at the practice.</p><p>Ethical approval was received from NRES Committee East of England Cambridge East and local approvals from NRES Committee North West Liverpool Central and NRES Committee South Central Oxford. This trial was registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN82857232.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Participants</title><p>Eligible participants (those aged 18 years or older and had a body-mass index [BMI] of 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or higher) were identified through practice records. Exclusion criteria were planned (within 2 years) or current pregnancy; previous or planned bariatric surgery; current participation in a structured, monitored weight-loss programme; participation in other research that could confound outcome measures; eating disorders; and non-English speaking or special communication needs. Practices could exclude additional patients who they felt were inappropriate to invite, but were asked to report reasons for exclusion. Additional reasons for exclusion included terminal illness or palliative care, dementia, a severe mental health problem or learning difficulty, carer for a terminally ill relative, or recently bereaved. Patients were invited by letter and asked to contact the local study coordinator for telephone screening if they were interested in participating. Eligible and willing participants were given an appointment, during which a member of the research team weighed them and measured their height to confirm eligibility before randomisation. If more than one household member was eligible and interested in participating, the first to enrol was taken as the participant. All participants gave written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>Participant details were entered into the trial database, which randomly assigned participants with a valid BMI to have one of three interventions (brief intervention [given a booklet of self-help weight-management strategies], referral to the commercial, open-group, behavioural weight-loss programme [behavioural programme] for 12 weeks, or referral to the same programme for 52 weeks) in a 2:5:5 ratio stratified by centre and gender, with a block size of 12. The randomisation sequence was generated by the trial statistician at the time of protocol development using Stata (version 12.1) and programmed into the database by the data manager (DC). The sequence was unknown to research staff and participants. The database revealed the group allocation after participants were enrolled and entered into the database. Participants and research staff were not blinded to the intervention allocation after randomisation because of the nature of the intervention and the trial design.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Procedures</title><p>Participants assigned to the behavioural programme were asked to attend a local Weight Watchers meeting once a week for the duration of their intervention (12 weeks or 52 weeks). At the baseline visit, participants were given a list of local meeting times and locations, a voucher booklet for 12 visits (the expiry date was set for 14 weeks from baseline), and a unique code to access digital tools for the duration of their intervention. Meeting vouchers were identical to those used in the National Health Service (NHS) referral schemes operating throughout the country and allowed participants to attend meetings without charge. At the meeting, participants were asked to give the voucher to the group leader, but were asked not to mention their participation in the trial to the group leader or other members. Participants assigned to the 52-week programme were given three additional books of vouchers when they returned for their 3-month visit (expiry date set for 54 weeks from baseline).</p><p>Participants allocated to the brief intervention were given a 32-page printed booklet by the British Heart Foundation of self-help weight-management strategies<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> and research staff read a scripted introduction that drew attention to each section of the booklet.</p><p>All participants attended measurement appointments at baseline and 3, 12, and 24 months. Height was measured to the nearest 0&#x000b7;1 cm using a stadiometer. Weight and fat mass were measured to the nearest 0&#x000b7;1 kg using a 4-point segmental body composition analyser (Tanita, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Waist circumference was measured to the nearest 0&#x000b7;1 cm with a tape measure, halfway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest. Blood pressure was measured three times in a seated resting state with an automated blood pressure monitor, and the mean calculated. Biochemical measurements were optional. Willing participants were asked to give a fasting blood sample at the baseline visit and 12 months for analysis of glucose concentration, glycated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>), and lipid profile. All samples were analysed in Cambridge using standardised methods (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 2</xref>).</p><p>At each visit, participants self-reported their use of weight-loss methods, including the allocated intervention, and completed the EuroQol 5-dimension 3-level (EQ5D-3L) questionnaire<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> as a measure of quality of life. Data on health-care resource use was also self-reported. Participants who were unable or unwilling to attend a 12-month visit (primary outcome measurement) were asked to provide a self-measured weight by phone or email. Self-reported weights are not included in the primary outcome analysis, but are included in a sensitivity analysis (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was change in bodyweight at 12 months. The secondary clinical outcomes were bodyweight at 3 months and 24 months; proportion of participants losing 5% or more of baseline bodyweight or 10% or more of baseline bodyweight at 3, 12, and 24 months; waist circumference, fat mass, and blood pressure at 3, 12 and 24 months; fasting blood glucose concentration, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, triglycerides and HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol at 12 months; and self-reported quality of life (EQ5D-3L) and health resource use at 3, 12, and 24 months. We did not anticipate that adverse events related to the interventions would occur and so did not formally record these.</p></sec><sec id="cesec80"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We calculated the sample size based on data from our previous trials<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> with an expected difference of 2&#x000b7;3 kg between the brief intervention and combined behavioural programme groups, 1&#x000b7;3 kg difference between 12-week and 52-week programmes, and an assumed SD of 6 kg. The hierarchical closed-testing procedure was used to compare the behavioural programme groups with the brief intervention groups using a one-sided test and then, only if significant at the 5% level, we did a two-sided test for a difference between 12-week and 52-week programmes to preserve a type I error rate of 5% without the need for a multiplicity correction. With a sample of 1200 participants (200 participants in the brief intervention group, 500 participants in the 12-week programme, and 500 participants in the 52-week programme), we had 99&#x000b7;95% power to detect a difference of 2&#x000b7;3 kg between the brief intervention group and the behavioural programme groups, and 92&#x000b7;87% power to detect a difference of 1&#x000b7;3 kg between 12-week and 52-week programmes. The overall power of the study was 92&#x000b7;82%.</p><p>Analyses were prespecified in the published protocol.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> The primary analyses assessed differences between the intervention groups in mean weight change from baseline to 12 months. Because of levels of attrition commonly encountered in weight-loss trials, four analysis approaches were taken to account for the effect of missing data: a missing at random (MAR) analysis using a variance components model; a completers only analysis; baseline observation carried forward (BOCF); and last observation carried forward (LOCF). For the MAR analysis, we calculated mean weight loss and SE via a multiple imputation model using multivariate normal regression; we imputed 20 datasets for weight separately for each treatment group, with baseline weight, weight at 3 months, weight at 12 months, and weight at 24 months regressed on centre. A model for multivariate normal data with baseline weight, weight at 3 months, weight at 12 months, and weight at 24 months as the outcome was fitted using measured weights at each timepoint via generalised least squares, with intervention group, visit, intervention group-by-visit interaction, and centre included as fixed effects. For the participants who completed the study only, BOCF and LOCF analyses, fixed-effect models for continuous normal data were fitted to the 12-month weight data. The fixed effects were intervention group, centre, and baseline weight. We analysed secondary outcomes with the same regression-based models. Results reported in this Article used the MAR assumption. Results obtained using other assumptions are in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 4)</xref>. We did sensitivity analyses to examine whether findings were sensitive to timing of the 12-month assessment or inclusion of self-reported weights. All analyses were done in Stata (version 13.1).</p><p>A review<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> highlighted the absence of evidence of this type of programme on socioeconomic inequalities, so we also did a post-hoc analysis of potential interactions between intervention effects and gender, educational qualification, and income. We calculated coefficient estimates for each fixed effect.</p><p>To establish within-trial cost-effectiveness over 24 months, we calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as incremental cost per additional kg of weight loss (see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix for details p 5</xref>). If the participant attended at least one session, the NHS would be charged a flat rate of &#x000a3;48&#x000b7;50 (12-week programme) or &#x000a3;190 (52-week programme). If they did not attend, there was no charge. We estimated non-intervention NHS costs from health-resource use questionnaires, which were completed by participants at baseline, 3, 12, and 24 months and were framed within a 3-month recall period.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> We used area under the curve methods to ascertain the full NHS costs incurred over the 24 months' follow-up period.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> We did a secondary analysis to examine the ICER over a 1-year time horizon to enable comparison with similar studies with shorter follow-up.</p><p>We used the microsimulation model developed for the Foresight: Tackling Obesities project<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> to estimate the effect of the three interventions on disease incidence, health-care costs, quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and ICERs for 25 years following baseline (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 14</xref>). We used mean change in BMI for each intervention at 1 year and 2 years for this analysis, and assumed that between 2 years and 5 years all participants returned to their baseline weight in a linear manner (ie, regained all weight lost) and followed national trends based on data derived from repeated cross-sectional samples in the Health Survey for England.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref></p><p>The number of meetings attended by the participants in the behavioural programme groups between baseline and 3 months, 9 months, and 12 months, and 21 months and 24 months, was self-reported.

After the baseline appointment and before the interventions were started, two participants were excluded because their general practitioner reported illnesses that would have excluded them. These participants were removed and the remaining 1267 participants were included in the primary analyses. Data on participants who died during the trial are included up until the event. The number of participants completing each assessment was 1004 (79%) of 1267 participants at 3 months, 823 (65%) of 1267 participants at 12 months, and 856 (68%) of 1267 participants at 24 months. Using Pearson's &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, there was a borderline significant association between the percentage of participants attending the 12-month appointment and intervention group (p=0&#x000b7;0475); no such association for participants completing the 24-month assessment was found (p=0&#x000b7;21). Examination of the effect of individual characteristics on attendance by intervention group showed no evidence of bias in attendance during the study (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Analyses of biochemical risk factors are based on 837 (66%) of 1267 participants who provided a blood sample at baseline.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile</p><p>*Excluded

By comparison with the 12-week programme, the 52-week programme resulted in 1786 fewer incident cases of disease and generated 1282 additional QALYs, at a cost of approximately &#x000a3;4&#x000b7;9 million per 100&#x02008;000 individuals (for further details see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 17</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="cesec110"><title>Discussion</title><p>Adults in primary care who were overweight or obese and who were referred to an open-group behavioural weight-management programme lost more weight at 12-month follow-up than those who were given brief advice and self-help materials. People who were referred to this behavioural programme for 52 weeks lost more weight than those who were referred for 12 weeks. 57% of participants referred to the 52-week programme lost more than 5% weight, compared with 42% referred to the 12-week programme and 25% of those in the brief intervention group. 5% weight loss is often used as a cut-off for clinically significant weight loss, although even smaller weight losses are associated with improvements in markers of cardiovascular disease risk.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> All groups regained some of the weight lost and at 24 months the difference in weight loss between the 12-week programme and the brief intervention was no longer significant, whereas the weight loss in the 52-week programme was significantly higher than both other groups. Participants in the 52-week programme also had larger reductions in waist circumference, fat mass, fasting glucose concentration, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> than participants in the 12-week programme and the brief intervention. When the impact of the 12-week programme was modelled over 25 years, it was cost-saving compared with the brief intervention. Although the 52-week programme was more expensive in the within-trial analysis, when the impact was modelled over 25 years, the 52-week programme resulted in the greatest gain in QALYs and the greatest reduction in disease incidence. By standards set by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, the 52-week programme is cost-effective compared with the brief intervention and the 12-week programme. This assessment of cost-effectiveness does not include potential further savings in social care and indirect health-care costs. It also uses a flat-rate cost for all participants who took up an intervention, whereas, in some payment models, full costs might not be incurred if people did not complete the course, thus potentially overestimating intervention costs.</p><p>A strength of this trial is the large patient group that is broadly generalisable to the UK population. In our previous trial,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> participants with a BMI of 27&#x02013;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were identified during routine consultations and recruited to the trial. This trial was more inclusive (BMI 28&#x02013;68 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and participants were recruited by letter based on their weight records. In the 2011 trial, the mean BMI was 31&#x000b7;4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> whereas in the present study participants had a mean BMI of 34&#x000b7;5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, which is more comparable to the population typically referred to open-group behavioural programmes in NHS referral schemes.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Invitation of all eligible patients by mail resulted in a higher proportion of men recruited than seen in routine referral schemes,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> although this percentage is still lower than the proportion of men in the UK population.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> More than half of participating practices were from areas with an index of multiple deprivation that is higher (more deprived) than the national median and participants were drawn from a wide range of socioeconomic groups.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Most participants were white, with the proportion enrolled reflecting the ethnic composition of the UK.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Intervention effects did not vary by gender or socioeconomic status.

Although uptake of the programmes by more deprived populations is somewhat lower than in less deprived areas,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> more targeted schemes, as have been implemented elsewhere,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> might reduce health inequalities.</p><p>Loss to follow-up at 1 year in our study was slightly below average for weight-loss trials,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> and there was little attrition between 1 and 2 years. Three different intention-to-treat analyses were done that each make different assumptions about missing data, as well as two sensitivity analyses. The consistency of effects shows the robustness of our findings. The pragmatic nature of the trial meant that participants in all groups were free to use other weight-loss methods during the trial. This reflects how these interventions are routinely delivered and allows direct translation of these findings to clinical practice. Only very few participants in each group used other NHS interventions or weight-loss medications, and only a small proportion of participants who were assigned to the brief intervention group went on to use a commercial weight-loss programme. A strength of this trial is the 2-year follow-up of participants, which gives important information on weight trajectories after participation in the programme ends. The modelled cost-effectiveness over 25 years is based on assumptions about weight trajectories beyond 2 years; however, we have been conservative in these assumptions, assuming all weight lost is regained within 5 years. The within-trial ICERs are strongly affected by non-significant differences between groups in health-care costs (highest in the 52-week programme and lowest in the 12-week programme). However, sensitivity analyses (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 9</xref>) provide information with which to assess the strength of these findings. Fasting status when blood was taken was self-reported and could be susceptible to reporting bias or recall bias. Reliance on participants confirming that the blood sample was taken in a fasting state is a universal concern in any free-living study and findings related to glucose were congruent with findings for HbA<sub>1c</sub>, which is not affected by fasting status. Attendance at sessions was self-reported and could be susceptible to reporting, or recall bias, or both. However, any bias in the attendance data does not affect the prespecified outcomes, which were done on an intention-to-treat basis.</p><p>The weight losses seen in this study are consistent with previous trials<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> of referrals to 12-week and 52-week commercial, open-group behavioural weight-management programmes, suggesting that our findings are robust. Estimates of the mean incremental cost per additional kg of bodyweight lost for either duration of treatment are in the range of other behavioural programmes (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 12</xref>). The reductions in fasting glucose concentration and HbA<sub>1c</sub> were not seen in our previous trial<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> of the 52-week programme, perhaps because the lower baseline BMI and stricter inclusion criteria in that study meant that participants had lower baseline values than in this study. Almost half of participants in the present trial had elevated fasting glucose concentration, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, or both at baseline. Reductions seen in participants in the 52-week programme group at 12 months (&#x02212;0&#x000b7;5 mmol/L fasting glucose and &#x02212;2&#x000b7;8 mmol/mol HbA<sub>1c</sub> [&#x02013;0&#x000b7;24% HbA<sub>1c</sub>]) are larger than those seen at the same timepoint in the intensive lifestyle intervention arm of the Diabetes Prevention Programme (DPP; approximately &#x02212;0&#x000b7;4 mmol/L fasting glucose and &#x02212;1 mmol/mol HbA<sub>1c</sub><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref>), in which participants were similar to those in the present study in baseline BMI, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and fasting glucose concentration, and had similar weight loss at 12 months, but achieved at a fraction of the cost.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Notwithstanding gradual weight regain and increase in associated risk factors observed over 15 years of follow-up, DPP achieved a 27% reduction in the cumulative incidence of diabetes in the lifestyle intervention relative to the control group.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> However, the impact of these more scalable interventions on diabetes incidence will depend on whether longer term weight trajectories are similar.</p><p>The weight-loss programme we assessed is widely available and participants in the brief intervention group were neither encouraged nor discouraged from attending other weight-loss programmes. Only one in 20 chose to do so, compared with 14 in 20 of those referred to these programmes. In the 12-week group, 19% of participants were still attending the programme 12 months later at their own cost, compared with 9% of those in the brief intervention. This finding suggests a legacy effect of the initial referral. However, this proportion of participants is lower than that of the 52-week group (42% of participants were still attending at 12 months). Because the median household income was about &#x000a3;30&#x02008;000, many people would probably have been able to afford the programme (approximately &#x000a3;5 per week) suggesting that the act of referral itself might have been the source of motivation to attend, although it is impossible to exclude the possibility that lower attendance in other groups was related to the cost. The importance of the referral is supported by qualitative data that found the general practioner referral is perceived as an implicit recommendation of the programme and the allocation of NHS resources to enable their attendance increases motivation to attend.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> These findings are supported by another trial<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> in people who were obese attending a general practitioner consultation unrelated to their weight, in which 77% who agreed to participate in the trial and were offered a referral to a weight-management programme accepted it and 40% attended the programme.</p><p>The absolute weight loss in participants who had the brief intervention also warrants consideration. Participants given 5 min of non-tailored advice and a self-help booklet lost more than 3 kg at 12 months and more than 2 kg at 24 months. Weight change in this group is higher than the average weight loss observed in a meta-analysis<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> for interventions led by generalist primary care teams, and higher than the average weight loss seen in a systematic review<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> of self-help interventions. Given the small cost of this intervention (self-help booklet and three short appointments that could be given by a nurse or health-care assistant), observational data support the implementation of this intervention as a minimal standard in primary care. However, this finding highlights the importance of including a control group when evaluating the effects of weight-loss interventions. Findings from a review<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> have shown that control groups given minimal interventions will generally lose weight over the course of a trial. The absolute weight loss of control groups was considerably heterogeneous in this review,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> which might reflect differences in study populations and trial design. Our trial illustrates this disparity between trials, showing 3&#x000b7;3 kg weight loss in the brief intervention control group, when an almost identical brief intervention resulted in less than 1 kg weight loss when used as a control group in a different population and context.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref></p><p>This trial shows that referral to this commercial open-group behavioural weight-loss programme increases weight loss relative to a brief intervention in primary care. Increasing the duration of the programme from 12 weeks to 52 weeks increases weight loss and improvements in other markers of diabetes and cardiovascular risk, most notably HBA<sub>1c</sub> and fasting glucose concentration. Economic evaluation of this trial found that although the 52-week programme requires greater initial investment, the programme is likely to be cost-effective in the long-term and health-care providers should consider a move towards extended referral schemes.</p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10a"><p><bold>This online publication has been corrected.
