One hundred and twenty patients of American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-II of both sexes, aged between 18 and 60 years undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomies were included in this prospective, randomised, double-blind study conducted between November 2012 and August 2013. Patient who were allergic to local anaesthetic and study drugs, patients with acute cholecystitis, patients with severe cardiac, pulmonary, and neurological diseases, those in whom procedure had to be converted to open cholecystectomy, in whom abdominal drain was put were excluded from the study.</p><p>All patients were transported to the operating room without premedication. On arrival to operating room, an 18-gauge intravenous (IV) catheter was inserted and 6 ml/kg/h crystalloid was infused intraoperatively monitoring of electrocardiography, non-invasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) was started and baseline values were recorded. Pre-oxygenation with 100% oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) was done for 3 min. General anaesthesia was induced with IV fentanyl 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg, propofol 2.0&#x02013;2.5 mg/kg followed by succinyl choline 2 mg/kg to facilitate orotracheal intubation. The trachea was intubated with a cuffed orotracheal tube of appropriate size, lubricated with lidocaine jelly 2%. Anaesthesia was maintained with 60% N<sub>2</sub>O in oxygen with 0.5&#x02013;1% isoflurane. Intermittent boluses of vecuronium bromide were used to achieve muscle relaxation. Minute ventilation was adjusted to maintain normocapnia (end tidal carbon-dioxide [EtCO<sub>2</sub>] between 34 and 38 mm Hg) and EtCO<sub>2</sub> was monitored. Nasogastric tube of appropriate size was inserted.</p><p>Hypotension/hypertension was defined as fall/rise in systolic blood pressure of &#x0003e;20% from the baseline values and bradycardia/tachycardia was defined as fall/rise in pulse rate of &#x0003e;20% from the baseline values. Haemodynamic fluctuations were to be managed accordingly. Patients were placed in 15-20&#x000b0; reverse Trendelenberg's position with the the left side tilt position. During laparoscopy, intra-abdominal pressure was maintained 12-14 mm Hg. The CO<sub>2</sub> was removed carefully by manual compression of the abdomen at the end of the procedure with open trocar.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated to one of the groups using table of randomisation, Group B (<italic>n</italic> = 40): Intraperitoneal bupivacaine 50 ml 0.25% +5 ml normal saline (NS), Group BT (<italic>n</italic> = 40): Intraperitoneal bupivacaine 50 ml 0.25% + tramadol 1 mg/kg (diluted in 5 ml NS) or Group BD (<italic>n</italic> = 40): Intraperitoneal bupivacaine 50 ml 0.25% + dexmedetomidine1 &#x003bc;g/kg (diluted in 5 ml NS),</p><p>Study drugs were prepared by an anaesthesiologist not involved in the study. Anaesthesiologist who observed the patient and surgeon were unaware of the study group until the end of the study. At the end of the surgery, the study solution was given intraperitoneally before removal of trocar in Trendelenberg's position, into the hepato-diaphragmatic space, on gall bladder bed and near and above hepatoduodenal ligament. The neuro-muscular blockade was antagonized with neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg and trachea was extubated. The nasogastric tube was removed, and the patient was shifted to post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU).</p><p>All patients stayed in PACU for 2 h after the end of surgery. The primary outcome variable was to compare pain (visual analogue scale [VAS]) score. The secondary outcome included time to the first request of analgesia in the post-operative period, total dose of analgesic used in 24 h period (post-operative) and any adverse/side effects.</p><p>The intensity of post-operative pain was recorded for all the patients using VAS score at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 h after surgery and over all VAS score (mean of all VAS scores). All the study patients were instructed about the use of the VAS score before induction of anesthesia (VAS score 0 - no pain, VAS score 10 - worst possible pain). Patients who reported VAS 3 or &#x0003e;3 were given diclofenac 75 mg intramuscularly as rescue analgesia. Patients were also observed for post-operative nausea and vomiting. Patients who suffered nausea or vomiting were given ondansetron 4 mg IV. Time to the first request of analgesia (considering the extubation as time 0), total dose of analgesia and adverse or side effects over 24 h postoperatively were noted.</p><p>A total sample size of 120 patients (<italic>n</italic> = 40 each for three groups) was calculated using Power and Sample size calculator (PS version 3.0.0.34), assuming 30% improvement in pain scores with &#x0221d; error of 0.05 and power of 80%. To obtain a 120 study sample size, a total of 135 patients were included; but 15 patients were excluded on the basis of exclusion criteria.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Consort diagram</label><caption><p>Patient randomisation and study design. *Out of excluded 15 patients, 11 were excluded because of associated severe co-morbid conditions while 4 were excluded during operative procedure and results of these were not included in the study so the sample size was limited to 120 patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJA-59-234-g001"/></fig><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft (MS) Office Excel Software (Microsoft Microsoft Excel, Redmond, Washington: Microsoft 2003, Computer software).

The local anaesthetic agents provide antinociception by affecting nerve membrane associated proteins and by inhibiting the release and action of prostaglandins which stimulates the nociceptors and cause inflammation.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Intraperitoneal instillation of 0.25% bupivacaine provide effective analgesia, in addition to this, we added either dexmedetomidine or tramadol to compare the antinociceptive efficacy if mixed with bupivacaine.</p><p>The antinociceptive effects of dexmedetomidine occurs at dorsal root neuron level, where it blocks the release of substance <italic>P</italic> in the nociceptive pathway and through action on inhibitory G protein, which increases the conductance through potassium channels.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Golubovic <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] assessed the analgesic effects of intraperitoneal instillation of bupivacaine and/or tramadol in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and concluded that intraperitoneal instillation of bupivacaine or tramadol or combination of both are effective method for management of pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and they significantly reduce post-operative analgesic and antiemetic medication. On the contrary, we found bupivacaine in combination with tramadol (Group BT) has significantly lower VAS score at all points of time (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and overall VAS score, and post-operative analgesia was statistically lower than with Group B.</p><p>Memis <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] studied the effects of tramadol or clonidine added to intraperitoneal bupivacaine, on post-operative pain in total abdominal hysterectomy and found that combination of tramadol or clonidine with intraperitoneal bupivacaine to be more effective than bupivacaine alone. They found no significant difference between tramadol and clonidine groups in terms of efficacy but we found dexmedetomidine to have significantly better efficacy than tramadol in combination with bupivacaine. The prominent effect of dexmedetomidine may be due to its higher efficacy in our study and higher efficacy of clonidine in the study by Memis <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>There are very few studies in the literature which examined the analgesic effects of &#x01f00;-2 agonists intraperitoneally.</p><p>Our results correlate with study done by Ahmed <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] which has shown that intraperitoneal instillation of mepiridine or dexmedetomidine in combination with bupivacaine 0.25% significantly decreases the post-operative analgesic requirements and decreased incidence of shoulder pain in patients undergoing laparoscopic gynaecological surgeries.</p><p>Time to first request of analgesia in post operative period was significantly delayed in Group BD as compared to Group B (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000).

Only 5 (12.5%) patients in Group BD suffered from shoulder pain as compared to 16 (40%) in Group BT and 28 (70%) patients in bupivacaine alone group.

the post-operative pain, which is a subjective experience and can be difficult to quantify objectively and compare when comparing various treatment options.</p><p>As there are very few studies in the past on addition of dexmedetomidine to intraperitoneal bupivacaine, further studies with different doses of dexmedetomidine, timing, concentrations of local anaesthetics and routes of administration are needed to provide maximal benefit in terms of post-operative pain relief with minimal adverse effects after laparoscopic surgeries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"
