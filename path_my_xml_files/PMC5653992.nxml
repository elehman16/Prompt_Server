This study involves a risk score for lung cancer in smokers that is roughly 50% genetic (50% clinical criteria). The risk score has been shown to be effective as a smoking cessation motivator in hospital recruited subjects (not actively seeking cessation services).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This was an RCT set in a United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) smoking cessation clinic. Smokers were identified from medical records. Subjects that wanted to participate were randomised to a test group that was administered a gene-based risk test and given a lung cancer risk score, or a control group where no risk score was performed. Each group had 8&#x000a0;weeks of weekly smoking cessation sessions involving group therapy and advice on smoking cessation pharmacotherapy and follow-up at 6&#x000a0;months. The primary endpoint was smoking cessation at 6&#x000a0;months. Secondary outcomes included ranking of the risk score and other motivators.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">67 subjects attended the smoking cessation clinic. The 6&#x000a0;months quit rates were 29.4%, (10/34; 95% CI 14.1&#x02013;44.7%) for the test group and 42.9% (12/28; 95% CI 24.6&#x02013;61.2%) for the controls. The difference is not significant. However, the quit rate for test group subjects with a &#x0201c;very high&#x0201d; risk score was 89% (8/9; 95% CI 68.4&#x02013;100%) which was significant when compared with the control group (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.023) and test group subjects with moderate risk scores had a 9.5% quit rate (2/21; 95% CI 2.7&#x02013;28.9%) which was significantly lower than for above moderate risk score 61.5% (8/13; 95% CI 35.5&#x02013;82.3; p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.03).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Only the sub-group with the highest risk score showed an increased quit rate. Controls and test group subjects with a moderate risk score were relatively unlikely to have achieved and maintained non-smoker status at 6&#x000a0;months.</p><p id="Par5">

Researchers have shown that there is a significant genetic familial component to lung cancer risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and the recent development of gene-based tests that predict the risk of lung cancer in smokers is an example of a test which may be useful in the primary care setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A research team in New Zealand has shown a correlation between a genetic test, consisting of 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one deletion mutation, and cancer risk (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix S1). When a risk score was calculated from the results of the genetic test and clinical risk factors (COPD, family history of lung cancer and age), this was an accurate predictor for the development of lung cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">They also conducted a controlled trial using this risk score for smoking cessation motivation. They recruited smokers who were recently discharged from hospital but who were not actively planning to quit smoking or enrolling in a smoking cessation programme. Follow-up was done by telephone and the lung cancer risk score was calculated and explained to test subjects using a risk graph (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). There was a 6&#x000a0;month quit rate of 20% in subjects with a moderate risk score for lung cancer, 36% for high risk score and 40% for very high risk score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. When compared with a 5% quit rate for the control group and with previous studies using telephone counselling alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the absolute figures for smoking cessation with this risk score was 20&#x02013;25% higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Individualised lung cancer risk score graph based on genome-wide association studies of smokers with cancer and a control group of smokers that had not developed lung cancer.

</p><p id="Par19">A USA hospital trial of CT screening for lung cancer in smokers and ex-smokers used the same risk score. This trial showed that subjects categorised as having a very high risk score had a 71% adherence to the CT screening protocol compared with 52% for the other two categories&#x02014;high and moderate (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). There was no evidence of demotivating effects in the moderate (lowest) risk group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There have, however, been no UK trials of this gene-based risk score. Our trial was designed to evaluate the risk score as a motivator in an NHS primary care smoking cessation clinic alongside the usual counselling and prescribing protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par20">We published our protocol and outcome measures a priori [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Subjects were recruited from a UK NHS primary care unit using computerised medical records to identify and contact smokers by post (letters signed and sent from their registered GPs). Subjects who replied stating that they wished to stop smoking by attending our clinic were randomised by the principal investigator (PI) (stratified randomisation to ensure equivalent age and gender mix) to a test group (genetic test and risk score) or control group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design and consent</title><p id="Par22">Two clinics were run in parallel at the same venue but on different weekdays for test and control groups. Information sheets were posted to all subjects that had expressed an interest in attending the clinic and at first attendance, subjects were seen individually to discuss participation and they were invited to complete a consent form. An initial assessment was carried out using the Fagerstr&#x000f6;m nicotine addiction score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and salivary cotinine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Each clinic consisted of 8 smoking cessation sessions and end of trial evaluation at 6&#x000a0;months. A buccal swab was taken for the 20 gene test on the first or second attendance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The 8&#x000a0;weekly smoking cessation sessions included group counselling and advice on smoking cessation pharmacotherapy (varenicline or a range of NRTs).</p><p id="Par23">Lung cancer susceptibility (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) was calculated using the Auckland formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]: <disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

NHS primary care smoking data is very reliably recorded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. At the time of this study (2011&#x02013;13) smoking cessation clinics were commissioned by a Surrey wide NHS body and followed national recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] which in turn followed an international consensus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

There was no monitoring of smoking cessation in the period between the 8&#x000a0;week smoking cessation session and the 6&#x000a0;month follow-up session.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p id="Par27">Questionnaires were used to evaluate outcomes and secondary endpoints at the 8&#x000a0;week session and at the 6&#x000a0;month follow up clinic session. Although both controls and test group subjects were asked to complete the questionnaires, a question about the motivational value of a&#x000a0;gene-based test would not have been relevant to the controls and was omitted from their version of the questionnaire. Participants who failed to attend at 8&#x000a0;weeks and 6&#x000a0;months were contacted by telephone to remind them to complete and forward their questionnaires. When participants found this too difficult, they were completed over the telephone with the PI. The questionnaires were designed to determine which subjects had quit smoking or cut down. They were also asked to score the motivators (10 for test group and 9 for controls) for their Influence in helping them to quit (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Appendix S2). The questions in this section were derived from, but not identical to, a previously validated questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

Mean scores were calculated; selected pairs of motivators were compared using the Wilcoxon matched pairs test.</p><p id="Par36">We also asked whether the participant would be likely to recommend a test for lung cancer risk to a friend or family member; an approach, although not without criticism, that is now used for evaluation of hospital and primary care across England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Although this question was obviously related to the gene test in the test group the question was put to the controls in terms of an unspecified hypothetical test for risk of lung cancer.

Five were completely lost to follow-up (two from the test group, three from the control group) having moved to another area.

Comparing the rating for the influence at 6&#x000a0;months of the risk score for lung cancer against each of the other motivators for the test group (the control group were not offered the genetic test and therefore not asked about its motivational value), the risk score had a significantly greater influence than smoking restrictions, current health problems, doctor&#x02019;s advice, fact sheet on tobacco risk and saliva cotinine test (Wilcoxon matched pairs test: p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.002, 0.022, 0.007, 0.019 and 0.047 respectively); the risk score was rated as a motivator equivalent to pressure from the family, cost of smoking and carbon monoxide breath test. When comparing the other motivators against each other utilising both groups of patients, general support for smoking cessation clinic sessions was significantly more influential at 6&#x000a0;months than every other motivator except cost of smoking (Wilcoxon matched pairs tests: all p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.006; more influential than cost of smoking at 10% level: p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.066). There was a statistically significant higher level of confidence about recommending &#x0201c;a test for lung cancer&#x0201d; risk to family and friends amongst subjects in the test group compared with subjects in the control group at 8&#x000a0;weeks (Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test, for friends: p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.003; for family: p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.012).

There was a generally positive response to the open ended questions asking how they felt about having had the genetic test and lung cancer risk score (test group) or how they would feel about having a test that would estimate their risk of lung cancer (control group).

</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Summary of principal findings</title><p id="Par41">This first trial of a risk score for lung cancer with genetic and clinical components in a primary care setting showed that a very high risk score encourages smoking cessation with a quit rate 46% higher than controls (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.023) but quit rates for moderate risk scores were 33.4% lower than controls. Although quit rates were identical at the end of the 8&#x000a0;weeks of smoking cessation sessions there was a higher lapse rate in the test group than controls. The study also demonstrated the feasibility of building genetic tests of this sort into an established smoking cessation service.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Comparison with the literature</title><p id="Par42">Our results contrast with the findings of Hopkins et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Their test group underwent gene-based testing and their control group did not whilst both groups were offered brief advice and a smoking cessation information pack with an NRT prescription. The gene-based testing used in both this study and our own study (multiple SNPs plus clinical data) is quite different from the gene-based approach in previous smoking cessation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, in the Hopkins study, test group subjects had a better quit rate than controls regardless of the score. Possible reasons for these differences are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par43">Their hospital recruited smokers were in the precontemplative-contemplative stage whereas this study involved people from primary care who were in the action stage of quitting. Precontemplative hospital controls, without the benefit of the risk score as a motivator, may be relatively resistant to smoking behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">Their test subjects and controls were contacted by telephone after having had only the genetic test whereas our participants attended our clinic regularly for various interventions including group counselling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The high score for &#x0201c;help from the clinic&#x0201d; as a motivator may have masked the motivational effect of the risk score.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par45">Another possible explanation for poor quit rates for subjects with moderate scores is that their relatively low scores encouraged continuation of smoking. Test subjects with moderate risk scores had a 9.5% quit rate. When this was compared with all other participants this poor quit rate was significant (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.022) which suggest that their relatively low risk score may have reassured them that it was safe to carry on smoking or encouraged them to lapse during the 6&#x000a0;month period between the 8&#x000a0;weekly smoking cessation sessions and the 6&#x000a0;month follow-up session.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par46">This trial of partly genetic risk score as a smoking cessation motivator was the first to investigate a role in primary care. Only 7% of smokers expressed an interest in our smoking cessation clinic (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) which is a fairly typical response rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, this poor recruitment means that the study is underpowered to answer some basic questions such as whether a moderate risk score reassures smokers and encourages them to continue smoking or whether a very high risk score can reliably yield such an impressive quit rate. Further research is urgently needed to clarify the significance of these findings.</p><p id="Par47">Had we administered the Fagerstr&#x000f6;m score questionnaire before randomisation, we could have included this value in randomisation to eliminate the level of nicotine addiction as a confounding factor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par48">Since this study is underpowered, a larger multi-centre trial would help to clarify the risk score&#x02019;s motivational value for all risk categories. However, the results suggest that this genetic test and risk estimation is acceptable to most smokers but may be more helpful to higher risk people. The risk score might be especially appropriate as a motivator for patients diagnosed with early COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
