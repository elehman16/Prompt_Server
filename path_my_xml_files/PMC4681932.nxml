with electromyogram-triggered electrical stimulation on neglect and activities of daily
living in stroke patients with unilateral neglect. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-three
stroke patients with unilateral neglect were recruited from a local university hospital,
and were divided into two groups. The experimental group received an intervention
consisting of mental practice combined with electromyogram-triggered electrical
stimulation on the neglected side, while the control group received cyclic electrical
stimulation at the same site. In addition, both groups received an identical intervention
of conventional occupational and physical therapy. [Results] After the intervention, the
experimental group showed a statistically significant improvement in the line bisection
test result, star cancellation test result, and Catherine Bergego Scale scores. The
control group showed a significant improvement only in the line bisection test result.
[Conclusion] These data suggest that mental practice combined with
electromyogram-triggered electrical stimulation is an effective, novel treatment for
reducing unilateral neglect in stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Electromyogram-triggered electrical stimulation</kwd><kwd>Mental practice</kwd><kwd>Unilateral neglect</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Unilateral neglect (UN) refers to the neuropsychological condition in which patients
experience reduced orientation and concentration and response to stimuli on the
contralesional side owing to behavioral problems that occur after brain injury, although
these patients having sensorimotor abilities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. UN is caused by various forms of brain damage and has an especially
high incidence in patients with stroke in the right inferior parietal lobe<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>UN has important implications in the rehabilitation of patients with brain damage. It is
negatively associated with the rehabilitation period because patients with UN show
relatively poor functional recovery compared with those without UN<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, these patients experience difficulties in
activities of daily living (ADL), including maintaining personal hygiene, eating, and
dressing, and also are at increased risk of falling because of gait disturbance<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, having an appropriate treatment
and strategy are important while treating this condition because it is essential to reduce
UN to achieve effective rehabilitation in these patients.</p><p>We proposed a new treatment method for UN by modifying current treatment methods and
combining them with mental practice and electromyogram-triggered electrical stimulation
(MP-EMG ES). MP-EMG ES is a new, state-of-the-art rehabilitation treatment technology based
on neurologic theories. MP-EMG ES involves only repetitive mental practice (for example,
imagination of intense movement of the upper limbs on the neglected side), not voluntary
muscular contraction. When the generated electric potential reaches a preset threshold, an
electric stimulus is generated, resulting in actual muscular contraction and cortical
activation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In other words, MP-EMG ES
can produce a synergistic effect by combining two treatments (mental practice plus
electrical stimulation) with proven efficacy in the alleviation of neglect. The purpose of
this study was to identify the effects of this novel training method&#x02014;MP combined with EMG
ES&#x02014;over a 6-week period of daily training in patients showing right brain damage with
UN.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The participants for this study were recruited from the rehabilitation center of a local
university hospital. The inclusion criteria for participation were: (1) onset duration of
<italic>&#x0003e;</italic>6 months, (2) right hemisphere stroke with UN, (3) mini-mental status
examination score <italic>&#x0003e;</italic>24, (4) ability to imagine (average score on the
vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire &#x0003c;3), and (5) active wrist muscle strength
&#x0003e;2 on the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. Exclusion criteria were: (1) an implanted
cardiac pacemaker, (2) skin lesion on the affected side or hypersensitivity at the electrode
site, (3) a history of seizure or epilepsy, and (4) unstable medical conditions. In total,
thirty-three stroke patients with neglect were eligible for this study. All participants
provided written informed consent, and this study was approved by the Inje University
Institution Review Board.</p><p>This study was designed as a single-blind randomized control study and was scheduled to
last for a total 6 weeks. Eligible participants were randomly allocated to the two groups by
block randomization using opaque envelopes containing a code specifying the group. The
experimental group (n=16) received MP-EMG ES in addition to conventional rehabilitation
therapy (CRT: physical therapy and occupational therapy), whereas the control group (n=17)
received cyclic ES in addition to the same CRT. Mentamove (Mentamove Deutschland GmbH,
Munich, Germany) was used to apply MP-EMG ES in the experimental group. Surface electrodes
were attached to the wrist extensor muscle and a reference electrode was attached at the
lateral side of the forearm. The site of electrode placement was marked using a permanent
marker throughout the intervention. During motor imagery training, electrical potentials
were generated in the affected arm and were recorded using EMG. When the potentials reached
a preset threshold, the induced electrical stimulation would contract the targeted
muscle.</p><p>The Mentamove process consisted of three stages: (1) motor imagery (approximately 12&#x02005;s),
(2) electrical stimulation (approximately 6&#x02005;s), and (3) relaxation (approximately 12&#x02005;s). The
motor imagery used in this study was a vigorous waving of the affected whole arm. This
imagery was selected because the EMG was not able to detect electrical stimulation induced
by motor imagery of simple extension of the wrist or elbow. The EMG pick-up threshold was
set afresh for each subject in every session. If the subject repeatedly reached the
threshold during the MP-EMGES, the threshold was automatically increased slightly. The
instructions were as follows: First, relax in a comfortable position. Imagine that your left
arm moves rapidly and intensely when you see &#x0201c;motor imagery&#x0201d; in the tool window. If your
performance is successful, you will experience an electrical stimulation in your forearm. If
your performance fails, maintain the relaxed state.</p><p>Cyclic ES (Mendel GmbH, Germany) without the EMG function was used to apply electrical
stimulation in the control group. Electrodes also were attached to the wrist extensor
muscle. In either instrument, biphasic pulses with a frequency of 35&#x02005;Hz and pulse width of
200 &#x000b5;S were applied for 12 s. Stimulation intensity led to a clear extension of the wrist
(average 20&#x02013;30 mA). Over a period of 6 weeks, both groups were treated 30 times in two
30-min sessions.</p><p>The line bisection test (LBT), star cancellation test (SCT), and Catherine Bergego Scale
(CBS) were used to quantify the severity of UN. The LBT was performed using Schenkenberg&#x02019;s
method<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Twenty lines were drawn on an
A4 sheet parallel to the long axis, and 18 of these lines were organized into 3 set of 6: 1
set lay primarily on the left, 1 at the center, and 1 on the right side of the sheet. The
evaluator initially demonstrated the procedure by marking the 2,150-mm lines at the top and
bottom of the sheet. Patients were asked to mark the center points of each of the 18 lines
in order. Distances from the left of each line to patient&#x02019;s marks and to true line centers
were measured. Deviations were measured using the formula: Percent deviation (%) = [(Marked
left side distance-True half length)/True half length] &#x000d7; 100.</p><p>In SCT, 56 stars and other symbols were presented on an A4 sheet. The left and right halves
of the sheet each contained 27 stars, and patients were asked to mark all of the stars. The
scores range from 0 to 27, with lower scores indicating more severe UN. Assessment using CBS
involved evaluating the performance of patients by directly observing them perform
activities (e.g., dressing, grooming) in real-life situations, and consisted of 10 items.
Each item was scored on a four-point scale as follows: 0: no neglect 1&#x02013;10: mild neglect,
11&#x02013;20: moderate neglect, and 21&#x02013;30: severe neglect<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Participant characteristics were analyzed using a statistical software program (SPSS
Statistics 20) and descriptive statistics were presented as mean &#x000b1; SD. The Shapiro-Wilk test
was used to check normality of the outcome variables. To evaluate the intervention effects,
measures before and after the intervention in each group were compared using a paired
t-test. An independent t-test was used to compare changes in outcome measures between the
two groups. Statistical significance was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>All demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants were comparable and are

through mental practice, rather than through actual physical movements, and this method is
used to induce muscle contraction in the upper extremity (U/E) on the neglected side. In
other words, the aim of MP-EMG ES is to form sensorimotor circuits for movement through a
repeated cycle of brain signal &#x02192; transmission &#x02192; muscle movement, which can be used to
produce functional changes in the central nervous system and the body. The continual
activation of these circuits helps reorganize the damaged areas of the cerebral cortex<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is thought that MP-EMG ES works by
inducing neural and peripheral changes through activation of the cerebral cortex via mental
practice and afferent stimulation of the neglected U/E via electrical stimulation.</p><p>Hong et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> reported MP-EMG ES is more
effective than cyclic ES for improving motor function on the affected side and improves
cerebral glucose metabolism in supplementary motor, precentral and postcentral gyri on the
contralesional side. However, there is little evidence about the effects of this treatment
in cases of UN. In this study, we investigated the effects of MP-EMG ES on neglect in
comparison with those of cyclic ES. CBS, LBT and SCT scores significantly improved after
treatment in the experimental group. The control group received various CRT interventions
that were the same as the experimental group. This control treatment was important because
Cyclic ES has been proven to alleviate neglect to some extent by applying afferent
stimulation to the neglected side. Therefore, while the control group only showed a
significant improvement in LBT, they also showed a slight improvement in scores for CBS and
SCT, and as a result, no significant differences were demonstrated between the two groups in
any assessments.</p><p>The effect of MP-EMG ES is considered synergistic with mental practice. Some studies
reported that mental practice is effective for rehabilitation in patients with
contralesional neglect, but it is difficult to verify whether patients imagine the specific
movement well<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. MP-EMG ES seems to remedy
the deficiencies of mental practice alone.</p><p>In this study, patients were instructed to imagine a large and powerful movement of the
neglected U/E during the mental practice stage of MP-EMG ES treatment. When imagining the
movement of the neglected U/E, the muscles in the U/E show dynamic regulation and
changes<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this regard, when a
participant imagined a complex and powerful movement instead of a simple movement, the
motor-evoked potential and the excitation in the corticospinal tract increased<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study showed that MP-EMG ES is an effective method for reducing unilateral neglect in
stroke patients. However, several factors need to be considered when applying this method.
Because MP-EMG ES requires the patient to be capable of imaging movement of the body on the
neglect side, there are limitations in applying this method to patients with severe neglect.
Active cooperation and good cognitive function also are required.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Jehkonen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Laihosalo</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Kettunen</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Impact of neglect on functional outcome after stroke: a
