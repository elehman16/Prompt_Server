To determine the sample size, the formula of comparison of the mean was used. Sampling was done in several stages. The names of the five main medical-health centers were written on a paper and each was put in an envelope, and then an envelope was randomly selected. Thus, among the five medical-health centers in Mashhad, center No. 1 was randomly selected.</p><p>Then, from medical-health center No. 1, nine covered centers were selected by lottery and the required sample size was determined according to the number of referrals for receiving postpartum care and vaccination in each center. Easy sampling was performed among nulliparous women who referred to health centers 8 weeks after child birth to receive health care services. After selecting the participants, they were randomly assigned to either intervention or control group.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were: Being nulliparous, Iranians living in Mashhad, having the ability to read and write, living with husband, beginning the sexual activity after delivery, having passed 8 weeks of vaginal delivery, having a healthy baby, no postpartum complications, lack of special medical disease, lack of psychological disorder in couples, non-addictive couples, not using alcohol or drugs affecting sexual function, no uterine prolapse or cystocele or rectocele grade 3 and 4, and not having undergone stressful event during a month ago. Exclusion criteria included being pregnant during the study, doing regular exercises during the study, and not regularly performing Kegel exercise program based on the method proposed in the study.</p><p>After obtaining informed consent, the intervention group was given face-to-face training about the anatomy and function of the pelvic floor muscles and how to do Kegel exercises. A pamphlet and an audio CD about how to do Kegel exercises were presented to this group.</p><p>Pelvic floor muscle strength was measured with Brink scale. This scale is a four-degree (1, 2, 3, 4) tool which is measured based on three criteria: Pressure, moving the fingers in the horizontal plane, and time. The minimum score is 3 and the maximum score is 12. If after the intervention, the scores obtained by this criterion are increased, it shows an increase in pelvic floor muscle strength. To determine the strength of the pelvic floor muscles by Brink scale, the sample was asked to lie down on the bed in supine position with knees bent and focus on the perineal area and completely relax the perineal area. Then two fingers were put inside the vagina, and she was asked to contract her pelvic floor muscles just like when she holds the urine and she had to try to pull the researcher's finger upward and inward.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>In the intervention group, after identifying these muscles, the subjects were asked to contract the pelvic floor muscles during examination of the vagina, and then after ensuring proper contraction of the muscle, they were asked to do these exercises twice daily, each time 15&#x02013;20 times depending on their ability to contract their pelvic floor muscles for 5&#x02013;10 s and relax for 5&#x02013;10 s and repeating this exercise for 20 times (for 5 min). After 2 min of rest, they again had to perform this exercise for 3 times of 5 min. so that a total of 20 minutes of exercise is performed at each time.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>Checklist includes the duration of exercise per day and performing exercise according to training program. It were taken from subjects at the end every 4 weeks. The researcher performed the follow-up of the subjects by telephone every 2 weeks in order to find out if they were regularly performing the exercises and had other problems. Pelvic floor muscle strength and sexual self-efficacy were examined again at weeks 12 and 16 after delivery and then the results were compared [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of participants of the study pelvic floor muscle training and control groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-20-347-g001"/></fig><p>Data collection tool in this study included an interview form consisting of four sections: Personal-familial information, marital and sexual relationships, pregnancy and infant, and Brink scale; and Bailes sexual self-efficacy questionnaire (1989) which consists of eight dimensions (desire, sensuality, arousal, orgasm, emotion, communication, body acceptance, and rejection). If the subject is able to do the activity, her confidence is determined to be in the range of 10 (very uncertain) to 100 (absolutely certain), and if she is not able to perform that, the column is left blank and in this case, zero score is given.

Kegel exercise strengthens levator ani muscle through muscular hypertrophy and stronger levator ani muscle improves support and reduces the burden imposed on the ligament.

It seems that the disagreement with the results of this study could be due to differences in measuring the strength of pelvic floor muscles and the study population (nulliparous and multiparous women, vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery). In the present study, control group also received postpartum care instructions that included Kegel exercises and 50% of them reported that they performed these exercises once or twice a week.

Postpartum period is followed by factors such as fatigue, anxiety from changes in life, and care of the newborn baby. These factors have a negative impact on women's sexual life.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Over time, these concerns had diminished and the mother is also more compatible with the existing status, it would be justification for the increase in sexual self-efficacy found in the control group.</p><p>Given that pregnancy and childbirth are the predisposing factors for weakening of the pelvic floor muscles and Kegel exercise is the best way to strengthen pelvic floor muscles,[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] it is recommended that due to the positive effect of pelvic floor strengthening exercises on the women's sexual self-efficacy, Kegel exercises should be considered as clinical and counseling services by midwives in postpartum care.</p><p>One of the limitations of this study is that the study was performed in a particular community (nulliparous women with vaginal delivery), which reduces the generalization of the study to a larger community.
