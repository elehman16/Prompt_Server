elderly, with respect to the effects on walking ability during direction change and on
falls efficacy. [Subjects] In total, 40 subjects were selected for this study and assigned
randomly to either a complex exercise (n = 20) or a general exercise (n = 20) group.
[Methods] The complex exercise consisted of resistance and aerobic exercises. The exercise
program was conducted three times a week for eight weeks. We assessed outcome measures of
the four square step test, the figure-of-8 walk test, and the falls efficacy scale.
[Results] After the intervention, the four step square test, figure-of-8 walk test, and
falls efficacy scale values increased significantly in both the complex exercise program
and general exercise groups. The complex exercise group showed a more significant
improvement than the general exercise group in the figure-of-8 walk test step and falls
efficacy scale scores. [Conclusion] Complex exercise improved walking ability during
direction change and falls efficacy in elderly individuals.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Complex exercise</kwd><kwd>Falls efficacy</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Walking is a factor that can predict a fall<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Successful walking is affected by the integration of complex
cognition and neuromuscular, sensory, and skeletal factors, which can degenerate with
disease and aging<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Age- related walking
changes begin during a person&#x02019;s 60s and 70s. Elderly walking is characterized by reduced
velocity and increased basal plane. In particular, elderly persons have difficulty changing
directions<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, resulting in a high fall
risk.</p><p>Statistical reports have shown that one in three persons over the age of 65 experience a
fall annually<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Elderly persons who have
fallen can worry about falling again and develop a phobia of falling, which leads to
anxiety. The falling phobia results in reduced mobility, which limits a person&#x02019;s activities
and further increases the risk of falling, thus creating a vicious cycle<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Increased balance, improved cardiovascular function, and good flexibility achieved through
regular exercise are effective management strategies in reducing the risk of falling in
elderly individuals<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. To improve their physical condition, elderly individuals have
participated in various interventions, such as resistance exercises using elastic bands<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, muscle strength exercises using
equipment<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and tai chi exercises<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, because they had to perform
monotonous motions repeatedly, they lost interest easily, which resulted in low
participation. It has also been reported that the limitations of locations, tools, and
equipment required for exercising are some of the drawbacks of this approach<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Thus, it is necessary to provide an interesting, efficient complex exercise program that
can be performed anywhere, and that maintains a high level of motivation in the
participants. As such, the aim of this study was to conduct a complex exercise program for
the elderly, and determine the effects of the program on walking ability during direction
change and on falls efficacy. The study also aimed to determine the applicability of this
program to other complex exercise programs, and assess the improvements in the mobility of
the elderly based on the effects of the program.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In total, 40 subjects who attended the Welfare Center in Gwangju city were selected for
this study and assigned randomly to two groups: the complex exercise group (n = 20), which
participated in a complex exercise program, and the general exercise group (n = 20), which
did not participate in the complex exercise program. This study was approved by the
hospital, and all participants provided their written informed consent. The complex exercise
group consisted of twelve men and eight women (average age, 68.81&#x000b1;3.48&#x02005;years; average
height, 158.00&#x000b1;5.19&#x02005;cm; average weight, 58.94&#x000b1;11.36&#x02005;kg), and the general exercise group
consisted of seven men and 13 women (average age, 71.50&#x000b1;5.54&#x02005;years; average height,
160.07&#x000b1;7.14&#x02005;cm; average weight, 62.64&#x000b1;12.12&#x02005;kg).</p><p>The selection criteria were as follows: a minimum of 24 points on the Korean Mini-Mental
State Examination (K-MMSE), no medication due to mental illness, no orthopedic disease in
the lower limbs, the ability to walk 10 meters or more independently, and the ability to
understand the study objective and provide voluntary consent.</p><p>The complex exercise program consisted of resistance and aerobic exercises. An exercise
using a weight was conducted to improve muscle strength. A bridge exercise, arm and leg
stretching in the prone position, the cat pose, and full-body stretching were performed to
strengthen the trunk and increase flexibility. Aerobic exercise was achieved by setting the
intensity level at 60&#x02013;70% of the participants&#x02019; heart rate reserve, and walking training was
conducted according to the participants&#x02019; individual capabilities. Full-body stretching and
walking in place were performed for 5 minutes each as warm-up and cool-down exercises,
respectively. The main exercises were performed for 30 minutes, including two 5-minutes rest
periods, for a total of 50 minutes. The exercise program was conducted three times a week
for eight weeks.</p><p>The four square step test (FSST) is a tool that evaluates complex walking ability. Subjects
step over four bars placed on the ground orthogonally in the shape of a plus sign &#x0201c;+&#x0201d;; the
height and length of which were 2.5&#x02005;cm and 90&#x02005;cm, respectively<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subject starts by walking over a bar from &#x0201c;zone 1,&#x0201d;
one of the quadrants formed by the plus sign, and continues walking over the bars, one by
one, in a clockwise direction, until he/she arrives back in the starting quadrant. Then, the
exercise is repeated in the counterclockwise direction. During the test, if the subject
touches a bar, loses his/her balance, or fails to put both feet in the same quadrant, the
exercise is re-started. A mean value of three measurements is determined.</p><p>The figure-of-8 walk test (F8WT) measures walking skills in elderly persons with mobility
impairments. It was developed to assess curved walking abilities in daily living, which
cannot be measured by straight-line walking tests<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subject walks a &#x0201c;figure 8&#x0201d; pattern around cones, and the time
and number of steps needed to complete the exercise are recorded. In this study, the
inter-rater reliability time was 0.90 and the step count was 0.92, while intra-rater
reliability time was 0.84 and the step count was 0.82<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Falls Efficacy Scale (FES) is a self-administered questionnaire designed to determine
the degree of self-confidence regarding falling; it represents fears experienced while
conducting ten activities required for daily living<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The measurement data obtained with these tests were analyzed using SPSS version 17.0 for
Windows. A paired t-test was conducted to determine within-group differences in the results
before and after the experiment, and an independent t-test was conducted to determine
between-group differences in the results before and after the experiment. The statistical
significance level was set to &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results before and after the intervention are presented in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The within-group and between-group comparisons of the outcome measures</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="center" colspan="1"/><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Complex exercise group (n=20)</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">General exercise group (n=20)</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-test</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-test</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-test</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-test</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FSST (sec)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.8 (8.4)<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.6 (5.9)<sup>**&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.0 (7.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.9 (6.5)<sup>**</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">F8WT (sec)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.9 (5.7)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.8 (3.9)<sup>**</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.3 (5.9)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.9 (4.6)<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">F8WT (steps)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.4 (6.8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.1 (5.8)<sup>**&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.9 (6.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.6 (6.0)<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FES</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">81.4 (8.5)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">94.7 (6.2)<sup>**&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">82.7 (8.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">89.7 (5.3)<sup>**</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup> Means (SD). <sup>*</sup>Significant difference within group (p&#x0003c;0.05);

resulting in improved walking ability during direction change and in falls efficacy.</p><p>The FSST is a test that measures the ability to change direction while lifting a foot.
There was a significant difference in the FSST scores between groups. This result indicates
that the complex exercise group improved their direction change ability by improving their
balance through regular exercise incorporating various movements. This finding is consistent
with the results of another study, in which patients with chronic stroke participating in
functional exercises incorporating various positions showed improved FSST scores, along with
a speed moment more reduced than that of the general exercise group. Our results also
support the study results of Song et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, who reported walking ability improvements through muscular
strengthening and flexibility exercises.</p><p>The F8WT (time and step count) was conducted to determine the between-group differences in
the walking abilities of the elderly participants before and after the experiment, and the
results showed a significant difference in the F8WT step count, but not in the F8WT time.
The F8WT (time and step count), which was conducted to determine the curve walking abilities
of the elderly, showed a significant difference in the F8WT step count, which indicated that
the complex exercise group took fewer steps and had a longer stride when passing over two
barriers in the curved lane than the general exercise group.</p><p>This result was due to improvements in the balance of the complex exercise group when
navigating a curved line, thereby requiring fewer steps. It has been reported that superior
balance requires fewer steps and lengthens the stride required to maintain balance when
walking around a curved line<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
experiments that compared straight walking and curved walking abilities, the differences
between the two types of walking were greater in a group of patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s
disease than in healthy subjects. In particular, the patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease
exhibited a smaller step width and stride length<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The lack of significant difference between the two groups in the time taken to complete the
F8WT indicates that there was no significant difference in the time required to navigate a
curved path. The F8WT specifies a gap between barriers of 1.5 meters and a width of 1.2
meters. When the elderly subjects passed over the barriers, they chose a long stride to pass
over the barrier safely; thus, there was no significant difference between the two
groups.</p><p>Will and motivation are important to changes in falls efficacy. Both groups experienced a
positive psychological effect with respect to falling due to the regular exercises. A fear
of falling can reduce flexibility and cause balance problems<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance improved and fear of falling decreased due to the effects
of the exercise program, thus improving falls efficacy. It has been reported that increased
muscle strength improves balance, which increases safety in performing daily living
activities<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, increased
lower extremity muscle strength has been found to correlate significantly with increased
walking speed and falls efficacy<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, a complex exercise program improved walking ability during direction change
and falls efficacy in elderly individuals. In future research, the difference between the
effects of various exercises and the complex exercise will be investigated. In addition,
further studies comparing the effects of this complex exercise program on elderly patients
suffering from a variety of diseases will be needed in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by research funds provided from the Howon University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lamoth</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name><name><surname>van Deudekom</surname><given-names>FJ</given-names></name><name><surname>van Campen</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Gait stability and variability measures show effects of
