It can lead to gynecological problems such as irregular menstruation, miscarriage, and infertility. Traditionally, Korean herbal medicine has been the primary treatment method used to balance thermoregulation in the human body; however, its effectiveness has not been confirmed through systematic study. Thus, in this trial, we will investigate the feasibility of a full randomized clinical trial, <italic>Danggui-Sayuk-Ga-Osuyu-Saenggang-tang</italic> (DSGOST) in Korean women with CHH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study will be a pilot, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, two-arm, placebo-controlled clinical trial. A total of 66 participants will be randomly divided into two groups, a DSGOST treatment group and a placebo control group, in a 1:1 ratio using a web-based randomization system. Each group will take DSGOST or placebo three times daily for 6&#x000a0;weeks. The primary outcome will be measured using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores of CHH. Secondary outcomes will include changes in skin temperature of the hands, Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale scores, recovery rate of skin temperature of the hands after the cold stress test, and the Korean version of the WHO Quality of Life Scale, abbreviated version (WHOQOL-BREF).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial will be the first trial to reflect the newly defined disease range of CHH which was compiled by Korean medicine expert consensus. This study will provide considerable evidence for further large-scale trials and general clinical guidelines for CHH in the Korean medical field.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02645916">NCT02645916</ext-link>.

CHH is not a fatal disease, but can worsen quality of life by interfering with daily activities. According to a Korean genetic etiology and phenotype of CHH study, there are more female CHH sufferers than males with an approximate prevalence ratio of 3:2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Through reviewing previous CHH-related studies, we found out that studies based on the Asian population were more frequently performed than in the western population. Among the studies, Li et al. reported that the prevalence rates of women with CHH by country are 54.3% in Japan, 25% in Korea, and 20% in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>In conventional medicine, CHH is the representative clinical symptom of Raynaud&#x02019;s phenomenon (RP) which is classified in the <italic>International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition</italic> (ICD-9) as a peripheral vascular disease. It is thought that an increase in &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> sympathetic receptor activity causes the vasoconstriction of blood vessels and central thermoregulatory dysfunction in CHH, but its pathophysiological mechanism is not completely clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Due to the uncertain pathology and nonstandardized diagnostic and treatment methods of CHH, most conventional physicians prefer to identify CHH by the occurrence of symptoms during the cold stimulation test which is one of the primary diagnostic tests for RP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The general treatment of RP is similar to the allopathic treatments of RP, including vitamin E, calcium-channel blockers, and lifestyle modification, but the efficacy of such treatments is controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>In Korea, treating CHH with traditional Korean herbal medicine is often preferred to conventional medicine. Because Korean medicine takes a holistic approach to the ailment, it is considered to be a cold-related symptom and is also classified as cold syndrome pattern. Balancing <italic>yin</italic> and <italic>yang</italic> energy in the body with holistic and personalized therapy is one of the advantages of Korean medicine which is more acceptable in Korean society other than symptom-based treatments.</p><p>Based on traditional medicine theory, women&#x02019;s disease is generally caused by cold pathogenic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] which can easily lead to cold-related syndromes such as CHH. Many people consider CHH to be a mild symptom, but it should be treated with careful attention before it worsens and leads to more severe problems.</p><p>
<italic>Danggui-Sayuk-Ga-Osuyu-Saenggang-tang</italic> (DSGOST) is the one representative traditional Korean herbal medicine formula used to treat CHH since ancient times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) classic, <italic>Shanghanlun</italic> mentions that DSGOST is the appropriate prescription for patients who have had pathogenic internal cold for a long time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is composed mainly of herbs that can disperse cold and tonify the blood in order to enhance the healing capacity of the body system from cold damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Nishida et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] found that DSGOST treatment for 8&#x000a0;weeks helped to improve the severity of peripheral coldness and blood flow in female Japanese patients. In our research team, we also found that DSGOST relaxes both the endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells by inhibiting cold-induced activation of the Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) and blocks the endothelin-1-mediated paracrine pathway for the cold response in blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although it has a long history of use for CHH, there has been no clinical trial performed to evaluate the potential efficacy of DSGOST in the Korean population. For that reason, through this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with participant and investigator blinding, we will examine the feasibility of a full randomized clinical trial of DSGOST on Korean female patients with CHH in order to provide more convincing evidence for the treatment of CHH using herbal medicine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>This trial is a pilot, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, two-arm, placebo-controlled clinical trial that will be conducted in the Department of Internal Medicine at Gachon University, Gil Oriental Medical Hospital, Dongguk University, Ilsan Oriental Hospital, Sangji University Oriental Medical Centre, Semyung University Second Affiliated Oriental Medical Hospital at Chungju, and the Department of Gynecology, Kyung Hee University Oriental Medical Center, Kyung Hee University Oriental Medicine Hospital at Gangdong in Korea.</p><p>We will recruit 66 participants in total. Once the participant decides to take part in this trial, there will be at least a 2-week run-in period prior to randomization. After randomization, each participant will be treated for 6&#x000a0;weeks and visit the clinic once every 2&#x000a0;weeks. The total trial duration will be 8&#x000a0;weeks.

Assignment will be done with the web-based randomization system developed by the contract research organization (CRO), the Institute of Safety and Effectiveness Evaluation for Korean Medicine (ISEE). The random sequence will be generated by an independent professional statistician from the CRO using the SAS 6.1 program and stratified by hospital using random block sizes of 2 and 4.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Blinding</title><p>Once the participant is randomly allocated to a group, neither the investigator nor the participant will know which type of the drug the participant receives until the end of the trial. The trial drugs will be manufactured in packages that are indistinguishable in appearance and then distributed by independent research pharmacists or assistants who are also blinded to the randomization, in each hospital. When voluntary withdrawals or urgent medical situations, such as severe adverse events (SAEs), are encountered, the principal researcher of the hospital will inform the sponsor and the CRO immediately to handle unblinding according to standard operating procedures (SOPs).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>This study will enroll a total of 66 patients who have a complaint of CHH and who are eligible according to the following criteria:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Female subjects aged 19 to 59&#x000a0;years who have a complaint of CHH.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients must have at least one of the following symptoms:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Symptoms of CHH at a temperature at which most individuals feel no cold</p></list-item><list-item><p>Symptoms of extremely cold hands upon cold temperature exposure</p></list-item><list-item><p>Those who, upon return to a warmer environment, continue to have symptoms of cold hands</p></list-item></list>

In conventional medicine (CM), CHH is categorized as an associated symptom of vascular diseases such as RP and hand-arm vibration syndrome. In contrast, traditional Korean medicine (TKM) defines CHH as a disease entity in itself which is a key factor for the final diagnosis of cold syndrome pattern. According to one Japanese survey, approximately 60% of the Japanese population suffer from cold syndrome, especially extremity coldness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Facing health care issues, the Japanese government approved insurance coverage of <italic>Kampo</italic> treatment for CHH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, even though there have been increasing numbers of people experiencing CHH in Korea, policymakers have not yet allowed for broader TKM health insurance coverage or better development of a TKM welfare program.</p><p>In designing this trial, we reviewed previous studies by searching various databases (EMBASE, PubMed, CNKI, Oasis). We found several studies on CHH in the traditional medicine field, but its diagnostic criteria and terminology were varied. In addition, most of the studies focused on the occurrence of symptoms upon exposure to cold temperatures.</p><p>To determine new diagnostic criteria for CHH in TKM, we organized an Advisory Committee of Experts (ACE) consisting of 10 medical experts, each with more than 10&#x000a0;years of clinical experience, as well as experience treating CHH. The Delphi survey method was used for making accurate decisions. As a result, the collated determination of the ACE was that most Korean women with CHH complain of coldness in the hands at room temperature as well as from cold temperature exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Thus, the ACE considered expanding the range of diagnostic criteria to include patients with symptom occurrence both at room temperature and at cold temperatures. Thus, it will be significant to perform a clinical trial using a broader perspective of CHH in TKM. It will also help to define the characteristics of CHH in the Korean population.</p><p>Although a few previous studies used infrared thermography to measure the skin temperature with scientific accuracy, this may not reflect the severity of patients&#x02019; actual self-report of discomfort due to the limitation of objective measurement. In this exploratory trial, we instead decided to use a VAS score as the primary outcome measure for the severity of CHH changes between baseline (visit 2) and after treatment (visit 5).</p><p>In this trial, the CST will be applied to evaluate functional recovery after cold stress in patients with CHH. It is a well-known test for diagnosing RP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and hand-arm vibration syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and has a high sensitivity and specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, the CST procedure is not yet standardized. In general, earlier studies used a varied temperature from 0&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C to 15&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and an immersion time from 1 to 20&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In this trial, the ACE recommended a water temperature of 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and an immersion time of 1&#x000a0;min in order to minimize uncomfortable pain. This was based upon the clinical experience of ACE members and the results of previous validation tests.</p><p>There are a few limitations in this trial. Firstly, due to the relationship between cold environment and target disease, the results of this study might be affected by environmental temperature. However, we try to select well-performing study sites by feasibility assessment of equipment and facilities required to successfully conduct the trial such as the availability of room with well-controlled temperature, for reducing any potential bias. We also consider the differences of daily temperature between cities in Korea, so we will recruit the participants at six hospitals in five different regions of Korea to explore the characteristics of CHH differences within the Korean peninsula. Secondly, due to the small research grant for the pilot study, we will not be able to completely exclude the presence of RP. However, an ANA test will be performed to rule out any autoimmune disorders, instead of a primary test for RP.</p><p>Our team plans to conduct further large-scale clinical trials using several Korean medicine extracts for CHH in the near future. The results of this study will provide valuable information, such as methodological problems, specified outcome variables, regional characteristics of CHH, and statistical power for sample size calculation, for future large-scale trials. Furthermore, it will provide supporting evidence for the future development of general clinical guidelines for CHH in the Korean medicine field.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment is ongoing from December 2015.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec28"><title>Additional file</title><p>
