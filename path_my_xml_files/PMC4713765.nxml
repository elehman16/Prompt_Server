wave therapy on frozen shoulder patients&#x02019; pain and functions. [Subjects] In the present
study, 30 frozen shoulder patients were divided into two groups: an extracorporeal shock
wave therapy group of 15 patients and a conservative physical therapy group of 15
patients. [Methods] Two times per week for six weeks, the extracorporeal shock wave
therapy group underwent extracorporeal shock wave therapy, and the conservative physical
therapy group underwent general physical therapy. Visual analog scales were used to
measure frozen shoulder patients&#x02019; pain, and patient-specific functional scales were used
to evaluate the degree of functional disorders. [Results] In intra-group comparisons, the
two groups showed significant decreases in terms of visual analog scales and
patient-specific functional scales, although the extracorporeal shock wave therapy group
showed significantly lower scores than the conservative physical therapy group.
[Conclusion] Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is considered an effective intervention for
improving frozen shoulder patients&#x02019; pain and functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Extracorporeal shock wave therapy</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>Function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Frozen shoulder is a disease that causes joint synovial membranes to thicken and adhere to
articular surfaces, leading to gradually intensifying pain and gradual decreases in joints&#x02019;
range of motion. Although frozen shoulder does not cause neurogenic muscle weakness such as
cervical radiculopathy per se, it results in flexion and reduced external rotation of the
shoulder joint due to pain, reduces flexibility and elasticity, and makes performing
everyday activities difficult due to the chronic inflammation and joint fibrosis that
accompany it<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the factors that
induce frozen shoulder, continued immobility is the most commonly known. Other factors
include age, diabetes, thyroid diseases, humeral lesions, and personality disorders<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. No accurate cause has been determined,
although it has been reported that aging leads to insufficient blood supply to tendons and
articular capsules, which results in reduced nutrition supply to articular capsule and
tendon tissues and causes tissue degeneration, local necrosis appears in the degenerated
tendons and articular capsules, and the necrotized areas are calcified so that they can be
easily ruptured or lacerated by even minor injuries<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although there are a number of frozen shoulder treatment methods,
including thermotherapy, psychrotherapy, electric percutaneous nerve treatment, ultrasound
therapy, manual therapy, and taping therapy, one non-surgical treatment method that has been
receiving attention recently is extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT). ESWT is a
treatment method that applies extracorporeal shock waves to lesions to aid revascularization
and stimulate or reactivate the healing of bones and connective tissues such as tendons,
thereby relieving pain and improving functions<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although ESWT is commonly used to treat musculoskeletal diseases
such as calcific tenosynovitis and plantar aponeurositis<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, studies on its application for treating frozen shoulder are rare.
The present study was conducted to examine the effects of ESWT on frozen shoulder patients&#x02019;
pain and functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted with 30 of the patients who visited the outpatient clinic
of S Orthopedic Hospital in Daegu, Korea. All the patients were diagnosed with frozen
shoulder by a doctor who used clinical findings and medical equipment, such as an X-ray
machine. Patients with structural problems, recent dislocations or subluxations, or
rheumatic disease as well as those who underwent surgery were excluded. All patients were
taking NSAIDs once a day. The study subjects were divided into a conservative physical
therapy group (CPTG, n=15), with a mean age of 52.8&#x000b1;5.6&#x02005;years, a mean height of
163.9&#x000b1;7.6&#x02005;cm, and a mean weight of 61.2&#x000b1;11.7&#x02005;kg, and an extracorporeal shock wave therapy
group (ESWTG, n=15), with a mean age of 54.2&#x000b1;5.7&#x02005;years, a mean height of 162.6&#x000b1;7.7&#x02005;cm, and a
mean weight of 64.3&#x000b1;10.1&#x02005;kg. The intention of the present study and the entire experimental
process were sufficiently explained, and voluntary agreement was obtained from all
participants before the experiment was conducted. In addition, ethical approval for the
study was granted by Youngdong University&#x02019;s institutional review board.</p><p>For the ESWTG, a VITERA (Comed, Korea) was used for ESWT. The patients received 1,000 shock
waves at 2.5&#x02005;Hz, with the energy adjusted from 0.01&#x02013;0.16&#x02005;mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>, depending on the
degree to which the patients endured pain. To accurately deliver the shock wave energy to
targeted regions, targeted regions were determined through physical examinations and the
setting of the shock wave therapy equipment according to the results before implementing the
therapy. Physical therapist was operated ESWT. The CPTG was treated with a hot pack (20
minutes) and an ultrasound (5 minutes), which are thermotherapies, and interference current
therapy (100 bps, 15 minutes), which is an electrotherapy. ESWTG and CPTG did not have other
physical therapy. All subjects were treated two times per week for six weeks.</p><p>Visual analog scales (VASs) were used to evaluate pain, and patient-specific functional
scales (PSFSs) were used to evaluate functions. PSFSs are questionnaires designed to
evaluate patients&#x02019; functions by examining the activities that the patient finds hardest to
perform and determining the degree of difficulty of performing these activities. PSFSs were
used before and after treatment, and the results were compared to examine changes in the
functions of the patients.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup></p><p>For statistical processing, paired sample T-tests were used for intra-group comparisons,
and independent sample t-tests were used for inter-group comparisons to examine the changes
in frozen shoulder patients&#x02019; functions and evaluations of pain. In the present study, the
data were statistically processed using SPSS/PC Ver. 13.0, and the significance level &#x003b1; was
set to 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In intra-group comparisons of VAS and PSFS, both the CPTG and the ESWTG showed significant

when the pain is severe, all of which disrupt patients&#x02019; daily lives. Recently, ESWT was
presented as a new way to treat frozen shoulder.</p><p>Moon et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when Maitland
and Kaltenborn mobilization techniques were used to treat frozen shoulder patients, the
patients&#x02019; pain decreased and their internal and external rotation ranges increased.
Similarly, Park et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
intensive mobilization techniques and steroid injection controlled inflammation, expanded
joint spaces, and improved joints&#x02019; range of motion. Rompe et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that when one-time shock wave therapy was used to
treat calcific tendonitis of the shoulder, 60% of patients recovered to normal states, and
72% of patients improved to a point at which they only felt intermittent discomfort on the
Constant-Murley scale. Lee<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> revealed that
the use of ESWT to treat lateral epicondylitis relieved pain, significantly improved simple
elbow test scores, and led to satisfactory results for 83% of patients. Cho et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> related that when lateral epicondylitis
patients were treated by ESWT, the patients&#x02019; pain significantly decreased and muscle
strength significantly increased. Likewise, Na<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when ESWT was used to treat chronic low back pain,
patients&#x02019; pain significant decreased. Lastly, Lee et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> discovered that chronic low back pain patients who were treated
with an exercise program and ESWT experienced reduced pain and improved dynamic balancing,
compared to those who were treated with an exercise program and conservative physical
therapy.</p><p>In the present study, in intra-group comparisons of VAS and PSFS, both the CPTG and the
ESWTG showed significant decreases in both VAS and PSFS. In intergroup comparisons of VAS
and PSFS, the ESWTG received significantly lower scores than the CPTG. Given these results,
ESWT is considered to be effective for pain relief. It uses fine, repetitive stimuli
produced by a sound wave that can be spread through soft tissues without energy
dissipation<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In doing this, it causes
changes in cells&#x02019; metabolism and the permeability of endothelial cell tissues, leading to
pain relief<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, and has positive effects
on soft tissues.</p><p>Frozen shoulder patients have trouble performing common activities due to pain or physical
functional disorders, and they experience many restrictions each day. The patients showed
significant decreases in their functional disorder evaluation indexes because their ability
to perform everyday activities was improved due to improved physical functions and pain
relief.</p><p>The diverse effects of ESWT should be investigated, and the author hopes that the results
of the present study will be utilized as reference data at clinics when selecting treatment
for frozen shoulder patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Loew</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Heichel</surname><given-names>TO</given-names></name><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Intraarticular lesions in primary frozen shoulder after
