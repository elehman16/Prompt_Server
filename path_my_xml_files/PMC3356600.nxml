This parasite has been commonly known as the &#x0201c;oriental eye worm&#x0201d; because of its occurrence, mostly in human beings, in far Eastern countries such as Thailand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Nowadays, it is evident that <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> is also endemic throughout Europe infesting domestic and wild carnivores in Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and Switzerland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and domestic animals in France [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and Spain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Importantly, human cases of thelaziosis in Europe have been recorded in Italy and France [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Since the incrimination of <italic>Phortica variegata</italic> (Diptera, Drosophilidae) as a vector of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> in Europe under laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and natural conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the knowledge on this nematode and its vector has been greatly enhanced. The adult whitish nematodes (about 0.5&#x02013;2 cm) and first stage larvae (L1) localize under the third eyelid provoking lacrimation, conjunctivitis or even keratitis and corneal ulcer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. L1s are released by the adult worms into the conjunctival secretions of infested animals and they are ingested by <italic>P. variegata</italic> flies while feeding on animal eyes, developing into the infective third stage larvae (L3) within about 3 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The parasitic stages of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> (i.e., adults and larvae) may be removed mechanically by rinsing the conjunctival sac with sterilized saline fluids or by collecting the adults with fine forceps or cotton swab; however, worm removal may be incomplete. Antiparasitic drugs, such as macrocyclic lactones (e.g., moxidectin) have been proven efficacious in treating thelaziosis by ocular instillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. For compliance reasons it may be recommended to use systemic macrocyclic lactones licensed for dogs and cats, such as the spot-on formulation containing moxidectin (Advocate&#x000ae;, Bayer HealthCare AG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], or oral formulations containing milbemycin oxime (Interceptor&#x000ae;, Milbemax&#x000ae;, Program Plus&#x000ae;, Sentinel&#x000ae;, Novartis Animal Health) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Interceptor&#x000ae; showed a good therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy in treating thelaziosis in naturally infested dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Due to the increasing attention of pet owners and practitioners on canine and feline thelaziosis and to the spread of this ocular infestation in geographical areas previously regarded as non endemic, new therapeutic options are solicited. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a commercial oral formulation of milbemycin oxime/praziquantel (Milbemax&#x000ae; - Novartis Animal Health) in dogs and cats naturally infested with <italic>T. callipaeda</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The efficacy of Milbemax&#x000ae; (Novartis Animal Health) was evaluated in a placebo controlled, multicentric, blinded and randomized field study conducted in Switzerland (CH) in the Mendrisiotto region (Southern Ticino, 101 km<sup>2</sup>, latitude 45&#x000b0;52 N and latitude 8&#x000b0;59 E, altitude ranging from 277&#x02013;571 m above sea level), and in Italy (ITA) in the Basilicata region (Southern Italy, 9&#x02018;992 km<sup>2</sup>, latitude: 30&#x000b0; and 41&#x000b0;N; longitude 15&#x000b0; and 16&#x000b0; E, altitude ranging from 548&#x02013;1367 m asl).</p><p>Dogs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and cats (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) naturally infested with <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> were enrolled from January 2009 to June 2011 (CH) and from October 2010 to July 2011 (ITA).

Animals were required to be infested with a minimum of one worm in one conjunctival pouch and living outdoors or regularly going outdoors. Testing for infestation of <italic>Dirofilaria immitis</italic> was done in Southern Ticino, being a heartworm endemic area, prior to inclusion in accordance with Milbemax&#x000ae; label content. Only <italic>D. immitis</italic> negative dogs were included in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><p>Dogs and cats were physically examined by the veterinarian at enrolment (D0) and then at two follow-up visits, (D7 and D14). A general physical examination was carried out at each visit to determine the health status of the animals. This examination also included body weight (b.w.) determination on D0 and D14. A blood sample was collected on day 0, before the treatment, for baseline haematology and clinical chemistry. In Southern Ticino the presence of <italic>D. immitis</italic> antigen (Dirocheck<sup>(R)</sup>, Synbiotics) and microfilariae (Knott&#x02019;s test) was assessed in dogs. At each visit, both eyes were examined for the presence of eye worms by clinical inspection of the conjunctival pouch, including a thorough examination underneath the third eyelid using a cotton swab. If necessary, 2 drops per eye of a local anaesthetic (oxybuprocaine hydrochloride solution, Novesin&#x000ae; 0.4%, Omnivision) were applied into the conjunctival pouches. Clinical signs indicative of eye worm infestation (e.g., lacrimation, conjunctivitis, ocular discharge, keratitis, ulcers) were recorded and classified as absent mild, moderate or severe. A fluorescein test to diagnose ulcers was only performed if the animal was suspected to have ulcers. Worms were counted in each eye separately and the infestation intensity categorized into very mild (1 worm), mild (2&#x02013;5 worms), moderate (6&#x02013;10 worms) and severe (&#x0003e;10 worms).</p><p>On D0 dogs and cats were randomly allocated to treatment or control group by a random treatment allocation plan and orally treated according to body weight, following the label instructions of the commercial formulations of Milbemax&#x000ae; in both countries. In order to keep the blinding on the treatment details, even though both products (i.e., the milbemycinoxime/praziquantel and the placebo tablets) were comparable in appearance, a technician, different from the veterinarian that performed clinical evaluations, was responsible for the administration of the product and the storage of all test product related documentation.</p><p>On D7, if an animal was still found to be infested with <italic>T. callipaeda</italic>, a re-treatment with the same product at the same dose was administered. On D14, at the final visit, the conjunctival pouches were flushed with 5 ml of saline solution (0.9% NaCl) to collect larval stages of the parasite that were identified and counted, following centrifugation (5 min at 2000 g) and microscopic examination (40&#x000d7;).</p><p>During the study period animals were observed daily by their owners for health abnormalities and physically examined by the veterinarian in case of adverse events. If eye worms were still detected after D14, parasites were mechanically removed or animals were treated with an injectable solution of moxidectin 1 per cent (Cydectin&#x000ae;, Fort Dodge Animal Health) administered by ocular administration as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were statistically examined using SAS&#x000ae; Version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Summary statistics including arithmetic and geometric mean, minimum, maximum and median were provided for all counts, percentages or continuous parameters of interest. Primary efficacy objective was to compare the Milbemax&#x000ae; group with the placebo group with respect to clinical cure (therapeutic efficacy), i.e., complete elimination of adult eye worms, seven and fourteen days after treatment. Secondary efficacy objective was to compare the treatment groups with respect to worm count reduction and reduction of severity and/or presence of clinical signs caused by eye worm infestation. Worm count reduction was calculated for each animal as follows: % reduction[t]&#x02009;=&#x02009;100 &#x000d7; (WC[t<sub>o</sub>] &#x02013; WC[t])/WC[t<sub>o</sub>], where WC[t<sub>o</sub>]&#x02009;=&#x02009;baseline worm count before treatment and WC[t]&#x02009;=&#x02009;worm count at time t after treatment. Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was applied for the statistical comparison of clinical cure rates and infestation frequencies between treatment groups at different study days. Worm count reduction percentages were analyzed by analysis of variance methods if the assumption of normal distribution was satisfied on original scale or after transformation. Otherwise, Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was performed to compare the treatment groups. Adverse events observations were summarized and Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was applied for the statistical comparison between groups.

In dogs the efficacy was 72.7% and 90.9% after a single or two treatments, at a weekly interval, both significantly differing from the placebo group. In cats, the therapeutic efficacy was 53.3% and 73.3% after a single or two treatments, at a weekly interval. It is known that praziquantel is not efficacious against nematodes. Since both actives of Milbemax&#x000ae;, milbemycin oxime and praziquantel, are well established on the market and known not to interfere with each other, it can be assumed that other formulations containing milbemycin oxime alone or in combination with other actives (e.g., Interceptor&#x000ae;, Sentinel&#x000ae;, Sentinel Spectrum&#x000ae; and Program Plus&#x000ae;; all Novartis Animal Health) may be efficacious against <italic>T. callipaeda</italic>. Furthermore, since <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> lives in the conjunctival pouches of the final host, an accurate dosing to ensure optimal blood concentrations of milbemycin oxime is needed to reach efficacious concentrations of the product in the conjunctives. This may explain the reasons for a higher efficacy of the product after a second treatment one week after the first, as also suggested by the results of a preliminary study on <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> naturally infested animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. A lower efficacy observed on the 13 dogs (excluded from the statistical analysis) in which the treatment was administered without food, highlights the importance of a correct administration of the drug.</p><p>This study first evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of milbemycin oxime and praziquantel against <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> in cats. In addition, on the basis of a previous study in which the monthly administration of milbemyin oxime in dogs was highly effective (96.7%) for the prophylaxis of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], it may be argued that a similar prophylactic effect might occur in cats. This hypothesis deserves to be further tested under field conditions. Treatment of thelaziosis is an important issue in animals living in endemic areas, such as Basilicata in Italy (prevalence up to 60%; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]), or Spain (prevalence of 39.9%; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]) and Switzerland (prevalence up to 5%; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). An efficacious treatment against <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> is useful for pet owners considering the spread of the parasite in areas previously regarded as non endemic, such as France [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and Spain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The reasons for such an increase in cases of thelaziosis in dogs and cats throughout Europe are unknown, but it could be related to the spread of vector populations as well as to the occurrence of the infestation in wildlife species (e.g., foxes, wolves, beech martens and brown hares), which act as reservoirs for <italic>T. callipaeda</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Therefore, domestic animals which are traveling together with their owners from non-endemic to areas endemic for <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> should be treated since they are at risk of acquiring thelaziosis, as reported for some dogs in France or Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, monthly anthelmintic treatments, which are already recommended as a control strategy for dirofilarioses and other helminth infestations (e.g. see ESCCAP.org), should be considered for animals living in areas endemic for <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> in order to eliminate larval stages soon after their transmission from the drosophilid flies, thus interrupting the host-parasite transmission chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The high level of efficacy demonstrated in the current study suggests that further investigations should be carried out in order to test the effectiveness of the product when administered monthly during the risk season, in preventing <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> infestations in dogs and cats.</p><p>In addition, since Milbemax&#x000ae;-tablets for cats are flavor coated and chewable tablets are available for dogs, the oral formulations are very easy to apply, compared to the non-licensed local instillation of antiparasitic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] or to the mechanical removal of parasites from eyes. This especially applies when dealing with non-cooperative dogs and cats, where restraining them for manipulations around the eyes or even for spot-on applications is particularly difficult and bears the risk of trauma. Furthermore, wet coats or rainy days are reported to reduce the efficacy of topical administrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], a problem that is avoided by the drug administration <italic>per os</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The commercial formulation of milbemycin oxime at the minimal dose of 0.5 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg milbemycin oxime for dogs and cats, respectively, showed a high therapeutic efficacy in curing <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> infestations. The advantages of an oral application of Milbemax&#x000ae; are additionally increased by the large spectrum of activity of praziquantel and milbemycin oxime against Cestodes and Nematodes infesting dogs and cats.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>BM participated in the design of the study and in the field work, carried out the diagnostic assays and participated in the elaboration of the manuscript.
