A key symptom of OIBD is opioid-induced constipation (OIC), which can severely impact patients&#x02019; quality of life to the point where treatment compliance and subsequent pain relief are compromised.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Laxatives are frequently used to address the symptoms of OIC. Most laxatives aid defecation by stimulating colonic motility and/or softening stools.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Laxatives can be effective in some circumstances, including for constipation arising from delayed colonic transit.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, OIC has a unique etiology, arising from interaction between opioids and <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>-opioid receptors present throughout the entire gut.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Stimulation of peripheral <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>-opioid receptors affects numerous gastrointestinal functions, including neural activity, motility, secretion, resorption of fluid, and blood flow.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Consequently, opioids delay gastric emptying and prolong transit time throughout the small and large intestines.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> As opioids affect the entire gastrointestinal tract, it is unsurprising that laxatives, which predominantly act on the colon, frequently do not address the symptoms of OIC.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Indeed, many patients report that despite taking laxatives they miss or decrease doses of opioids to make it easier to have a bowel movement.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> No single laxative is considered optimal for OIC.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Furthermore, laxatives are associated with side effects including bloating, gas, and gastroesophageal reflux.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Therefore, aggressive laxative regimens may be associated with tolerability issues.</p><p>Oxycodone (Oxy) is a semi-synthetic, opioid analgesic demonstrated to be efficacious for cancer-related pain, postoperative pain, osteoarthritis-related pain, and neuropathic non-malignant pain syndromes.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> To address OIC symptoms, which are associated with all opioid agonists, a novel analgesic was developed combining Oxy with naloxone, an opioid-receptor antagonist.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> When administered orally, naloxone has &#x02264;2% systemic bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Consequently, oral naloxone acts on opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, where it has greater affinity than Oxy.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Combined oxycodone/naloxone prolonged-release tablets (OXN PR) provide effective analgesia for patients with moderate-to-severe chronic pain in studies of 12&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; duration. Meaningful improvements were also observed in the symptoms of OIC.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Given the nature of chronic pain, effective management often necessitates prolonged therapy. Consequently, the long-term effects of treatments must be established. Here, we present a pooled analysis of efficacy and safety data based on data from two 52-week extension phases which followed completion of two double-blind, randomized studies. These studies were conducted in patients with moderate-to-severe non-cancer pain and OIC between January 2006 and July 2007 to compare the efficacy and safety of OXN PR <italic>vs</italic> Oxy PR.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The aim of this pooled analysis was to investigate whether the analgesia, safety profile, and improvements in bowel function and quality of life associated with OXN PR are maintained long term in a large number of patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This pooled analysis comprised two open-label, 52-week extension phases (OXN3001S and OXN3006S) investigating OXN PR in patients who had completed one of two Phase III, double-blind, multicenter, randomized, 12-week studies (OXN3001; EudraCT: 2005-002398-57<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and OXN3006; EudraCT: 2005-003510-15).<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Details of the designs of the two Phase III, double-blind studies have been reported.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Patients were male or female, aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years, with a documented history of moderate-to-severe non-cancer pain that required round-the-clock opioid therapy.

In these patients, a substantial fall in mean BFI score was observed within the first week of OXN PR treatment. Furthermore, improvement in bowel function was maintained long term, with a clinically meaningful (&#x02265;12 points) mean reduction of 20.8 points on the BFI score observed over the 52-week extension phases for patients who received Oxy PR in the double-blind trials and then OXN PR in the extension phases. For patients who received OXN PR in both the double-blind and extension phases the reduction in BFI score (9.6 points) was less owing to the already significantly improved bowel function experienced during the double-blind studies.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> For all patients receiving OXN PR in the extension phases, mean BFI scores were within the normal range for non-constipated patients with chronic pain (&#x02264;28.8 points) from Week 1 to Month 12 of treatment.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>At screening, prior to randomization in the 12-week double-blind studies, most patients (69.0%) were documented to &#x02018;require laxatives&#x02019; (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>). Marked differences in laxative intake between patients randomized to Oxy PR and OXN PR had already been observed during the first 4&#x000a0;weeks of the double-blind trials. This was demonstrated by a significant reduction in the incidence of laxative intake for patients randomized to OXN PR (36.5%) compared with those randomized to Oxy PR (59.0%; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001).<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Compared with during double-blind treatment, laxative intake was captured differently in the extension phases, to reflect clinical practice, and consequently direct comparison of laxative use during these time periods cannot be made. However, during the long-term therapy fewer than 10% of patients from the pooled analysis population were documented to have &#x02018;received laxatives on a regular basis&#x02019;. The infrequent use of laxatives is particularly noteworthy given many patients were transitioning from Oxy PR in the double-blind studies to OXN PR in the extension phases.</p><p>Opioids induce OIBD, including OIC, via interaction with <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>-opioid receptors present throughout the entire gastrointestinal tract.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The effects of OXN PR on the small intestine and the colon likely play a significant part in addressing symptoms of OIC.

Average &#x02018;pain over the previous 24&#x000a0;h scores were low and stable over the 12-month period and were similar when patients were subgrouped according to the treatment they received during the double-blind phase of the studies, indicating OXN PR provides effective long-term analgesia. The mean pain scores in this pooled analysis of the extension phases were similar to those reported in the Oxy PR and the OXN PR groups during the double-blind studies (Week 12 of the double-blind phases: mean Oxy PR patients' score was 3.5; mean OXN PR patients' score was 3.6).<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Mean daily use of Oxy IR during the first week of the extension phases was low and patient satisfaction with OXN PR (as shown by the TSQM scores) was high following long-term treatment, in concordance with the analgesic efficacy and improvements in bowel function associated with OXN PR.</p><p>Based on the observed adverse events, vital signs, hematology, blood chemistry, and ECG profiles, long-term therapy with OXN PR was well-tolerated. Most adverse events did not have a major impact on long-term treatment with OXN PR as few subjects experienced events which resulted in dose reduction or discontinuation. Adverse events in the pooled analysis were slightly more frequent than observed previously during the double-blind studies (61% of OXN PR-treated patients had adverse events, with 36% experiencing treatment-related adverse events<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). This difference was anticipated due to the considerably longer duration of the extension phases (12&#x000a0;months) compared with the double-blind studies (12&#x000a0;weeks). During the pooled analysis, diarrhea and constipation considered by the study investigator to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to study medication were infrequent. This is particularly noteworthy, given the high incidence of constipation reported in studies of patients receiving opioid therapy despite the use of laxatives.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>No unexpected safety signals were detected in the pooled analysis and the safety profile of OXN PR associated with long-term administration appears consistent with previous observations and the expected profile of the opioid analgesic class of drugs.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> SOWS scores were stable during the extension phase and were similar to the scores seen during the double-blind studies, indicating that drug withdrawal was not a problem associated with long-term administration of OXN PR.</p><p>In summary, this pooled analysis of data from a large number of patients indicates that OXN PR is an effective long-term therapy for patients with chronic non-cancer pain, and can address symptoms of OIC. While all patients received OXN PR for 12&#x000a0;months, approximately 50% of patients had also received OXN PR for an additional 12&#x000a0;weeks during the preceding randomized, double-blind studies. Data from this subgroup indicate that OXN PR is effective throughout 15&#x000a0;months of therapy. This pooled analysis demonstrated that average pain scores remained low and stable throughout the extension phases and use of analgesic rescue medication was infrequent. The improvement in bowel function seen with OXN PR during the double-blind studies was continued throughout the 52&#x000a0;weeks of extended treatment in this pooled analysis. No new or unexpected safety issues were observed which were attributable to the long-term administration of OXN PR. Patient satisfaction with OXN PR was also high and maintained throughout the 52&#x000a0;weeks. Findings from this pooled analysis are consistent with a prior analysis of long-term OXN PR in patients with non-cancer chronic pain.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank all participating patients, and the network of investigators, study coordinators, and operations staff.
