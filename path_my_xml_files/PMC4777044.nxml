An experimental study was carried out and a total of 200 women were selected for the study using convenience sampling method among women who attended in the health centre in order to utilize the necessary premarital actions. Respondents were divided by two experimental and control groups randomly. A pre-evaluation was done on the knowledge and attitude on family planning using a structured questionnaire. After which, the health education for experimental group was done within four educational sessions during 4 consecutive weeks and control group underwent traditional education method.</p><p>Post evaluation was utilized for any changes regarding their knowledge and attitude among the respondents immediately after the intervention. Independent and paired t-test was used to evaluate the mean knowledge and attitude scores differences among both groups. Results showed that there was a significant improvement in respondents&#x02019; knowledge and attitude after educational program in experimental group (p&#x0003c;0.001), while no significant difference was observed in knowledge and attitude of control group. The finding also indicated that age was significantly associated with the level of respondents&#x02019; knowledge. These results deal the effectiveness of the educational method. In conclusion, the educational method is effective in increasing the knowledge and improving the attitude of women regarding family planning in Yasouj compared to current used educational method. Future educational programs need to incorporate the features that have been associated with successful interventions in the past, as well as including their own evaluation procedures.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Attitude</kwd><kwd>Education</kwd><kwd>Family planning</kwd><kwd>Knowledge</kwd><kwd>Yasouj</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>According to World health Organization (WHO) estimates, one in every five people in the world is an adolescent, (between 10 and 19 years of age). With an estimated 1.2 billion adolescents alive today, the world has the largest adolescent population in history (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Blum and Nelson, 2005</xref>). Of these, about 85% or four out of five young people live in developing countries. Moreover, more than half of the world&#x02019;s population is below the age of 25 (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">UNFPA, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 1999</xref>). Young people constitute a significant proportion of the Iranian population (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Mohammadi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). According to recent census (2006), there were approximately 17.6 million young people aged 15&#x02013;24, accounting for 25% of the Iranian population (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Iran Statistic Center, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Assad and Roudi-fahimi, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Despite the fact that contraceptive usage has increased over a period of time, there exists a Knowledge Attitude and Practice -gap regarding contraception (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Malek-Afzali, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Ramesh <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). The reasons for not using any family planning methods are lack of knowledge and education, religious belief and fear of side effects. Family planning has two main objectives; firstly, to have only the desired number of children and secondly, proper spacing of pregnancies (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Mao, 1999)</xref>.</p><p>Knowledge and practice of family planning is strongly related to higher level of education (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Ramesh <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). In most of the studies it was found that education is the prime influencing factor and education affects the attitudinal and behavioral patterns of the individuals (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Sajid and Malik, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Mao, 1999)</xref>. A number of Knowledge Attitude and Practice survey has been carried out covering different population groups (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Dabral S, Malik, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Gautam and Seth, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Takkar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Rao, 2005</xref>). Based on a majority of researches, in most countries of the world, female adolescents do not receive formal reproductive health education on time, since their puberty happens earlier than boys. <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Lloyd (2009</xref>:85) contends that all 13&#x02013;15 year olds should be acquiring &#x0201c;reading and writing fluency for lifelong learning, critical thinking skills, health and reproductive health knowledge and skills for social and civic participation. Nevertheless, it offers a standard to make informed and voluntary decisions in their lives, including their sexual, marital and reproductive lives. Studies have showed that 63.4% of puberty disorders and complications among females were because of their ignorance (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Mohammadi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Considering the above research results and the fact that the number of youths in Iran is increasing, it is necessary to educate youths regarding family planning particularly during puberty and before marriage. This study tried to educate female adolescents who tended to married for the first time regarding family planning and find out how such education affects their knowledge and attitude.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2. Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>2.1 Study area and Study Period</title><p>The purpose of current study was to determine the effect of health education on the knowledge and attitude regarding family planning and contraception&#x02019;s method among the women who obligatory attended the Premarital Counseling Center in Yasouj city, Iran. The study was conducted in Yasouj city located in the South-East of Iran, which is 800 km away from Tehran, the capital city of the country. The study was carried out in Shahid Ashrafi Isfahani Health Center. The center is a referral center which covered the only Premarital Counseling Center in the city. Iran has laws in place making premarital counseling and screening for Thalasaemia mandatory for all couples before they are given approval to get married. One innovative program provides mandatory premarital sex education courses for engaged couples form 1994. To obtain a marriage license, each couple must attend a short course on sexual and reproductive health issues, ranging from reproductive anatomy to spousal communication. The study was conducted from November 2010 to February 2011.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>2.2 Study Design, Study Participants and Sampling</title><p>An experimental design with an experimental and a control site using pre- and post-intervention measurements was used to investigate the effect of a planned family planning health education on the participants&#x02019; knowledge and attitude. The interventional education included in four 1.5 hours sessions covering related contents of contraception methods lectured by six health trainer. To ensure their consistency in educational methods and contents, they were trained seven consecutive days before starting intervention. Furthermore, the trainers also monitored directly using video camera recording which observed by researchers for assuring their consistency in educational methods and contents. The educational method consists of lecture and discussion panel including questions and answers concerning family planning and contraceptive methods which allow the women to express their ambiguity in understanding. Control group underwent traditional educational method which included a single two hours educational session which covering general issues of reproductive health issues consist of family planning, sexual health and spousal communication. Study population including all couples who wish to married and attended to premarital counselling centre during study period. There were 9534 couples who attended to the centre in 2010. A total of 200 women enrolled in the study using convenience sampling method. A convenience sampling method was used to select the study participants, because the application of any of the probability sampling methods would have obstructed the flow of service in the clinic and drastically increased clients&#x02019; waiting time. Afterward the selected samples randomly divided by two groups including control and experimental groups according to their registration numbers.

It consisted of three parts: The first part of the questionnaire was demographic data. The second part of the questionnaire consisted of questions regarding knowledge on family planning and contraception&#x02019; methods and the third part comprised of questions regarding attitude toward family planning on both positive and negative statements regarding common issues on family planning with 5 point Likert Scale questions. The knowledge and attitude questions have shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. Content validity was ascertained by an expert panel comprising professionals who were health faculty members, health practitioners and family physicians. Pilot study was carried out on 30 women not included in the study. It was performed as an initial step for the study to check the questionnaire. Some modifications in some questions were done after the pilot study. Its reliability also was determined by alpha-Krunbach (r=0.76) considering the fact that A reliability coefficient (alpha) of. 70 or higher is considered acceptable reliability (<xref rid="ref21"

The questionnaire took about 20 minutes to be completed. In order to start study, the experimental group was divided by four equal groups (each group 25 person) who underwent four educational sessions during 4 consecutive weeks. The health education was done by the health trainers which lasted approximately 1.5 hours. Visual aids were used to further guide the respondents during the sessions. Questions were encouraged and a discussion after the lecture followed. Topics discussed during the family planning lecture were the different methods of family planning, its proper use, side effects, advantages and disadvantages. Issues regarding family planning in general were also addressed. These include side effects that one may expect from each method, the fear that some methods can lead to cancer and the complaints regarding the effectiveness of the methods. Some concerns were also regarding the approval of their husbands since some regard family planning as affecting the masculinity of their husbands. Explaining the long &#x02013;term benefits of family planning on their family&#x02019;s health and finances was also a goal in the discussions. Furthermore, the traditional education method was done among control group.

Discussion</title><p>The result demonstrated the poor knowledge and attitude regarding family planning among respondents which was in agreement with the study in the South-East Asia that showed low level of contraception methods information (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Dabral and Malik, 2004</xref>). Lack of knowledge about contraceptive methods can be a major obstacle in their use (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Sajid and Malik, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The research findings also showed that the mean scores of respondents&#x02019; differed significantly before and after intervention among experimental group and mean change of knowledge were about 5.70, while the knowledge score of control group were not significantly different compare to the baseline. It is indicated that family planning education through this method had an impact on improving respondents&#x02019; knowledge. On the other word the traditional educational method which used currently is not effective as present method of education. Other studies also proved that health education regarding reproductive health not only increased the respondents&#x02019; knowledge, but also improved their healthy behavior (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Afghari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Eisenstein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Meuwissen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The results of the present study revealed that family planning education improved the experimental subjects&#x02019; attitude about contraception methods significantly. This may signify that any improvement in a person&#x02019;s knowledge about something will ensue to a better attitude on it. However, the increase in the mean scores from 4.20 during the pretest to 9.73 during the post proves that family planning education can be a useful tool not just in improving a person&#x02019;s knowledge but their attitude as well. This is consistent with the results of <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Wang and his colleagues (2011)</xref>. Through the health education on family planning, negative attitude on family planning will be changed since promoting a more positive attitude on family planning is a vital step in the actual acceptance of family planning method by people.</p><p>The finding also demonstrated that continues education had higher impact on attitude improvement rather than usual educational method which present in a single session of lecture. <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Young (1996)</xref> believes that health education for adolescents strongly affects their attitude toward their abilities and suggests that education should be long term enough to develop their attitude. <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Poppe (1992)</xref> also showed that educational films improve the adolescents&#x02019; attitude toward adolescents&#x02019; relationships and their knowledge about various safe sexual behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>5.
