A promising method for pharmacodynamic monitoring of tacrolimus (TAC) in T cell subsets of transplant recipients might be the measurement of (phosphorylated) p38MAPK, ERK1/2 and Akt (activated downstream of the T cell receptor) by phospho-specific flow cytometry. Here, blood samples from n&#x02009;=&#x02009;40 kidney transplant recipients (treated with either TAC-based or belatacept (BELA)-based immunosuppressive drug therapy) were monitored before and throughout the first year after transplantation. After transplantation and in unstimulated samples, p-p38MAPK and p-Akt were inhibited in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and p-ERK in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells but only in patients who received TAC-based therapy. After activation with PMA/ionomycin, p-p38MAPK and p-AKT were significantly inhibited in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells when TAC was given, compared to pre-transplantation. Eleven BELA-treated patients had a biopsy-proven acute rejection, which was associated with higher p-ERK levels in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to patients without rejection.&#x000a0;In conclusion, phospho-specific flow cytometry is a promising tool to pharmacodynamically monitor TAC-based therapy. In contrast to TAC-based therapy, BELA-based immunosuppression does not inhibit key T cell activation pathways which may contribute to the high rejection incidence among BELA-treated transplant recipients.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Pharmacokinetic monitoring of the most frequently used immunosuppressive drug after solid organ transplantation, tacrolimus (TAC), is most often based on whole-blood, pre-dose concentrations. The TAC pre-dose concentration, however, has an imperfect correlation (r<sub>s</sub> &#x02248; 0.7) with the total exposure to TAC during a dosing interval as measured by the area-under the concentration <italic>versus</italic> time-curve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

T cells become activated upon three separate stimulation signals: 1) antigen recognition by the T cell receptor (TCR) with the help of antigen presenting cells (APC); 2) co-stimulation, of which the interaction between CD28 molecules on T cells and CD80/86 molecules on the APC is the best known pathway, and 3) binding of cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. This will activate intracellular signaling pathways downstream of the TCR [including the calcineurin, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) and PI3K pathways] and initiate the activation of transcription factors that regulate the production of cytokines (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. IL-2, IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1;)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The activation of these pathways is characterized by (de-)phosphorylation of specific signaling molecules: Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT), p38MAPK, Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and AKT8 virus oncogene cellular homolog (Akt) (see also Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">A promising approach to determine the biological effects of immunosuppressive drugs may be the measurement of intracellular signaling pathway activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

Previous studies on phospho-specific flow cytometry have demonstrated that TAC can inhibit p38MAPK in a dose-dependent manner in kidney transplant patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Moreover, mycophenolic acid (MPA) was been found to decrease the phosphorylation of p38MAPK and ERK1/2 <italic>in vitro</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. However, these previous studies lacked an appropriate control group that did not receive TAC and could therefore not exclude an effect of other, concomitantly used immunosuppressive drugs on T cell activation in these kidney transplant patients.</p><p id="Par6">Belatacept (BELA), a fusion protein consisting of the Fc-fragment of human immunoglobulin G1 linked to the extracellular domain of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4, was approved in 2011 for the prevention of acute rejection after kidney transplantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. It blocks the co-stimulation signal between CD80/86 and CD28 molecules (on APCs and T cells, respectively) and prevents T cell activation. In contrast to TAC, BELA is not nephrotoxic and has less metabolic side effects, although the incidence of acute rejection with a BELA-based treatment is relatively high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The higher risk of acute rejection of patients who receive treatment with BELA has been associated with a more aggressive T cell-mediated allogeneic response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. One of the explanations for this phenomenon is the fact that memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells lack CD28 expression and are not dependent on the co-stimulatory signal from CD80/86<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Here, we expand on our previous work and investigated the phosphorylation status of 3 signaling proteins involved in T cell activation, namely p38MAPK, ERK and Akt, by means of phospho-specific flow cytometry to investigate whether this technique can be used as a tool for pharmacodynamic monitoring of TAC-based immunosuppression after kidney transplantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

Because BELA only indirectly inhibits T cell activation, the BELA-treated group served as a control group in this study, circumventing a limitation of previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

In summary, three patients in the BELA group lost their graft at day 12 (Banff type IIB acute rejection), day 59 (Banff type III acute rejection) and day 161 (Banff type IIB acute rejection) after transplantation. The total incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) in this group was 55% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;11, median time to rejection 81 days). The incidence of BPAR was lower in the TAC-treated group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2, 10%, median time to rejection 56 days). In the TAC group, one patient died 294 days after transplantation, due to a traumatic head injury. For the present study, patients with a BPAR were censored from the moment of rejection onwards, because measurements of intracellular signaling pathways after the occurrence of rejection were likely to be heavily influenced by the anti-rejection therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>T cell subset counts and immunosuppressive drug pre-dose concentrations</title><p id="Par9">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> represents a gating strategy example of the phospho-specific flow cytometry measurements and the selection of the CD3<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets.

However, the TAC pre-dose concentration does not accurately predict the occurrence of acute rejection after kidney transplantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Here, phospho-specific flow cytometry, a promising technique with a short turnaround time for the pharmacodynamic measurement of immunosuppressive drug effects, was investigated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The technique has been used previously for testing immunosuppressive drug responses in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and for the monitoring of mTOR inhibitor therapy. This technique was also studied with regard to TDM of TAC by our group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, and in contrast to the present work, in that study, only p38MAPK was investigated and only in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells of patients treated with TAC-based immunosuppression. Here, three major signaling molecules involved in T cell activation, p38MAPK, ERK and Akt, were tested as potential biomarkers for detecting biological drug effects of TAC in different T cell subsets and compared to a group of patients treated with BELA-based treatment.</p><p id="Par19">In directly measured blood samples of patients treated with a TAC-based immunosuppressive regimen, expression of p-ERK in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was decreased at almost all measured time points after transplantation, whereas no effect was found on p38MAPK and Akt phosphorylation. In contrast, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells showed no decrease in p-ERK but showed a lower expression of p-p38MAPK and p-Akt at day 30.</p><p id="Par20">There was no decrease in p-ERK induced by TAC-based treatment after stimulation with PMA/ionomycin, suggesting that the ERK pathway can still be activated after transplantation, despite the inhibited expression in unstimulated samples. A TAC-based-treatment also affected the expression of p-p38MAPK and p-Akt in stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells, but not to the same extent. For example, CD8<sup>+</sup> cells did not show an inhibition of p38MAPK at day 90, while this molecule was significantly inhibited at all measured time points in CD4<sup>+</sup> cells. P-Akt showed no significant inhibition at day 180 in all T cells subsets.</p><p id="Par21">BELA blocks the co-stimulation signal between the CD80/86 molecule on APC&#x02019;s and the CD28 molecule on T cells. This indicates that BELA only indirect affects the phosphorylation of signaling pathways in T cells. Indeed, no effects of BELA on signaling protein phosphorylation were noticed in both unstimulated and stimulated samples. Only at day 90, when blood samples were stimulated with PMA/ionomycin, a decrease of p-p38MAPK was found in CD28<sup>+</sup> cells after treatment with BELA. This effect was not noticed in CD8<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells, indicating that BELA did not affect these cells. However, this effect was not observed at other time points, indicating that any difference between the effect of BELA on CD28<sup>+</sup> and on the more aggressive CD28<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells could not be detected with phospho-specific flow cytometry. Notably and in contrast to the TAC-treated study population, expression of p-ERK was increased at day 360 in the presence of BELA, reflecting immune activation.</p><p id="Par22">The absence of decreased signaling protein phosphorylation during BELA-based therapy also suggests that p-p38MAPK and p-Akt are mainly affected by TAC. However, the significant reductions that were found during TAC-based treatment were small and no correlations were found between TAC pre-dose concentrations and p-p38MAPK. However, there could be a correlation between phosphorylation expression and peak drug concentrations or area under the concentration-<italic>versus</italic> time curve, but these were not measured in this study. No other patient baseline characteristic showed an association with the expression of p-p38MAPK, p-ERK or p-Akt, suggesting that the decrease in phosphorylation was not influenced by these parameters. Downstream of the MAPK pathway, p-p38MAPK will initiate the transcription of the IFNG gene, which in turn will lead to the production of IFN-&#x003b3; by T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Here, the expression of p-p38MAPK, measured by phospho-specific flow cytometry, significantly correlated with IFN-&#x003b3; production in CD8<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>+</sup> T cells but only after transplantation when there is less variation in p-p38MAPK expression due to the presence of immunosuppressive drugs. Unfortunately, IFN-&#x003b3; production was not measured at day 4 and 30 after transplantation, but the immunosuppressive drug concentrations were higher at day 90 compared to day 180 and 360 after transplantation suggesting that a TAC-based immunosuppressive drug therapy is involved in the regulation of p38MAPK phosphorylation. Altogether, the correlation between p-p38MAPK and the production of IFN-&#x003b3; suggests that measuring phosphorylation of p38MAPK could be an effective manner to monitor CD8<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>+</sup> T cell function after transplantation.</p><p id="Par23">Eleven out of 20 BELA-treated patients in this study suffered from an acute rejection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. BELA-treated patients suffering from a BPAR showed an increased phosphorylation of ERK after stimulation with PMA/ionomycin in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, in contrast to patients without an acute rejection episode. This observation was made at day 4 in CD4<sup>+</sup> and at day 90 in CD8<sup>+</sup> cells before the rejection episode was detected. p-ERK could be inhibited in the presence of a TAC-based regimen, as was measured in unstimulated samples. In contrast, a BELA-based treatment even increased the expression of p-ERK at day 360 after stimulation of the samples. Previously, a weak correlation was also found between the expression of p-ERK and antibody-mediated rejection biopsies of heart transplant patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Moreover, graft survival could be prolonged by the use of an ERK1/2 inhibitor as was shown in a mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Altogether, these results indicate an important role for ERK in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells before an acute rejection episode is diagnosed clinically. Unfortunately, it could not be verified in this study whether the expression of p-ERK during a rejection episode was also increased in the presence of a TAC-based treatment, since only two patients in this treatment group suffered from acute rejection.</p><p id="Par24">This study has other limitations, such as the small sample size and the lack of correlations between the expression of p-p38MAPK, p-ERK and p-Akt and clinical outcomes. Larger prospective cohort studies should focus on the phosphorylation of ERK in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells after transplantation to prove that p-ERK is a reliable biomarker for rejection in the presence of either a BELA- or TAC-based therapy. Such a study should also measure the total expression of ERK to ensure that any effects are due to the phosphorylation inhibition and not to the changed expression of the total protein. Moreover, in order to use phospho-specific flow cytometry for daily clinical diagnostics, the technique should be validated by using area-under the concentration <italic>versus</italic> time-curve values instead of pre-dose concentrations. These values could also give an explanation for the low inhibitory effects on signaling molecule phosphorylation at specific time points and the increase in p-ERK in BELA-treated patients suffering from a rejection.</p><p id="Par25">In conclusion, phospho-specific flow cytometry is a promising technique to monitor the pharmacodynamic effects of a TAC, but not BELA, -based immunosuppressive therapy after transplantation. In contrast to TAC-based treatment, BELA-based immunosuppression does not inhibit key T cell activation pathways, despite the expression of CD28, which may contribute to the high rejection incidence observed among BELA-treated kidney transplant recipients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Kidney transplant patients</title><p id="Par26">Between January 21<sup>th</sup>
