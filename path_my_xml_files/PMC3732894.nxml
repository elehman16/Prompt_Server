Patients who had history of allergic reactions to NSAIDs, history of usage of paracetamol, opioids, or NSAIDs for a long time (3 months), chronic alcoholism, deficiency of liver and kidney, cardiovascular system illness, bleeding diathesis, cases in such a mental or cultural condition that they are unable to use the patient-controlled analge-sia device, gastric or duodenal ulser were excluded. By visiting the patients one day before the opera-tion, related information and training was given about the anesthesia method to be applied, usage of the visual analog scale (VAS).

In our study, the incidence of nausea was 72% in Group III, 48% in Group II and 25% in Group I, and the incidence of vomiting was 50%, 27% and 12%, respectively. Six patients in Group III, 4 patients in Group II had hypotension, whereas none of the patients in Group I had hypotension. The reason for high incidence of nausea and vomiting in Group III and Group II may be due to higher consumption of opioids in the post-operative period, hypotension and pain.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrated the early postoperative analgesic effect of 1 g of paracetamol in patients undergoing cholecystectomy. Because of providing decreased opioid consumption with lower side effects, paracetamol can be safely used in post-operative pain management.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
