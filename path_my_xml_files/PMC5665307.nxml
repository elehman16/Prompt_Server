First self-help apps for eating disorders have been developed recently. However, studies assessing the efficacy of such apps are scarce. A smartphone app could prevent further weight reduction and increase commitment during waiting time for outpatient treatment, especially for adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN). In this study protocol, a randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a smartphone-enhanced low-threshold intervention for AN during waiting time is described.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>30 adolescents with AN aged 12&#x02013;19 years will be recruited at three child and adolescent psychiatry centres in Germany. All participants will be randomised to consultations only or consultations and the use of the Jourvie Research app. The app will be installed either on their own smartphone or on a research device. The participants will receive biweekly to monthly consultations for 3 months to review meal plans and weight management with a clinician. In addition, the Jourvie Research app for meal, behaviour and emotion protocolling will be provided to the intervention group. The protocols will be discussed with a clinician during the consultations. Dialectical behaviour therapy-informed skills for tension regulation to increase compliance with the meal plan will be taught in the intervention group and the app will remind the participant of a skill in a moment of need. The primary outcome is the age-adjusted and height-adjusted weight gain in standard deviation score after 3 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Results will be disseminated at conferences and through peer-reviewed publications. The trial was approved by the ethics review board of the local medical association, Mainz, Germany, under the reference number 837.338.15.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>German clinical trials register, reference number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/DRKS00008946">DRKS00008946</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adult psychiatry</kwd><kwd>eating disorders</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004033</institution-id><institution>Johannes Gutenberg-Universit&#x000e4;t Mainz</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The SELTIAN trial is the first randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a low-threshold intervention enhanced with a smartphone app for adolescents with anorexia nervosa.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A strength is the combination of face-to-face consultations with a smartphone app instead of distributing a smartphone app only.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A considerable limitation is that the smartphone app relies on user input for presenting an ecological momentary intervention rather than on sensor data (eg, increased physical activity or heart rate measured by wearable sensors).</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe eating disorder associated with a high impact on quality of life, significant health risks and one of the highest mortality rates for mental disorders.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Lower body mass indices at first admission to mental health services are related to poorer treatment outcome and higher mortality,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> whereas a higher rate of weight gain during treatment is a predictor for recovery.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Therefore, weight restoration of the patients is the main focus of early treatment stages.</p><p>Many evidence-based cognitive treatment approaches use self-monitoring to assess disordered eating behaviours in daily life. Self-monitoring is helpful in identifying emotional and behavioural factors which prevent weight gain and maintain disordered eating behaviour.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> Additionally, self-monitoring eating behaviour and mood fluctuations might increase insight into the disorder by the patient and concurrently lead to a faster weight gain.</p><p>With the wide distribution of smartphones nowadays, a powerful tool for assessment and intervention is available to most of adolescents. So-called mobile health applications (mhealth apps) for various mental disorders already exist and several have been shown as effective, for example, in the treatment of depression<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> or anxiety.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> Regarding mhealth apps for eating disorders, two recent reviews identified existing apps in the most prominent app stores and assessed the quality and clinical utility of these apps.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> Several apps rely mostly on ecological momentary assessment (EMA) tools such as meal and emotion protocols, whereas only few apps allowed a direct data exchange with a therapist. Hence, in most cases, the interpretation of the observed behaviour and emotions is solely conducted by the user based on the feedback of the app, which might lead to underestimation of the severity of problematic behaviour. Surprisingly, none of the apps reviewed by Juarascio <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> took advantage of the possibilities of ecological momentary interventions (EMI), which refers to delivering a psychosocial intervention immediately at the moment of need based on user input or sensor data. A third review analysing technology-based psychological interventions for eating disorders found preliminary evidence for the efficacy of mobile interventions (mostly text-message-based interventions) in the treatment of eating disorders.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> With respect to other forms of e-therapy for eating disorders (eg, CBT-E informed internet interventions), a meta-analysis found small beneficial effects but statistical confidence in the estimates was moderate to low.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The included studies, however focused primarily on binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa and its results might not be applicable to e-therapy for AN. Recently, an article on the development of one of the apps discussed in the mobile app reviews above was published, highlighting the good acceptance rates of the app as demonstrated in the utilisation behaviour in an international sample based on free downloads.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Eighty-nine per cent of the users used the app at least once and the majority for &#x0003e;30 meal protocols. However, the efficacy of the app compared with other self-help tools was not assessed. In conclusion, all reviews identified a lack of controlled studies assessing the feasibility, efficacy and safety of smartphone apps for eating disorders.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Rationale for a dialectical behaviour therapy-informed mhealth app for AN</title><p>Emotion dysregulation is one of the key features for the development and maintenance of AN.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> There is a growing body of evidence that highlights a causal connection between momentary levels of affect and disordered eating behaviour in individuals with AN.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> For instance, momentary emotional instability and negative urgency (ie, the tendency to immediately terminate states of negative affect) were found to be in direct relation to the occurrence of restrictive eating and active weight reduction in a study on adult individuals with AN.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> Engel <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> found that adults with AN showed more negative affect prior to and more positive affect after restrictive eating, which indicates that restrictive eating might be used as an emotion regulation strategy. However, monitoring mood and behaviour with an EMA approach did not substantially increase therapy outcome in a study on binge-eating disorder.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> With the technical possibilities of smartphones nowadays, modern mhealth apps might be used as a monitoring tool and offer specific interventions in the moment of need, which could increase the efficacy of such an app.</p><p>In a recent study on adolescents with AN, higher levels of aversive tension were associated with food intake.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Aversive tension is defined as an unpleasant state of high arousal, generally not associated with a specific emotion and with an action tendency towards immediate termination.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> In the treatment of borderline personality disorder and non-suicidal self-harm of adults and adolescents, the dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) approach has been shown to effectively reduce states of high aversive tension by teaching distress tolerance skills.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;29</xref> DBT is a modern cognitive behavioural psychotherapy focusing on increasing emotion regulation capabilities of patients to reduce reactivity to distress. In DBT, it is assumed that patients with emotion dysregulation are doing their best but lack specific skills to effectively regulate their emotional states.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> As recommended in the most recent DBT skills training manuals,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref> skills should be taught and trained in the therapy session and an individual list of helpful skills should be created together with the patient. Training in these skills instead of only presenting a list of potentially helpful skills to the patient is considered to increase the perceived efficacy of the skills. Regarding DBT for eating disorders, recent trials have shown promising effects in the reduction of disordered eating behaviour and body mass index (BMI) increase in individuals with AN.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32&#x02013;34</xref> A German randomised controlled trial (RCT) study comparing cognitive&#x000a0;behavioural therapy and DBT with a control group was able to show that DBT was effective in the outpatient treatment of adolescents with AN.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Thus, a DBT-informed skills module might be effective in reducing aversive tension during meal times and might subsequently increase calorie intake, when integrated into a smartphone app. A smartphone app could even propose a previously defined skill in the time of need, which would be of additional benefit.</p><p>Another important concern regarding smartphone apps for eating disorders is how such apps should be integrated in existing treatment.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Currently, several mhealth apps are available in the app stores and can be used without prior or accompanying consultations. Especially in the case of eating disorders, thorough assessment of severity and comorbidity is crucial to prevent mortality and a chronic course of the disorder, which remains a challenge for many emerging mhealth solutions.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In addition, there is evidence that guided technology-based psychological interventions for eating disorders, even if guidance of an experienced clinician is only applied on an email or text message basis, is perceived as supportive by most of the users. However, studies comparing guided and unguided (self-help) interventions have found mixed results regarding efficacy.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x000a0;Hence, we defined the following specifications for a DBT-informed, smartphone-based mhealth intervention for AN to facilitate weight restoration, normalisation of food intake and reduction of aversive tension and psychological distress during waiting time for outpatient treatment:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>EMA of mood, meal and behaviour to assess momentary emotion dysregulation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>DBT-informed EMI module to deliver individual skills for reduction of aversive tension.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Training of individual EMI skills before presentation in the app to increase efficacy and compliance.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Guided app use and assessment of the protocols together with an experienced clinician to improve meal plans and decrease disordered eating.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>In this trial, the efficacy of a smartphone app developed following the above-mentioned specifications will be tested in a group of adolescents with AN.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a smartphone app in combination with psychiatric consultations during the waiting time for outpatient psychotherapy for AN in comparison with psychiatric consultations only. An important factor in achieving a favourable outcome in AN is early weight gain.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Hence, any intervention for AN during waiting time for outpatient treatment should focus on increasing the BMI SD score adjusted for age and height (BMI-SDS) of the patients rather than focusing on reduction of psychopathology only. Therefore, BMI-SDS was chosen as the primary outcome in this study.</p><p>We hypothesise that (1) after 3&#x02009;months the height and age-adjusted weight gain of the participants receiving the additional smartphone app will be greater when compared with the participants receiving psychiatric consultations only (differences in BMI-SDS pretreatment to post-treatment). Moreover, we expect that (2) mean levels of daily aversive tension will be reduced significantly from baseline to closure in the intervention group compared with control group (mean aversive tension as measured in the EMA pretreatment and post-treatment). In addition, we will assess eating disorder psychopathology, depressiveness and general psychological distress at baseline and closure, as well as adherence to the protocolling scheme (eg, number of protocols recorded, number of sessions) and usability of the app as secondary outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>This study protocol describes a multicentre, two-arm RCT assessing the efficacy of a specific smartphone application in addition to supportive psychiatric consultations for adolescents with AN waiting for outpatient therapy. After informed consent is provided by the participant and her legal guardians in case of minority, the participant will be randomly assigned to either the smartphone-enhanced treatment condition (psychiatric consultations+specific&#x02009;mhealth app) or the treatment as usual condition (psychiatric consultations only). Each participant will receive a consultation every 2&#x02009;weeks within the first 6&#x02009;weeks after enrolment and further consultations when needed at least on a monthly basis throughout participation. Participants will be recruited at three different outpatient child and adolescent mental health services in Berlin, Mainz and Neuwied, Germany. Data will be collected at baseline, during the intervention and at the end of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>To our knowledge, there is no literature on smartphone-enhanced psychiatric consultations published. In a study on psychotherapy for AN, the waiting control group received 30&#x02009;min psychiatric consultations every 2&#x02009;weeks for 3&#x02009;months with no effect on the BMI.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> In a previous study on guided self-help, a medium increase in BMI was found after 3&#x02009;weeks of guided self-help.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Therefore, we assume that single psychiatric consultations have no effect on the BMI and expect similar effects on the BMI in the smartphone-enhanced intervention as in guided self-help.</p><p>In this study, a repeated measurements analysis of variance (rmANOVA) assessing a within-between interaction of time and group will be used to test baseline to post-treatment BMI-SDS differences. A sample size of 22 participants is required to detect a medium effect size of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mspace/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mspace/><mml:mn>0.25</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> with a power of at least 80%, an assumed correlation of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mspace/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mspace/><mml:mn>0.70</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> between measurements and an alpha-error level of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x0221d;=</mml:mo><mml:mspace/><mml:mn>0.05</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. Sample size calculations were conducted with G*Power<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> and supervised by a biometrician. In order to reach at least 22 complete data sets, 30 participants are planned to be enrolled in the study, which will create a reasonable margin for possible dropouts.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Recruitment and participants</title><p>Recruitment will be conducted at the study centres. Prior to the study, general practitioners, paediatricians (child and adolescent) psychiatrists and psychotherapists in private practice in close distance to the study centres will be informed of the study and referral options by a personal letter.</p><p>Due to ethical reasons, we decided to include participants currently waiting for outpatient treatment. In Germany, waiting times for outpatient psychotherapy are at 12.5 weeks on average.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Especially patients with AN might wait even longer as this disorder is considered hard-to-treat and many psychotherapists refuse to treat adolescents with AN in an outpatient setting.</p><p>Female participants aged 12&#x02013;19 years who have been diagnosed with either full syndrome or atypical AN according to ICD-10 at one of the study centres will be eligible for participation. Clinical diagnoses will be confirmed by conducting the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) in the adult or children version, a structured interview for the valid and reliable assessment of eating disorders.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40 41</xref> In addition, amenorrhoea will be assessed to meet ICD-10 criteria for AN.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> As males and females differ regarding the prevalence<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and psychopathology of AN,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> only females will be included to prevent gender effects on the primary outcome. Patients who receive outpatient psychotherapy on a regular basis (ie, at least weekly 50&#x02009;min sessions with a licensed psychotherapist) will not qualify for inclusion. However, preparatory sessions (up to five initial sessions with a licensed psychotherapist for diagnostic and goal establishing purposes) during participation will be encouraged to facilitate prompt outpatient treatment after completion of the study. Pharmacological treatment of comorbid disorders (eg, depression) will be permitted during participation. Patients with a comorbid personality disorder of the emotionally&#x000a0;unstable subtype will be excluded, as this condition is related to heightened levels of aversive tension,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> which is a secondary outcome in this study. Patients with severe suicidal ideation will not be eligible for participation as inpatient treatment is recommended for safety reasons. Participants who will be referred to inpatient treatment for &#x0003e;1&#x02009;week (ie, mostly due to severe somatic complications or inpatient refeeding) during participation will be considered as dropouts.</p><p>All participants and their legal guardians will be made aware of the voluntary nature of the study. Refusing to participate will not affect the treatment of the participant in any way. Furthermore, both participants and their legal guardians in case of minority will be required to consent to participation after being provided with extensive information on the study by the local study coordinator. All participants will be required to install the smartphone application on their private smartphone or to agree with using a smartphone distributed by the study centre. The first participant was recruited in April 2016. Recruitment is expected to close in 2018.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Following baseline assessment, participants will be randomised to either the smartphone-enhanced intervention arm or the treatment-as-usual condition with a 3:2 allocation rate. Randomisation will be stratified for the study centres and the ICD-10 subtypes of AN (restrictive, binge-purge, atypical) to prevent possible confounding effects by baseline weight and psychopathology differences of AN subtypes and potential structural differences of the study centres (two university medical centres and one public child and adolescent psychiatry hospital). The randomisation procedure will be conducted on a web-based platform using REDCap.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Allocation tables are concealed within REDCap. Randomisation will be conducted by the study coordinator at each study centre. Due to the nature of the study, neither blinding of the counsellors nor the participants can be conducted. With an allocation ratio of 3:2 for the intervention group, 18 participants in the intervention group and 12 participants in the control group will be included. However, as randomisation is stratified, the final distribution of the groups might differ from the 3:2 ratio.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>The Jourvie Research app</title><p>In 2015, Jourvie gUG (Berlin, Germany) released an Android and iOS app for self-help and therapy enhancement of patients with eating disorders.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> The freely available app provides users with an electronic meal, behaviour and emotion protocol function, and the opportunity to browse and enter coping strategies. The app assesses the &#x02018;when, where, what, with whom&#x02019; of any meal the user entered, asks if the user was hungry and if she felt sated after the meal. Additionally, the intensity of several emotions and the urge to or actually engage in maladaptive emotion regulation behaviours (eg, bingeing, purging, self-harm) is assessed at every data entry. Users can specify times for automatic reminders to fill in the meal protocol. The data can be shared by email with the user&#x02019;s personal therapist. The growing number of users as well as their positive feedback shows the high acceptance rate of the original Jourvie app.</p><p>For the SELTIAN study, we enhanced the Jourvie app by implementing an additional EMI module. In this Jourvie Research version for Android smartphones, the EMA part consists of the standard meal and emotion protocol of the Jourvie app. Furthermore, a visual analogue slider was added to assess current aversive tension from 0 to 100, as the EMI part of the application will be triggered by the intensity of aversive tension at the time data are&#x000a0;entered. If a value of aversive tension &#x0003e;50 and &#x0003c;70 is entered, the app will advise the user to use an individual skill for reduction of aversive tension and to facilitate a regular eating behaviour. If a value of aversive tension &#x0003e;70 is entered, the app shows a short instruction for an individual skill of the high distress category. The skills will be trained in the intervention sessions and a short instruction on how to apply this particular skill will be uploaded automatically onto the smartphone of the participant once the counsellor has entered the skill instruction into the server database. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows screenshots of the Jourvie Research EMA and EMI modules.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Screenshots of the Jourvie Research application as used in the intervention group.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018049f01"/></fig><p>Each meal and emotion protocol will be uploaded immediately after completion to a server of the University Medical Centre of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Germany. The counsellors will have online access to the individual protocols of their participants at any point in time and can print the protocol before the consultations to review them with the participants. The connection to the server database will be protected by SSL encryption. After uploading the data, the local copy of the meal and emotion protocol on the smartphone will be deleted for data safety reasons.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Treatment arms</title><p>After randomisation, participants will be enrolled in one of two treatment arms. For 3&#x02009;months, participants will receive psychiatric sessions by a counsellor with a master&#x02019;s degree in psychology, a medical doctor or equivalent. A child and adolescent psychiatrist or a licensed psychological psychotherapist experienced with DBT will supervise the counsellors. Ideally, each patient will receive all sessions from the same counsellor. All counsellors will receive a thorough explanation on how to obtain individual protocols from the database and how to upload skill instructions onto the smartphones of the participants.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows the study flow diagram and gives an overview of the treatment arms. In each treatment arm, three standardised sessions will be held in the first 6&#x02009;weeks of the intervention. Each session should last 50&#x02009;min, depending on the needs of the participant and her parents. After the initial 6-week phase, participants will receive follow-up sessions on at least a monthly basis, depending on the severity of the disorder and the initial weight gain in the first 6&#x02009;weeks. At each session, the participant will be weighed in underwear.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Study flow chart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018049f02"/></fig><sec id="s2f1"><title>Control condition</title><p>In the control condition, a meal plan and a target weight will be established with the participant during the first session.

Unlike the smartphone-enhanced treatment condition, these strategies will focus on a &#x02018;treatment as usual approach&#x02019; to increase weight rather than on reducing aversive tension.

Additionally, the participant will be introduced to the skill instruction function of the application. &#x02018;Skills&#x02019; in this context are DBT-informed emotion regulation techniques, which aim at reducing aversive tension primarily, as restrictive eating is considered a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy to reduce aversive tension.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 24</xref> A first skill to facilitate regular eating behaviour during meal times will be taught and discussed with the participant and finally a short description of the skill will be entered into the application, if necessary. The skills can be either individualised (eg, the participant states that listening to her favourite song helps her in eating a whole meal) or taken from a list of helpful skills given to all counsellors in the study. The skills on this list are derived from the emotion regulation, mindfulness and stress tolerance chapters of the DBT skills manuals for adults and adolescents<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48 49</xref> and grouped into two categories (skills for aversive tension of 50&#x02013;70 and skills for aversive tension &#x0003e;70). The participant will be advised to fill in the meal and emotion protocols thoroughly until the next session and to make use of the skill whenever necessary or recommended by the application.</p><p>In the second session, the counsellor will evaluate the meal and emotion protocol together with the participant to identify particular situations in which disordered eating or compensatory behaviour occurred. Furthermore, the counsellor will focus on the use of the skills taught in the last session and modify the ones already known or teach new skills in relation to the specific problem behaviour which impedes weight gain.</p><p>During the third session, the meal and emotion protocol will be reviewed again and adjustments to the meal plan and/or the individual skills list will be made. If time is available, individual topics can be discussed. The following sessions will be similar to the third session, always starting with a review of the protocol, adjusting the individual skills if necessary and allowing time for individual

In addition, as this is a trial during waiting time, it is assumed that several participants will drop out of the treatment when they start regular outpatient psychotherapy within the 3&#x02009;months duration of the study. Therefore, the primary outcome will be analysed by intention-to-treat with a last-observation-carried-forward procedure (ie, all participants who completed baseline, randomisation and at least one consultation will be included in analysis).

Two recent reviews of the literature on smartphone apps for eating disorders could not identify any RCTs testing the outcome of these apps.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> Our expectations are that using Jourvie Research as a monitoring and intervention app in a guided setting will increase BMI-SDS and decrease aversive tension of the participants significantly during the waiting time for treatment. However, we do not expect that a smartphone app will render psychotherapy obsolete.</p><p>A notable strength of the study is that it allows a direct intervention in a naturalistic setting (ie, a skill provided exactly when needed). The participant enter valuable data for the assessment in the next session, and&#x000a0;the therapist can provide the participant with new skills depending on feedback from previously tested skills. This might be essential for behavioural change, as an earlier study on patients with binge-eating disorder using EMA as a treatment tool did not find any effects on behaviour.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In particular, time-congruent recording of aversive tension and the presentation of skills may have a beneficial effect on adolescents when they use a smartphone in contrast to paper and pencil approaches. In addition, electronically recording meal protocols might reduce stigmatising conditions compared with filling in a paper-based protocol during lunch in a restaurant. Comparing our trial with other EMA studies in the field of eating disorders, the possibility to use the participants&#x02019; own smartphone for data capture and intervention might offer more accurate and complete data, especially of adolescents.</p><p>A considerable limitation is that Jourvie Research relies on user input for triggering EMIs. Taking advantage of the sensor data of a smartphone might increase chances that the intervention is presented in the moment of need. However, the reliability of sensor data (eg, of the smartphone itself or wearables such as smartwatches, activity trackers) has to be tested before integration. Due to the automatic trigger of an intervention, the skill presented in Jourvie research might not be applicable in the given situation for the participant (eg, a skill using ice cubes might not be applicable during school). We tried to minimise these difficulties by offering skills which are in general applicable during meals and do not rely on additional tools (eg, ice cubes, chili peppers).</p><p>Another limitation is that the number of psychiatric consultations with a clinician is allowed to vary between the participants. Adolescents with AN require different amounts of care depending on the current physiological health, motivation to change and the current BMI. A flexible consultation schedule accounts for these needs and increases ecological validity of the study. However, this degree of freedom might confound the results, if a systematic group effect regarding the number of consultations or a significant correlation of consultations with the BMI-SDS occurs. To minimise a systematic effect, the number of consultations is fixed in the first 6&#x02009;weeks (comparable to a training phase) and only based on the individual needs of the participant in the remaining time. On a statistical level, group differences regarding the number of consultations will be assessed and included into the analyses as a covariate if systematic group differences occurred. Finally, assessing the direct influence of the smartphone application on the primary outcome might be difficult, as the intervention and control treatments differ on several levels. However, the impact of the smartphone application can be estimated by assessing whether a high number of completed protocols (measuring the use of the app) is correlated with any of the outcome measures.</p><p>Several ethical concerns need to be discussed when an EMI is conducted. First of all, participants can only agree to the treatment on a general level, as interventions will be triggered automatically, even if the participant does not explicitly wish to receive any intervention in this specific moment. However, we assume that by allowing participants to dismiss a certain intervention or report the intervention as &#x02018;not helpful&#x02019;, the participant has sufficient control over the intervention. Second, by using smartphones and internet connections, data safety must be guaranteed as far as possible. To maximise the safety of the health data of our participants, we rely on encrypted data transfer and data storage on the smartphones of the participants. In addition, every data entry will be deleted on the participants&#x02019; smartphone once the data were successfully transferred to the servers of our research department. Hence, the risk that health data can be read in case of theft of the smartphone and decryption of the Jourvie Research app is reduced to a minimum.</p><p>Considering adverse effects in mhealth or smartphone treatments for eating disorders, several potential risks are conceivable: there is a potential risk that monitoring food intake might increase restrictive eating when participants are confronted with a subjectively too large amount of food intake during their day which otherwise would have remained unnoticed. This is of particular concern as any meal protocolling app can be used as a weight loss app when assessing whether food intake was reduced to the previous day. In addition, AN is often associated with perseverance and perfectionism.<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> Participants with high levels of these personality traits might not benefit of a meal protocol app as they might focus more rigidly on controlling and protocolling their meals and behaviour than on changing their behaviour based on the protocols. To minimise this risk, the app does not allow reviewing previous meal protocols, and calorie content of food intake is not assessed explicitly. Furthermore, all participants will review their protocols directly with a clinician to increase the motivation to change based on their previously protocolled behaviour.</p><p>A potential outcome of our study in favour of the intervention with the smartphone app might encourage researchers to investigate other interventions enhanced with smartphones for eating disorders and other mental disorders. Implementing the results of this trial into practice could result in better overall outpatient psychotherapy outcomes in AN if psychotherapy could focus on the underlying cognitive and emotional causes from the start rather than stabilising the weight of the patient during the first sessions. However, this remains speculative and needs to be evaluated once an implementation into practice is made.</p><p>In conclusion, the SELTIAN trial offers the opportunity to assess the efficacy of a low-threshold intervention enhanced with a smartphone app for adolescents with AN. If a positive effect of the intervention with the smartphone app on the BMI is found, assessing the efficacy of a smartphone app as a treatment add-on for outpatient treatment of AN and other eating disorders should be considered. Given that AN is a disorder which is hard to treat, especially in an outpatient setting with only low-frequent face-to-face sessions, it is hard to predict if our intervention will directly affect weight gain.
