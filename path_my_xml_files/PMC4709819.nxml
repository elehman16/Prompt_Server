Religious beliefs are important sources of comfort and support for many cancer patients and their families. The present study aimed to assess the effect of educational-spiritual intervention on burnout of the parents of the children with cancer.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>In this randomized clinical trial, 135 parents of children with cancer were randomly assigned into intervention and control groups. Data were collected through SMBQ (Shirom and Melamed Burnout Questionnaire) from both groups, before, immediately after and one month after the intervention. Educational-spiritual programs were held for six weeks, one session every week. The data were analyzed by SPSS using independent t-test, and repeated measure ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The results showed that the mean burnout score before the intervention in the intervention group was 4.28&#x000b1;0.61 and in the control group it was 4.23&#x000b1;0.50; most of the parents reported moderate to high burnout. But, there was a significant difference between the intervention and control groups immediately after and one month after the intervention (t=10.16, P&#x0003c;0.0001). The mean burnout score in the intervention group was less than the control group.

The mortality rate due to cancer in this age group has been decreased during the last three decades so that from 9.4 per a hundred thousand people in 1975 decreased to 2.2 in 2008. The five-year survival rate for all cancers in children has been increased so that from 58% of diagnosed cases in 1975 to 1977 increased to 83% in 2001 and 2008.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>Cancer is a debilitating disease and its treatment comprises a part of the lives of the patients and their families. This disease leads to a cycle of psychosocial problems for both patients and their families. Thus, cancer patients and their families need evaluation and support as to their emotional reactions against their life-threatening disease.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>When cancer is diagnosed in a child, his parents experience a crisis. Previous studies have demonstrated that parents encounter high levels of stress h which is more than when they themselves suffer from a disease. Furthermore, the treatment of the disease and its complications will be followed by a long period of stress for the parents.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Treatment of cancer is a period of chronic stress for the parents of these children. Thus, stress reactions, such as anxiety, depression, and mental symptoms, increase in parents in the active phase of the disease.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Studies showed that parents&#x02019; reactions to the diagnosis of cancer in their child included feelings of loneliness, loss of control, and instability which even after years after completion of the treatment may stay in the parents of the children with cancer.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Considering the fact that cancer is a chronic disease putting parents under long-term stress, incidence of mental reactions in parents of the children with cancer is not quite unexpected.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Burnout occurs when a person is exposed to prolonged and severe stress. It interferes with an individual&#x02019;s role forming the core of his character.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Burnout may also occur when a person is exposed to severe emotional stress.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Studies revealed that the parents of children with chronic diseases have shown the symptoms of burnout more than those of healthy children.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Parents struggling to cope with stressful situations depend on availability and use of appropriate sources of support including information, social support, appropriate use of funds and their employment status.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Providing the parents with clear information about the disease and its treatment in order to gain a sense of control over the situation and develop an appropriate plan is helpful.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Religious beliefs are an important source of comfort and support for cancer patients and their families and its role is more important when a child is diagnosed with cancer. When parents face a severe disease, suffering and death of a child, they need something beyond the material world for comfort and solace.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Dealing with cancer is a difficult experience for cancer patients and their families. Spirituality plays an important role in coping with life-threatening conditions of cancer patients.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>The diagnosis of cancer in children has adverse effects on their parents so psychological support and attention to them is essential. In addition, nurses have more contact with patients and their families and understand the necessity of more attention to their spiritual needs. Since no researches have been done in this field in Iran, we decided to investigate the effect of the educational-spiritual intervention on the burnout of the parents of school age children with cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This randomized clinical trial aimed to assess the effectiveness of educational-spiritual intervention on burnout of parents of school-age children with cancer from December 2013 to July 2014.</p><p>Based on the study by Norberg<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and considering the mean difference with 95% confidence interval, power of 80%, standard deviation of 10.5, and least acceptable difference of 5, a 140-subject sample size was determined for the study (70 subjects in each group). Yet, considering the loss rate, the sample size was increased to 135 subjects (65 in the intervention and 70 in the control group). Thus, 59 fathers and 76 mothers were enrolled in the study.</p><p>The inclusion criteria of the study were being 6-12 years old, diagnosis of cancer by a specialist, passage of at least 6 months and at most 2 years from cancer diagnosis, parents&#x02019; ability to read and write, signing written informed consents for taking part in the research, not being an only child, taking part in all educational sessions, not experiencing stress or other crises within the study period, parents&#x02019; burnout score&#x0003e;3.75, and being under treatment by chemotherapy, radiotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. On the other hand, the exclusion criteria of the study were child&#x02019;s death, unwillingness to continue participation in the study, and diagnosis of other chronic diseases in children or parents.</p><p>In order to select the subjects, all the parents of school-age children with cancer who had inclusion criteria were recruited based on convenience sampling. Then, in order to allocate the parents into the study groups, a simple random allocation was used. At first, random numbers of 1 and 2 were given to the control and intervention group, respectively. Then, numbers 1 and 2 were put in two balls in a box. When the parents who had the inclusion criteria were recruited, from the box, one of the balls was randomly selected. Based on the drawn out number, the subjects were randomly allocated into the control or intervention groups.

The researchers referred to the setting of the study, introduced themselves to the relevant ward, and chose the samples based on qualifications. After obtaining their written informed consents to participate in research, the demographic information and burnout questionnaire was presented to them.</p><p>Data were collected by the demographic questionnaire and Shirom and Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ). This questionnaire is composed of 22 questions in 4 domains of Physical fatigue, Cognitive weariness, Tension, and Listlessness. Each question has 7 options, from option 1 (almost never) to option 7 (nearly always) and the participant should choose an option among them. Five of the items have reversed scoring, one item in the tension domain three in the listlessness domain, and one in the physical fatigue domain. For each sub-domain, and the scale as a whole, the total score is averaged by dividing it by the number of items in the domain.</p><p>The threshold score is equal to 3.37. In other words, scores above 3.37 represent high burnout (scores&#x02265;4.47 represent pathologic condition) and those below 2.75 are considered as healthy.<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> At first, the original questionnaire was translated into Persian and investigated by expert professors. Then, it was back-translated into Swedish, the two questionnaires were compared, and the necessary modifications were applied. The evaluation of reliability of the questionnaire was obtained using test re-test=0.9; the internal consistency of the questionnaire using Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha coefficient was 0.91.</p><p>Then, the intervention was administered for the intervention group. The intervention method consisted of six educational sessions each lasting 45 minutes of lecture, question and answer in groups of 7 to 10 people; one-week interval was between the sessions and the educational topics included an introduction to cancer disease, the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, the side effects of various treatments and its control, daily activity, diet and spiritual teaching like philosophy of life and death and life after death, divine fate acceptance, patience and fortitude which was held by a religious advisor.</p><p>The outcome measure of this study was the burnout of the parents which was completed before and after intervention and one month after the intervention in both groups. During the study five participants in the intervention group dropped out related to death of the child (n=1) and did not attend the intervention sessions (n=4).

The results of a previous study showed that the prevalence of burnout was higher in parents of children with chronic illnesses compared to those of healthy children.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Also, the results of another study on parents of children with brain tumors demonstrated that more than half of the mothers and 20% of the fathers of these children had symptoms of burnout.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> One other study which was conducted on parents of children with cancer revealed that parents mostly used an adaptive approach of spiritual support (96%).<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>The mean age of the parents was 32 years in this study and 30-39 years in the aforementioned one.<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Nowadays, providing care regardless of spiritual dimension is almost impossible because patient satisfaction is significantly associated with emotional and spiritual care. Studies have shown that 41 to 94 percent of patients have wanted doctors and nurses to pay attention to their spiritual concerns and their trust was more to those medical staff who more focused on their spiritual needs.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>This study showed that the mean scores of parental burnout reduced from 4.28&#x000b1;0.61 before the intervention to 3.25&#x000b1;0.68 after the intervention in the intervention group. It has been reported in many of the studies that families having religious beliefs have a better adaptability with their child&#x02019;s cancer. In fact, these families may interpret the disease based on the philosophy of religion and understand it as God&#x02019;s will. These people receive emotional and psychological support from their beliefs. The parents who are faced with the stressful situation, like having a child with cancer, in order to reorganize the family system, seek information from the doctors, nurses, health care workers and various textbooks that help them determine their position. The amount and quality of the information that the parents have about their child&#x02019;s illness, problems that may be encountered and possible effects of the disease on all stages of life all affect the process of adaptation.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>The results of a previous study showed that most of the parents with children at end stages of life-threatening diseases considered religion and spirituality as an important support during tough times. They believed that God provided them with help and support and participation in religious ceremonies calmed them down. However, some parents were angry with God and were against religion and religious beliefs.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> One other study also demonstrated that spirituality and religious beliefs reduced disappointment, suicidal thoughts, and depression in the patients at the final stages of cancer.<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>Since nurses have more contact with patients, they understand the necessity of more attention to their spiritual needs. They have noted that if they want to have a holistic view of their action, they can&#x02019;t ignore the spiritual matters. Spirituality is perhaps the most basic and at the same time the least well known holistic nursing dimension.<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>According to the treatment group, attention to the spiritual and psychological needs of parents is essential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>The results of this study indicated that spiritual-educational teaching can reduce burnout in parents of children with cancer. Due to the close relationship of nurses with patients and their families, this study helps them by considering the spiritual needs of patients and their families, so they take a major step in reducing the severity of burnout and their psychological and spiritual problems. Since the findings of each study can be a basis for later researches, it is recommended that the researches should evaluate the effects of spirituality on other spiritual psychological problems such as depression.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGEMENTS</sc></title><p>We would like to thank the medical staff of Amir Hospital, parents who participated in this study and all the people who helped us to conduct the research.
