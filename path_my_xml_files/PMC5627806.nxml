Recently, automated tube current modulation (ATCM) has emerged as an important technique to reduce radiation exposure. Many studies have shown that the difference in scout view would affect modulation. This prospective randomized controlled study is aimed to investigate the impact of an additional lateral scout view on radiation dose and image quality in CT using ACTM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods:</title><p>Combined with ATCM (Care Dose 4D) on multidetector CT, 2 thoracic phantom CT image series were acquired in which planning was conducted with either an anteroposterior (AP) or an AP-lateral scout view. Also, 410 patients underwent thoracic CT examinations using Care Dose 4D modulation and were randomized to either a scan planned with an AP-lateral scout or a single AP scout. Effects of the different scout views on applied effective milliampere seconds (mAs), volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose&#x02013;length&#x02013;product (DLP) were analyzed.

Tube current is varied on the basis of a scout view and real-time feedback of actual attenuation during rotation. The type of scout views used have a great impact on the level of radiation exposure with ATCM.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> The manufacturer (Siemens Healthcare, Germany) indicates that ATCM uses information of all valid topograms to calculate milliampere seconds values. A previous report has suggested using lateral scout views for planning CT to reduce radiation dose,<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> but attenuation information in the anteroposterior (AP) direction is merely an estimate and inaccurate. A recent study using cadavers has shown that using 2 orthogonal scout views (AP and lateral) for ATCM could reduce radiation dose more than a single AP scout view.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the clinical utility of an additional lateral scout view or its impact on image quality. Thus, we conducted a prospective, randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of AP + lateral to programs to single-view AP to programs on radiation dose and image quality using ATCM.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study protocol and patients data</title><p>This randomized controlled clinical study was designed according to the CONSORT 2010 statement.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> This study was approved by the Institutional Medical Ethics Committee of West China Hospital of Sichuan University (No. 2014-163), and written informed consents, which included enduring the level and reaction of radiation exposure, were obtained from all patients prior to the CT examination.

The study also revealed that when an additional lateral scout view is used, the radiation dose at different off-center positions remained essentially constant.</p><p>The phantom study revealed that radiation dose decreased by approximately 50% at the isocenter when an AP-lateral scout view was used. As the table height changed, radiation doses increased by 34% at the highest table position (closest to the x-ray tube) and decreased by 32% at the lowest table position associated with AP scout view. These results support the findings of previous studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup></p><p>The ATCM implemented by Siemens (Care Dose 4D) automatically modulates the tube current in relation to patient size and attenuation characteristics together with real-time angular dose modulation during the scan. The technique uses scout views to estimate patient size and automatically adapts radiation dose by matching the actual patient to a reference patient. The tube current will be reduced for smaller patients and increased for larger patients.</p><p>The aforementioned changes in radiation dose occurred possibly because moving the phantom away from the gantry center in the vertical direction results in magnification or reduction of scout views.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Consequently, inappropriate patient centering may overestimate or underestimate patient habitus, thereby causing a change in radiation dose. However, the radiation dose on different off-center positions was essentially unchanged when an AP-lateral topogram was used. According to the manufacturer, Care Dose 4D evaluates the topogram for attenuation in the AP and lateral directions, and calculates the appropriate axial tube current profiles. Using a single AP scout view, the attenuation information from only 1 direction is obtained, and the attenuation in the perpendicular direction is estimated sophistically. By using an AP-lateral topogram, Care Dose 4D can more accurately measure the attenuation and the geometrical width along the patient's long axis.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Accordingly, using an AP-lateral topogram avoids misestimating the patient's habitus to some extent.</p><p>In terms of the ALARA principle, it has always been a hotspot in CT research to reduce the radiation dose. Lowering tube potential is the most simple and direct method,<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> but too low of a tube potential may increase noise and change the tissue contrast. In 1997, Hopper et al<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> proposed that incremental breast shields could substantially reduce dose. But researchers noted that shields will generate more image noise, artificially augment attenuation values and produce streak artifacts.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, organ-based tube current modulation techniques can yield nearly the same amount of dose reduction to the breast without increasing image noise.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Iterative reconstruction is a postprocessing technique that can lower dose significantly while maintaining image quality.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> However, blotchy and pixilated artifacts have been observed on some images.</p><p>ATCM systems are now commonly used to reduce radiation exposure.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> Our finding that radiation dose decreased by 50% when an AP-lateral scout view was used is similar to the results of Rodrigues et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> who combined a routine AP scan with an additional lateral scout view in CT pulmonary angiography. Their findings indicated that an additional lateral topogram could reduce scan length and thereby significantly reduce organ dose. In a cadaver study, Singh et al<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> recently also found that, compared with using an AP scout view alone, incorporating an additional lateral scout view significantly reduced radiation dose in thoracic and abdominal CT. Unfortunately, these authors did not compare image quality. Radiation dose reduction frequently is accompanied by loss of image quality due to increasing noise. In our study, the mean objective quality score was significantly decreased on an AP-lateral scout view compared with using an AP scout view alone. Nevertheless, qualitative image quality was rated as equal. Therefore, the differences in objective image quality seem to be inappreciable for clinical diagnosis.</p><p>In the analysis of patients who had received a CT scan in the previous year using a single AP scout view, we found a 45.5% reduction in the CTDIvol and up to a 78.9% reduction in the maximum dose. The dose reduction was only 12.4% in 1 patients and that could potentially be linked to that his weight gain exactly equal to 2&#x0200a;kg between 2 medical examinations.</p><p>Other than the different scout views having an impact on the radiation exposure, other factors may have affected our results. The 2 groups did not differ with regard to baseline patient characteristics or with regard to scan parameters; however, scan length did differ between the 2 groups, and scan length has a direct influence on DLP. In patient scans planned on AP-lateral scout views, scan lengths were significantly shorter than those planned on AP-only scout views. This might be because the lateral topogram can display the base of the lungs more clearly.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> When the AP topogram was used alone, it was sometimes difficult to identify the base of the lungs. In the phantom study, the differences in DLP between the 2 protocols were not due to scan length because scan length was held constant.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, our study included only healthy individuals who underwent medical examination at our hospital, so we did not compare the capacity of the 2 different protocols to discriminate lesions from surrounding normal tissue. Secondly, we restricted our study to evaluating the effect of an additional lateral topogram on radiation exposure and image quality during a nonenhanced scan. Hence, the reliability of multiphase CT scanning and the ability to diagnose lesions needs to further investigated. Thirdly, we only used ATCM techniques in this study. The combined use of ATCM and automated tube voltage selection might allow further reduction of radiation exposure while maintaining good image quality. We plan to conduct additional studies to determine the impact of automated tube voltage selection on reducing radiation exposure.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our study shows that by combining a routine AP scout view with an additional lateral view using the Care Dose 4D, radiation dose can be significantly reduced without impacting image quality. Hence, using an AP-lateral topogram is a simple and feasible method to achieve lower radiation doses during chest CT screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge Jin Pu and Yuming Li for their great support.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ALARA = as low as reasonably achievable, AP = anteroposterior, ATCM = automated tube current modulation, BMI = body mass index, CI = confidence interval, CNR = contrast-to-noise ratio, CT = computed tomography, CTDIvol = volume CT dose index, DLP = dose-length-product, ED = effective dose, GFR = glomerular filtration rate, ROI = region of interest, SD = standard deviation, SNR = signal-to-noise ratio, WL = window level, WW = window width.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This work is supported by the Science and Technology Support Project in Sichuan Province (2017SZ0016) of China and the Chengdu Science and Technology Project (2010FZ0017).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Etard</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Tellier</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Bissonnet</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
