Dysphagia prolongs hospital length-of-stay <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and slows recovery; in part secondary to the complications of malnutrition and dehydration. Although many patients recover from dysphagia following stroke <xref rid="bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr">[3,4]</xref>, a proportion remain chronically dysphagic, dependent on modified diet and/or enteral feeding. In addition to impaired quality-of-life, patients with long-term dysphagia remain at risk of malnutrition, dehydration and aspiration pneumonia. Moreover, while speech and language therapists have employed a variety of labor intensive compensatory maneuvers to treat chronic dysphagia, there is very little evidence of their effectiveness <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Recent evidence has given insight into the cortical and sub-cortical brain areas, activated during the highly coordinated sensorimotor activity of swallowing <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In dysphagia literature, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have shown that the pharyngeal motor cortex (MI) reorganizes following acute unilateral stroke, and that an increase in cortical excitability in the unaffected hemisphere is associated with the recovery of swallowing function <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Consequently, the development of novel rehabilitative approaches to drive beneficial changes in cortical and subcortical activity, hence promoting improved swallowing function, remains a major imperative <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Recently, peripheral stimulation of the pharynx (pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES) <xref rid="bib9 bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr">[9&#x02013;11]</xref>, and cortical stimulation by repetitive TMS (rTMS) <xref rid="bib12 bib13 bib14 bib15 bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr">[12&#x02013;17]</xref>, or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) <xref rid="bib18 bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr">[18&#x02013;20]</xref>, or the combination of both peripheral and central stimulation (paired associative stimulation, PAS) <xref rid="bib21 bib22" ref-type="bibr">[21,22]</xref>, have been used in acute and chronic dysphagic stroke research studies in an attempt to both modulate cortical activity and induce or promote functional improvements in swallowing. Several study protocols have been proposed from different laboratories with varying parameters, intensity frequency and targeted specific muscle groups (i.e. mylohyoid <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, upper esophageal area <xref rid="bib13 bib17" ref-type="bibr">[13,17]</xref>).</p><p>The aim of our study was to compare the effects of a single application of one of three neurostimulation techniques (PES, PAS, rTMS) on swallowing safety and neurophysiological mechanisms in chronic dysphagic stroke.

Given the individual characteristics of each intervention, our results merit further discussion.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Neurophysiological and behavioral changes in chronic stroke patients following the different neurostimulation paradigms</title><p>Bilateral increases in cortical excitability were evident after the application of 2 of the 3 real neurostimulation paradigms. The greatest increase was observed in the unaffected hemisphere, while an overall reduction in penetration-aspiration scores was found when real stimulation was compared to sham, particularly for both real PAS and PES, accompanied by changes in swallowing transfer timings (pharyngeal response time (PRT)).</p><p>Interestingly, the two neurostimulation paradigms, PES and PAS, which mainly employ peripheral stimulation, showed associated increases in cortical excitability of the affected hemisphere, and curiously this took place at different time-points (immediately following PAS and 30&#x000a0;min following PES). Although difficult to explain without neuroimaging studies, we could speculate that these two neurostimulation techniques promote or enhance cortical inter-hemispheric connectivity via different mechanisms in timing or cortical fiber recruitment.</p><p>Repetitive TMS did not achieve significant increases in brain excitability when applied to the unaffected pharyngeal projection compared to sham. Intriguingly, while there was a visible increase in brain excitation following real rTMS, there was also an increase with sham rTMS; suggesting some biological effects of sham stimulation on cortical function. Previous studies have advocated the sham rTMS method of coil tilt <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. but there is evidence suggesting that subclinical stimulation is possible and indeed measurable <xref rid="bib31 bib32" ref-type="bibr">[31,32]</xref>. Nonetheless, the lack of difference between real and sham rTMS in brain excitation may also explain the lack of behavioral effect. Alternatively, it might be speculated that as PES and PAS produced bilateral cortical effects due to the peripheral component of the two neurostimulation techniques, while the effects of a single application of rTMS may not have been adequate to produce bilateral increases and improve functional outcome. In the literature, the beneficial effects of 5&#x000a0;Hz rTMS on swallowing motor cortex were observed following a repeated application of the technique over a period of weeks suggesting that more persistent doses of rTMS are required for beneficial and long lasting effects on swallowing <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>A significant correlation between increases in swallowing safety (reduced cumulative penetration-aspiration scores) and increases in unaffected hemisphere excitability was observed, supporting the contention that functional behavioral changes in swallow are mostly driven by improvements in the undamaged circuitry. Hence, our findings continue to support the notion that in (unilateral) stroke, successful neurorehabilitation treatments should both target and promote compensatory changes in the undamaged/unaffected cortex. The unexpected finding that cortical excitability of the affected hemisphere increasing in tandem with an increase in cumulative penetration-aspiration scores, might be of importance for future directions of research. It might be speculated that the long-term neuroplastic changes occurring in the affected hemisphere following stroke might be of maladaptive nature, not facilitating the process of functional recovery, or that priming the undamaged pharyngeal motor system in the chronic phase may assist the affected hemisphere to participate in the process of recovery. It might also be contended that unilateral increases in swallowing activity might be more functionally useful in dysphagia recovery, although the bilateral increases in brain swallowing activity with PES and PAS, both of which were associated with improved swallowing, would be against this notion. Future longitudinal neurophysiological studies in dysphagic stroke patients might provide additional information on how the unaffected hemisphere operationalizes physiological processes several months post-ictus or to what extent the activity of the corticobulbar projections from the affected and adjunct to the lesion areas might be employed for the restitution of adaptive function, in conjunction with the unaffected hemispheric projection.</p><p>Since there is limited data on the exact physiologic mechanisms that drive recovery in stroke, it is not surprising that studies focusing on neurostimulation technologies have targeted either affected or unaffected hemisphere without clear rationale. Our contention that excitatory stimulation applied to unaffected cortex is likely to produce greatest benefit was also the rationale by Park et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> who recently targeted that hemisphere with 5&#x000a0;Hz rTMS employing a therapeutic regimen of 2 weeks.</p><p>By studying chronic stroke patients, the confounding effect of spontaneous recovery of function post-ictus was also reduced. Our results show that neurostimulation affects neuronal activity even after a single application in chronic stroke patients, who usually present a plateau in their ability to change behaviorally. In the literature, the time-window for functional restoration following stroke is not clear. However, several factors may play a role in any restorative process in the chronic stage, such as the timing and exposure to restorative treatments during the acute stage of recovery <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In animals, even weeks and months after a plateau following the acute phase, there is potential for change <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. However, plastic reorganizational changes in chronic dysphagic stroke patients may involve different mechanisms, implicating the need for longitudinal studies to understand the recovery mechanisms.</p><p>Notably, we were only able to study a carefully selected but well-characterized sample of chronic dysphagic stroke patients, so it is not possible to generalize our results to a wider more heterogenous population of chronic dysphagic patients. Although we used specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, there was still some heterogeneity in the dysphagia severity amongst the patients in each group, which may have contributed to the less favorable results following rTMS. Moreover, a cross-over design was employed, with patients serving as their own control. The wash-out period of treatments used in cross-over designs is of importance, however, results from studies in health <xref rid="bib10 bib11 bib12 bib21" ref-type="bibr">[10&#x02013;12,21]</xref> showed that a single application does not promote effects more than 2&#x000a0;h post-intervention. High variability in biomechanics and transport bolus timings was observed, which may be a result of the small sample sizes per treatment arm. Inter-subject differences in swallowing patterns are more overt in stroke, with the majority of chronic dysphagic patients requiring artificial feeding to retain nutritional levels. Compensatory strategies during swallowing are usually employed, a factor, which by itself may produce additional changes in neurophysiology.</p><p>To conclude our preliminary results suggest that even a single application of some types of neurostimulation (PES and PAS) when applied to dysphagic chronic stroke patients can lead to changes in corticobulbar excitability and associated behavioral changes, such changes in penetration-aspiration scores. Further studies are required to elucidate the optimum stimulation paradigms with additional classifiers such as the severity of dysphagia, as well as different location and sizes of lesions, which might reduce the increased heterogeneity in the results. Finally, this study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of the interventions in patients with chronic dysphagia following stroke and provides information on likely recruitment rates and effect sizes for the design of a future clinical trial.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Finlayson</surname><given-names>O.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kapral</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Asllani</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Selchen</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Saposnik</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Risk factors, inpatient care, and outcomes of pneumonia after ischemic stroke</article-title><source>Neurology</source><volume>77</volume><year>2011</year><fpage>1338</fpage><lpage>1345</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21940613</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Altman</surname><given-names>K.W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>G.P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Schaefer</surname><given-names>S.D.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Consequence of dysphagia in the hospitalized patient: impact on prognosis and hospital resources</article-title><source>Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg</source><volume>136</volume><issue>8</issue><year>2010</year><fpage>784</fpage><lpage>789</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20713754</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Smithard</surname><given-names>D.G.</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Neill</surname><given-names>P.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Parks</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Morris</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Complications and outcome after acute stroke.
