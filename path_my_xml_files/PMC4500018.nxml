cough flow in patients with cervical spinal cord injury. [Subjects] Twenty-six patients
were included in the study and were randomized into experimental (n = 14) and control (n =
12) groups. [Methods] Both groups performed therapeutic exercises: the control group
performed incentive spirometry, while the experimental group performed 20 repetitions of
air stacking exercise twice a day. The training for both groups continued for 5 days a
week for 6 weeks. [Results] Forced vital capacity and peak cough flow increased
significantly in the experimental group compared to the controls. All within-group
variables in the experimental group differed significantly at 6 weeks compared to
baseline, while in the control group only Forced vital capacity differed significantly at
6 weeks compared to baseline. [Conclusion] Air stacking exercise significantly improved
pulmonary function and peak cough flow in patients with a cervical spinal cord injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Air stacking exercise</kwd><kwd>Cervical spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>Respiratory rehabilitation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The number of respiratory complications experienced during initial acute-care
hospitalization for cervical spinal cord injury (CSI) is a more important determinant of the
length of stay and hospital costs than degree of the injury<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In patients with CSI, the inability to cough out airway secretions
effectively is the main cause of respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure
leading to death, because effective coughing is an important host defense mechanism for
clearing the airway<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The phases of
coughing can be classified as inspiration, compression, and expiration. During the
inspiration phase, normal subjects have pre-cough volumes that are 85&#x02212;90% of their
inspiratory capacity<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Air stacking (AS)
exercise increases the capacity to stack air with deep insufflations and can improve cough
effectiveness<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have
focused on patients with congenital or progressive diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS) and Duchene muscular dystrophy. Therefore, this study evaluated how AS
affects pulmonary function and peak cough flow (PCF) in patients with CSI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The recruitment period for this study was from August to October 2014. This study was
approved by the Inje University Faculty of Health Science Human Ethics Committee and all
subjects provided written informed consent before participating. Thirty CSI patients who
understood the details of the study consented to participate. Subjects averaged 47.58 &#x000b1;
11.74&#x02005;years of age, 164.73 &#x000b1; 17.19&#x02005;cm in height, and 56.69 &#x000b1; 14.12&#x02005;kg in weight, and had an
average body mass index (BMI) of 54.00 &#x000b1; 13.74. Patients were excluded if they had
concomitant intrinsic lung diseases, could not hold their breath due to vocal cord
paralysis, were intubated or had a tracheostomy, or took medications that affected pulmonary
function. The 30 patients who consented to participate were randomized into two groups using
computer-generated tables. The randomization codes were kept by an independent member of the
study team and released after consent was obtained. The subjects were assessed by a physical
therapist who was blinded to all group information. The control group performed 20
repetitions of incentive spirometry (IS) twice a day, while the experimental group performed
20 repetitions of AS twice a day. Both groups trained for 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. During
the 6-week study, one subject from the experimental group and three subjects from the
control group were excluded based on the exclusion criteria, therefore, a total of 14
subjects in the experimental group and 12 subjects in the control group completed the
study.</p><p>Pulmonary function was assessed using MicroLab (Micro Medical, Cambridge, UK). Forced vital
capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) were measured in accordance
with the American Thoracic Society guidelines<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. PCF was assessed using a peak flow meter (Micro Medical, Cambridge,
UK). PCF has been used as a measure of huff strength, and the effectiveness of airway
clearance depends largely on PCF<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version
12.0 (SPSS; Chicago, IL, USA). The statistical significance level was set at &#x003b1; = 0.05. The
homogeneity of the general characteristics between the two groups was analyzed using the
&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test and independent t-test. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to confirm the
homogeneity of the variables between the two groups before the experiment. Differences in
the changes within each group from baseline to 6 weeks were assessed using two-way repeated
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the variables between the two groups</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" valign="top" align="left" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="3" align="center" valign="middle" colspan="1">Group</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Baseline</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After 6 weeks</th><th rowspan="3" align="center" valign="middle" colspan="1">Source</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean (SD)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean (SD)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FVC</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exp</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.49 (0.81)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.85 (0.91)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">time*</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(L)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cont</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.67 (0.77)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.83 (0.76)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">group, time*</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FEV1</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exp</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.41 (0.84)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.69 (0.87)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">time*</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(L)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cont</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.41 (0.84)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.62 (0.82)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">group*, time</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PCF</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exp</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">204.2 (128.7)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">260.7 (126.0)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">time*</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(L/min)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cont</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">239.5 (142.4)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">249.1 (109.7)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">group*, time*</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*p&#x0003c;0.05</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap> compares the variables for the two groups before and after the experiment.

and PCF increased significantly (p &#x0003c; 0.05) in the experimental group compared to the

only FVC differed significantly at 6 weeks compared to baseline (p &#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Kang et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a daily
program of AS in patients with neuromuscular disease increased maximum insufflation capacity
and assisted PCF. Additionally, the extent of the increase in maximum insufflation capacity
correlated with an increased assisted cough flow. It is likely that both of our groups
showed significant increases in FVC because both exercises increased lung capacity.
Additionally, AS maintained pulmonary compliance by inflating the lungs maximally in the
experimental group. Consequently, the increase in FVC in the experimental group was
significantly more than that in the control group. Marques et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> instructed 18 patients with neuromuscular disease to perform
routine AS at home for 4&#x02013;6 months and found that PCF increased significantly by 9.9%. In our
study, the increase in PCF was 27.3% in the experimental group versus 4.2% in the control
group. The difference in the results of these two studies can likely be attributed to the
different types of patients included as well as differences between the locations of patient
management. Neuromuscular disease is a progressive congenital disease, while CSI is caused
accidentally. Additionally, Marques et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> managed their subjects at home, so the effects of intervention might
have been less than in subjects managed in hospital. Park et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that among patients with CSI, PCF was correlated
with inspiratory muscular function. It is likely that our experimental group obtained higher
PCF values because AS training for 6 weeks improved inspiratory capacity more effectively
than IS.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, the number of subjects was small, and it is
difficult to generalize the results because the study was performed in a single center.
Second, all the subjects had cervical cord injuries only, so we cannot apply our results to
other pathological conditions. In conclusion, in patients with CSI, AS exercise led to
significantly improved pulmonary function in terms of PCF.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Berlly</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Shem</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Respiratory management during the first five days after
