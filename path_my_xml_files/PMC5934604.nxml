Subjects</title><p>This was an experimental study carried out at a tertiary care hospital in Mumbai from December 2014 to October 2016. The procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. The study was approved by the Hospital Review Board of Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital (IRB number: IEC-15/2014). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before enrolment into the study. Patients with anticipated difficult colonoscopies were included and divided into 3 groups: (1) individuals with BMI &#x0003c;18 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, (2) individuals with BMI &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, or (3) individuals who had undergone abdominal or pelvic surgery (other than colonic). The exclusion criteria were age less than 18 years, or presence of renal or cardiopulmonary disease. These patients were allocated to air, water, or carbon dioxide insufflation by a computer generated random number table. Sedation was given upon patient's request. Only patients with bowel preparation grade &#x0003e;5 on the Boston bowel preparation scale and without any colonic obstruction precluding complete colonoscopy were included in the final analysis.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The primary endpoint was cecal intubation with pain score (visual analogue scale, VAS) &#x0003c;5 (moderate pain) without sedation. Secondary outcomes were cecal intubation rate and time, pain scores at the rectosigmoid junction, splenic flexure, hepatic flexure, and during withdrawal, and use of other maneuvers such as pressure and change of position during colonoscopy. Subgroup analyses for primary and secondary end points were carried out in the 3 study groups: BMI &#x0003c;18 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, BMI &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and post-surgical cases.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Study Procedure</title><p>This was a randomized, experimental study of the patients undergoing colonoscopy at our center and fulfilling the above inclusion and exclusion criteria. Procedures were performed by 2 endoscopists experienced in colonoscopy for 2 years. Each had performed at least 400 colonoscopies before the study. Patients took a low-volume split-dose preparation regimen of 2 L of polyethylene glycol. Half the dose was taken at night before the procedure, and the rest in the morning.<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Demographic data (age, sex, and BMI), previous abdominal surgery, main indication for colonoscopy, co-morbidities, and current medications was recorded. The VAS for pain was explained before the procedure and patients were asked to give feedback during the procedure when asked. Colonoscopy was performed in the left lateral position without sedation. An Olympus series CV-150 (Tokyo, Japan) colonoscope was used. Alphaflator (Om surgicals, Mumbai, India) with maximum pressure of 45 mmHg and flow rate of 25 L/min was used for carbon dioxide insufflation. Endopump (Mitra Industries Pvt. Ltd., Faridabad, India) with a capacity of 5 L was used for water insufflation. Water used was at room temperature, i.e., 32&#x02103; to 37&#x02103;. Cecal intubation was defined as passage of the colonoscope into the cecum with visualization of the cecal wall and appendiceal orifice. Cecal intubation time was defined as the time for passage of the colonoscope from the anus to the cecum to the closest minute. During withdrawal, air was used for air and water insufflation and carbon dioxide for carbon dioxide insufflation. Withdrawal was defined as the time for passage of the colonoscope from the cecum to the rectum. Withdrawal time took at least 6 minutes was taken.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Pain was recorded by an assistant at the rectosigmoid junction, splenic flexure, hepatic flexure, and during withdrawal, using the VAS (0, no pain; 5, moderate pain; and 10, unbearable pain).<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A note was made of abdominal pressure and change of position during the procedure. The pain score was calculated as an average for all patients reported at the corresponding flexure or bend. Sedation was induced on demand. Patients with poor bowel preparation (Boston bowel preparation scale &#x02264;5) and those with colonic obstruction prior to cecal intubation were not included in the final analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>3. Study Endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint was successful cecal intubation with pain score less than 5 on the VAS (mild pain), without sedation. Secondary outcomes were cecal intubation rate, cecal intubation time, pain scores at the rectosigmoid junction, splenic flexure, hepatic flexure, and during withdrawal, and use of maneuvers such as abdominal pressure and change of position.</p></sec><sec><title>4. Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). <italic>P</italic>-values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant. Demographics (age and sex) were compared between insufflation groups using Pearson's chi-square contingency table, and BMI was compared using one-way ANOVA with <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis (Sidak correction). The primary end point, cecal intubation rate, abdominal compression, and change of position were compared for insufflation groups using Pearson chi-square contingency table. The mean pain score, pain scores at the rectosigmoid junction, splenic flexure, hepatic flexure, and during withdrawal were compared using one-way ANOVA with <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis (Sidak correction).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>1. Patient's Characteristics</title><p>A total of 167 patients (air, 56; carbon dioxide, 56; and water, 55) met the inclusion criteria for the study. Of these, 158 had adequate bowel preparation, i.e., Boston bowel preparation scale &#x0003e;5 (air, 54; carbon dioxide, 51; and water, 53). Five patients had colonic narrowing due to stricture/mass precluding complete colonoscopy (air, 2 and carbon dioxide, 3). Hence, 153 patients were included in the final analysis (air, 52; carbon dioxide, 48; and water, 53). Patient characteristics and subgroup distributions (BMI &#x0003c;18 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and post-surgical) were comparable in the air, carbon dioxide, and water insufflation groups. However, the carbon dioxide group had a higher percentage of females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>2.

However, these were done without discriminating difficult colonoscopies from others. Few studies have exclusively assessed the superiority of insufflation methods in difficult colonoscopies. Difficult anatomy for colonoscopy has been broadly classified into 2 types: the narrow, angulated colon and the redundant colon.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In a study by Takahashi et al.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> of 848 patients undergoing colonoscopy, it was observed that lower BMI, younger age, intubation time, preparation status, and previous gynecologic surgery were predictors of difficult cecal intubation. Having a lower BMI or previous pelvic surgery predisposes the patient to a narrower, angulated distal colon.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In the obese patient, cecal intubation has been found to be prolonged due to excessive looping and the requirement of maneuvers and even a prone position to complete colonoscopy.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In our study, we included 3 groups of the patients with anticipated difficult colonoscopies: patients with BMI less than 18 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and more than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and patients who had undergone non-colonic abdominal or pelvic surgery. We subjected them to either air, water, or carbon dioxide insufflation, and studied the pain scores at each flexure, along with the cecal intubation time and rate.</p><p>Air insufflation causes pain during intubation as it elongates and distends the colon. Water insufflation reduces pain by weighing down the sigmoid, hence straightening it and decreasing colonic spasm.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Water-aided colonoscopy is of 2 types: water immersion, in which water is infused at insertion and removed during withdrawal, and water exchange, in which both infusion and suction of water are performed during insertion to minimize distension. Water exchange has been shown to be superior to water immersion, causing less pain and minimizing the sedation requirement.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In our study, we used the water immersion technique, as it had a smaller learning curve as compared to water exchange, and the study was performed by trainees. We found that 9% of the patients in the air group required sedation as opposed to 2.2% in the water group.</p><p>Carbon dioxide insufflation can reduce gas combustion.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It is absorbed 150 times faster than nitrogen from the bowel, resulting in less pain and ischemia.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Castell reviewed 21 randomized controlled trials comparing air and carbon dioxide insufflation, and observed that there was reduced pain and faster cecal intubation in the carbon dioxide group.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> We did not obtain similar results in our study. In a randomized controlled trial by Garborg et al.,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> carbon dioxide insufflation was compared with water exchange and water insufflation, and was associated with less pain.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> We had similar results in our study. A few studies have compared insufflation methods in patients with anticipated difficult colonoscopy.</p><p>Luo et al.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> studied patients who had undergone previous abdominal or pelvic surgery. Water insufflation showed better cecal intubation rates (92.7% vs. 76.4%) and lower pain scores (2.1&#x000b1;1.8 vs. 4.6&#x000b1;1.7), as compared to air.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In our study, we observed that pain scores were lower for water as compared to air or carbon dioxide, but the cecal intubation rate did not differ between the 3 groups. Patients with a low BMI, i.e., &#x0003c;18 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and those who have undergone pelvic surgery tend to have a sharply-angulated left colon. Both these groups benefit from water-aided colonoscopy, as it straightens the left colon. Vemulapalli and Rex<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> evaluated patients with redundant colons and found less need for maneuvers in the water immersion group. We did not find significant differences in achieving primary endpoints in the group with BMI &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The obese patients tend to have redundant colons that permit loop formation in both sigmoid and transverse colons. Water-aided colonoscopy tends to straighten the left colon but might not reduce transverse colon loop formation. Since we did not objectively assess loop formation in the study, we cannot verify these assumptions. Although the primary endpoints were more often achieved with water-aided colonoscopy (46.7%, 56.3%, and 78.6% in the air, carbon dioxide, and water insufflation groups; <italic>P</italic>=0.750), the difference was not significant. We found that frequent abdominal compression and change of position was required to complete the colonoscopy, irrespective of the method of insufflation.</p><p>In our study, we compared the pain scores at each bend, instead of determining a total score, and found that negotiation of the left colon was better tolerated in the water insufflation group, whereas pain score at the hepatic flexure did not differ between the 3 groups.</p><p>We observed that the use of carbon dioxide during withdrawal resulted in less pain, as compared to the use of air on withdrawal. This correlates with the findings of a study by Cadoni et al.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>The limitations of our study are that the colonoscopists were not blinded and the carbon dioxide group included more women than the other 2 groups. Our study highlights techniques in anticipated difficult colonoscopies. This will aid in choosing appropriate insufflation techniques in clinical practice.</p><p>In conclusions, water insufflation was superior to air or carbon dioxide insufflation for pain tolerance in the left colon. This trend was seen in the subgroup with BMI &#x0003c;18 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and the post-surgical group, but not in the group with BMI &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The cecal intubation rate or time did not significantly differ across the insufflation groups. The group with BMI &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> frequently required use of maneuvers for colonoscopy completion.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>FINANCIAL
