This has resulted in continuous research in analgesic effects and underlying drug mechanisms. Confounders such as underlying diseases, comedication, and psychological status provide an inhomogeneous population in clinical studies, and therefore, it can be complicated to demonstrate analgesic effects. In contrast, human experimental pain models offer opportunities to evaluate underlying analgesic mechanisms in standardized laboratories, where reproducible stimuli can be applied and the pain can be assessed quantitatively.<xref rid="b1-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, human experimental pain studies have also demonstrated variable results regarding opioid effects, and not all compounds with known analgesic properties are effective in all experimental models.<xref rid="b2-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Therefore, identification of appropriate experimental pain models can be critical for facilitating the rational clinical development of novel analgesic compounds and drug formulations.<xref rid="b4-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>To assess several elementary attributes of the stimuli in the experimental pain model, it has been recommended to use a battery of stimulations (multi-modal) in several tissues (multi-tissue), rather than a single stimulation.<xref rid="b5-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This approach will complicate the experimental procedure, emphasizing the importance of having consistent, standardized laboratory facilities and experienced research staff available, providing reliable methods.<xref rid="b1-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Identifying combinations of experimental models and clinical validation seems to be the direction for the development of experimental pain models toward predictive tools in drug development.<xref rid="b6-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>The different methods can be divided into phasic and tonic models based on the nature and duration of the different methods.<xref rid="b7-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Phasic pain models induce fast and sharp pain predominantly transmitted by A&#x003b4; fibers; whereas tonic pain models induce slow and dull pain transmitted primarily by C fibers.<xref rid="b7-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Animal studies have demonstrated that opioids preferentially attenuate nociceptive responses produced by C fiber activation.<xref rid="b9-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Additionally, human studies have shown that pain models including C fiber activation and/or characterization of endogenous pain modulation and/or increased affective component are more sensitive to opioids.<xref rid="b1-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Despite this, most investigations on analgesic effects have been performed using models of phasic pain in superficial tissues.<xref rid="b2-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Therefore, the aim was to investigate the effect of the gold standard opioid, morphine, on a battery of phasic and tonic pain stimulations in a multi-modal, multi-tissue, human experimental pain study in a group of healthy volunteers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The Ethics Committee for the Region of Northern Jutland (reference no N-20100046) and the Danish Medicines Agency (reference no 2612&#x02013;4319) approved the study, which was carried out in the Research Laboratory at Mech-Sense, Department of Gastroenterology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark. The study was conducted in the period November 2010 to April 2012.</p><p>The trial was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT01245244, EUDRACT no 2010-020894-17). The study was monitored according to the rules of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) by the GCP unit Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.</p><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty participants were enrolled by a medical doctor, gave their informed consent and were compensated for participation. Inclusion criteria were: 1) age between 20 and 65 years; 2) opioid na&#x000ef;ve, ie, has not recently taken an opioid medication regularly; 3) no known allergy to study medication; 4) no ongoing participation in other drug studies; 5) not pregnant; 6) no previous addictive behavior; 7) no previous pain causing diseases or psychiatric disorders. All included woman were on safe contraceptive medication during the study. Before inclusion, a medical doctor conducted a routine health screening for each participant, ruling out any pain-related conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study protocol</title><p>A double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover, single-dose study was conducted with at least 1-week washout intervals. A pharmacist not involved in the study generated a randomization list by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">http://www.randomization.com</ext-link>; all participants were randomized into four blocks to receive morphine or placebo on day 1 or day 2. The same pharmacist handled the morphine oral mixture and secured and documented that all participants received the correct medication for specific periods. Thus, the experimenters and the participants were fully blinded for randomization. One-week washout intervals were chosen to ensure that the morphine was fully excreted before the second study period. Each participant fasted at least 6 hours prior to the study. Prior to the first dosing day, a training session, including all experimental pain procedures was conducted, in order to familiarize the participants with the laboratory environment and to verify that the participants could tolerate the comprehensive experimental pain-testing procedure. The study was controlled for menstrual cycle so that each woman was investigated in the same phase of her individual menstrual cycle. All testing was performed by well-trained experimenters in a quiet room. The same experimenter tested each participant at the same time of the day on both study days.</p></sec><sec><title>Medication</title><p>Each participant received morphine 30 mg (2 mg/mL) as an oral solution or placebo. The color and taste of the solution was masked by adding 5 mL of orange juice concentrate to the solution; hence, the total amount of one dose was 20 mL (15 mL morphine solution or pure water [placebo] and 5 mL of orange juice). Oral solution was used instead of tablets to avoid variability in dissolution of the tablets.</p></sec><sec><title>Pain assessment</title><p>Somatic stimulations were interrupted when the participant reported &#x0201c;pain tolerance threshold&#x0201d; (PTT). A modified numerical/categorical analog scale for assessment of nonpainful and painful sensations was used for the rectal stimulations and for the cold pressor stimulation. The scale is a continuous scale from 0 to 10, where 5= the pain detection threshold (PDT). This scale has been validated for reliability and robustness, and is described in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="b11-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Pain-testing procedures</title><p>A comprehensive multi-modal, multi-tissue, pain-testing program was performed, including pain thresholds and pain intensity ratings. A variety of pain models were selected to cover both superficial and deep pain as well as phasic and tonic stimulations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jpr-7-717">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-7-717">Figure 1</xref>). Hereby, sufficient resting periods were included in the protocol and the risk for sensitization was diminished.</p></sec><sec><title>Skin stimulation</title><sec><title>Thermal</title><p>Thermal heat stimuli were applied by a contact heat-evoked potential stimulator (CHEPS; Medoc Ltd, Ramat Yishai, Israel), placed 10 cm distal to the elbow on the right forearm. The start temperature was set to 32&#x000b0;C and the temperature increase was set at 1&#x000b0;C/s. Participants were asked to press a button at PTT, and immediately afterward, the thermode cooled down to 32&#x000b0;C, with a cooling rate of 10&#x000b0;C/s. This was repeated three times, and the average stimulus intensity (&#x000b0;C) was calculated and used for further data analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Muscle stimulation</title><sec><title>Mechanical</title><p>Pressure was applied to the supinator muscle on the left forearm, 15 cm distal to the elbow by a handheld electronic pressure algometer (Somedic AB, Stockholm, Sweden) with a standard probe of 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. The pressure increase rate was 30 kPa/s and the algometer was set with a safety maximum of 2,000 kPa. The stimulation was interrupted when the participants reported PTT and the maximum stimulus intensity (kPa) was noted and used for further analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Bone stimulation</title><sec><title>Mechanical</title><p>The mechanical stimulation was conducted on the right tibia bone, 10 cm distal to the patella by a handheld electronic pressure algometer (Somedic AB) with a specially designed probe of 3.1 mm<sup>2</sup> (Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark).

The rectal probe has been validated and is described in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="b14-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Prior to the experiment, a 5 mL enema with 2 mg/mL bisacodyl (Toilax<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Orion Pharma, Espoo, Finland) was administered. A lubricated anoscope (Cat No E-03. 19. 925; Heine Optotechnik, Herrsching, Germany) was placed in the anal canal and through this, the probe was placed in the rectum 20 cm from the anal sphincter. All data were displayed online (Openlab; GMC, Hornslet, Denmark) and stored for later analysis.</p><sec><title>Mechanical</title><p>For mechanical stimulation of the rectum, the bag was inflated with 37&#x000b0;C water from a water bath (Julabo VWR 5; Julabo, Labortechnik GMBH, Seelbach, Germany) controlling the temperature. A peristaltic pump (Type 111; Ole Dich Instrumentmakers, Hvidovre, Denmark) was used to inflate the bag at a rate of 200 mL/minute. Three distensions to the PDT were performed with a 1-minute interval to precondition the tissue. Hereafter, a single distension to &#x0201c;moderate pain&#x0201d; was performed. The bag was emptied at the same rate as it was inflated. The volumes in the bag (mL) at PDT and at moderate pain were noted and used for further analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrical</title><p>For the electrical stimulation, two stainless steel bipolar electrodes mounted on the tip of the rectal probe with an inter-electrode distance of 2 mm were connected to a computer-controlled constant current stimulator (Digitimer Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, UK). Impedance was kept below 3 k&#x02126; to ensure sufficient mucosal contact. The electrical stimulation intensity slowly increased in increments of 1.0 mA increments. To blind the participant, sham stimulations with same or lower intensities were included. Stimulus intensities (mA) at PDT and at moderate pain were noted and used for further analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Thermal</title><p>Before thermal stimulation, 60 mL of 37&#x000b0;C water was added to the polyester urethane bag of the probe. The temperature elevation was reached by recirculation of 68&#x000b0;C water through the bag. A water bath (VWR 5; Julabo) controlled the temperature in the closed circuit. A peristaltic pump (Type 111; Ole Dich Instrumentmakers) circulated the water at a flow rate of 150 mL/minute, and a temperature sensor (Buhl &#x00026; B&#x000f8;ns&#x000f8;e AS, Virum, Denmark) was located in the inflated bag. During thermal stimulation, the anal canal was shielded with the anoscope in order to minimize stimulation of somatic tissue. The temperature increased until the participants reported moderate pain, and immediately hereafter, the heated water was withdrawn to minimize discomfort for the participant. Thermal stimulus was computed as area under the time&#x02013;temperature curve.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Cold pressor test</title><p>For the cold pressor stimulation, a cold pressor test apparatus (Grant instruments; Fischer Scientific, Slangerup, Denmark) was used. The participants immersed their left hand into the 2&#x000b0;C cooled water up to the wrist for 2 minutes. The participants rated the perceived pain continuously on the electronic handheld device.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data were baseline corrected before statistical analysis.

Factors for these two-way ANOVAs were: 1) treatment and 2) time. For rectal electrical and mechanical stimulations, analyses were performed at two pain levels (PDT and moderate pain). These data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA, where factors were: 1) treatment and 2) pain level. When outcome measures were only assessed at one time point (60 minutes after drug administration), one-way ANOVA was used for statistical analysis (mechanical bone stimulation, rectal thermal stimulation, and the cold pressor test). Stata software (v12.1) was used for analysis. <italic>P</italic>-values of &#x0003c;0.05 were considered significant.</p><p>As this study investigated the effects of morphine on multiple endpoints, a precise calculation of sample size for each endpoint was not possible. A sample size was estimated based on data from a previous study, from our group,<xref rid="b27-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> of opioid effect assessed by heat stimulation of the skin in healthy volunteers, as skin heat stimulation was hypothesized to be the least sensitive outcome.

Thirty-nine participants finalized the study and were included in further analyses.</p><sec><title>Side effects</title><p>Three participants experienced morphine side effects to such a degree that the experiment was interrupted. They reported dizziness, tiredness, and intense pain in the epigastrium radiating to both sides. In total, 26 of 39 participants experienced side effects due to the morphine treatment (nine reported nausea, 23 reported dizziness, four reported itching, and two reported sweating).

Opioid effects on heat pain have been tested through various stimulation paradigms and conflicting results exist.<xref rid="b1-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In the present study, the heat stimulation was stopped at moderate pain, meaning that it was more intense than a stimulus stopped at pain detection. It has been assumed that an A delta-mediated nociceptive component will show increasing dominance at high-intensity heating<xref rid="b16-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and it has previously been demonstrated that for heat stimulation, pricking pain by A delta fibers was felt at the end of the stimulation at high intensities.<xref rid="b17-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Therefore, in the present study, it could be speculated that A delta fibers were activated in the noxious range. Thus, the fact that no morphine analgesia was demonstrated may reflect the limited effectiveness of attenuating the A delta-mediated nociceptive component. Thus, in future experimental pain studies of morphine effects, it is not recommended to use high-intensity stimulations for heat stimulation of the skin by the method of limits. Instead, the heat PDT should be used. Furthermore, it is known that morphine will inhibit longer duration stimulation at lower doses than short duration stimulation,<xref rid="b5-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and it could be speculated that a higher dose of oral-administered morphine or an intravenous approach may be effective on skin heat pain. Finally, different thermodes were used in different studies, and even when the skin surface temperature is controlled, stimuli applied with different methods are not necessarily comparable.<xref rid="b1-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b18-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Muscle pain</title><p>Morphine reduced deep muscle pain in the present study. The majority of A delta and C fibers in muscles serve as polymodal nociceptors,<xref rid="b19-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and findings may be caused by a combined effect. This finding contradicted a previous study by Schulte et al,<xref rid="b20-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> in which no morphine effect was seen in a deep muscle pain model. However, this study only included 15 healthy volunteers, and methods for pain induction were different as they used repeated intramuscular electrical stimulation and muscular infusion of hypertonic saline for induction of tonic muscle pain. In the present study, the maximum effect on muscle pressure pain was found 45 minutes after oral administration. Hence, the findings correspond well with the time it takes for morphine to reach the central nervous system, where the majority of opioid receptors in supraspinal components of the pain-modulating circuit are responsible for analgesic effect.<xref rid="b21-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Bone pain</title><p>Opioids are not the first choice of treatment for bone pain, but are often used when pain is intense and severe.<xref rid="b22-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Bone is innervated differently from the skin by A delta and C fibers.<xref rid="b23-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The terminals of these fibers mostly contain polymodal receptors.<xref rid="b24-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The posterium is therefore very sensitive to a variety of stimuli, where mechanical activation is the most clinically relevant. Thus, bone pressure was included in the present study as a model of pain stimulation in deep tissue. As the results were only marginally significant, bone pain stimulation may be less sensitive to opioid effects, and results should be more cautiously interpreted.</p></sec><sec><title>Visceral pain</title><p>In this study, a comprehensive visceral model, stimulating the rectum offered possibilities of multi-modal stimulations. The model has previously been shown to be reproducible<xref rid="b14-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and suitable for studying pharmacological interventions in healthy controls.<xref rid="b14-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> External validity of the model of rectal distention has previously been demonstrated, as patients have reported that discomfort of pain induced by rectal distension was similar to their irritable bowel syndrome symptoms.<xref rid="b25-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In contrast, the model for electrical stimulation of the rectum is less relevant to a definable group of patients. Electrical pain is phasic, and intense electrical stimuli excites all peripheral fibers in a nondifferential fashion.<xref rid="b8-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Thus, analgesic effects of opioids on this dynamic endpoint have previously only been demonstrated in patients with chronic pain, suggesting that an upregulated pain system is needed for demonstration of analgesic effect.<xref rid="b1-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The most reliable proxy of thermal energy load to the tissue is assessment of the area under the temperature curve,<xref rid="b26-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> which was used in the present study. However, no morphine analgesia could be demonstrated. This finding was supported by two previous visceral studies from our group, in which no effects of morphine were demonstrated when stimulating the esophagus with heat.<xref rid="b27-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Thus, the results may be explained by the phasic nature of this stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Cold pressor pain</title><p>Activation of descending inhibitory pathways preferentially attenuates C fiber activity, and exogenous opioids affect descending pain modulation.<xref rid="b29-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Opioid sensitivity to the cold pressor model (affecting descending inhibitory pathways) has also previously been reported.<xref rid="b3-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b30-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Thus, the temporal configurations of the stimulus in addition to the different types of primary afferents being stimulated could contribute to the higher sensitivity of the cold pressor test to detect the analgesic effect of opioids.<xref rid="b3-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Sensory versus affective pain</title><p>Different modalities of experimental noxious stimuli can also be described according to their characteristic contributions to the sensory and affective components of the evoked pain.<xref rid="b31-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> For example, the unpleasantness evoked by heat and electrical stimulation of the skin was less than that evoked by the cold pressor test,<xref rid="b31-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> suggesting that tonic pain models affect these psychophysical parameters (eg, anxiety and catastrophizing) to a higher degree and consequently mimic clinical pain to a higher degree. It has been suggested that morphine more potently attenuates the affective component as compared to the sensory component.<xref rid="b32-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Hence, the cold pressor test, which is very sensitive to morphine, is known to involve strong affective and autonomic components.<xref rid="b34-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>In the present study, all primary endpoints (tonic pain stimulations) provided significant results and no adjustment for multiplicity was made.<xref rid="b35-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> It is well-known that different opioids exert different mechanisms in both experimental and clinical settings.<xref rid="b36-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Additionally, different administrations and dosing intervals will affect the outcome. Hence, it cannot be excluded that other findings would be seen if different opioids or doses were administered. It should therefore be emphasized that this discussion was based exclusively on a single oral dose of morphine if nothing else was stated.</p><p>Dropouts in quantitative sensory testing studies are not unusual. For example, a high rate of dropouts (64%) in a 60-second long cold pressor test has been reported in an aged matched group of participants.<xref rid="b37-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> However, in the present study, 87% did not withdraw their hand. Finally, it should be noted that analgesic effects of a drug may be assessed in several ways: effect on latency to pain onset; effect on peak pain intensity; effect on area under the pain intensity curve; and effect on time to threshold.<xref rid="b30-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b38-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Different assessments could also affect model sensitivity.<xref rid="b4-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The use of the modified rating scale was recently supported by a study with a rating scale ranging from &#x0201c;no sensation&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;unbearable pain&#x0201d;, allowing participants to rate stimulus intensities that are perceived but are not painful, and may reduce bias and be more reliable for experimental pain assessment.<xref rid="b39-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p><p>The fact that 34 of 93 screened healthy volunteers were not willing to participate after further information and consideration indicates a study selection bias, and hence, results may not reflect the Danish population. However, as participation is voluntary, experimental pain studies will always be affected by such study selection bias.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Recommendations</title><p>Several factors should be considered when planning an experimental human pain study for assessment of analgesic effects.<xref rid="b1-jpr-7-717" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Using multi-modal tests and multi-tissue stimulations, the present study confirmed that: 1) deep stimuli should be included to mimic the clinical situation; 2) tonic stimulations should be used rather than phasic stimulations to evaluate pain intensity before and after drug administration; and 3) models involving activation predominantly of C fibers should be included.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Pain models with deep tonic stimulation including C fiber activation and/or endogenous pain modulation were more sensitive to morphine analgesia. To avoid false negative results in future studies, we recommend inclusion of reproducible tonic pain models in deep tissues, mimicking clinical pain to a higher degree.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The study was supported by the Danish Council for Strategic Research and Det Obelske Familiefond.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The funding sources for this work were not involved in the conduct of the study or in the development of the submission.
