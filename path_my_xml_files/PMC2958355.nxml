The sample comprised 39 subjects, of whom 20 received the drug and 19 received placebo. The two groups were sociodemographically and clinically similar at baseline. At 2 and 6 weeks follow-up, data from approximately 85% of patients in each group were available for analysis. Statistical trends favouring the drug were observed at both time points. At 6 weeks, significantly more patients met a priori response criteria in the drug group (88.2%) as compared with the placebo group (50%). The drug was well-tolerated and did not occasion more adverse effects than did placebo. It is concluded that this ethanolic extract of Withania somnifera has useful anxiolytic potential and merits further investigation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anxiety disorder</kwd><kwd>generalized anxiety disorder</kwd><kwd>adjustment disorder with anxiety</kwd><kwd>panic disorder</kwd><kwd>Aswagandha</kwd><kwd>Ayurvedic treatment</kwd><kwd>herbal therapy</kwd><kwd>clinical trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
