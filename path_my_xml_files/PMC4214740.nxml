In murine models of myocardial infarction, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists reduce infarct size. Using gene deletion and pharmacological approaches, it has been shown that extracellular formation of the endogenous nucleoside adenosine is crucial for this protective effect. We now aim to translate this finding to humans, by investigating the effects of the selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eplerenone on the vasodilator effect of the adenosine uptake inhibitor dipyridamole, which is a well-validated surrogate marker for extracellular adenosine formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results</title><p>In a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study we measured the forearm blood flow response to the intrabrachial administration of dipyridamole in 14 healthy male subjects before and after treatment with placebo or eplerenone (50 mg bid for 8 days). The forearm blood flow during administration of dipyridamole (10, 30 and 100 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;dl<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was 1.63 (0.60), 2.13 (1.51) and 2.71 (1.32) ml&#x000b7;dl<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> during placebo use, versus 2.00 (1.45), 2.68 (1.87) and 3.22 (1.94) ml&#x000b7;dl<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> during eplerenone treatment (median (interquartile range); <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.51). Concomitant administration of the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine attenuated dipyridamole-induced vasodilation to a similar extent in both groups.

This is caused, at least in part, by &#x02019;lethal reperfusion injury&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0111248-Yellon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Therefore, novel therapeutic options to further limit ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury are urgently needed to improve outcome in these patients.</p><p>It has been suggested that the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists spironolactone and eplerenone could potentially serve this goal, because these drugs reduce mortality in patients with heart failure <xref rid="pone.0111248-Pitt1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0111248-Zannad1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Indeed, recent studies in murine models of myocardial infarction have shown that MR antagonists can directly limit infarct size <xref rid="pone.0111248-LoanLe1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0111248-Chai1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and have beneficial effects on left ventricular remodeling <xref rid="pone.0111248-vandenBorne1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111248-KesslerIcekson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The underlying mechanisms of the infarct size-limiting effect are not yet fully understood, but it has been suggested that the endogenous purine nucleoside adenosine is crucially involved. Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside, which is formed by intra-, and extracellular degradation of adenosine monophosphate by the enzyme ecto-5&#x02019;-nucleotidase (CD73). Degradation of adenosine only occurs in the intracellular compartment. As a consequence, facilitated diffusion of adenosine over the cellular membrane by the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) is normally directed inwards. Stimulation of membrane-bound adenosine receptors (A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2A</sub>, A<sub>2B</sub>, and A<sub>3</sub>) induces various effects, including vasodilation, inhibition of inflammation, and protection against IR-injury. Indeed, endogenous adenosine acts as a key mediator of the infarct size-limiting effect of several drugs, including statins and metformin <xref rid="pone.0111248-Riksen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111248-Paiva1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. A recent series of experiments, using genetic and pharmacological approaches in mouse and rat models of myocardial infarction, convincingly demonstrated that the cardioprotective effects of the MR antagonists eplerenone and canrenoate were crucially dependent on extracellular adenosine formation by CD73 and adenosine receptor stimulation <xref rid="pone.0111248-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Based on these previous animal studies, we now hypothesize that MR antagonists increase the extracellular adenosine concentration by activating CD73, which has previously also been reported for statins <xref rid="pone.0111248-Meijer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and we aim to test this hypothesis in humans <italic>in vivo</italic>. Measurement of circulating endogenous adenosine is extremely difficult <xref rid="pone.0111248-Ramakers1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, because the half life of adenosine in blood is very short, due to rapid uptake and degradation by circulating erythrocytes <xref rid="pone.0111248-Moser1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Therefore, we used the vasodilator effect of the ENT inhibitor dipyridamole as a read-out for endogenous adenosine formation by CD73, as previously described by our group <xref rid="pone.0111248-Riksen2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111248-Meijer2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The results of this study will give novel insight into the pharmacology of MR antagonists, which can be used to optimize pharmacological cardioprotective strategies, for example avoid the use of adenosine receptor antagonists, such as caffeine, in patients treated with MR antagonists.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111248.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111248.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Study population</title><p>After approval by the Institutional Review Board of our centre, we included 14 healthy male volunteers.

Study medication was taken bid during 8 days. We advised the participants to have a diet low in potassium. On the 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> day of treatment, we measured forearm blood flow (FBF) with the use of venous occlusion plethysmography. After a wash-out period of at least 4 weeks, the participants crossed-over to the alternative treatment arm.

In animal models of myocardial infarction, MR antagonists limit infarct size when administered either prior to ischemia or just before the onset of reperfusion, and protect against cardiac remodeling, as reviewed by van den Berg <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0111248-vandenBerg1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>The underlying mechanism of the beneficial effects of MR antagonists in patients is not yet understood. However, results from animal studies suggest that extracellular adenosine formation is crucial for the protective effect of MR antagonists against myocardial IR injury. In an elegant series of experiments in mice and rabbits, Schmidt et al. showed that the MR antagonists canrenoate and eplerenone reduce infarct size in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, by using pharmacological approaches and models of targeted gene deletion, the investigators convincingly demonstrated an important role for endogenous adenosine in the cardioprotective effect. The infarct size-limiting effect of canrenoate was completely abolished in CD73 knock-out mice and in adenosine A<sub>2b</sub> receptor knock-out mice. Similar results were obtained in isolated rat hearts. In rats, administration of eplerenone at 10 &#x000b5;M at the moment of reperfusion resulted in a reduction of the infarct size from 40 to 10%, which was completely blocked by co-administration of the adenosine receptor blocker 8p-sulfophenyladenosine <xref rid="pone.0111248-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Based on this series of experiments, we hypothesized that the selective MR antagonist eplerenone increases extracellular formation of adenosine, by activation of the enzyme CD73. Interestingly, increased endogenous adenosine receptor stimulation has also been implicated in the cardioprotective effect of other drugs, including statins, methotrexate and metformin <xref rid="pone.0111248-Paiva1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111248-Sanada1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111248-Asanuma1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>It is difficult to investigate the potential effects of drugs on endogenous adenosine because the half life of adenosine in blood is extremely short due to rapid uptake and degradation of adenosine by erythrocytes and endothelial cells <xref rid="pone.0111248-Riksen2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In a normal physiological situation, the transmembranous adenosine concentration gradient drives extracellular adenosine into the cytosol <xref rid="pone.0111248-Deussen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The ENT-inhibitor dipyridamole inhibits this facilitated diffusion and thereby increases the extracellular adenosine concentration, which can subsequently activate membrane-bound adenosine receptors at the site of adenosine formation <xref rid="pone.0111248-Riksen2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111248-Riksen3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. These observations justify the use of dipyridamole-induced vasodilation as a read-out of extracellular adenosine formation. We have previously shown, using a similar experimental design as the present study, that rosuvastatin augments dipyridamole-induced forearm vasodilation and post-occlusive reactive hyperemia and limits forearm ischemia-reperfusion injury via adenosine receptor stimulation <xref rid="pone.0111248-Meijer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111248-Meijer2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Moreover, rosuvastatin increased the activity of CD73 on circulating human mononuclear cells <xref rid="pone.0111248-Meijer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we could not confirm a relation between treatment with eplerenone and the extracellular adenosine system in healthy humans <italic>in vivo</italic>. We showed that a one-week treatment with eplerenone 50 mg bid does not potentiate dipyridamole-induced vasodilation and does not affect PORH after 2 and 5 minutes of arterial occlusion. These findings are in sharp contrast to the previous observations in animal models of myocardial infarction <xref rid="pone.0111248-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>How can this discrepancy be explained? First, it has been recognized that many promising findings in animal study cannot be confirmed in human studies <xref rid="pone.0111248-vanderWorp1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In general, this translational failure can be explained by methodological shortcomings in animal studies, e.g. the lack of a formal sample size calculation, selection bias due to the lack of randomization, unblinded researchers, and inadequate statistical analyses <xref rid="pone.0111248-vanderWorp1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The scientific basis for our hypothesis is based on only one preclinical study by Schmidt et al <xref rid="pone.0111248-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This study, however, described a series of experiments in which a pivotal role for endogenous adenosine in the infarct size-limiting effect of the MR antagonists canrenoate and eplerenone was consistently observed in different animal species and by using various methodological approaches, including pharmacological inhibitor studies and gene deletion models. Translational failure could also result from fundamental differences between the animal models and the human situation. With regard to adenosine metabolism, it is known for fundamental differences exists between rats and humans (e.g. the rat ENT1 transporter is less sensitive to inhibition with dipyridamole than the human ENT1) <xref rid="pone.0111248-Yao1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, other drugs that modulate adenosine levels seem equally effective in humans and in animal models <xref rid="pone.0111248-Meijer2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111248-Sanada1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111248-Asanuma1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111248-Riksen4" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Thirdly, a major difference in drug concentration between the animal studies and the human situation is often present. In our study, the circulating eplerenone concentration immediately before the intake of the last medication dose (trough concentration) averaged 0.17 &#x000b5;g/ml (0.41 &#x000b5;M). Given a bioavailability of 70%, and an apparent volume of distribution of 43&#x02013;90 liters, the eplerenone concentration at the moment of the experiment is approximately 1.7 &#x000b5;M. In a rat Langendorff model, in which the heart is perfused with a buffer solution <xref rid="pone.0111248-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, a cardioprotective effect of eplerenone was observed with 10 &#x000b5;M, but not with 1 &#x000b5;M. Given a plasma protein binding of 50%, the effective concentration in the rat study is approximately 10-times higher than the concentration in our study. We used 50 mg of eplerenone bid, which is higher than the dosages administered in the clinical trials in patients with heart failure in which eplerenone showed beneficial effects <xref rid="pone.0111248-Pitt2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111248-Zannad1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Therefore, we cannot exclude that eplerenone does affect adenosine formation at higher concentrations, which are not relevant however for the clinical situation. In addition, in our study, eplerenone was administered during one week, in contrast to the single dose administration in the animal studies. As expected, the serum aldosterone and plasma renine levels had almost doubled after 6 days of treatment with eplerenone. Although this increase in aldosterone does probably not affect our results, because eplerenone blocks the MR, MR-independent effects of aldosterone have been described previously (20). In theory, any non-MR-mediated effects of aldosterone on adenosine metabolism might have influenced our result. Finally, it is important to realize that our experiments were performed in healthy subjects, and not in patients with cardiovascular disease or heart failure. This was done because we aimed to demonstrate a general pharmacological mechanism of eplerenone and also because the preclinical studies that were fundamental to our hypothesis were performed in healthy animals. We cannot exclude, however, that the effects of MR antagonists are different in patients with cardiovascular disease, such as heart failure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0111248.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
