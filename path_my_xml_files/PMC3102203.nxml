This effect of ATD has been shown in studies which used inhalation of 35% and 5% carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) (Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2000</xref>; Schruers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2000</xref>) and infusion of flumazenil (Bell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2002</xref>; Davies et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>) as challenges to induce panic, but no effect has been observed using infusion of cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) (Toru et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2006</xref>). Pre-treatment with 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), the immediate precursor of serotonin (5-HT), has been shown to blunt the response to 35% CO<sub>2</sub> challenge, indicating a &#x0201c;protective&#x0201d; effect on experimentally induced panic (Schruers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2002b</xref>). These findings seem to indicate that in PD patients, fear or anxiety provoked by some panicogenic challenges is negatively correlated to the availability of 5-HT precursors.</p><p>Studies in healthy volunteers yielded inconclusive findings: reports showed that ATD failed to modify the panicogenic effects of CCK-4 (Koszycki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1996</xref>) as well as the effects of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation (Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2000</xref>) or the Read rebreathing test (Struzik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2002</xref>). Two studies have tested the effects of 35% CO<sub>2</sub> in tryptophan (Trp) depleted subjects, one showing an increase of CO<sub>2</sub>-induced neurovegetative symptoms but not subjective anxiety (Klaassen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1998</xref>), while the other did not find any significant difference between ATD condition and placebo with regard to CO<sub>2</sub>-provoked subjective effects (Hood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>). Administration of 5-HTP in healthy volunteers was shown to reduce CCK-4-induced panic attacks and panic-related cognitive symptoms, specifically in females (Maron et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2004</xref>), but had no effects on the response to CO<sub>2</sub> (Schruers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2002b</xref>).</p><p>The discrepancies observed between PD patients and healthy controls, in terms of the effects of ATD on the subjective response to challenges might be due to the relative low sensitivity exhibited by healthy subjects to panicogenic agents. We have previously showed in healthy volunteers that the inhalation of CO<sub>2</sub> dose-dependently induces panic-like symptoms, and that high doses of CO<sub>2</sub> (double-breath of 35% CO<sub>2</sub>) in healthy subjects might be as effective as moderate doses of CO<sub>2</sub> are in PD patients (Griez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>; Schruers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2004</xref>b). Here, we intended to perform a study in healthy subjects using a high-dose CO<sub>2</sub> challenge in order to test whether we can reproduce in a non-clinical population the same modulating effects of 5-HT manipulation observed in PD patients on experimental panic response; for this purpose, we investigated the effects of ATD on CO<sub>2</sub>-induced panic response in healthy volunteers.</p><p>Additionally, since the Trp suppletion studies with panicogenic challenges conducted in healthy subjects gave inconclusive results (Maron et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2004</xref>; Schruers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2002b</xref>), we also tested the effects of acute tryptophan loading (ATL) on subjective response to CO<sub>2</sub> challenge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Healthy volunteers were recruited among students or staff, through advertisements from within the Vijverdal Psychiatric Hospital Maastricht (Mondriaan Zorggroep) and throughout the Maastricht University locations. The Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Hospital Maastricht and Maastricht University approved the study, and the subjects were paid for their participation in the experiment. After a complete description of the study, a written informed consent was obtained from the subjects. The volunteers underwent collection of medical history and physical examination. Inclusion criteria were age between 18 and 65&#x000a0;years and a good present and past physical and mental condition. The latter was established using a structured psychiatric interview (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview) performed by a physician. Exclusion criteria were current psychopharmacological or psychological treatment, recent alcohol intake, substance or caffeine-related disorders, excessive smoking (&#x0003e;10 cigarettes a day), respiratory or cardiovascular disease, hypertension (diastolic &#x0003e;100&#x000a0;mmHg; systolic &#x0003e;170&#x000a0;mmHg), personal or family history of cerebral aneurysm, pregnancy, and epilepsy. Individuals were also excluded if they reported common specific fears or if they had a history of panic attacks, or a history of PD in a first-degree relative.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>Subjects were randomized in double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study design. The subjects received three different gelatin-based mixtures (GBM) on three different days in a randomized order, to induce respectively the ATD condition, a balanced condition (BAL) and the ATL condition. On each day, after GBM administration, they underwent a double-breath CO<sub>2</sub> challenge.</p><p>A separate analysis has been conducted on a larger sample of subjects in a randomized separate-group design, in order to investigate the relationship between the ratio Trp to the sum of large neutral amino acids in plasma (Trp:&#x003a3;LNAA) and the subjective response to CO<sub>2</sub>. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: ATD condition, BAL condition, and ATL condition. This sample also included subjects who were enrolled in the cross-over study for which only the first study day was taken into consideration in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Procedure</title><p>The subjects arrived at the clinic after an overnight fast. Blood was drawn to measure plasma Trp and large neutral amino acids (LNAA) levels. GBM were administered in the morning at about 9:30. After drinking the GBM, the subjects remained on the ward and were allowed to read or watch a nature documentary on video. Subjects had ad libitum access to mineral water, but they were asked to refrain from eating and drinking any xanthine beverages. At 4.5&#x000a0;h after GBM administration, other blood samples were collected to monitor plasma Trp and LNAA levels. Ten minutes later, the subjects underwent a double-breath inhalation of a gas mixture containing 35% CO<sub>2</sub> and 65% O<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Gelatin-based mixtures</title><p>The gelatin consists of a hydrolysate collagen-protein comprising the entire range of amino acids in the form of peptides, but completely lacking Trp. After administration, these peptides are decomposed into amino acids, and the mechanism of depletion is identical to that of the &#x0201c;classic&#x0201d; amino acid mixture (Sambeth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2009</xref>). The GBM was kindly provided by PB Gelatins (Tessenderlo Group, Belgium) in form of powder. Amino acid composition of the GBM can be found in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The drink was prepared mixing 100&#x000a0;g of the powder with 200&#x000a0;ml water at 50&#x02013;70&#x000b0;C. The drink was kept refrigerated at 4&#x000b0;C and then kept at room temperature for 30&#x000a0;min before administration. The three GBM were identical in composition, except that 1.15&#x000a0;g of l-tryptophan and 5.15&#x000a0;g of l-tryptophan was added to the mixtures for the BAL and ATL conditions, respectively. No l-tryptophan was added for the ATD condition. The three GBM had the same color and taste.

A gas mixture containing 35% CO<sub>2</sub>/65% O<sub>2</sub> was delivered through a nasal&#x02013;oral exercise self-administration facemask, using a double vital capacity inhalation technique. Before the challenge, the inspired vital capacity of every subject was measured using an analogue respirometer (Wright respirometer Mark 20) connected to the self-administration mask. The same respirometer measured the gas volume delivered at each inhalation. The inspired vital capacity with a double breath of air was measured on each occasion, and a challenge was considered adequate if it was more than 80% of the baseline vital capacity. The subjects were then given the self-administration mask and asked to exhale as deeply as possible. They were asked to take a maximal inspiration through the mask and to make a complete expiration outside the mask, immediately followed by a second maximal inspiration. At the end of the second inhalation, the subjects were asked to hold their breath for 4&#x000a0;s to enhance the alveolar gas exchange, and finally make a complete expiration outside the mask again.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Amino acid analysis</title><p>Samples for determination of plasma amino acid levels were taken at baseline (T0) and 4.5&#x000a0;h after GBM administration (T1). Blood (10&#x000a0;ml) was collected by venepuncture in sodium heparin tubes at each time point immediately after the rating of subjective assessments. After collection, the blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 4&#x000b0;C (10&#x000a0;min at 4,000&#x000a0;rpm). Subsequently, 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of plasma was mixed with 8&#x000a0;mg of sulphasalicyl acid and frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until the amino acid analysis was performed (van Eijk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1993</xref>). Plasma amino acids were determined using a fully automated high-performance liquid chromatography system after precolumn derivatization with <italic>o</italic>-phthaldialdehyde (OPA). OPA-AA derivates of the amino acids were quantified with fluorescence detection. The concentrations of plasma amino acids were expressed as micromoles per liter (&#x003bc;mol/l) (van Eijk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1993</xref>). The ratio of total Trp:&#x003a3;LNAA (LNAA, i.e., tyrosine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, and valine) at baseline and 4.5&#x000a0;h after GBM were used as endpoints to monitor changes in Trp availability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Assessments</title><p>Rating scales to assess panicogenic effects of CO<sub>2</sub> challenge were chosen with reference to the definition of panic attack in DSM-IV TR diagnostic criteria (APA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2000</xref>). We used a visual analogue scale for affect (VAAS) labeled &#x0201c;fear or discomfort&#x0201d;, ranging from 0 (no fear/discomfort at all) to 100 (the worst imaginable fear/discomfort). The participants were instructed to indicate the amount of the subjective disturbance, in case of feeling either fear or discomfort following an established procedure (Colasanti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2008</xref>).</p><p>Panic symptoms were evaluated using the Panic Symptom List (PSL-IV) (Schruers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2000</xref>). This consists of a questionnaire listing 13 items, each representing one of the DSM-IV TR symptoms (i.e., palpitations; sweating; trembling; sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; feeling of choking; chest discomfort; nausea or abdominal distress; feeling dizzy, lightheaded, or faint; derealization or depersonalization; fear of losing control; fear of dying; paresthesias; chills or hot flushes). The participants were asked to rate the intensity of each symptom from 0 (absent) to 4 (very intense). The total scores thus ranged from 0 to 52.</p><p>VAAS and PSL-IV were administered at baseline (T0; pre-GBM administration), 1.5&#x000a0;h (T1), 3&#x000a0;h (T2), 4.5&#x000a0;h post-GBM administration (T3), and after CO<sub>2</sub> challenge (Post-CO<sub>2</sub>). Post-CO<sub>2</sub> scores indicated the worst moment experienced by the subjects after inhaling the gas mixture.</p><p>Mood states were measured with the shortened 32-item validated version of the Dutch translation of the Profile of Mood States Scale (POMS) (Wald and Mellenbergh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1990</xref>), which consists of five mood scales (depression, tension/anxiety, vigor, anger/hostility, and fatigue). The POMS was administered at T0, T1, T2, and T3. Subjects were asked to rate the scale according to how they felt at that moment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data analysis</title><p>All the data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). Percentage changes in Trp: &#x003a3;LNAA ratio (&#x00394;% Trp:&#x003a3;LNAA ratio) after GBM (T3) compared to baseline (T0) were calculated by the formula T3-T0/T0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100. CO<sub>2</sub>-induced changes in VAAS and PSL scores were expressed as &#x00394; scores (obtained by the formula POST-CO<sub>2</sub> scores&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;T3 scores). In the cross-over sample, all data were analyzed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures with time and treatment condition as within-subjects factors. The effects of time X treatment condition interaction were studied to investigate the influence of GBM condition (ATD, BAL, ATL) on the subjective response to CO<sub>2</sub> measured with VAAS and PSL scores. The analysis of VAAS scores has been repeated after controlling for gender, and the interaction time X treatment condition X gender has been studied using ANOVA per repeated measures.</p><p>To investigate the influence of GBM conditions on POMS scores, the effects of time per se and time X treatment condition interaction were studied with ANOVA per repeated measures.</p><p>If indicated by a significant ANOVA condition effect, time effect, or time X condition interaction effect, a subsequent evaluation on difference between individual conditions and between individual time points was done by within-subject repeated contrasts. The level of significance was set at 0.05. For the separate-group analysis the principal statistical analysis consisted of Spearman's non-parametric correlation between &#x00394;VAAS scores and Trp:&#x003a3;LNAA levels. A partial correlation analysis between these two variables was repeated after controlling for gender. Moreover, baseline differences between treatments/groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA for continuous variables (age, weight, Trp:&#x003a3;LNAA ratio, VAS, and PSL scores) and chi-square for non-parametric variables (gender distribution).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Results</title><p>Eighteen healthy volunteers (10 male) completed the cross-over study (mean age 25&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.5&#x000a0;years).</p><p>One subject was excluded because she reported nausea and vomiting after the administration of GBM.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Amino acid levels</title><p>Plasma amino acid levels are presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

We found a mild, but significant effect of treatment condition on the subjective scores of fear/discomfort, indicating that ATD is associated to a reduced response to a CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation relative to placebo and ATL. The same effect was also evident for scores on the panic symptom &#x0201c;shortness of breath&#x0201d;. The analysis of the other separate individual symptoms and the total composite score of panic symptoms induced by CO<sub>2</sub> did not show any significant difference between conditions. In a separate analysis, we also investigated the relationship between Trp availability (Trp:&#x003a3;LNAA ratio) and subjective response to CO<sub>2</sub>, as measured by VAAS scores, in a separate-group design. We found a relatively weak, but significant positive correlation between the Trp:&#x003a3;LNAA ratio and CO<sub>2</sub>-induced changes in VAAS scores, indicating that lower availability of 5-HT precursors is associated to a blunted affective response to CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>These findings are in contrast with previous results found in studies by our laboratory (Klaassen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1998</xref>; Schruers and Griez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2004</xref>a; Schruers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2000</xref>; Schruers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">b</xref>) and in other CO<sub>2</sub> challenge studies in healthy volunteers (Hood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>) and in PD patients (Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2000</xref>). First, we will discuss potential explanations for the divergent findings observed in this study compared to other studies with inhaled CO<sub>2</sub> and other panicogenic agents in both healthy volunteers and PD patients. Furthermore, we will try to interpret our findings in the context of the complex relationship between panic, 5-HT, and CO<sub>2</sub>, also in light of the recent data, which suggest that 5-HT neurons are sensitive to acute changes in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Methodological issues and limitations relative to the technique used to manipulate 5-HT precursors will be finally addressed.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Tryptophan depletion/suppletion studies in healthy volunteers and PD patients</title><p>A large body of evidence suggests that manipulation of 5-HT precursors availability has an influence in modulating panic and anxiety (see review by Maron et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>). However, some of the findings from experimental studies, both in healthy volunteers and PD patients, are divisive and indicate that the role of 5-HT might not be unique.</p><p>Hood et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>) and Klaassen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1998</xref>) tested the effects of ATD on the response to single-breath 35% CO<sub>2</sub> challenge in healthy subjects. In a study on 14 healthy volunteers, no significant differences were found in subjective measures between ATD and balanced conditions, although ATD resulted in an increased CO<sub>2</sub>-induced elevation of cortisol compared to the balanced condition (Hood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>). Klaassen et al. study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1998</xref>), including 15 volunteers, found a significant increase in CO<sub>2</sub>-induced neurovegetative symptoms after ATD. In that study sample, mean net increases in total PSL scores and VAAS scores after CO<sub>2</sub> were &#x0003c;7 and &#x0003c;7, respectively (Klaassen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1998</xref>). Subjective CO<sub>2</sub>-induced anxiety was, therefore, very mild, hence indicating that single-breath 35% CO<sub>2</sub> in healthy subjects did not evoke &#x0201c;real&#x0201d; panic. In the present study, using double-breath CO<sub>2</sub>, we found a more than 30% higher increase in PSL scores and more than 500% higher increase in VAAS scores after CO<sub>2</sub> compared to Klaassen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1998</xref>) study. Average VAAS and PSL scores in the present double-breath 35% CO<sub>2</sub> study are comparable to those normally found in PD patients after single-breath 35% CO<sub>2</sub> (Verburg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1998</xref>). Other challenges in healthy volunteers found no significant effect of ATD on responses to anxiogenic challenges. This has been showed using a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> challenge (Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2000</xref>) and the hypercapnic Read rebreathing technique (Struzik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2002</xref>), a simulated public speaking challenge (Monteiro-dos-Santos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2000</xref>), and CCK-4 (Koszycki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1996</xref>). In contrast, a study by (Goddard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1995</xref>) showed increased nervousness in response to yohimbine challenge after ATD compared to yohimbine alone.</p><p>To enhance 5-HT availability in healthy subjects, (Maron et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2004</xref>) administered 5-HTP (direct precursor of 5-HT) and used CCK-4 as panicogenic challenge in 32 healthy volunteers. They observed a significant reduction compared to placebo in CCK-4-induced panic attacks and cognitive symptoms only in females, whereas in males only a decrease in somatic symptoms was observed. In Schruers et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2002b</xref>) study, 5-HTP did not alter the response to 35% CO<sub>2</sub> compared to placebo. Taken together, these data and our results indicate that the effects of Trp depletion in healthy volunteers largely depend on the type of challenge and its relative potency, and might be additionally confounded by gender effects.</p><p>Studies in PD patients demonstrated that ATD increased the response to single-breath 35% CO<sub>2</sub> (Schruers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2000</xref>) and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> anxiety (Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2000</xref>), and administration of 5-HTP blunted the response to single-breath 35% CO<sub>2</sub> (Schruers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2002b</xref>)</p><p>ATD also increased the response to flumazenil infusion in PD patients successfully treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) (Bell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2002</xref>; Davies et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>) or CBT (Bell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>). In contrast, subjective response to CCK-4 is not influenced by ATD (Toru et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2006</xref>) in SSRI-treated PD patients. Also, ATD did not have significant effects on the subjective response to anxiogenic challenges in OCD (Barr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1994</xref>; Kulz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2007</xref>) and in GAD SSRI-treated patients (Hood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>). It is interesting to note that in the latest study of Hood and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>), using 7.5% CO<sub>2</sub> challenge, some subjective measures of anxiety (&#x0201c;something bad is going to happen&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;anxious&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;secure&#x0201d;), seemed to indicate an anxiolytic effect of ATD rather than anxiogenic; however, pairways comparison was not significantly different between conditions.</p><p>As a further confirmation of the role of 5-HT in modulating experimental panic, serotonergic drugs that are effective in treating panic disorder, like SSRI and tryciclics, also reduce the fear that patients with PD experience when they inhale CO<sub>2</sub> (Bertani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2001</xref>; Bertani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1997</xref>; Perna et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2004</xref>; Perna et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2002</xref>; Perna et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1997</xref>; Pols et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1996</xref>).</p><p>In summary, a number of studies in PD indicate that availability of 5-HT precursors is inversely related to vulnerability to CO<sub>2</sub> challenges, which is at odds with the present results. However, overall findings in anxiety disorder patients suggest that the effects of Trp manipulation specifically depend on the diagnosis and the type of anxiogenic challenge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Panic, 5-HT, and CO<sub>2</sub>: a complex relationship</title><p>Accumulating evidence from clinical and experimental research and genetic studies suggest a substantial role for the 5-HT system on the neurobiology of PD (see Maron and Shlik <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2006</xref>). The relationship between 5-HT and panic is complex, as exemplified by the notion that SSRI are effective in reducing panic, but they may exacerbate anxiety during the initial phase of treatment (Sinclair et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2009</xref>). It has been hypothesized that panic is associated to either 5-HT excess (Iversen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1984</xref>) and 5-HT deficit (Deakin and Graeff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1991</xref>). Deakin &#x00026; Graeff proposed that the 5-HT system plays a dual role in the modulation of anxiety by inhibiting panic responses, but contributing to anticipatory or generalized anxiety. Our findings presented here are not in line with this theory, as in our experimental design increased 5-HT availability did not suppress CO<sub>2</sub>-induced panic responses in healthy volunteers. However, recent studies suggest that other factors should be taken into account in understanding the relationship between 5-HT, CO<sub>2</sub> and anxiety: a subset of 5-HT neurons, located in the chemosensitive zone (ventrolateral medulla and raphe) and associated with large arteries, are intrinsically chemosensitive in vitro (Severson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2003</xref>) and are stimulated by hypercapnia in vivo in unanaesthetized animals (Veasey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1997</xref>). Furthermore, experiments using in vivo microdialysis showed that increasing inhaled CO<sub>2</sub> causes an increase in 5-HT release (Kanamaru and Homma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2007</xref>). Interestingly, mice selectively lacking 5-HT neurons display a blunted respiratory response to CO<sub>2</sub>, indicating that 5-HT neurons are required for normal central chemoreception (Hodges and Richerson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2008</xref>). Richerson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2004</xref>) proposed that medullary 5-HT neurons control ventilatory responses to CO<sub>2</sub> and project to areas like forebrain and limbic system that are involved in affective regulation. Taking into account the panicogenic properties of CO<sub>2</sub>, we have previously speculated that these neurons could be part of an adaptive protective mechanism alerting the organism against the risk of impending asphyxia (Griez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>). Taken all these preclinical findings together, it appears that acute hypercapnia stimulates serotonergic neurons and 5-HT release and that conversely, disruption of the 5-HT system blunts the neuronal response to CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Our data are in line with the above preclinical evidence; we have effectively reduced availability of 5-HT precursors and we have used CO<sub>2</sub> as a panicogenic challenge. In agreement with Hodges and Richerson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2008</xref>) data, we found that depletion of 5-HT precursors blunted the subjective response to CO<sub>2</sub>, particularly the respiratory sensations, and Trp availability was positively correlated with the intensity of the subjective responses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Methodological limitations</title><p>Some methodological considerations regard the validity of Trp manipulations to alter 5-HT availability. Trp depletion and Trp loading are relatively easy procedures to rapidly and reversibly change, decrease and increase respectively, the levels of 5-HT precursors (Hood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2005</xref>). The first step in 5-HT biosynthesis is the conversion of Trp to 5-HTP by Trp hydroxylase. In the brain, this enzyme is only 50% saturated and the rate at which 5-HT is synthesized is limited only by substrate (Trp) availability. The LNAA transport system at the blood&#x02013;brain barrier has a high affinity for all the LNAAs, including Trp. Therefore, the ratio Trp:&#x003a3;LNAA in plasma is generally used to predict the availability of Trp to the brain. A large body of literature provides evidence that manipulations of the levels of Trp in plasma results in a substantial and parallel alteration of 5-HT synthesis in the brain and availability of 5-HT and its metabolite in humans and animals (Biggio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1974</xref>; Carpenter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1998</xref>; Gessa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1974</xref>; Leathwood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1987</xref>; Lieben et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>; Williams et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">1999</xref>). However, an altered release of 5-HT efflux (thought to reflect synaptic release, i.e., 5-HT neuronal activity) was only reported after chronic Trp depletion (Fadda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2000</xref>) or after ATD in combination with 5-HT reuptake inhibition (Bel and Artigas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1996</xref>), but not after ATD alone (van der Plasse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2007</xref>). In vitro studies suggest that an increase in Trp availability determines dose-dependent changes in 5-HT release under conditions of increased serotonergic neuronal activity but not on basal output of 5-HT (Sharp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1992</xref>; Wolf and Kuhn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">1986</xref>).</p><p>We assume that the alterations in the Trp:&#x003a3;LNAA ratio of the present study were followed by changes in brain 5-HT availability and synthesis in the same direction. However, at present, we cannot assure that Trp depletion and Trp loading actually influenced 5-HT release. Nevertheless, the possibility exists that the manipulations in the present study did affect 5-HT neuronal release, based on the abovementioned notions that acute hypercapnia stimulates serotonergic neurons and induces 5-HT release, and that Trp manipulations seem to be effective in altering 5-HT release only in stimulated neurons.</p><p>A number of other methodological issues need to be addressed. To manipulate brain Trp availability, the studies in healthy volunteers of both Klaassen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1998</xref>) and Hood et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>) included the use of the classic amino acid mixture (Young et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">1985</xref>), the former including an addition of carbohydrates and fat. In these studies, ATD appeared to be as effective as it was in ours and resulted in a significant decrease of plasma Trp levels. However, the magnitude of the depletion seems difficult to compare with that in our study due to some methodological differences: in the study of Klaassen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1998</xref>), no baseline Trp plasma levels were collected, and in the study of Hood et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>), free Trp plasma levels instead of total TRP levels were used for calculation of the Trp:&#x003a3;LNAA ratio. It is still debated whether total Trp or free Trp levels in plasma are the most reliable indirect measures of brain Trp availability (Pardridge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1998</xref>). Therefore, methodological differences might account for the divergent findings in our study compared to previous studies in healthy volunteers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p>It is recognized that 5-HT system plays a complex role in the regulation of the panic responses to CO<sub>2</sub>, as different serotonergic mechanisms can coexist, either inhibiting panic (Deakin and Graeff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1991</xref>) or promoting the aversive respiratory sensations to hypercapnic stimuli.
