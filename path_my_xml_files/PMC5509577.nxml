institutionalized older adults improves by a virtual reality dual task training. [Subjects
and Methods] Randomized controlled trial; Twenty institutionalized older adults with mild
cognitive impairment (13 female, 7 male; average age, 87.2 &#x000b1; 5.96&#x02005;years) were randomized
to the intervention (i.e. Virtual reality dual-task training using the BioRescue) or
control group (no additional training). The intervention group took part in a 6-week
training program while the elderly in the control group maintained their daily activities.
Balance was measured with the Instrumented Timed Up-and-Go Test with and without a
cognitive task. The Observed Emotion Rating Scale and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory were
administered to evaluate the emotions and motivation regarding the exergaming program.
[Results] The intervention group improved significantly on the total Timed Up-and-Go
duration and the turn-to-sit duration during single-task walking in comparison to the
control group who received no additional training. Participants found the virtual reality
dual task training pleasant and useful for their concentration, memory and balance.
Pleasure and alertness were the two emotions which were mostly seen during the
intervention. [Conclusion] The BioRescue is a pleasant and interesting treatment method,
well suited for institutionalized older adults in need of lifelong physical therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Mild cognitive impairment</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Dual task training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ageing is characterized by deterioration of vision, gait, muscle strength, balance and
cognition<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, which often results in a
decrease of physical activity. This reduced physical activity leads to a vicious circle of
further deconditioning<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> including the
emerge of balance disorders<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The risk of
falling in community-dwelling older adults increases with balance disorders<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. A fall is one of the most common accidents
in older adults. Twenty-eight to 35% over the age of 65 fall at least once a year<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The number of falls in institutionalized
older adults (rate: 0.6&#x02013;3.6 per bed annually, mean 1.7) is higher than observed in
community-dwelling healthy older adults (rate: 0.3&#x02013;1.6 per person annually, mean 0.65). In
addition, injuries are much more severe<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cognitive decline is also associated with ageing. Forty-five percent of the
institutionalized older adults have dementia<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are due to atrophy of
the hippocampus, located in medial temporal lobes (MTL), and degradation of connections
between the brain regions MTL and prefrontal cortex<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mild cognitive impairment is defined as a state of cognition and
functional ability between normal aging and very mild Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease characterized by a
decline in one or more cognitive domains, including working memory, central executive
function and attentional resources<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> with still intact ADL-oriented
actions<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Research suggests that
during the MCI stage strengthening of executive function and reversing cognitive deficit is
still largely possible<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance and cognition impairments are related and both contribute to an increased fall
risk<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The cognitive input required
for postural control depends on the task complexity and the abilities of the subject&#x02019;s
postural control system<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Postural
control combined with a cognitive task, is called a cognitive-motor dual task. Specific
brain regions related to dual tasking include the precentral, postcentral, and lingual
gyri<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. To complete the secondary task,
the older adult uses cognitive resources. This in turn leads to a weaker performance of the
primary task and increases the fall risk in elderly with MCI.</p><p>General training programs have a positive effect on balance in institutionalized older
adults<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Last decade, the role of
virtual reality in the domain of the physical therapy increased. Goble et al. showed that
the &#x02018;Wii Balance Board&#x02019; has a positive effect on balance in older adults<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Further, virtual reality interventions
might be more attractive for older adults who need lifelong physical therapy.</p><p>The BioRescue is a comparable form of virtual reality for cognitive-motor dual task
training. It includes a platform (610 &#x000d7; 580 &#x000d7; 10 mm<sup>3</sup>) equipped with 1,600
pressure sensors that measure vertical pressure fluctuations in both feet. It can be used as
an assessment and intervention tool. The BioRescue might be more patient friendly and safer
than the &#x02018;Wii Fit&#x02019;, as the surface of the BioRescue is bigger, more stable and lower to the
ground, consequently decreasing the fall risk. During the exercises, the BioRescue gives the
patients real-time feedback on the movement of the centre of pressure. Despite a good
integration in clinical practice, there is only limited evidence on assessment and training
with the BioRescue. Until now, the BioRescue has been reported in only 18 studies as an
evaluation tool and in only one study as an intervention tool for stroke patients<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, significant improvements
in balance and cognition were found in comparison to baseline measurements in a group of
sub-acute stroke patients.</p><p>This study will examine the effect of dual task training with the BioRescue on cognition,
balance and dual task performance in institutionalized older adults with MCI. In addition,
the motivation and emotions experienced during the program will be monitored as this
population needs lifelong physical therapy to reduce the risk of further motor and cognitive
decline. We hypothesize that virtual reality dual task training with the BioRescue improves
cognition, balance and dual task performance and is a pleasant alternative for traditional
physical therapy resulting in positive emotions (i.e. pleasure and alertness) and more
motivation towards the program.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty older adults, aged 75 and over, were recruited from the residential care center St.
Elisabeth in Hasselt, Belgium after signing a written informed consent. The study received
ethical approval by the local ethical committee of Hasselt University and the regional
ethical committee of medical research, UZ KU Leuven on 23/09/2015. The register number is
B322201525648. Participants were able to walk 10 meters repeatedly with walking aid, lived
for at least 3 months at the residential care center and suffered from mild cognitive
impairment (MoCa&#x0003c;26)<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> Participants
who were still rehabilitating from a hospitalization (e.g., after a neurological disease or
orthopedic surgery), had a diagnosis of dementia or major sensory or motor impairments of
the upper or lower extremities which could interfere with the program were excluded. The
participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n=10) and control group
(n=10). The subjects in the control group continued their standard of usual care in the
nursing home if applicable.</p><p>The subjects assigned to the intervention group, followed a training program with the
BioRescue (RM Ingenierie, France) combined with their standard of usual care. Training
sessions were planned two times a week for six weeks. The duration of each session was
gradually increased from 18 minutes in week 1 to 30 minutes in week 5.</p><p>The BioRescue training was offered by a physical therapist. Participants were asked to
stand on the platform located 1.0&#x02013;1.5&#x02005;m away from a 55 inch TV-flat screen. A training
session consisted of a number of 3 minute exercises. <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Exercises using BioRescue</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Dual tasking</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Memory exercise </td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The participant is required to memorize the 4 cards

memory, attention and dual tasking. The degree of difficulty of each exercise was adjusted
to the perceived skill level of each participant separately. If needed, the subjects could
take a 90-second break for up to twice per session.</p><p>Balance and gait performance was evaluated using the Tinetti-POMA scale
(Performance-oriented Mobility Assessment)<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> and the instrumented Timed Up and Go test (iTUG). Participants wore
inertial measurement units (Opal<sup>&#x02122;</sup>, APDM&#x02019;s Mobility Lab<sup>&#x02122;</sup>, APDM Inc,
http://apdm.com) on the ankles, wrists and sternum while they were asked to stand up from a
chair, walk 3 meters, turn 180&#x000b0;, walk 3 meters and sit down on the chair. Recorded data from
total duration, step time before the turn, duration for sit-to-stand transition, turning and
stand-to-sit transition were measured. Two measurements for every participant were averaged.
This method is validated<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> and has a high
inter-rater reliability with video analysis for turning characteristics<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To evaluate the effect of the program on cognitive-motor dual tasking, the iTUG was
combined with an extra visual task (iTUG+DT). A visual task was chosen for its similarity to
the dual task training and for the high impact on gait performance in comparison to tasks
which involve external interfering factors (e.g., reaction time tasks)<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. For this dual task, six different images (e.g., glasses,
a key and traffic lights) were displayed on a screen in a specific color in front of the
participant. The six colors were then spoken in a random order at three-second intervals.
Participants were instructed to name the matching image without further instructions
regarding task prioritization. One practice session while sitting was allowed before
implementation during the iTUG. During every trial different images were used to avoid
habituation effects. Dual task performance was measured as a percentage of wrong answers
during the test. Two trials for each participant were averaged.</p><p>The Dutch version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a 30-point test which
assesses memory function, visuospatial abilities, executive function, orientation and verbal
fluency<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Dutch version of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) was used to evaluate the
motivation during the exercise program<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The IMI consists of 37 questions, divided over six subscales (i.e., interest/enjoyment,
perceived choice, perceived competence, pressure/ tension, value/usefulness, effort). It was
filled out after the last training session by the intervention group.</p><p>To evaluate the participants&#x02019; emotions during the intervention, the Observed Emotion Rating
Scale (OERS) was used<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The intervention
group was recorded on videotape during a session in the fifth week of the program. The first
10 minutes of these recordings were screened for presence and duration of 5 affects
(Pleasure, anger, anxiety/fear, sadness, general alertness). Additionally, participants of
the intervention group were recorded during a standard physical therapy treatment (if
applicable) to compare the two treatments.</p><p>To standardize the protocol, identical footwear and walking aids were used during both pre-
and post-testing. The assessor administrating the tinetti-POMA scale and MOCA was blinded to
the treatment. For safety reasons, the blinded assessor was accompanied by the physical
therapist during the iTUG with and without dual task.</p><p>As the data were not normally distributed, non-parametric statistics was chosen for the
data-analysis. Group differences at baseline were determined with the Mann-Whitney U test
using JMP Pro 12.1.0. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test two-sided was used to compare each
variable within-group before and after the program. The level of significance was set at
p&#x0003c;0.05 for all statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The clinical characteristics of the two groups are presented in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Clinical characteristics at baseline</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention (n=10)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control (n=10)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">86.9 &#x000b1; 5.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">87.5 &#x000b1; 6.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (M/F)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2/8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">161.0 &#x000b1; 7.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">164.0 &#x000b1; 11.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MoCA ( /30)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.7 &#x000b1; 5.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.8 &#x000b1; 5.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tinetti ( /28)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.3 &#x000b1; 4.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.6 &#x000b1; 5.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TUG (sec)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.2 &#x000b1; 9.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.1 &#x000b1; 13.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Walking Aids (Y/N)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Additional PT (Y/N)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2/8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/4</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are presented as mean &#x000b1; SD.

in the intervention group by almost a second (p=0.02), whereas the sit-to-stand transition

significantly in the intervention group (0.7 sec versus 0.5 sec, p=0.02).</p><p>All older adults were able to perform the visual task while sitting. However, difficulties
were experienced when it was combined with the iTUG. The iTUG + DT proved to be very
challenging, as only 41.2% of participants remembered to sit at the chair at the end of the
TUG in combination with the dual task. As a result, the total duration and the parameters
from turn to sit of the iTUG + DT were not analyzed. Instead, supplemental analysis showed
that only 37.5% of participants in the intervention group remembered to sit down at the end
of the TUG + DT at baseline in comparison to 75% after the intervention. No changes were
seen in the control group. Further, the BioRescue training did not seem to have any effect
on gait or dual task performance during the TUG + DT as the percentage of errors nor gait
parameters improved.</p><p>Interviews with participants from the intervention group showed that they found the program
useful for their concentration, memory and balance, according to the results of the IMI,
which resulted in a high compliance. They scored the program as very interesting and
pleasant to do and perceived their performance of the different exercises as good to very

training with the BioRescue. These emotions appeared only as a small reaction to the failure
of an exercise. Especially alertness and pleasure were seen during the training. In
comparison to the standard physical therapy in the residential care center, BioRescue
exercises were associated with more pleasure in the two participants who received both
therapies (<xref rid="tbl_005" ref-type="table">Table 5B and 5C</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present study was conducted to investigate the influence of cognitive-motor dual task
training with the BioRescue on balance, cognition and dual tasks during walking in
institutionalized older adults.</p><p>This virtual reality training has a significant effect on dynamic balance during single
task walking, as the total duration, turn-to-sit duration and step-time before the turn
during the iTUG without dual task, improved only in the intervention group. This result
shows that the intervention group improved functionality during transfers (i.e., turning and
sitting down), in contrast to the control group. The fact that the iTUG improved after
training with the BioRescue, is in line with the results of Rendon et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> who showed that the eight feet up and go
improved significantly after six weeks of training with the Wii Fit. Further, Karaha et al.
demonstrated a significant effect on balance, functional walking and quality of life after 6
weeks of virtual reality gaming using the Xbox KinectTM<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Results on the tinetti-POMA test did not improve in contrast to
earlier published research on cognitive-motor dual task training using the Wii Fit. These
studies however included significantly younger participants (average aged 75 to
80&#x02005;years)<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> or had a significant higher training frequency<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, a training dosage of 2 days a week
for 6 weeks with an increasing exercise duration up to 30 minutes was used, as suggested by
the review of Goble et al<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Only
turn-to-sit and total duration of the TUG improved. This can be explained by the fact that
these parameters are specifically correlated to executive functions<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> and virtual reality training can have a positive effect on
executive function in elderly<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cognition measured by the MoCA did not improve after 6 weeks of dual task training in
contrast to the Biorescue training in the study of Choi et al<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, Choi et al. included subacute stroke patients, while the
present study included a more than 20&#x02005;years older group of institutionalized older adults.
The cognitive improvement was also seen in the control group, suggesting that the target
group in the study of Choi et al. was more sensitive for cognitive improvements. However,
previous study has shown that turn duration and turn-to-sit are correlated to executive
functions<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study,
especially turn-to-sit and turn preparation improved after dual-task training. This is in
line with previous study suggesting that executive functions improve with exergaming in
institutionalized older adults<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. Future
studies on BioRescue training in elderly should therefore include a more extensive test
battery for executive functions.</p><p>The performance of the dual task did not improve in comparison to a control group who
received no additional training. Improvements should be expected at the end of the TUG,
which could not be analyzed due to missing data as almost 60% forgot to sit down on the
chair. However, after the training only 25% of the intervention group still forgot to sit
down on the chair while dual tasking in contrast to almost 60% in the control group. As a
result, we can carefully suggest that dual-tasking seems to improve in the intervention
group after the dual-task Biorescue training and secondary that the TUG with dual-tasking is
a challenging test for elderly with MCI. In the present study, we have shown that the
BioRescue training ensures enjoyment in a population of older adults living in a residential
care center who are in need of lifelong physical therapy. Moreover, the participants felt
that their performance of the different exercises was good to very good, proving that the
BioRescue is also suited for this population and might improve patient compliance as a
similar exergame training program has shown to do so in patients with multiple
sclerosis<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The following strengths should be recognized in this study. The participants were allocated
in random order to the intervention or control group. The two non-computerized tests (i.e.,
MoCa and Tinetti-POMA) were administered by a blinded assessor. Further, for every
participant, the same footwear and walking aids were used during pre- and post-testing.
There are some limitations in this RCT. Although, physical abilities, mental abilities and
fatigue of institutionalized older adults can vary between and within days<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>, the timing during the day for pre- and
post-assessment was not standardized. Even though, groups were randomized, the control group
tended to receive more standard physical therapy than the intervention group as it was
unethical to withhold the standard of usual care in this old population. Therefore, we can
cautiously conclude that even though both groups had equal access to physical therapy, the
BioRescue training was more effective in improving dynamic balance than the everyday
physical therapy in a nursing home setting. Future studies should include a larger number of
participants and a longer training duration to see if balance, cognition and dual task
performance during walking effectively improve by training with the BioRescue. Further, a
follow-up period is recommended to determine the extent to which improvements are retained
over time.</p><p>The results of this study suggest that the dynamic balance of institutionalized elderly
improves by training with the BioRescue. It is a fun alternative exercise tool, well-suited
for this population. More long-term studies are needed to see if cognition and dual task
performance improve as well.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Chaudhry</surname><given-names>SI</given-names></name><name><surname>McAvay</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Ning</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Geriatric impairments and disability: the cardiovascular
