It has been cited as suitable for the existing local needs as it is based on the most popular insulin regimen i.e. premixed insulin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>The Indian National Consensus Group (INCG) decided to validate the effectiveness and impact of the Indian insulin guideline in real life clinical practice. A positive move in this direction was the Improving Management Practices and Clinical Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes (IMPACT) Study. This 26 week multicenter, open label, randomized, prospective study aimed to evaluate effectiveness of Indian insulin guideline (IIG) versus routine clinical practice (RCP) in patients with type 2 diabetes. The secondary objective of the study was to evaluate the physician's perceptions on the use of IIG versus RCP for management of type 2 diabetes. A total of 20653 adults with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned in 885 diabetes care centers to one of the two types of intervention: Treatment based on the Indian insulin guideline and usual care or the routine clinical practice. For the next 26 weeks, 18179 patients (88.02%) were treated according to the IIG while 2474 patients (11.98%) were treated as per the usual care. Baseline data was recorded at the first visit, and the subsequent efficacy and safety parameters were recorded at weeks 13 and 26. Pre- and post-study physicians&#x02019; perception questionnaires were filled in by the participating investigators. A reduction of 2.0% in the HbA1c marked clinically and statistically significant achievement with the use of the IIG in patients prescribed premixed analogue therapy. Out of 426 investigators who completed the physicians&#x02019; perception questionnaire, 189 (44.4%) felt that it was &#x0201c;easy&#x0201d; to initiate insulin in their patients using IIG followed by 114 (26.8%) investigators who felt neutral with respect to ease of insulin initiation in their patients as per IIG. Two hundred and thirty three (54.7%) investigators felt that insulin titration was made &#x0201c;easy&#x0201d; in their patients using IIG, while 104 (24.4%) had a neutral approach. A total of 222 investigators (52.1%) felt it was &#x0201c;convenient&#x0201d; applying IIG in their practice while 105 (24.6%) had a neutral approach. Further, two hundred and eighty nine (67.8%) investigators felt &#x0201c;satisfied&#x0201d; with IIG in achieving the targeted HbA1c &#x0003c;7%, while 83 (19.5%) were neutral in this aspect. One hundred and seventy seven (41.5%) investigators felt that simplification was required as an improvement in the present IIG, and 117 (27.5%) investigators felt that revision of titration schedule should be improved in the present IIG.</p><p>It is the first prospective study on validation of a diabetes guideline in the world and one of the largest studies in diabetes involving more than 20000 patients and 1000 participating centers. A simple and easy-to-use insulin guideline results in better reductions in HbA1c over a period of time was the key finding in this study. A reduction of 2.0% in the HbA1c marked clinically and statistically significant achievement with the use of the IIG in patients prescribed premixed analogue therapy. The physicians&#x02019; perceptions on insulin therapy in India and the role of present IIG in practice provides future perspectives on the development of a revised consensus guideline.</p></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Unrestricted educational grant from novonordisk India Limited</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Joshi</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name><name><surname>Kalra</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Badgandi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>YS</given-names></name><name><surname>Chawla</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Designer insulins regimens in clinical practice&#x02013;pilot multicenter Indian study</article-title><source>J Assoc Physicians India</source><year>2005</year><volume>53</volume><fpage>775</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16334621</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Raskin</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Hollander</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Lewin</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Gabbay</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Initiating insulin therapy in type 2 Diabetes: A comparison of biphasic and basal insulin analogs</article-title><source>Diabetes Care</source><year>2005</year><volume>28</volume><fpage>260</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15677776</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Liebl</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Prager</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Binz</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaiser</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Bergenstal</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Gallwitz</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Biphasic Insulin Aspart 30 (BIAsp30), Insulin Detemir (IDet) and Insulin Aspart (IAsp) allow patients with Type 2 Diabetes to Reach A1 c Target: The PREFER Study</article-title><source>Diabetes</source><year>2006</year><volume>55</volume><fpage>A123</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Garber</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Ligthelm</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Christiansen</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Liebl</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Premixed insulin treatment for type 2 diabetes: Analogue or human?</article-title><source>Diabetes Obes Metab</source><year>2007</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>630</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17697056</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>Indian National Consensus Group</collab><article-title>Premix Insulin: Initiation and Continuation Guidelines for Management of Diabetes in Primary Care</article-title><source>J Assoc Physicians India</source><year>2009</year><volume>57</volume><fpage>42</fpage><lpage>6</lpage></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
