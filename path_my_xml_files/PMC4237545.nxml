INS rose correspondingly and glucose disposal was accelerated by 1.8-fold in T2DM. First-phase insulin secretion and glucose disposal were also augmented by LIXI in HS, whereas second-phase insulin secretion reduced blood glucose concentrations to below fasting levels and then ceased, accompanied by a rapid, short-lasting rise in glucagon.

One study was performed in HS and the other study was performed in people with T2DM. These studies were carried out at the PROFIL Institut f&#x000fc;r Stoffwechselforschung GmbH, Neuss, Germany. The studies were approved by the institutional review boards or ethics committees and were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All participants gave written informed consent to participate in the studies.</p><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>In both studies, participants were randomized 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 to one of two treatment sequences (LIXI 20&#x02009;&#x000b5;g in study period 1 and placebo in study period 2 or <italic>vice versa</italic>). The two study periods were separated by a washout period of between 1 and 7&#x02009;days. During each study period, participants fasted overnight (at least 10&#x02009;h for HS and 13&#x02009;h for people with T2DM) to adjust blood glucose to euglycaemic levels [about 5.5&#x02009;mmol/l (100&#x02009;mg/dl)]. In the study in people with T2DM, an iv infusion of insulin [soluble human insulin (Actrapid&#x000ae;), NovoNordisk, Mainz, Germany] could be given to people who did not reach euglycaemia. Participants in both studies received a subcutaneous injection of LIXI 20&#x02009;&#x000b5;g or placebo in the left or right abdominal wall. Two hours after LIXI or placebo injection, participants received an iv bolus of glucose (0.3&#x02009;g/kg body weight; 50% aqueous solution) over a period of 30&#x02009;s.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Participants</title><p>Both studies combined included a total of 42 participants: 20 (14 male, 6 female) in the healthy study and 22 (13 male, 9 female) in the T2DM study. In the study in HS, the mean age, weight and body mass index (BMI) were 35.6&#x02009;years, 75.7&#x02009;kg and 24.5&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Screening included FPG and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). In the T2DM study, all subjects were confirmed as having T2DM by HbA1c determination and being treated with metformin and/or lifestyle modifications. In the study in people with T2DM, the mean age, weight and BMI were 54.6&#x02009;years, 88.7&#x02009;kg and 29.9&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. In this study, baseline FPG ranged from 4.9 to 7.7&#x02009;mmol/l (88139&#x02009;mg/dl), with a mean value of 6.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.5&#x02009;mmol/l (114&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11&#x02009;mg/dl), and baseline HbA1c ranged from 44 to 64&#x02009;mmol/mol (6.2&#x02013;8.0%), with a mean value of 52&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x02009;mmol/mol (6.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.5%). HbA1c of people with T2DM treated with lifestyle modifications only was 49&#x02013;55&#x02009;mmol/mol (6.2&#x02013;7.2%).</p></sec><sec><title>Study Assessments</title><p>In both studies the first- and second-phase insulin secretion response was assessed as the area under the insulin secretion rate (ISR) curve after iv glucose challenge (ISR-AUC<sub>0&#x02013;10&#x02009;min</sub>, ISR-AUC<sub>10&#x02013;120&#x02009;min</sub>). The ISR was calculated by deconvolution analysis based on a two-compartment model of C-peptide (C-PEP) elimination and was calculated from the C-PEP concentrations using the <sc>insulin secretion</sc> (ISEC) computer program to calculate insulin secretion <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. First- and second-phase insulin concentrations (INS) as well as C-PEP and glucagon concentrations (and associated AUCs), and glucose disposal according to the glucose disappearance constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>glucose</sub>), were also evaluated.</p><p><italic>K</italic><sub>glucose</sub> was calculated as 100&#x000d7; the slope of the regression line fitted to the natural logarithm of glucose concentrations from 15 to 120&#x02009;min after the glucose bolus in people with T2DM and from 10 to 30&#x02009;min after the glucose bolus in HS. LIXI plasma concentrations were determined using a double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique (lower limit of quantification, 12&#x02009;pg/ml) from blood samples frequently collected over 12&#x02009;h after LIXI injection. Adverse event (AE) data were collected and summarized for all participants who received at least one administration of investigational product, including those who were withdrawn prematurely.</p><p>In healthy volunteers, blood samples were collected for 300&#x02009;min (for 60&#x02009;min before injection of LIXI or placebo and for 240&#x02009;min after injection). In people with T2DM, blood samples were collected 30&#x02009;min before and 240&#x02009;min after injection of LIXI or placebo, that is for 120&#x02009;min after iv glucose challenge. INS, C-PEP and glucagon concentrations were determined by peptide-specific radioimmunoassay, and glucose concentration was determined using a photometric hexokinase assay. In both the studies, blood samples for the determination of LIXI plasma concentration were collected from LIXI injection until 12&#x02009;h thereafter.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>The primary analysis population comprised all subjects with completed profiles on both study days and with both treatments.

This enhanced insulin secretion was seen to result in 6.6-fold elevated INS and an acceleration of glucose disposal comparable with that seen in HS on placebo, with <italic>K</italic><sub>glucose</sub>increasing by 1.8-fold. The first-phase insulin secretion response in people with T2DM was comparable with that seen in HS receiving placebo. In HS, LIXI also enhanced first-phase insulin secretion by 2.4-fold; first-phase INS was also higher by threefold and acceleration of glucose disposal was higher by 2.3-fold. However, the rise in second-phase insulin secretion was short lived and (in total) not increased, as insulin release rapidly ceased when blood glucose fell below baseline. Overall, these effects on insulin response are what would be predicted for a prandial GLP-1 receptor agonist based on previous studies with native GLP-1 or exenatide <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. It is important to note, however, that this was an acute study and the effect of LIXI on insulin secretion following longer-term use is not known.</p><p>The ability of LIXI to resensitize glucose-dependent insulin release was observed in all people with T2DM. However, there was a trend observed for LIXI to be more effective in those with modestly elevated HbA1c levels, indicative of the early stages of T2DM, compared with those with higher HbA1c levels. This is probably related to the greater insulin secretory capacity remaining in earlier disease stages.</p><p>Glucagon suppression was not affected in either patient population, with glucagon levels returning to normal more rapidly in HS after LIXI than after placebo. It is likely that physiological counter-regulatory pathways are not affected by LIXI, enabling the body to combat hypoglycaemia. The effect of LIXI on glucagon suppression is consistent with observations from a previous 13-week study that showed enhanced suppression with LIXI during the 4&#x02009;h following a standardized meal test <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>.</p><p>The iv glucose bolus coincided well with the maximum plasma concentrations of LIXI, which occurred 2&#x02009;h after subcutaneous injection of a 20&#x02009;&#x000b5;g dose, and the terminal plasma half-life was similar between people with T2DM (2.6&#x02009;h) and HS (2.1&#x02009;h), which is consistent with a previous study using repeated dosing of LIXI <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. Higher maximum plasma concentrations of LIXI were seen in HS compared with people with T2DM. This resulted in higher overall exposure to LIXI in HS than in people with T2DM&#x000a0;&#x02013;&#x000a0;reflecting the greater dose per body weight of 0.26&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/kg in HS compared with 0.23&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/kg in people with T2DM&#x000a0;&#x02013;&#x000a0;yet indicates otherwise similar exposure profiles in people with T2DM and in HS.</p><p>The mechanism of action underlying the observed acute effects of LIXI on insulin secretion probably involves direct stimulation of GLP-1 receptors located in the pancreatic islet &#x003b2;-cells, resensitizing the glucose concentration-dependent exocytotic release from insulin-secretory vesicles via a cyclic AMP-dependent signalling pathway <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. Although the overall impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists on glycaemic control is likely to involve a multifactorial mechanism of action, with retardation of gastric emptying being predominant to the PPG-lowering efficacy of LIXI, the acute effects on the insulin-secretory profile are likely to be highly relevant as they mark restoration of glucose-sensitive stimulation of insulin secretion <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>.</p><p>At least in its early stages, T2DM is characterized by fasting hyperglycaemia despite hyperinsulinaemia and relative hyperglucagonaemia, all of which were present in people with T2DM. The sustained lowering of blood glucose from hyperglycaemic levels to those of HS after injection of LIXI, and prior to the iv glucose challenge, which is not seen in subjects treated with placebo, is indicative of resensitizing glucose-sensitive insulin release and readjusting glucohomeostasis. This effect on fasting hyperglycaemia is effective on its own and adds to the accelerated PPG disposal. The corresponding effect in HS was short lived, which could be explained by intact glucohomeostatic regulation.</p><p>In conclusion, LIXI resensitized the insulin response to an iv glucose challenge in people with T2DM, thereby accelerating glucose disposal to nearly physiological intensities, and did not impair counter-regulation to low glucose by glucagon. The first-phase insulin secretion response in people with T2DM was comparable with that seen in HS receiving placebo.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all of the study staff and participating subjects at PROFIL.
