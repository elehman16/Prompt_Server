In a resource&#x02010;constrained setting such as a PHC, the implementation of a DSS intervention should test not only the physician performance, but also on related patient outcomes. Individual randomization dilutes the intervention effect size owing to contamination between individuals.<sup><xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Diffuse and complex interventions such as DSS (having information technology inputs) need cluster randomization.<sup><xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Moreover, coefficient of variation (CV) between PHC clusters can only be accounted for by analyzing cluster&#x02010;level data. Hence, we performed a cluster randomized trial that aimed to test the effectiveness and cost&#x02010;effectiveness of DSS for BP management among Indian hypertensive patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>We performed a cluster randomized trial to test the effectiveness and cost&#x02010;effectiveness of a DSS among Indian hypertensive patients, wherein PHC clusters were randomized to receive either a DSS or a chart&#x02010;based support (CBS) system in a district of Telangana state, India (baseline vs. 12&#x02010;month follow&#x02010;up; 8 PHC clusters per intervention). The processes involved in development, validation, and pilot testing of the DSS have been previously described.<sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The process of development and validation of our clinical DSS for management of HTN have been previously published.<sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Physicians from the PHCs, who were randomized to receive the DSS arm, were trained and instructed to follow the algorithms and prompts that would arise out of the computer&#x02010;based software for management of BP. DSS was a software that helped the physician to (1) undertake a thorough evaluation of risk factors that hypertensive patients may have for developing a CVD; (2) classify the risk level based on data entered by the physician. These included lifestyle&#x02010;related risk factors, such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet (high salt intake), obesity (waist circumference &#x0003e;90 cm in men and &#x0003e;80 cm in women), and physical inactivity (physical activity less than 30 minutes a day for at least 5 days in a week); nonmodifiable risk factors, such as age &#x0003e;55 years in males and &#x0003e;65 years in females, family history of premature coronary artery disease (males &#x0003c;55 years, female &#x0003e;65 years), history of heart disease (heart attack, angina, heart failure [HF], or any surgical procedure on coronary vessels, ie, coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty), history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, history of diabetes, high levels low&#x02010;density lipoprotein (&#x0003e;100 mg/dL), low levels of high&#x02010;density lipoprotein in blood (&#x0003c;40 mg/dL), and hypertriglyceridemia (&#x02265;150 mg/d:); (3) follow a software&#x02010;prompted algorithmic guideline&#x02010;based drug management (which was developed based on Indian hypertension guidelines II [2007])<sup><xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>; and (4) give alerts on the counseling on lifestyle changes and adherence to medication. Only lifestyle&#x02010;related counseling was provided for patients suffering from comorbid conditions, such as hyperlipidemia and diabetes, in the primary care centers. However, all patients suffering from any other comorbid conditions were referred to secondary care centers (community health centers) for their disease management. The algorithm had a defined set of criteria for referral to a higher center in the HTN treatment algorithms (Table S1).</p><p>The DSS was installed in a netbook and given to the physicians in the DSS group. All the physicians allocated to the DSS group had given a written informed consent to enter all the study patients' data in the netbook (containing the DSS software) and view the DSS recommendations. However, they had the choice to agree or disagree with the DSS recommendations. The final summary output sheet containing the patient&#x02010;tailored recommendations (based on the data entered by the physician) in the DSS had a tracking variable, which specifically asked the treating physician to document their agreement or disagreement with the DSS recommendations and, if agreeable, whether they implemented or did not implement the suggested recommendations. The physicians randomized to receive the CBS had the guidelines and lifestyle advices printed as a poster format, which was fixed to the wall opposite the place where the physician usually sat and examined the patients in the outpatient department. Posters were displayed prominently and were visible even at a distance of 3 m. The risk factors that need to be specifically elicited, classification of risk among hypertensive subjects, flow chart for drug management, and advice for lifestyle interventions was included as a simple flow chart in the form of a poster.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint was to compare the systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 0 and 12 months among hypertensive patients randomized to receive either the DSS or the CBS group. The secondary endpoints were to compare the cost&#x02010;effectiveness of the DSS versus the CBS at the end of 12 months among hypertensive patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Participants</title><p>Adult male and female Indians in the age group of 35 to 64 years, with SBP of 140 mm Hg or greater and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90 mm Hg or greater (irrespective of antihypertensive medications) who had given an informed written consent form were included in the study. Hypertensive subjects who have been hospitalized within the last 12 months, pregnant and lactating women, and participants with a history of cancer (physician certified) were excluded. The study protocol was approved by the (1) Human Biology Research Ethics Committee, University of Cambridge, UK, and (2) Institutional Ethics Committee, Public Health Foundation of India, New Delhi, India.

We stratified the 84 PHCs into two groups (1) less than 20 km from the nearest CHC and (2) more than or equal to 20 km away from the nearest CHC. A line listing of all PHCs was done in both the groups. A random double&#x02010;digit number table was used, by an independent statistician not belonging to the study group, to randomly choose 8 PHCs from the &#x0201c;less than 20 km distance&#x0201d; group. Matched pairs of PHCs based on population size were then created. Simple randomization by an independent statistician was then used to distribute the paired PHC into any one of the randomisation arms (ie, either DSS or CBS intervention arms). Similar steps were repeated for the &#x0201c;more than 20 km distance&#x0201d; group. Hence, 4 PHCs from the less than 20 km group and 4 PHCs from the more than 20 km group were randomized to receive DSS. Four PHCs (population matched to those PHCs that entered DSS arm) from the less than 20 km group and 4 PHCs from the more than 20 km group (population matched to those PHCs that entered the DSS arm) were randomized to receive CBS.

Data on known cardiovascular risk factors, such as type and quantity of smoking tobacco (cigarette or locally consumed products, such as beedi, chillum, and/or hukkah); type and quantity of oral tobacco and consumption of smokeless tobacco manufactured products (indigenous and locally consumed products, such as chewable tobacco, gutka, and paan with tobacco); and number of days alcohol was consumed in a typical week, whether alcohol was consumed regularly (defined as consumption of alcohol on more than or equal to 10 days in a month) were collected at 0, 6, and 12 months after study entry. The number of days in a week wherein physical activity was undertaken as a part of daily activity or leisure sport activity for 30 minutes a day was also collected. Dietary history questions were restricted to number of times of daily intake of salty food (locally high&#x02010;salt prevalent food items, such as pickles and papad), portions of fruits or vegetables consumed per day, quantity oil and fat consumed by the family members in a month, and type of oil/fat consumed by the family in a month were collected at 0, 6, and 12 months after study entry.

One to 2 hypertensive patients were recruited per day by the physician, per PHC, from the patients attending the outpatient clinic in the PHC. The average time for recruitment was approximately 4 to 8 patients per week per PHC and 16 to 32 per month per PHC. Hence, in approximately 4 to 6 months, all the required patients were recruited for the study from each center. Study recruitment lasted from October 2011 to March 2012. A 12&#x02010;month follow&#x02010;up phase for all recruited patients ended in March 2013. Patients were followed up for 1 year from the time they entered the study. Data collection using questionnaires on personal and dietary habits, risk factors, and physical measurements were done at baseline and during the 6th and 12th month after study entry. Baseline and end of 12th&#x02010;month comparisons were done for the primary endpoint. The assessments at 0&#x02010;, 6&#x02010;, and 12&#x02010;month time points were integrated with their monthly visits to the PHCs (PHCs provide medications on a monthly basis).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Consent Procedures</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the (1) Human Biology Research Ethics Committee, University of Cambridge, UK, and (2) Institutional Ethics Committee, Public Health Foundation of India, New Delhi, India. Participants were given sufficient time to understand the contents of the patient information sheet, which contained details on the study purpose, duration, study procedures, right to withdrawal from the study, details of patient confidentiality, ethical committee clearances, and the study team contact details. Participants were encouraged to ask questions regarding any aspects of the study procedures that they have not understood. The written informed consent form was read out aloud in the native language to the study participants. They were given an opportunity to seek clarifications on any issues that were not understood. Signatures were obtained by the physician who was recruiting the hypertensive patients for the study. The physician also signed and dated the informed consent form. One copy was given to the patients and 1 copy was retained at the study site. Written informed consent was obtained from both the representatives of the cluster (medical officer in charge of the PHC) and individual cluster members (hypertensive patients), and consent was sought before randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Cost&#x02010;Effectiveness Analysis</title><p>Drummond's 10&#x02010;point check list for cost&#x02010;effectiveness analysis<sup><xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> was used as a benchmark for our cost&#x02010;effective analysis (CEA). A societal perspective was employed because this would enable the tangible costs to be directly compared between both the intervention arms. The physician services, hospital services, drugs, costs of the DSS software development, and costs for charts (posters, etc.) involved in delivery of health care were included in the direct health care costs. Transportation to and from the site of care were included in the indirect costs. The time horizon for the costs involved was for a 1&#x02010;year duration. Costs were discounted at 3%. Quantities and unit prices for each item were calculated in Indian National Rupees and U.S. dollars. Costs for human resources were estimated from within the study. The building maintenance costs, telephone, electrical, vehicle, and other capital costs were sourced from published costing studies done among PHCs in India.<sup><xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Cost&#x02010;Effectiveness Ratio</title><p>A comparison of costs in monetary units with outcomes in quantitative nonmonetary units was done in the CEA. Resources required for intervention and values attached to those resources and effects of treatment (either benefit or harm) and values attached to those effects for both the groups were compared to determine the cost&#x02010;effectiveness ratio (CER). CERs were derived as the cost of the intervention per mm reduction in SBP for both the DSS and CBS groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Sensitivity Analysis</title><p>The hardware equipment costs in the DSS intervention arm are expected to fall with time and increase in usage. The software costs would also reduce given that they would entail no development, but only maintenance costs in the future. Owing to the fact that DSS intervention per se costs form a significant proportion of costs, we performed a sensitivity analysis at 50% and 80% reduction in DSS equipment costs.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis Plan</title><p>Linear mixed&#x02010;regression modeling was used to test the hypothesis about difference in mean SBP levels over time by trial group (interventions arms: DSS or CBS), accounting for clustering of observations within centers and individuals over time, using a random&#x02010;effects model. Mean difference in change in SBP and DBP (95% confidence interval [CI]) between the baseline and 12th month, for both intervention arms, were reported as unadjusted values. The SBP and DBP difference in changes from baseline between DSS and CBS groups at 12th month of follow&#x02010;up were adjusted for age, gender, height, waist, body mass index (BMI), alcohol intake, pickle and papad intake, and portions of vegetable/fruit consumed per day and allowing for clustering of observations within centers and individuals. The linear mixed&#x02010;modeling approach included all data available on participants, and the between trial group comparisons correspond to modified intention to treat (mITT) analyses. We performed an mITT, wherein we excluded those patients who were randomized, but had not received the allocated intervention in our analysis (randomized, but not received the allocated intervention: 5 of the 845 patients in the DSS arm and 10 of 793 in the CBS arm). We excluded the patients who had not received the allocated intervention from our analysis since we did not collect their data at 6th and 12th month time points (only baseline data collected). We acknowledge this as a limitation in our analysis plan. Additionally, we performed ITT by including both types of missing data: (1) the patients who were lost to follow&#x02010;up after randomization and (2) patients who were randomized, but had not received the intervention (5 and 10 patients in the DSS and CBS groups, respectively). We have conducted further sensitivity analysis by assuming the worst&#x02010;case scenario for patients lost to follow&#x02010;up (no improvement in BP in the DSS group and a reduction of at least 5 mm Hg in the CBS group). A limitation of our study is that we have not adjusted the alpha for secondary endpoints (lifestyle and dietary changes and BP under control and cost comparisons) analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="other"><title>Results</title><p>During the recruitment phase, which lasted from October 2011 to March 2012, 2478 consecutive HTN patients were observed at the OPDs of the study centers and assessed for eligibility to participate in the trial. A total of 521 did not fit our eligibility criterion (age greater than 64 years: 310; hospitalized within the last 12 months: 162; pregnant and lactating females: 24; and participants with a history of physician certified cancer: 25). Response rate was 83.6% (of 1957 eligible patients, 319 had declined to participate). Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl02">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl03">3</xref> summarize the baseline features of patients randomized to the 2 groups. There were no significant differences in age, age category (3 age categories: 35 to 44; 45 to 54; and 55 to 64 years), gender, religion, education, smoking status at baseline, and prevalence of pre&#x02010;existing HTN status between the 2 groups. The treating physicians who were randomized to receive the DSS agreed with the DSS recommendations and implemented the suggested DSS recommendations in more than 93% of patients at both 0&#x02010; and 12&#x02010;month time points (at 0 months: agreed with and implemented DSS in 794 and 787 patients, respectively, of 845 patients at baseline; at 12th month: agreed with and implemented DSS in 747 and

Costings</title><p>Equipment costs contributed a significant proportion of DSS costs. If equipment prices fall by 50%, estimated mean costs per year for the DSS group would decrease from $19 513 to $12 776. If equipment prices fall by 80%, the DSS mean costs per year would be $8733 (less than 50% of total costs for DSS intervention). However, total costs of the DSS group would remain slightly higher than those of the CBS group (difference of $1223). SDs for the equipment costs could not be calculated owing to the fact that the procurement was centralized and each center had the same model and make of equipment.</p></sec><sec><title>Cost&#x02010;Effectiveness Ratios</title><p>The average costs per patient for the CBS group patient ($344.69) divided by the average reduction in SBP over a 12&#x02010;month period (3.59 mm Hg) yielded a CER of $96.01 per mm reduction in SBP for the CBS group; the corresponding CER for DSS intervention arm was $36.57 ($370.48 divided by 10.13) per mm reduction in SBP.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="other"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our cluster randomized trial has shown that DSS help physicians to undertake guideline&#x02010;based risk staging, prescribe appropriate drug therapy, provide follow&#x02010;up advice, and offer tailor&#x02010;made counseling suggestions to patients based on their lifestyle and dietary factors. The adjusted mean difference in systolic BP, at 12th month of follow&#x02010;up, between the DSS and CBS in our study was &#x02212;6.59 mm Hg (95% CI: &#x02212;12.18 to &#x02212;1.42 mm Hg; <italic>P</italic>=0.021). The adjusted mean difference in DBP, at 12th month of follow up, between the DSS and CBS intervention arms was statistically not significant (&#x02212;2.83 mm Hg, 95% CI: &#x02212;5.78 to 0.13 mm Hg, <italic>P</italic>=0.083). Statistically significant differences between baseline and 12th month of follow&#x02010;up have been found for both SBP and DBP in the DSS arm. A trend toward statistical significance for both differences between baseline and 12th month of follow&#x02010;up in SBP and DBP was noted even in the CBS arm (<italic>P</italic> values of 0.061 and 0.06, respectively). The CERs for CBS and DSS groups ($96.01 and $36.57 per mm of SBP reduction) are very cost&#x02010;effective because they are less than the per&#x02010;capita gross domestic product of India ($1509; most recent estimate from World Bank in 2011).</p><p>The magnitude of difference for SBP between the intervention arms at study endpoint that has been found in our study (&#x02212;6.59 mm Hg; 95% CI: &#x02212;12.18 to &#x02212;1.42 mm Hg) has not been shown in any of the other DSS studies done thus far in the developed world. This could have arisen owing to 3 reasons. First, our cluster randomized study has been undertaken in a resource&#x02010;limited PHC setting, wherein the experience of the treating doctors and the health care staff for management of BP on clinical guideline based management is limited owing to the fact that the usual practice is to refer all cases to second&#x02010;tier health care (to the nearest CHC for initial screening and management of all hypertensive patients). Second, rigorous adherence of all sequential steps in the DSS algorithm by all the participating physicians made sure that risk, staging, history, and measurements were followed up with tailor&#x02010;made recommendations on drug management and counseling for lifestyle support. Finally, repeated counseling on lifestyle modifications at 0, 6, and 12 months by treating physicians and regular governmental supply of quality antihypertensives may have yielded the desired results.</p><p>Our study does not show a statistical significance for the adjusted mean difference in DBP, at 12th month of follow&#x02010;up, between the DSS and CBS in our study.

First, it has been documented, in clinical trials, that restriction of salt intake results in greater decrease in SBP than in DBP<sup><xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> (restricting salt intake to 80 mmol daily reduces SBP by 4.3 mm Hg and DBP by 2 mm Hg<sup><xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>). Consumption of salty food reduced in both groups at study end, when compared with baseline intake (owing to the lifestyle counseling given at 0&#x02010;, 6&#x02010;, and 12&#x02010;month time points), and thus might explain the greater drop in SBP, as compared to DBP, in both the study groups. Second, changes in lifestyle and dietary habits, such as increased physical activity, reduced alcohol consumption, and increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, all of which are known to lower SBP more than DBP,<sup><xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> may have led to more SBP reduction, as compared to DBP, in our study. Third, the magnitude of within&#x02010;group reduction in SBP at study end was more than the magnitude of within&#x02010;group reduction in DBP (SBP: 10.13 mm Hg in the DSS group and 3.59 mm Hg in the CBS group; DBP: 5.09 mm Hg in the DSS group and 2.82 mm Hg in the CBS group), which could have caused a statistical significant difference in SBP and an insignificant difference in DBP between DSS and CBS groups at the 12th month.</p><sec><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>This study has several important strengths.</p><p><italic>Blending within existing clinical work flow:</italic> We followed the SAGE (Standards&#x02010;Based Sharable Active Guideline Environment) consortium project recommendations by developing a DSS that has &#x0201c;a complex clinical guideline as a series of recommendation sets.&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Furthermore, we followed the SAGE guidelines model, which suggests that DSS must seamlessly blend within the clinical work flow nonobtrusively and allow for easy inspection of the underlying clinical logic, by having &#x0201c;info&#x0201d; buttons displaying the logic behind the recommendations.<sup><xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p><p><italic>Stakeholder involvement in DSS development process</italic>: A validated and pilot&#x02010;tested DSS was developed in resource&#x02010;constrained settings after extensive consultations and focus group discussions with all stakeholders involved.</p><p><italic>Reporting on patient outcomes:</italic> Computerised clinical DSS (CCDSS) have reported an improvement in physician performance and in quality of care given for patients, when CCDSS were deployed in developed countries.<sup><xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Ours is the first study that has documented an improvement in patient&#x02010;related outcomes for managing HTN at a primary health care level in low&#x02010; and middle&#x02010;income country settings (LMICs).</p><p><italic>Multicomponent intervention with concurrent advice to physicians and patients in institutional settings:</italic> A recent review reported that system&#x02010;initiated CCDSS in institutional settings performed better than ambulatory settings.<sup><xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Our DSS&#x02010;HTN has been set up in PHCs, which are the first gateway for institutional health care provider services in India. Adding a multicomponent intervention (clinical guidelines for the physician and lifestyle counseling for the patients) has yielded a comprehensive risk management strategy, thereby making our DSS&#x02010;HTN an effective tool for management of CVDs among hypertensive patients. In a recent decision maker/research partnership systematic review on CCDSS, transparent documentation of steps to clearly mention the design of the system, context in which CCDSS are deployed, implementation process, costing involved, user satisfaction, and impact on workflow patterns have been stated as key factors that ensure success in development and implementation of DSS.<sup><xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Our study has taken care to carefully delineate the above&#x02010;mentioned key factors.</p><p><italic>Inclusion of cost&#x02010;effective results:</italic> Very few DSS studies from the developed world have reported on cost&#x02010;effectiveness parameters. We studied the costs and the effect&#x02010;size gains involved among both the interventions and have arrived at reasonable estimates of accuracy (all our costs have been based on WHO&#x02010;CHOICE 2008<sup><xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> information, adjusted to inflation for the years 2009&#x02013;2012).</p><p>Our DSS&#x02010;HTN study meets 4 of the top 5 key DSS services and capabilities that have been listed in the consensus assessment of the health level 7 clinical decision support work group report.<sup><xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> &#x0201c;Clinical data query service, user communication service, use of appropriate and standard information models and the ability to leverage the DSS,&#x0201d; which were ranked on an absolute important scale,<sup><xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> and are the key services and capabilities needed for a service&#x02010;oriented architecture, are present in our DSS&#x02010;HTN. Finally, we have strived to provide recommendations, rather than mere assessments, for the physician in his daily workflow pattern at the time and location of his or her decision making, which have been identified as independent predictors for improving clinical practice when using CDSS.<sup><xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup></p><p>Our study has some potential limitations. First, our study did not have a usual care (UC) group. The comparison of DSS was done with the CBS group in our study. Given that the quality of usual care is very low in PHC settings in India, the ethical committee suggested having a chart&#x02010;based support system in place of UC, wherein the chart&#x02010;based system mimics all that is in a DSS, except that it is optional for the physician to refer to the pocket guidelines in CBS, whereas the physicians in the DSS group necessarily had to go step by step using the software processes in the netbooks. Our original intention to perform a cluster randomized trial with 3 arms&#x02014;DSS, CBS, and UC&#x02014;was not feasible in our settings owing to limitations in budget, higher sample&#x02010;size estimates, and lack of ethical committee's approval to undertake a 3&#x02010;arm study. Second, there was a considerable difference between the 2 treatment groups with respect to the number of patients with BP under control at baseline (186 participants in CBS and 106 in DSS). Having fewer patients with BP under control could have allowed participants in the DSS group more opportunity to improve BP. We attempted to overcome this limitation by doing a subgroup analysis based on the stages of BP. In the between&#x02010;group comparison at baseline, a significant difference in SBP was noted for patients in stage 1 and 3 BP. However, the between&#x02010;group comparison at the 12th month showed a significant reduction in BP even after accounting for between&#x02010;group baseline differences. The mean difference in SBP change from baseline between the DSS and CBS at the 12th month for patients in all stages of BP was significantly higher than the mean difference (between group) in SBP values at baseline (stage, 12th&#x02010;month difference versus 0&#x02010;month difference in SBP, stage 1: &#x02212;5.3 vs. &#x02212;1.3 mm Hg; stage 2: &#x02212;1.9 vs. &#x02212;1.1 mm Hg; stage 3: &#x02212;14.5 vs. &#x02212;12.9 mm Hg, respectively).</p><p>Third, a difference in loss to follow&#x02010;up was noticed between DSS (7.5%) and CBS (&#x0003c;1%) arms at the end of 12 months of follow&#x02010;up. To address the discrepancy in the loss to follow&#x02010;up rates between both the arms, we conducted further sensitivity analysis by imputing the missing data assuming a worst&#x02010;case scenario, although we acknowledge that multiple imputation may be a better approach for dealing with missing data on the covariates as well. We used a linear mixed model for inferences, which allowed the inclusion of all available data from the participants at baseline and during follow&#x02010;up in the modeling. Furthermore, because the modeling allowed for clustering at the center level and modeled the within&#x02010;subject correlations over time, the likelihood&#x02010;based inferences would have been unbiased under the missing&#x02010;at&#x02010;random assumption.</p><p>Fourth, a majority (90%) of the study&#x02010;site population is rural and this may have affected the generalizability of the findings to urban areas in India. However, this may have a limited impact given that 68.84% of the Indian population resides in rural areas (Indian Census 2011 data).<sup><xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Moreover, because our target was resource&#x02010;constrained PHCs, we chose rural settings. However, our study findings would be applicable to primary care settings in other LMICs given that they, too, suffer from similar problems, including lack of trained manpower and deficient health system infrastructure.</p><p>Finally, our study does not integrate the data from patient electronic records and hospital clinical information systems owing to the fact that the infrastructure for health management information system is still at a very primitive stage in India. The knowledge&#x02010;based engine in our system, built mostly on &#x0201c;if and then&#x0201d; scenarios, limits itself to management of HTN only at primary care settings. Similarly, potential interactions with other drugs that would have had an effect on BP have not been built in the system. Referral scenarios are suggested when the reasoning engine is confronted with complex data that can be managed only at secondary and tertiary care settings.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="other"><title>Conclusion</title><p>DSS embedded with clinical practice guidelines aid implementation of evidence&#x02010;based clinical practice guidelines for management of HTN even in resource&#x02010;limited settings. DSS result in better management of HTN, provided patients adhere to the suggested dietary and lifestyle modifications, and medications and providers adhere to the suggested DSS recommendations. Key features of the DSS include (1) patient&#x02010;specific, tailor&#x02010;made, and guideline&#x02010;based recommendations on risk factors and disease management of HTN and (2) counseling on lifestyle modification, both of which aid the end user (clinicians) to decide on the appropriate line of management for the patient. The DSS was not only effective, but also cost&#x02010;effective in management of HTN. Future studies on DSS should be of a longer duration and look at assessing (1) the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing the number of MI and stroke cases and (2) cost utility of the DSS, which, when answered, would aid in deciding the scalability and replicability of DSS in similar LMIC settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceived and designed the experiments: Anchala, Prabhakaran and Franco.
