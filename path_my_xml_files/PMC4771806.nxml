Here, we employed the cAMP/cGMP modulators, forskolin, IBMX, and cilostamide, during IVM to unravel the role of high cAMP in early embryonic development produced from prepubertal and adult bovine oocytes. Oocytes were collected via transvaginal aspiration and randomly assigned to three experimental groups: TCM24 (24h IVM/control), cAMP30 (2h pre-IVM (forskolin-IBMX), 30h IVM-cilostamide), and DMSO30 (Dimethyl Sulfoxide/vehicle control). After IVM, oocytes were fertilized <italic>in vitro</italic> and zygotes were cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> to blastocysts. Meiotic progression, cAMP levels, mRNA abundance of selected genes and DNA methylation were evaluated in oocytes. Blastocysts were used for gene expression or DNA methylation analyses. Blastocysts from the cAMP30 groups were transferred to recipients. The cAMP elevation delayed meiotic progression, but developmental rates were not increased. In immature oocytes, mRNA abundance of <italic>PRKACA</italic> was higher for cAMP30 protocol and no differences were found for <italic>PDE3A</italic>, <italic>SMAD2</italic>, <italic>ZAR1</italic>, <italic>PRDX1</italic> and <italic>SLC2A8</italic>. <italic>EGR1</italic> gene was up-regulated in prepubertal cAMP30 immature oocytes and down-regulated in blastocysts from all <italic>in vitro</italic> treatments. A similar gene expression profile was observed for <italic>DNMT3b</italic>, <italic>BCL2L1</italic>, <italic>PRDX1</italic> and <italic>SLC2A8</italic> in blastocysts. Satellite DNA methylation profiles were different between prepubertal and adult oocytes and blastocysts derived from the TCM24 and DMSO30 groups. Blastocysts obtained from prepubertal and adult oocytes in the cAMP30 treatment displayed normal methylation profiles and produced offspring. These data indicate that cAMP regulates IVM in prepubertal and adult oocytes in a similar manner, with impact on the establishment of epigenetic marks and acquisition of full developmental competency.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported in part by the DFG Research Group &#x0201c;Germ Cell potential&#x0201d; (FOR 1041; Ni 256/ 30-2 and 3).

In mammalian oocytes it maintains meiotic arrest by inactivation of maturation promoting factor (MPF) and by stimulating cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). During <italic>in vivo</italic> maturation in the mouse model, LH induces a decrease in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the mural granulosa cells and the oocyte, which in turn relieves the inhibition of phosphodiesterase 3A, by hydrolyzing cAMP to AMP, inducing activation of MPF and ultimately germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Cyclic AMP controls meiotic progression in fetal ovaries, and is involved in the establishment of the primordial follicle pool [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, the ability to accumulate cAMP is reduced in oocytes from prepubertal pigs [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and mice [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Since the oocyte receives cAMP from the adjacent cumulus cells via gap junctions, the lower cAMP levels associated with lower developmental capacity in prepubertal oocytes have been linked either to decreased LH/FSH ovarian receptor expression [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], altered adenylate cyclase response [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], different phosphodiesterase (PDE) activities [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and/or defective gap junction communication [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>When the oocyte is mechanically released from the antral follicle for <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation, intra-oocyte cAMP levels decrease and meiotic resumption begins non-physiologically, via &#x0201c;spontaneous&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;pseudo&#x0201d; maturation, attributed to the removal of inhibitory factors from the follicle rather than active processes [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150264.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This &#x0201c;pseudo&#x0201d; maturation has been linked to the lower efficiency reported for <italic>in vitro</italic> embryo production systems [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Diverse strategies have been tested not only in adult but also in prepubertal females to improve <italic>in vitro</italic> embryo production, including donor ovarian stimulation with different hormones or growth factors, such as eCG [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], GnRH [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], FSH [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], or IGF1 [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150264.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] with or without previous progesterone treatment [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150264.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, modulation of oocyte meiotic resumption by cAMP modulator agents [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], MPF inhibition [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], or cAMP analogs [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] have also been suggested. The simulated physiological oocyte maturation (SPOM) method was recently proposed to increase cAMP levels in bovine oocytes and cumulus cells from adult donors. It prevented spontaneous resumption of meiosis after mechanical oocyte retrieval and thereby improved <italic>in vitro</italic> embryo development [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. SPOM includes two steps using three different cAMP regulator compounds, forskolin (adenylate cyclase stimulator) and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, non-specific inhibitor of phosphodiesterases) 2 h prior to IVM followed by an extended exposure (30 h) to cilostamide (selective inhibitor of PDE3A and PDE3B).</p><p>The use of prepubescent oocytes is a promising strategy to preserve fertility in female pediatric patients with malignant disease or Turner syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150264.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, little is known about the competence of these oocytes and ethical reasons prohibit research on humans. Female prepubertal bovine donors have been used for <italic>in vitro</italic> embryo production with controversial results, but are currently used for commercial purposes [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150264.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The bovine model has been widely used for reproductive studies due to remarkable similarities with human [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge no research has been performed evaluating the effects of high cAMP levels on the developmental potential of bovine prepubertal oocytes. The purpose of the present study was to unravel the effects of increased intra-oocyte cAMP levels during maturation in bovine oocytes derived from prepubertal and adult donors using the SPOM system. We investigated the effects of elevated cAMP levels on mRNA expression of developmentally important genes, the CpG DNA methylation profiles of two DNA-satellite sequences and <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> development of oocytes from prepubertal and adult bovine donors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Bovine oocytes from prepubertal and adult donors were used in three different <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation (IVM) protocols. <italic>In vivo</italic> matured oocytes and <italic>in vivo</italic> produced expanded blastocysts were used as physiological standards for comparison with their <italic>in vitro</italic> produced counterparts.

Here, intra-oocyte cAMP levels were increased dramatically in both prepubertal and adult oocytes after 2 h pre-IVM with forskolin and IBMX (prepubertal oocytes: 360.4 fmol/oocyte; adult oocytes: 396.9 fmol/oocyte) as reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, after IVM intra-oocyte cAMP levels decreased, indicating that cAMP contents were not maintained at high levels during maturation in presence of cilostamide. The low cAMP levels prior to and after IVM in adult and prepubertal oocytes cultured without cAMP modulators, indicate that cAMP levels drop immediately after follicle aspiration and then remain at low levels through meiosis under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions. Our results provide compelling evidence that prepubertal oocytes produce and/or receive cAMP from cumulus cells in response to cAMP modulators similar to adult oocytes, suggesting that this pathway is already functional in prepubertal bovine oocytes, which is in apparent contrast to previous reports in mice and pig prepubertal models [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150264.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The observed increment in cAMP levels delayed progression through meiosis in oocytes obtained from prepubertal and adult donors. The maintenance of meiotic arrest was lower after 9 h in both types of oocytes than previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The <italic>in vivo</italic> oocyte retrieval method, use of heparin [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], number of cumulus cells, and inherent variation of the oocyte in the present approach may have influenced meiotic resumption and the response to cAMP modulator agents observed in this study.</p><p>An interesting side aspect of this study was that dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) added as a vehicle control, accelerated meiotic resumption in prepubertal and adult oocytes and reduced blastocyst yields, with a pronounced effect on prepubescent oocytes. Decreased oocyte developmental competence and lower blastocysts rates have been previously reported when DMSO was supplemented during IVM or IVC [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150264.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thus, DMSO even at low concentrations can affect cell integrity and normal cell function which has to be taken into account when using DMSO as solvent for defined molecules in research.</p><p>Lower <italic>in vitro</italic> development of oocytes derived from prepubertal donors employing 6&#x02013;7 and 7&#x02013;10 months old stimulated donors compared with adult donors has been previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150264.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], whereas other studies using 1&#x02013;4 months old unstimulated donors found similar cleavage and blastocyst rates as for adult donors [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Variable developmental rates have been reported using the SPOM system [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150264.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and the high success rates in the first report could not yet be confirmed, possibly due to methodological changes in culture conditions [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In our approach, prepubertal and adult oocytes produced similar blastocyst rates and the increased cAMP levels did not further improve <italic>in vitro</italic> developmental rates both in prepubertal and in adult oocytes. The prepubertal animals used in this study were ~6&#x02013;9 months of age; puberty usually starts around 10&#x02013;12 months in our animals. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out that at least some of the prepubertal donors were close to puberty, which may explain at least in part the similarities observed in the present study. Furthermore, it has been recently proposed in the mouse model that the follicles activated in the fetus in the ovarian medulla (first wave of primordial follicles) are actively growing after birth and remain as dominant ovulatory follicles until early adulthood [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150264.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Oocytes isolated from these follicles could have similar or even higher developmental competence [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], which could also explain the donor similarities observed in the present study.</p><p>Satellite DNA is the most abundant fraction of the genome [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In the present study, CpG DNA methylation in immature oocytes was similar in all treatments for both satellite sequences. Previously, comparable results were found for BT&#x003b1;S, whereas BTS hypermethylation was found in prepubertal oocytes [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Here, increased cAMP before IVM induced hypermethylation for both satellite sequences (BT&#x003b1;S and BTS) in MII adult oocytes compared to <italic>in vivo</italic> matured oocytes, indicating that the increment in cAMP levels possibly induces methylation changes during IVM. These findings could be associated with a better synchronized de- and remethylation during embryo development, because similar CpG methylation patterns were found in blastocysts retrieved from prepubertal and adult oocytes compared to their <italic>in vivo</italic> produced counterparts. Genome-wide DNA demethylation occurs after fertilization and reaches the lowest level at the morula stage and remethylation is initiated in the blastocyst in a cell type specific pattern [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Expanded blastocysts obtained from prepubertal oocytes under standard conditions, displayed lower DNA methylation profiles than their <italic>in vivo</italic> counterparts for the two DNA satellites, which could suggest hypomethylation during further development. Demethylation of satellite DNA has been observed in senescent [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and the facial anomalies syndrome (ICF) in humans [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Hypomethylation of satellite DNA could affect the transcriptional patterns of the entire genome via docks for transcription control proteins [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This hypomethylation may induce the expression of genes that are repressed under physiological conditions [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], which in turn might affect embryo development, and explain, at least in part, the differences in embryo viability reported previously for prepubertal donors [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150264.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hypermethylation was also observed in blastocysts produced under standard IVM conditions and in the group with DMSO supplementation suggesting gene repression and effects on further development. Our results indicate that satellite DNA methylation profiles in blastocysts can be altered by the previous oocyte culture conditions.</p><p>The relative abundance of transcripts for <italic>PDE3A</italic>, <italic>ZAR1</italic>, <italic>PRDX1 and SLC2A8</italic> genes was not affected by pre-IVM or <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation neither before nor after IVM in both types of oocytes. However, <italic>ZAR1</italic>, <italic>PRDX1 and SLC2A8</italic> transcript levels decreased markedly after maturation in all <italic>in vitro</italic> treatments and <italic>in vivo</italic> matured oocytes as previously shown for both types of donors [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150264.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], indicating selective transcript degradation for these three genes during maturation and their usefulness as oocyte maturation markers. We can rule out ageing effects due to the 6 h extended IVM period as <italic>SMAD2</italic> levels (marker for oocyte ageing) in MII oocytes were similar among <italic>in vitro</italic> treatments and age groups [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150264.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and because ageing effects in bovine oocytes become apparent after 48 h of IVM [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150264.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>BCL2L1</italic>, <italic>PRDX1</italic>, <italic>DNMT3b</italic> and <italic>SLC2A8</italic> expression levels did not differ significantly at the blastocyst stage suggesting similar roles of these genes before and after puberty. The promoter region of <italic>EGR1</italic> contains two cAMP responsive elements (CRE). Protein kinase A plays an important role in activating CREB (CRE binding protein)[<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. We speculate that the observed <italic>EGR1</italic> up-regulation in immature prepubertal oocytes is associated with the observed increase in <italic>PRKACA</italic> expression, and the activation of the cAMP/PRKACA/CREB pathway by high intra-oocyte cAMP levels. Additionally, marked <italic>EGR1</italic> down-regulation was observed in the present study for all <italic>in vitro</italic> produced expanded blastocysts in contrast to adult <italic>in vivo</italic> produced counterparts as reported previously, suggesting a close association between <italic>EGR1</italic> transcription and blastocyst quality [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies had suggested that embryos derived from prepubertal donors lack the ability to establish and maintain a pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150264.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Here, we found similar rates of <italic>in vivo</italic> development for both age groups (prepubertal donors: 29.4%, adult donors: 46.7%), comparable to previous reports under <italic>in vitro</italic> standard conditions for both types of donors [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Obviously, the oocyte cAMP increment had no deleterious effects on the capacity of the embryos to establish and maintain pregnancy. In both donor groups some calves were found with high birthweights, which had been previously reported in calves obtained from prepubertal donors [<xref rid="pone.0150264.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Due to the small number of transfers it is difficult to establish whether or not this observation was related to the source of oocytes, the bull used in IVF or the technique itself. Nevertheless, our results indicate that cAMP regulator agents are compatible with healthy pregnancies, established from embryos derived from adult or prepubertal donors; but care must be taken due to possible overweight of progeny.</p><p>In conclusion, we have found that bovine oocytes from prepubertal females (6&#x02013;9 mo old) appear to have a functional cAMP system, similar to their adult counterparts. A detailed characterization of their cellular, molecular and epigenetic features revealed only few differences between the two types of oocytes. Cyclic AMP increment in prepubertal and adult oocytes prior to IVM delayed meiotic progression, but did not increase developmental rates. However, it shifted DNA satellite sequence methylation marks during embryo development towards that of <italic>in vivo</italic> derived controls. Apparently, prepubertal oocytes have a greater sensitivity to exogenous factors, such as DMSO and cAMP modulators, than their adult counterparts. Collectively, these results show that maintenance or increment of cAMP levels prior to IVM play an important role in the acquisition of full developmental competency of oocyte and embryos; but the underlying mechanisms regulating these events must be explored in future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec028"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150264.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p><bold>Ultrasound images obtained from A) right ovary of a prepubertal bovine donor and B) right ovary from an adult bovine donor.</bold> Every point in the scale bar on the left side indicates 0.5 cm.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150264.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150264.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><p><bold>Bovine oocytes from prepubertal donors before IVM: A) cAMP30 protocol, B) DMSO30 protocol, C) TCM24 protocol and after IVM: D) cAMP30 protocol, E) DMSO30 protocol, and F) TCM24 protocol.</bold> Different categories of oocytes before IVM are shown.
