Rubella is generally a mild viral infection in children, but in pregnant women it may cause fetal death or severe congenital defects <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends measles and rubella vaccines for all the children in the world <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In 2012, several global agencies led by the WHO set the goal of eliminating measles and rubella in at least five WHO regions by 2020 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Currently, global measles immunization coverage is at 85%, but, to achieve elimination, at least 95% coverage with two doses of vaccine is required <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Though measles vaccine is used universally, in many developing countries, vaccines against mumps and rubella are not used in immunization programs.</p><p id="p0035">Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine generally is administered as a subcutaneous injection with needle and syringe (N-S). However, vaccine delivery with needles can cause needle-stick injuries and cross-infection, and it also creates dangerous sharps waste in communities. N-S delivery also complicates the logistics of immunization campaigns, since the requirement for proper sharps disposal can limit their reach and coverage. An alternative to N-S for vaccine delivery is the jet injector, a device that creates a fine stream of pressurized liquid that penetrates the skin to deposit vaccine without using a needle <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p id="p0040">Disposable-syringe jet injectors (DSJIs) that use a sterile, single-dose, disposable syringe for each patient were introduced in the 1990s, and a number of models have been approved in the United States and Europe for different uses, including vaccinations <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p id="p0045">The risks associated with DSJI use include failure to deliver the correct dose; pain, bleeding, or swelling at the injection site; and user error in positioning the injector to deliver the dose to the correct layer of tissue&#x02014;however, most of these risks also apply to vaccination by N-S <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p id="p0050">Vaccination by jet injection has been shown to induce immunity similar to that provided by N-S injection and to have a similar safety profile for a number of vaccines, including typhoid, cholera, smallpox, hepatitis A and B, influenza, whole cell pertussis-diphtheria-tetanus, polio, yellow fever, and tetanus. <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> A previous study comparing a DSJI with N-S for administering MMR vaccine several years ago met the requirement for rubella but failed to demonstrate non-inferiority of the DSJI to N-S for the measles and mumps vaccines <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, that study used a different jet injector than the one used in the present study as well as a vaccine from a different manufacturer.</p><p id="p0055">We conducted a phase IV, randomized, observer-blind, non-inferiority, parallel-group, multicentric clinical study of MMR vaccination in infants in India to compare immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine when administered by a DSJI to administration by conventional N-S method. A result of non-inferiority for the DSJI would support use of vaccination with a jet injector, offering a needle-free alternative for country immunization programs.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods and materials</title><p id="p0060">The study sponsor was the Serum Institute of India Pvt.

DiagnoSearch Life Sciences (Mumbai, India) was delegated by the sponsor for site monitoring, project management, clinical data management, and statistical analysis of the data. Approvals were obtained from the Drug Controller General of India, the institutional ethics committees of all study centers, and the Western Institutional Review Board in the United States. The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for GCP (E6) 1996; the GCP Guidelines in India; and the Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research on Human Subjects, issued by Indian Council of Medical Research in 2006.</p><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Vaccine</title><p id="p0065">MMR vaccine (SIIPL, India) was used in the study. It is presented as a single-dose of lyophilized vaccine and is provided with a sterile diluent (0.5&#x0202f;ml of water for injection) in a separate container. The vaccine is reconstituted by adding the diluent to the vial containing the lyophilized pellet. A single dose of 0.5&#x0202f;ml contains live attenuated strains of Edmonston-Zagreb measles virus (not less than 1000 CCID50), Leningrad-Zagreb mumps virus (not less than 5000 CCID50), and Wistar RA 27/3 rubella virus (not less than 1000 CCID50). The same batch of the vaccine (MMR batch 013N4017A expiry May2016 and diluent batch 064Q40330Z expiry April 2016) was used throughout the study. It was stored at 2&#x02013;8&#x0202f;&#x000b0;C.

The Stratis needle&#x02010;free injection system delivers 0.5&#x0202f;ml fluid volumes either intramuscularly or subcutaneously by means of a precise narrow fluid stream, which penetrates the skin in about a 1/10th of a second and delivers the medicine or vaccine into the body. Energy to propel the fluid is supplied by a hand-held, spring-powered injector, designed to be reused a minimum of 20,000 times. A disposable syringe containing medicine or vaccine is attached to the injector and placed in contact with the patient&#x02019;s skin. The fluid is then expelled through a very small orifice in the face of the syringe.<xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> The batch numbers for the Stratis devices used in the study were 25854275 and 23436455.

Each block consisted of six subjects. The randomization list was generated using SAS&#x000ae; statistical software version 9.2 in SAS Enterprise Guide 4.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). The list of randomization numbers and the group allocations covered with scratch labels were provided to all sites. Subjects were allocated to groups by scratching the label corresponding to the randomization number in the list by the vaccinator, just before vaccine administration.

Paired serum samples were tested using ELISA IgG kits (Trinity Biotech, Bray, Ireland) at Quest Diagnostics (Gurgaon, India). Seropositivity for each vaccine component was defined as IgG antibody titers &#x02265;1.10 immune status ratio (ISR). For measles and rubella, antibody titers were converted from ISR to IU/ml per instructions in the ELISA kits. For mumps, the ISR values were used.

Parent diaries for solicited local and systemic AEs occurring over 14&#x0202f;days post-vaccination were transcribed into the case report form. All solicited events were recorded for maximum severity and relatedness to treatment. The solicited local reactions were pain, redness, swelling, or bruising. The solicited systemic AEs were fever, rash, parotitis, lymphadenopathy, and loss of appetite. Unsolicited events and serious events were also collected from subjects throughout their entire participation in the study. All adverse events were categorized into mild, moderate or severe based on pre-defined severity criteria.

Also, differences in Day 35 post-vaccination GMTs between two groups for each component of vaccine were not statistically significant. A booster effect was seen for measles with MMR vaccination in both the groups in subjects who were seropositive at baseline. There was more increase in seropositivity from baseline to Day 35 post-vaccination for mumps and rubella in N-S group as compared to DSJI group, and the opposite was seen for measles. Similarly, there was more rise in GMTs from baseline to Day 35 post-vaccination for measles and rubella in N-S group as compared to DSJI group, and the opposite was seen for mumps. However, these apparent small differences were not statistically compared as they were not part of statistical analysis plan. Injection site reactions were more in DSJI group as compared to N-S group and this difference between two groups was statistically significant. However all injection site reactions resolved without any sequelae. Similarly, in a previous study of influenza vaccination, higher frequency of local injection site reactions were reported with DSJI than with the use of needle and syringe <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Systemic adverse reactions were comparable between the two study groups. Nine unsolicited adverse events (four injection site haemorrhage; one lymphadenopathy; one parotitis; and three upper respiratory tract infections) in DSJI group and seven unsolicited adverse events (one injection site haemorrhage; one injection site induration; four upper respiratory tract infections; and one vomiting) in N-S group were related to investigational or reference product (investigational product is the combination of delivery method and vaccine; causality is not attributable to the separate components). All reported systemic adverse events were consistent with typical MMR vaccination adverse events.</p><p id="p0175">Since all subjects had received a measles vaccination at 9&#x0202f;months of age, around 65% were measles seropositive at the beginning of the study. However, for mumps and rubella, the baseline seropositivity was less than 10%. After vaccination, the proportions of seropositives in both the groups increased significantly, to a level of 98&#x02013;100% for all three antigens, indicating that administration with the DSJI results in immunogenicity similar to that after injection with N-S.</p><p id="p0180">As noted earlier, jet injectors have worked well with many licensed vaccines, with the exception of a study of MMR vaccine conducted in Brazil that failed to demonstrate non-inferiority of the DSJI to N-S for measles and mumps vaccines <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The device used in that study was discontinued by the manufacturer and replaced with the Stratis device used in the current study. One hypothesis for the outcome of the Brazil study was that the pressures and shear forces generated during jet injection might have affected the viability of the live viruses in MMR vaccine; however, subsequent laboratory studies found that this was not the case <xref rid="b9000" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Another possibility was that vaccine left on the surface of the skin might have contributed to the reduced immunogenicity after DSJI delivery. The different manufacturers&#x02019; MMR vaccines also could have contributed to the difference in results. Thus, ours is the first study that demonstrates that MMR vaccine can be given by a jet injector with equivalent immunogenicity as that with conventional N-S. Also, MMR vaccination by jet injector is as safe as vaccination by N-S except for injection site reactions, in particular redness and swelling, which are more with DSJI. The cause of the increased injection site reactions with DSJI is not proven, but may be due to the mechanism of action of the DSJI, which deposits residual amounts of vaccine at each layer of the skin as it penetrates to the correct delivery depth.</p><p id="p0185">Limitations of this study include the lack of masking of the study participants and their parents to the method of vaccination and unequal gender distribution in the two study groups. An unequal gender distribution was purely a random occurrence. The use of block randomization can introduce bias, particularly with smaller block sizes.</p><p id="p0190">To conclude, subcutaneous MMR vaccination via DSJI is as immunogenic as vaccination by N-S. MMR vaccination by DSJI demonstrates a clinically acceptable safety profile and is similar to vaccination by N-S except for injection site reactions which are more with DSJI and are well-tolerated. Results of this study support use of the DSJI for MMR vaccination and provide information for regulatory authorities, immunization program managers, and clinicians who make decisions about safe clinical practice standards. Using the DSJI can reduce the risks of needle-stick injuries and the burden of sharps waste disposal, which can streamline logistics and contribute to improved coverage in low-resource settings, helping to reach the goal of preventing these diseases and their serious sequelae.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0195"><funding-source id="gp010">Bill &#x00026; Melinda Gates Foundation</funding-source> and <funding-source id="gp015">Serum Institute of India Pvt.
