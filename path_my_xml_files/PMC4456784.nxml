Children of parents with BD (CPB) are at significantly increased risk of a range of mental health issues including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, substance use, and sleep disorders. Furthermore, CPB are also at elevated risk for BD compared to the general population. This paper describes the rationale and protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) designed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a new online intervention providing interactive psychoeducational information and parenting support for parents with BD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>This article describes a single-blind randomised controlled trial comparing an Integrated Bipolar Parenting Intervention (IBPI) in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) with TAU alone. Participants will be recruited from across the UK from mental health services and through self-referral. The primary outcome of the study is the feasibility and acceptability of IBPI as indicated by recruitment to target, use of the intervention site, and retention to follow-up. Parents with BD allocated to the IBPI condition will have access to the intervention for 16 weeks. Effect size estimates will be obtained with respect to child behaviour, parenting skills and measures of parental mental health using measures taken at baseline (0), and at 16, 24, 36, and 48 weeks post randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first randomised controlled trial of an integrated bipolar disorder parenting intervention.

Difficulties with work-related performance, financial issues, social/leisure activities and social/family relationships are common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], though positive experiences of BD have also been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Overall, BD tends to have a significant negative impact on the individual, family, and society, with an estimated annual&#x000a0;financial cost in England alone of &#x000a3;5.2 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Many individuals with mental health problems are also parents. An Australian study estimated that 23 % of children live in families with at least one parent with a mental health illness and 20 % of users of mental health services have dependent children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The Royal College of Psychiatrist&#x02019;s report &#x02018;Parents as patients: supporting the needs of patients who are parents and their children&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] has highlighted the potential impact of parental mental health issues on children, especially severe mental illness, such as bipolar disorder. Parenting can be a particular challenge for parents who are living with bipolar disorder, as there can be difficulties with sleep/wake cycles, impulse control, motivation and communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] which can impact on their ability to consistently engage in adaptive parenting.</p><p>There is now consistent evidence that children of parents with BD (CPB) are vulnerable to a wide range of behavioural and emotional conditions including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, substance use, and sleep disorders, in addition to higher rates of BD compared to the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, it is possible that parenting programmes, designed to help parents to encourage desirable behaviour and cope with challenging behaviour in their children may be effective in enhancing the confidence and skills of bipolar parents, and in doing so, can help ameliorate these vulnerabilities. Parenting programmes are delivered in a range of formats from group settings to online and typically build on parenting strengths rather than highlighting weaknesses. There is evidence that such programmes can effectively reduce child problem behaviours including conduct, antisocial behaviour and attention deficit disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>A particular parenting programme (Triple P), developed by one of the authors (MS) has been shown to be effective in reducing problem behaviours and in improving both parenting skills and parental wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, there is evidence that in depressed mothers Triple P led to reductions in both maternal&#x000a0;depression and in problem behaviour in their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although there are Triple P studies which have included teenagers, the majority of trials have focussed on parents of pre-teenage children typically aged 2&#x02013;3 to 9&#x02013;11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>There is a high demand for both structured psychological interventions for mental health issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] as recommended by National Institute for Clinical Excellence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and for community based parenting support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However many individuals struggle to access either of these types of intervention due to lack of suitably trained therapists. The internet (currently used by 73 % of the UK population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]) provides an alternative to face to face interventions offering the potential to deliver self-management help flexibly (at the time and location chosen by the client), cheaply and without the stigma that some people feel is associated with seeking support from mental health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>A pilot study by our team has shown that providing simple psychoeducational information on BD along with an early online version of the Triple P Positive Parenting Program led to significant improvements in child behaviour and parenting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The present study builds on this work using a new interactive self-management site for BD developed for the study and integrated with the most recent version of Triple P Online, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] to provide a web-based integrated bipolar parenting intervention (IBPI).</p><p>This paper describes the rationale and protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of IBPI designed to assess how feasible it is to implement an online parenting intervention for parents with BD. The study will therefore evaluate as primary outcomes, recruitment into the study and consent to participate, retention to the intervention and to follow-up assessments (both arms). The trial will also provide preliminary estimates of the impact of the intervention on child behaviour, parenting skill and confidence, parental mood (including time to further mood episodes) and family functioning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Method</title><p>This trial is conducted by a multidisciplinary team of researchers, clinicians, service users, and a statistician across academic institutions and NHS Trusts in the United Kingdom.

Records on participants who drop out of the study before week 48 will be incomplete. Analysis of measurements and dropout times will include checks that groups are balanced with respect to age, gender, level of education and use of services, and control for these as required, followed by linear modelling with correlated errors for the repeated measurements and linked logistic regression models for the probability of dropout conditional on the repeated measurements prior to dropout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

The corresponding primary analysis will be a two-sample t-test comparing values of D in the two groups. Post-intervention, it is hypothesised that participants who received IBPI will have a greater D than those receiving assessments only.

The online parenting intervention IBPI has been developed with experts in positive parenting interventions, experts in the self-management of bipolar disorder and individuals who have experience of bipolar disorder consistent with Mental Health Research Network good practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In addition, service user involvement has been a core aspect of the research process, from inception of ideas through to the development of the methodology, outcome measures and the intervention. The intervention itself promotes positive parenting and builds upon skills which parents already possess. There is currently no other known intervention which specifically provides targeted support for parents with bipolar disorder.</p><p>Strengths of the study include a focus on an intervention which integrates strategies to aid living well with bipolar disorder in the context of being a parent of young children. It also offers the potential to increase access to evidence-based support for a group who currently have limited access to psychological interventions in general and particularly to interventions which also incorporate consideration of the challenges of parenting. The diverse nature of the research and intervention development team have ensured that the intervention is grounded in lived experience of being a parent with bipolar disorder, with the addition of opinions from experts in the field. The nature of IBPI means that each parent can personalise and tailor their own intervention, allowing them to get the most out of it for their circumstances. The intervention is intended to be both flexible and appealing, acknowledging the issue of engagement. All modules can be started, paused and recommenced when convenient or when feeling able to focus on the content.</p><p>The online RCT aims to be as rigorous as a traditional RCT but reducing the impact of potentially confounding variables such as extensive contact with the research team. In line with the definition of Mathieu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] the current trial is <italic>primarily</italic> rather than <italic>fully</italic> on line (as not all of the assessments are completed online). Participation in the trial is from home and observer-rated assessments are made via the telephone consistent with this minimal contact (whilst all self-report measures are completed online). A diagnosis of bipolar disorder is verified at baseline; followed by a series of outcome measures at baseline and then at follow up time points. Evaluating IBPI online makes it possible to recruit participants nationally, and capture outcome data instantaneously. This study is recruiting from across NHS primary and secondary care settings throughout the United Kingdom and through self-referral with a focus on online recruitment. Therefore, the findings should be more representative of a group of parents with bipolar disorder who use the internet for parenting support. This means higher levels of reliability, and validity without the cost implications and resources necessary in traditional RCTs.</p><p>The weaknesses of this study would need to be addressed in a later definitive trial. However, parenting in bipolar disorder is an area where little is known about the effects of a targeted intervention. The study allows individuals to be followed up for a period of 48 weeks following the use of the IBPI intervention. Further follow-ups would be helpful to indicate more definitively whether this intervention has a sustained impact on longer term parenting and mood outcomes. As the current focus of this trial is on parents of children from 3 to 10 it will not indicate whether this integrated approach might have potential as children enter teenage years and beyond (when risk for increased psychopathology in offspring is detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]).</p><p>The online nature of this intervention study means that there is a lack of human contact including the absence of a therapist. This potentially puts more demands on the individual to apply self-management strategies on their own initiative. However, this might also be an advantage for some participants, particularly in the context of evidence that individuals with bipolar disorder typically place high value on autonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. It has been suggested that computer mediated studies may provide an environment which encourages socially desirable or unreliable responding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, there is contrasting evidence to suggest that such studies are equally as reliable as traditional methods of outcome data collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and it has been argued that the anonymous online environment allows participants to express their opinions and feelings more freely, thus, reducing unreliable responding when completing outcome measures online [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p>In summary, if the current study indicates that IBPI is an acceptable and feasible intervention, in addition to potential clinical benefits it will be an important step towards developing evidence-based interventions for parents with bipolar disorder that have been lacking until now.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>This trial reports on both the development and evaluation of the IBPI intervention, the latter is therefore not independent.</p><p>Rachel Calam has long standing research collaborations with staff at the Parenting and Family Support Centre, School of Psychology, University of Queensland.
