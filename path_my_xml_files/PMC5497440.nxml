The Drug and Cosmetic Act 1940 and Rules 1945 is related to quality and sale/manufacturing license of the medicines in India but does not differentiate between generic and branded drugs.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The term &#x0201c;branded drug&#x0201d; broadly encompasses drug formulations manufactured and sold by a company under a popular brand name which is promoted. It does not correspond to innovator drug as in the US.</p><p>Generic drugs are manufactured by a pharmaceutical company under a brand name which is not promoted and so not widely known.</p><p>Two important factors regarding the use of generic drugs in India are low availability of competitively priced generics to the consumers[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and the quality of such drugs. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organization has made stringent rules and regulations in bringing out medicines in public use in India, requiring extensive <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> testing before marketing.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Despite these tests and the economic advantages of generic drugs, there is reluctance among doctors to prescribe and patients to use these agents because of perceived lesser efficacy of these drugs. Quality assurance of medicines, whether generic or innovator, is a feature of all procedures and processes involved throughout the production and supply chain. This quality assurance includes the quality of raw materials, excipients, packaging, stability studies, and bioequivalence.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Bioequivalence is important for all drugs and more so for antimicrobial agents. If drugs are found inequivalent, they would be considered as substandard or counterfeit drugs. According to the WHO, up to 10% of the drugs worldwide may be counterfeits with up to 50% of them being antimicrobial agents. In a recent literature review, out of 163 counterfeit antibiotics detected in the world until 2009, 50% were &#x003b2;-lactams with India leading with highest reported counterfeit/substandard antibacterial agents.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Amoxicillin was chosen for this study as it is a widely used and effective agent to treat community-acquired bacterial infections such as respiratory, urinary, ear, and nose.</p><p>This study was planned to ascertain whether bioequivalence of branded and generic amoxicillin capsule is comparable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study was conducted after obtaining approval from the institutional ethics committee at a tertiary care teaching hospital of Maharashtra.

Participants having a history of major illnesses, habituated to tobacco or alcohol, and a history of hypersensitivity to amoxicillin were excluded from the study.</p><p>After being given detailed information about the study, the participants were requested to sign an informed consent. Participants were randomized into two groups of six volunteers each, and each group received the two drug treatments at two different times, with a 1-week washout period.</p><p>The drugs were administered orally with 250 ml of water, after overnight fasting of 10 h. Venous blood was collected through indwelling catheters at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after dosing. Amoxicillin has a half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of 1&#x02013;1.5 h, 8 time points were selected at 0, 0.5, and 1 covering absorption phase and 1.5, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h covering elimination phase after dosing.</p><p>Using a refrigerated centrifuge, blood samples were spun at 3800 &#x000b1; 20 rpm for 10 min at 10&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C to separate serum. The serum samples were then stored upright in a freezer at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p><p>Amoxicillin was assayed in serum by an ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometric method. The method given by El-sayed <italic>et al</italic>. was modified and adapted to human serum and validated.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The method was validated for sensitivity, specificity, linearity, accuracy, and precision. A volume of 0.5 ml of serum sample was mixed with 4 ml of distilled water, and 0.5 ml of 70% perchloric acid was added to precipitate serum protein. The mixture was shaken for 5 min, and then centrifuged for 40 min at 2500 rpm. The supernatant was collected and read at 235 nm.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters such as area under the curve (AUC)<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>, C<sub>max</sub>, and T<sub>max</sub> were determined.

A sample size of 12 was chosen as it provides a power of 80% at &#x003b1; =0.05 in two-way crossover studies, which is sufficient for statistical analysis.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>A crossover design was adopted as it is the design of choice for bioequivalence trials. An advantage of this design is that it reduces the between-subject variability, because the comparison of different treatments is done on the same participant. This also results in a smaller sample size. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the flow of study events.</p><p>The main disadvantage of this design is carryover effect which can be overcome by giving an adequate washout period in a single-dose study. A washout period of 7 days was given to the participants in this study, which is more than 10 t<sub>1/2</sub> of amoxicillin, whose t<sub>1/2</sub> is 1&#x02013;1.5 h. Carryover effects can be detected in a bioequivalence trial, if the predose samples contain any measurable amount of study drug administered in the previous period. No amoxicillin was obtained in the predose samples of period 2 in the present study.</p><p>Bioequivalence is the absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent of absorption of drugs under consideration. Bioequivalence testing considers C<sub>max</sub> as this parameter indicates both the rate and extent of absorption. AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> determine the extent of drug absorption in the body. AUC is dependent on the rate of absorption and rate of elimination of the drug from the body. T<sub>max</sub> along with C<sub>max</sub> determines the rate of absorption.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The goal of equivalence testing is to test whether the 90% confidence interval of geometric mean AUC and C<sub>max</sub> ratio of Test (Generic drug) and Reference (Branded drug) is between the bioequivalence interval of 80% and 125% or 0.80 and 1.25. The basis of this range, 80%&#x02013;125%, is that differences in systemic drug exposure up to 20% are not clinically significant.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Log-transformation of C<sub>max</sub> and AUC parameters is required for calculation of the ratios as it normalizes the distribution of data.</p><p>The confidence limits of the geometric mean ratio of C<sub>max</sub> fell into the required range of 0.80&#x02013;1.25, but the confidence limits of the geometric mean of AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> lay outside the bioequivalence interval, with the lower limit being &#x0003c; 0.8 [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p><p>Coefficients of variation were &#x0003c; 5% for AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. Coefficients of variation can reflect within-subject variability. Since it was &#x0003c; 5%, it indicated minimal within-subject variability.</p><p>AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> mean values, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, for reference drug and test drug did not vary much from AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> mean values of the respective drugs. Since AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> indicates area under curve till complete elimination of the drug, this could be because amoxicillin has a short t<sub>1/2</sub> of around 1&#x02013;1.5 h, and since serum concentrations up to 8 h were included, the drug was almost completely eliminated from the body as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>Bioequivalence can be claimed only when the 90% confidence intervals of geometric mean ratios of both C<sub>max</sub> and AUC fall within the range of 0.80&#x02013;1.25. Since the confidence interval of AUC does not fall into this range, the generic formulation cannot be considered as bioequivalent to the branded amoxicillin product.</p><p>The mean time point at which maximum serum concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) was achieved for both drugs did not vary much. Results of C<sub>max</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> show that rate of absorption of both drugs was similar to each other.</p><p>On extensive literature search, few studies comparing generic amoxicillin to branded with varying results were found. In Italy, two generic drugs were compared with the innovator drug and it was found that the generic drugs were bioinequivalent for C<sub>max</sub> on the basis of single-dose study.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Another study testing generic amoxicillin in Bangladesh found it to be bioequivalent to its branded counterpart.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Equivalence was seen in a study comparing the bioequivalence of amoxicillin 500 mg capsules in Brazil[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Malaysia.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Amoxicillin is a &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotic and its antibacterial effect is time dependent. To be therapeutically effective, the optimal antibacterial action is required, and the duration for which the drug is above MIC is important. Hence, this parameter was also evaluated, though it is not required for bioequivalence. MIC of amoxicillin is 6.5 &#x003bc;g/ml.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The generic drug remained above this concentration for 48.38 (&#x000b1;9.12) min, whereas for branded drug, it was 56.75 (&#x000b1;5.07) min. When compared to branded drug, the generic drug showed a significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in the duration of concentration of drug over MIC. The difference seen in these results can play a part in reduced efficacy of generic drug as the concentration below the MIC is subtherapeutic and will not inhibit the microorganisms it is directed against.</p><p>In the present study, C<sub>max</sub> of both the preparations was equivalent. However, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>, and time above MIC of generic preparation were significantly less than that of the branded one. Due to this inequivalence, the generic drug under consideration would have subtherapeutic efficacy.</p><p>An extension to this study was done to ascertain the reason for biological inequivalence, which could be either due to chemical or pharmaceutical factors. Chemical equivalence of these capsules was studied, and the results showed them to be chemically equivalent.</p><p>Pharmaceutical factors also affect the bioavailability of drugs. Various factors such as excipients, additives, lubricants, and also pressure required to compress the mixture into capsule form can affect pharmaceutical equivalence.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Further studies are required to study the pharmaceutical equivalence of these drugs in detail.</p><p>The use of such inequivalent drugs can result in adverse clinical outcomes such as lack of effect and treatment failure, risk of development of bacterial resistance, toxicity, or side effects, all of which contribute to the burden of disease and consequently to excess mortality and morbidity. Therefore, a strong regulatory mandate is required to reduce the entry of such drugs in the market.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, comparison of generic and branded amoxicillin capsules showed generic capsules' bio-inequivalent to branded capsule. Duration above MIC of generic drug was also significantly lower than that of branded capsule.
