Whether this impact on the thermoregulatory response is solely due to affected thermoregulation is not clear, since reaction time may also be affected by hypoxia. Therefore, we studied the effect of hypoxia on thermal perception thresholds for warmth and cold. Thermal perception thresholds were determined in 11 healthy overweight adult males using two methods for small nerve fibre functioning: a reaction-time inclusive method of limits (MLI) and a reaction time exclusive method of levels (MLE). The subjects were measured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions using a cross-over design. Before the thermal threshold tests under hypoxic conditions were conducted, the subjects were acclimatized by staying 14&#x000a0;days overnight (8&#x000a0;h) in a hypoxic tent system (Colorado Altitude Training: 4,000&#x000a0;m). For normoxic measurements the same subjects were not acclimatized, but were used to sleep in the same tent system. Measurements were performed in the early morning in the tent. Normoxic MLI cold sensation threshold decreased significantly from 30.3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.4 (mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SD) to 29.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.7&#x000b0;C when exposed to hypoxia (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). Similarly, mean normoxic MLI warm sensation threshold increased from 34.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.9 to 34.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.1&#x000b0;C (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). MLE measured threshold for cutaneous cold sensation was 31.4&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.4 and 31.2&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.9&#x000b0;C under respectively normoxic and hypoxic conditions (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.05).

Most research on this topic has been focused on the one hand on thermal perception (Golja et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref>; Golja and Mekjavic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2003</xref>; Launay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2006</xref>) and on the other on reaction-time (Mackintosh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1988</xref>) both pleading for further research on the cause.</p><p>Hypoxia is suggested to affect perception of temperature stimuli by impeding thermoregulation at a neural level and may influence the zone of thermal comfort. Whether this impact on the thermoregulatory response is solely due to affected thermal regulation can be argued since hypoxia may also affect reaction-time (Fowler and Prlic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1995</xref>; Mackintosh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1988</xref>). Recently acclimation to intermittent hypoxia has been described to increase the sensitivity of the thermoregulatory system and thereby to modify thermoregulatory responses at sea level (Launay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2006</xref>). This could lead to a disturbance in the cutaneous perception of warm and cold stimuli. Golja et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref>) investigated the effects of hypoxic exposure on the perception of cutaneous warm and cold stimuli and suggested that cold sensation is affected as a result of exposure to hypoxia. This assumption was assessed with a cutaneous threshold thermal testing system positioned at the feet while subjects where either under hypocapnic hypoxia or normocapnic hypoxia conditions. Previous studies have demonstrated that hypoxic exposure could lead to a decrease in neural function resulting in a loss in cognitive function (Fowler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1994</xref>; Kennedy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1989</xref>) and an increase in reaction time (Fowler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1994</xref>).</p><p>The aim for this study was to assess the effect of nocturnal induced normobaric intermittent hypoxia on thermal perception thresholds (warm and cold) using a reaction time inclusive (Limits) and a reaction time exclusive (Levels) method for small nerve functioning in men. We hypothesize that hypoxia induces slowing of neural activity in the sensor-to-effector pathway and does not affect the sensation threshold for detection of either warm or cold. As a consequence of this hypothesis the results of Levels testing must be unaffected by hypoxia while the corresponding Limits values are expected to be significantly changed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects and materials</title><p>Eleven healthy, non-smoking overweight males with an average (SD) age of 44 (7)&#x000a0;years, a height of 180 (7)&#x000a0;cm, a body mass of 104.9 (16.1)&#x000a0;kg and a body mass index of 32.2 (3.1)&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, volunteered for the study (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

This enclosure is coupled with a molecular sieve that produces hypoxic air. A compressor forces normoxic air through the molecular sieve producing a controlled level of hypoxia. Airflow through the tent is sufficient to maintain high air quality and safe CO<sub>2</sub> levels while simulating altitudes up to 4,575&#x000a0;m and is therefore widely used in altitude training. The tent used in this study was 2.1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;2.3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;1.8&#x000a0;m and incorporates an oxygen sensor and hypoxic alarm (Wilber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2001</xref>). Before the thermal threshold tests were conducted, the subjects stayed overnight (8&#x000a0;h) in a hypoxic tent system (Colorado Altitude Training) under normoxic (300&#x000a0;m) and hypoxic (4,000&#x02013;4,200&#x000a0;m) conditions at the department of Human Biology at the Maastricht University. The study had a crossover design with a normoxic and a hypoxic period, preceeding the measurements in the laboratory. Each subject was measured after a normoxic period of at least 14&#x000a0;days preceeding the normoxic measurements, and after a 14&#x000a0;days hypoxic period before the hypoxic measurements. To avoid any tent effects all volunteers spent at least three nights at home sleeping under normoxic conditions in a fully operational tent before normoxic measurements. To prevent symptoms of acute mountain sickness subjects where acclimatized to hypoxia corresponding to 4,200&#x000a0;m. This stair step build-up was done in 5&#x000a0;days according to the so-called 300-m rule. After this period subjects were exposed to hypoxia at home every night for 14 consecutive days before the laboratory measurements commenced. The evening before the measurements participants came to the institute at 21:30&#x000a0;h. To get acquainted with the temperature threshold test procedures each subject performed a testing session consisting of a limits and a levels sequence in the evening (see below). Skin temperatures were measured according to Ramanathan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1964</xref>) by means of wireless thermo telemetry sensors (iButton<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) (van Marken Lichtenbelt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>). Core body temperature was measured by means of temperature telemetry using commercially available medical grade capsules (Coretemp<sup>TM</sup> 2000). After placing the temperature sensors, subjects got ready to enter the tent.</p><p>All measurements were performed inside the hypoxic tent under either normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Approximately 30&#x000a0;min after waking up in the morning subjects where summoned to sit at the foot end of the bed while temperature thresholds were measured at the palmer thenar of the contra lateral wrist, as opposed to right- or left-handedness. The researcher entered the tent via a lock system ensuring a constant O<sub>2</sub> level. The tests were performed between 7:00 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. The tests were performed according to Reulen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2003</xref>) using a commercially available computerized thermo-stimulator (Medoc TSA 2001<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Ramat Yishai, Israel) operating on the Peltier principle. The thermode (active area 32&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;32&#x000a0;mm<sup>2</sup>) was strapped to the palmar thenar, distal of the carpometacarpal joint using a fixation belt. The free hand was used to press a mouse button either when warm or cold sensation was perceived or a &#x0201c;yes/no&#x0201d; answer had to be given. Thermode adaptation temperature and thus starting baseline temperature was always set to 32&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Method description</title><p>Thermal perception thresholds were determined using two methods for testing of small nerve fibre functioning: the reaction-time inclusive method of limits (MLI) and the reaction time exclusive method of levels (MLE) as described by Claus et al.

As soon as warm or cold sensation is perceived the subject stops the administered stimulus by pushing a button thereby resulting in a slightly higher (increasing warm stimulus) or lower (decreasing cold stimulus) perceived threshold temperature because of the inherently &#x0201c;built-in&#x0201d; reaction time (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). A warm or cold sequence consists of five temperature stimuli and final MLI threshold is the mean of these five values. In advance of each sequence two training stimuli were administered. A complete MLI protocol started with seven cold stimuli (2 training, 5 measurement) followed by seven warm stimuli (2 training, 5 measurement). The inter-stimulus interval varied at random between 4 and 6&#x000a0;s and the change rate was set at 1&#x000b0;C/s with a 10&#x000b0;C/s return rate to baseline upon pushing the reaction button. To alert the subject an auditory warning signal was given directly before onset of each stimulus.

Starting from 32&#x000b0;C temperature rises (warm sensation) or decreases (cold sensation) with a 2&#x000b0;C step (rate of change 1&#x000b0;C/s). Based on the subjects answer (&#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; sensation) the &#x000b0;C amplitude of the following temperature step is doubled (&#x0201c;no&#x0201d; answer) or halved (&#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; answer) until a minimal perceptive criterion is established. In this &#x0201c;yes/no&#x0201d; procedure post-stimulus speed of reaction and by that reaction time does not play a role. By doing so a complete MLE test consists of several single stimuli resulting in a finally acquired reaction-time free temperature threshold. Anticipation or prediction of stimuli is prevented by random inclusion of &#x0201c;dummies&#x0201d; (no temperature change after the auditory signal) and combining two separate sequences of levels stimuli in a single test sequence. In this study levels thresholds were determined by applying temperature stimuli directly after an auditory cue (change rate 1&#x000b0;C/s) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Similar to the MLI, cold sensation sequence preceded warm sensation.

The results show that cold and warm cutaneous temperature threshold sensitivities are not affected by exposure to normobaric hypoxia in altitude acclimatized, overweight subjects. This is based on the finding of unchanged cold and warm temperature thresholds at the palmar thenar of the hand using the method of Levels. The increase in processing time in the sensor-to-effector pathway, including reaction time, becomes apparent from increased MLI measured thresholds for warm and cold.</p><p>In a study in which the perception of cold and warm cutaneous stimuli under hypoxia and hypoxia induced hypocapnia was examined, Golja et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref>) have reported a decrease in cutaneous thermal sensation for cold, but not for warmth, in humans after inspiring a mixture containing 10% oxygen. These results where obtained by determining cutaneous thresholds for thermal sensation on the toe using an MLE alike levels method. Their finding of an unchanged warmth threshold agrees with our findings while the increased threshold for cold disagrees with our data. However, there are major methodological differences between both studies. A difference was the level of acclimatization. While Golja et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref>) measured under non-acclimatized conditions, the volunteers in the present study were acclimatised prior to the tests by 14&#x000a0;days nocturnal intermittent hypoxia. Acclimatization thus can be one reason for the discrepancy for cold sensation between Golja et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref> and our study. Another difference concerns the method and apparatus used for threshold determination, which were different from ours. Stimulus site was also different (hand versus toe). In Golja&#x02019;s study warm threshold of the toes was measurable in a limited number of subjects. In our study all subjects responded to warm and cold stimulation of the hand.</p><p>Our study thus shows that the thermal thresholds, determined by the MLE, revealed no differences between normoxia and hypoxia. The altered thermal sensation as revealed by the MLI indicate that the hypoxic effect on cutaneous thermal thresholds may be a result of lowered neural activity and/or delayed signal conduction. This reflects the view that synaptic function is the first neural process to become affected during oxygen depletion (Astrup <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1982</xref>). So the functioning of the "thermal sensitivity system" does not seem to be affected but processing speed is lowered. Since thermal thresholds are not changed it is unlikely that the zone of thermal comfort is affected by hypoxia under normobaric circumstances.</p><p>One may argue that during hypoxia no changes in thermal MLE sensation were observed, not because no effects exist on thermal sensation, but because other factors, such as a learning effect, may have interfered with the results. Golja and Mekjavic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2003</xref>) reported a decrease over consecutive trials in warmth sensation threshold using a levels alike method (Fowler and Taylor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1987</xref>). The warm threshold decreased with repeated testing and stabilised after the third trial, indicating a learning effect. In our study several arguments do not favour the view of a learning effect as the source of our finding of unchanged warm and cold MLE thresholds. The MLE method, using exactly the same Medoc TSA system with similar protocols as in our study, has been evaluated extensively (Yarnitsky and Sprecher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1994</xref>; Kemler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2000</xref>). None of these studies, report significant intersession differences in MLE warm and cold thresholds measured at the wrist position between a first and a second session. In our laboratory (Kemler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2000</xref>; Reulen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2003</xref>) and in our patient investigations (Hoitsma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2003</xref>) always one or more training session(s) were done before actual MLE threshold determination. As a consequence of the rather simply to perform procedure, post-trainings session MLE threshold did not depend on trial number. Furthermore, the effect found in our study was not warmth specific, as it was in Golja&#x02019;s (Golja and Mekjavic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2003</xref>) study but was comparable for warm and cold sensation thresholds. To avoid training effects, as mentioned in the method section, each subject performed a complete testing session the evening before the actual recording session took place. Finally, the study had a cross over design regarding their normo- or hypoxic measurements: four subjects started with the normoxic period and measurment versus seven who started with the hypoxic condition. This minimizes a possible systematic effect on the results.</p><p>Under normal conditions thermal stimuli are considered warm or cold depending on the cortical integration of afferent sensory information (Cabanac et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1969</xref>) mediated by relatively fast (5&#x02013;30&#x000a0;m/s) conducting A&#x003b4;-fibers (cold perception) and slow (1&#x02013;2.5&#x000a0;m/s) conducting C-fibers (warm perception) (Reulen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2003</xref>). Since the MLI results did not differ between cold and warm tests, hypoxia did not seem to affect thermal perception of warm or cold differently. This might indicate that there may be no distinction in hypoxic impact on A&#x003b4; and C-fiber function, and cortical integration of its afferent sensory information. Possibly, with respect to the reaction time, the efferent part of the trajectory is involved, but this needs further exploration.</p><p>Most information on thermoregulation and other physiological parameters is collected from hypobaric chamber studies and mountain expeditions. However, it is known that using 14&#x000a0;days of intermittent isobaric hypoxia also results in altitude acclimatization (Katayama et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2004</xref>). Our study shows that the body temperature profile, as reflected by core body and average skin temperature, did not significantly differ between normoxia and hypoxia. Since room temperature was kept constant and tent temperature did not differ per situation, no changes in body temperature distribution were expected. In the tent overnight CO<sub>2</sub> accumulation occurred to a level of 0.3% CO<sub>2</sub>. This is far below known measurable effects on thermoregulation. Calculation of mean skin temperature is better using more measurements sites, although a four-point mean is recommended where simplicity of the technique becomes important (Mitchell and Wyndham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1969</xref>). Keeping in mind the limitation of the four-point mean skin temperature, the results of this normobaric hypoxic study on core body and average skin temperature suggest that hypoxia per se does not affect the body temperature profile.</p><p>Exposure to hypoxia could lead to reduced attentional performance (Bonnon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2000</xref>). Determination of thermal perception thresholds requires not only the ability to discriminate between thermal warm versus cold thresholds but in this case also the maintenance of an attentional focus. In the experimental setting used in our study, the auditory cue upon start of temperature change was thought to optimise attention. Stimulus duration, from its start to the moment of pushing the reaction button, was maximally about 4&#x000a0;s (time between start from 32&#x000b0;C to reaching a maximal threshold of about 28 or 36&#x000b0;C for cold respectively warmth). Under the (unlikely) assumption that subjects were not able upon auditory cued stimulus onset to hold attention for about 4&#x000a0;s, one cannot completely reject decreased attentional performance as a cause or at least as a part of the noticed increase in reaction time.</p><p>Mackintosh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1988</xref>) found a strong positive correlation between &#x0201c;long&#x0201d; reaction times and altitude in subjects affected with acute mountain sickness. As all subjects in the present study were acclimatized to hypoxia none of them suffered from any acute mountain sickness symptoms during testing. Considering this, lassitude or other effects associated with acute mountain sickness that might be able to interfere with reaction time can be excluded and thus, the noticed increase in the sensor-to-effector pathway processing time might be a direct hypoxic effect.</p><p>As the present study was part of an investigation in the effects of hypoxia on overweight and obesity, all subjects were overweight. Although there is no evidence stating differences in thermoregulatory reactions, one cannot exclude that discrepancy in results might occur between overweight and non-overweight subjects.</p><p>Finally we were able to confirm the hypothesis posed in the introduction. Although the influence of attention on MLI results cannot be excluded, precautions were taken to minimise it. A question remains whether decreased attention also may be a manifestation of decreased neural activity and/or signal conduction speed due to hypoxia.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this research offer strong evidence for decreased neural processing and/or decreased nerve conduction speed as an important cause for hypoxia induced effects on nervous system functioning.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would express their gratitude to Colorado Altitude Training for supplying several CAT hypoxic tent systems and specific technical assistance.
