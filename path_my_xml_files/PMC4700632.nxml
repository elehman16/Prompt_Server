The length of incision for a 2-level PLF usually ranges from 8 to 12&#x000a0;cm, depending on not only patient&#x02019;s size but also surgeon&#x02019;s preference and skills. Such techniques as percutaneous pedicle screw placement and expandable retractor system have been applied in PLF procedures in the last decade, aiming to lessen approach-related morbidity. However, such minimally invasive techniques always require totally four to seven incisions, and one of these incisions has to be around 4&#x000a0;cm in length so that an expandable retractor can be inserted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>With the advance navigation technology, navigated posterior lumbar fusion (navigated PLF) has become a new option for spine surgeons. The current paper presents a technique which needs only a 5-cm incision to accomplish a 2-level PLF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Peking University.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Navigated PLF</title><p>The indications for navigated PLF were symptomatic 2-level degenerative disc disease. Navigated PLF takes one incision, the length of which is about 5&#x000a0;cm. Through the 5-cm incision, pedicle screw placement, decompression, discectomy, cage insertion, and bone grafting can be performed. Accordingly, because of the incision&#x02019;s being small, blood loss can be decreased. Another advantage of navigated PLF is that the pedicle screws are inserted under the guidance of the infra-red navigators, which not only make the procedure safer but also completely avoid the operation personnel&#x02019;s exposure to radiation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Surgical techniques of navigated PLF</title><p>The indications for conventional PLF were the same as those of navigated PLF. Navigated PLF is performed with the patient under general anesthesia and in prone position on a carbon-fiber operating table. A 5-cm longitudinal median incision is made. Detachment of paravertebral muscles and exposure of laminas are performed bilaterally.</p><p>Firstly, a patient tracker is fixed to the spinal process (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) followed by a 3D scanning using a C-arm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). After the scanning, the image data are transferred within 30&#x000a0;s from the 3D C-arm to the navigation workstation. As a result, the lumbar spine of the patient can be tracked by the navigation system in real time. Meanwhile, the navigated instruments are also being tracked.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>
<bold>a</bold> The pedicles of L4, L5, and S1 are located with fluoroscopy. <bold>b</bold> Three transversal lines (<italic>arrows</italic>) are drawn on the skin to mark the location of the pedicles of L4, L5, and S1. <bold>c</bold> A 5-cm longitudinal median incision is made. <bold>d</bold> The navigated instruments are used in the procedure. <bold>e</bold> A patient tracker is fixed to the spinal process after exposure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13018_2015_338_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>
<bold>a</bold> Once a patient tracker has been fixed to the spinal process, a scanning will be performed with a 3D C-arm (<italic>arrow</italic>). <bold>b</bold> After the scanning, the 3D-reconstruction images are available on the screens. <bold>c</bold> A navigated tactile awl is used to establish the trajectories for the pedicle screws. <bold>d</bold> On the screens, both the navigated tactile awl (<italic>arrow</italic>) and the patient&#x02019;s spine are shown in real time, and hence, the trajectories can be made under the guidance of the navigator</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13018_2015_338_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>Secondly, under the guidance of the navigator, six pedicle screws (multi-axial, 6.5-mm diameter) are inserted one by one. When a screw is being inserted, the muscles are pulled laterally and the operator always has the visual of the entry point (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Once all the six pedicle screws have been inserted, another 3D scanning is usually performed to check the position of each screw. If all the screws have shown to be well placed, the patient tracker is removed from the spinal process.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>
<bold>a</bold> When a trajectory has been established, a screw will be inserted. <bold>b</bold> The operator always has the visual of the screw during the course of screw insertion. <bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold>, Once all the six screws have been inserted, another round of 3D scanning will be performed to check the positions of the screws. After the scanning, the screws are shown in 3D-reconstruction images, and the positions of which can be clearly seen</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13018_2015_338_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p>Lastly, a retractor is inserted to give the operator the visual of the laminas, by which decompression, discectomy, cage insertion, bone grafting, rod instrumentation, and screw nuts locking are performed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Circumferential decompression of the dural sac and nerve roots was completed by removal of the lateral part of the lamina of the two vertebrae, and was considered satisfactory until only the middle pedicle remained visible. Posterolateral fusion using both autograft and allograft was performed in every case.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>

Regarding operation time, both of the previous and current studies showed similar results, the time consumption of minimally invasive and conventional lumbar fusion were comparable (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Operation time and blood loss for 2-level lumbar fusion</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Author</th><th>Operation time (min)</th><th>Intraoperative blood loss (ml)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sakaura [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] (PLIF)</td><td>218</td><td>612</td></tr><tr><td>Hioki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] (PLIF)</td><td>301.8</td><td>1277.6</td></tr><tr><td>Scarone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] (MIS-TLIF)</td><td>249.6</td><td>206</td></tr><tr><td>Current study (navigated PLF)</td><td>160.7</td><td>209.0</td></tr><tr><td>Current study (conventional PLF)</td><td>144.4</td><td>334.0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

In addition, we found that the incision length decreased with time. At the final follow-up, the incision length had decreased averagely from 4.8 to 4.3&#x000a0;cm in the navigated PLF group and from 10.9 to 10.3&#x000a0;cm in the conventional PLF group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Navigated PLF versus other minimally invasive techniques</title><p>Several minimally invasive procedures have been developed in order to lessen the approach related morbidity. Schwender et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] presented the first clinical series reporting on minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MiTLIF). A paramedian, muscle-sparing approach was performed through a tubular retractor. Facetectomy, discectomy, and interbody cage insertion through the tube were performed. Bilateral percutaneous pedicle screw-rod placement was then accomplished with the Sextant system. Scheufler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] reported their clinical study on percutaneous transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (pTLIF). Decompression, discectomy, and interbody cage insertion were performed through tubular retractors followed by percutaneous pedicle screw-rod fixation. Isaacs et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] developed microendoscopic transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (METLIF). Hemilaminectomy, unilateral facetectomy, and microdiscectomy were performed using microendoscopy-assisted lumbar fusion through a working channel. Bilateral percutaneous pedicle screws were then inserted.</p><p>All the minimally invasive techniques mentioned above require totally four to seven incisions, and one of these incisions has to be around 4&#x000a0;cm (ranging from 3.5 to 4.5&#x000a0;cm) so that an expandable retractor can be accommodated. The present technique requires only a single 5-cm incision, and hence greatly decreases the number of incisions, which is one of the superiorities of navigated PLF over the other minimally invasive techniques. However, small skin incision does not necessarily mean small muscle injury. Navigated PLF in the current study still involves muscle detachment and ligamentous disruption, which should be improved in the future. Small skin incision could be a problem for navigation, because the patient tracker could be moving when the wound is being retracted laterally. As such, patient tracker must be fixed firmly and care must be taken when retracting the wound.</p><p>The length of incision could be further decreased if the pedicle-screw direction was well designed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Another important advantage of navigated PLF is that the pedicle screws are inserted under the guidance of the infra-red navigators, which not only make the procedure safer but also completely avoid the operation personnel&#x02019;s exposure to radiation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Compared to conventional PLF, navigated PLF proved to be superior with regard to incision length, blood loss, time to mobilization, and shorter length of hospital stay.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interest</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>YW conceived of the study and drafted the manuscript.
