The expectation is that this approach will lead to sustainable implementation of the patient decision aid.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Because the majority of patients with prostate cancer (as well as partners themselves) have the opinion that their partner has played a major role in the treatment decision, we also involved the partners of patients with prostate cancer in this study.</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Disadvantage of the stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial is the extended study duration due to sequential intervention rollout and the complicated analysis due to the unidirectional crossover.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in men over 55 years in the Netherlands. The vast majority of these men have a localised form of prostate cancer, meaning that the cancer is only present in the prostate gland and has not spread to another part of the body.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> For the initial treatment of localised prostate cancer, there are multiple, medically equivalent curative treatment options (radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy) as well as the option not to be treated immediately by following an active surveillance (AS) protocol. Each of these approaches has its own side effects, risks and possible consequences for the patient and his partner.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref> Currently, patients are informed about the treatment options, with often a well-intentioned preference by the healthcare professional (HCP).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> As long as none of these treatment options has proven to be superior,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> a patient should be able to make a decision based on his own preferences and values such as maintaining sexual function and urinary continence.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</p><p>Patient decision aids (PDAs) are tools, which can be used to help patients make specific and informed choices among options by providing information on the outcomes relevant to a person&#x02019;s health status.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Multiple studies showed that PDAs improve patients&#x02019; knowledge, participation in decision making and support patients to reach choices that are more consistent with their informed values.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 10&#x02013;12</xref>
</p><p>Usually, PDAs are developed and consequently evaluated in randomised controlled trials investigating effectiveness. Despite proven benefits of PDAs, structural implementation falls short of expectations. Barriers for implementation were recently revealed in reviews<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref>: HCPs do not trust the content of PDAs, they question if the information provided is evidence-based or they think that the PDA does not reflect &#x02018;local&#x02019; data.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Time pressure, lack of applicability due to patient characteristics (eg, patients&#x02019; literacy levels) and limitations due to clinical factors (eg, if a patient is not eligible for more than one option) were other barriers mentioned by HCPs.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> To overcome these hurdles, we developed a PDA for patients with localised prostate cancer and prepared an overview of requirements for implementation using an iterative participatory approach, meaning that patients with prostate cancer and HCPs were involved in each step of the development process.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref> This approach resulted in a PDA that fits the needs of patients and HCPs with the aim to ensure adequate uptake in daily clinical practice. See the Methods section for more information on the PDA and its development process.</p><p>The present study aims to assess the effectiveness and cost-utility of the PDA among newly diagnosed patients with localised prostate cancer and their partners, alongside implementation of the PDA in routine care via a stepped-wedge clustered randomised controlled trial. To our knowledge, there are no stepped-wedge cluster randomised trials with PDAs for patients with prostate cancer that evaluate both the effectiveness, cost-utility and implementation of a PDA.</p><p>Based on the Cochrane study of Stacey <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> we hypothesise that the PDA will improve knowledge on prostate cancer, satisfaction with the information provided and prepare patients for the treatment choice and can thus lead to a reduction in Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). Moreover, we expect the PDA to make patients more aware of the choice and can thus lead to a change in the role patients want to have in the decision-making process (eg, be more active).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Additionally, we hypothesise that the PDA will also result in more realistic expectations of the treatment and to less regret afterwards.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref>
</p><p>Because studies have shown that the majority of patients with prostate cancer (as well as partners themselves) have the opinion that their partner has played a major role in the treatment decision,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> we will evaluate the effect of a PDA on partners as well.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods/design</title><p>A prospective stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted to compare the PDA with usual care.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> We followed the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) checklist<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> (see appendix A). A stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial is a research design in which a new treatment is sequentially implemented in a set of clusters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). A stepped-wedge design is applied to assure implementation of the PDA in all of the participating hospitals while still allowing for a comparison with usual care. The order in which the clusters start with the new intervention is randomised. Until the time of implementation of the new intervention, clusters serve as a control group. A flowchart of the trial is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Time schedule of the stepped-wedge randomised controlled trial design.

Therefore, we developed a web-based and booklet version of a PDA for patients with localised prostate cancer.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> provides an overview of the followed steps in the development process. A qualitative assessment of needs among patients (n=12) recently treated for localised prostate cancer, their partners (n=4) and HCPs (n=10) by means of three focus group interviews was conducted (<italic>step 1</italic>).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> HCPs considered medical information on treatments and side effects as most important to be included in the PDA. Patients also focused on non-medical considerations. Both patients and HCPs expected the PDA to support patients in making a treatment choice. Based on the results of the focus groups, a prototype of the PDA was developed. In <italic>step 2</italic>, the prototype was presented to patients with prostate cancer (n=14) and HCPs (six urologists, four radiation therapists and three oncology nurses) in semistructured interviews. With these interviews, we also gained insight into requirements for implementing the PDA among HCPs.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> According to HCPs incorporation of the PDA into clinical guidelines and using the guidelines as a basis for the PDA would promote implementation. Finally, in <italic>step 3</italic>, the usability of the PDA was tested in a usability study among newly diagnosed patients (n=5) with localised prostate cancer targeting system quality (ease-of-use), content quality (usefulness and relevance) and service quality (the process of care provided).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;27</xref> Usability tests showed that patients managed to &#x02018;navigate through&#x02019; the PDA independently.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>

An example of an adjustment was the addition of a glossary.</p><p>The PDA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4A">figure 4</xref>) includes all options for localised prostate cancer and is composed of the following parts:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A general explanation with information about the content of the PDA. It also explains that patients have multiple (treatment) options and that the choice can be made in consultation with the HCP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4A">figure 4a</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>A section that describes all (treatment) options in short terms. The HCP can mark which (treatment) options are open for patients, if not all options are possible (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4A">figure 4b</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>A component that answers the question: what are my arguments for and against different (treatment) options for my prostate cancer? All four (treatment) options are discussed separately. All the pros and cons are described and divided into three subcomponents: cure, treatment and quality of life (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4A">figure 4c</xref>). All statements are presented in a clear manner from the patient&#x02019;s perspective (&#x02018;As long as I am under active surveillance, I will not have any side effects&#x02019;). The PDA does not include ranking of features of (treatment) options or a (treatment) advice but aids the patient to reach an informed treatment preference.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A glossary of the terminology. Because of the difficulty of some terms, it was decided to include a glossary that defines all difficult terms in alphabetical order. To be comprehensible for patients low on health literacy, the content was adjusted to an intermediate preparatory vocational education level (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4A">figure 4d</xref>).</p></list-item></list>

In each hospital, there will be a period of 4&#x02013;16 months of including newly diagnosed patients who receive usual care, followed by a period of at least 5 months and a maximum of 20 months in which the PDA is provided to newly diagnosed patients. The assignment of hospitals to groups switching at different times to use of the PDA is randomised by PMvdV. The only restriction on the randomisation is that both university hospitals will not be not assigned to the same group.</p><p>Participating centres know in advance when they will implement the PDA but will not receive the PDA before the start of the implementation. HCPs (urologists and oncology nurses) partaking in this study will be trained on how to introduce the PDA to eligible patients by means of a kick-off meeting organised in their hospital shortly before the start of the implementation of the PDA.</p><p>Patients (and their partners) receive a letter from their HCP with information on the study and an invitation to participate. Patients in the intervention condition will also receive the PDA. Depending on the local healthcare pathway for patients with localised prostate cancer, the PDA will be introduced by the HCP at diagnosis or during consultation following diagnosis. Next to the PDA, patients will receive all information (eg, brochures) that would also have been provided otherwise. Patients are offered the web-based version or the booklet version of the PDA (or both), depending on the preference of the patient. In case the patient is interested in participating, the researcher informs the patient on the study in more detail by telephone and invites the patient to participate in the study. In case the patient has a partner, the partner is also invited to participate. When the patient (and partner) agrees to participate (irrespective of the participation of a partner), the researcher sends the baseline questionnaire and an informed consent form (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>).</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure is decisional conflict (DCS) in patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>).

Furthermore, cost-utility will be evaluated. Regarding the partners, their primary outcome measures are treatment preferences and the experienced participation and approach to decision making. Secondary outcome measures for partners include quality of life of partners, and the effect of prostate cancer on the relationship, communication between patient, partner and HCPs, social contacts and
