It is increasingly recognized that T2DM potentiate the risk of cognitive decline, e.g. decline in working memory, verbal memory, executive functioning, information processing speed, attention, and increase the risk for dementia, including Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Also several of the individual key features that define the metabolic syndrome (MetS), e.g. hypertension, impaired glucose regulation, dyslipidemia, obesity [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], predispose for cognitive decline. In fact, accumulating data are in support of cognitive impairment being an early manifestation of the MetS, appearing even prior to impaired glucose tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188173.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The diet is probably the most significant lifestyle factor of importance for the etiology of MetS, making the diet an essential target in a strategy aiming at preventing cardiovascular diseases, and probably also MetS and T2DM associated cognitive decline. With respect to cardiometabolic health, certain foods, e.g. whole grain foods [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], legumes [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], dietary fibre (DF) [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and low glycaemic index (GI) foods [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], have been found to be advantageous. Furthermore, reports are available suggesting that foods and dietary patterns which induce cardiometabolic benefits also may improve cognitive functions [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Fruits and vegetables are rich sources of phytochemicals, e.g. polyphenols and carotenoids, and are good sources of DF. It has been reported that berry consumption has cardio protective effects. For example, a mix of berries (bilberries, lingonberries, blackcurrants, strawberries, chokeberries and raspberries) consumed for 8 weeks (wk) lowered blood pressure and improved blood lipid profile in middle aged subjects displaying cardiovascular risk factors [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Further, 8 wk blueberry supplement decreased markers of oxidative stress in obese men and women with the MetS [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and improved insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in obese subjects with insulin resistance. With respect to cognitive functions, prospective studies indicate that higher intake of berries such as blueberries and strawberries is associated with enhanced cognitive functions in elderly subjects [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, information from intervention studies regarding effects on cardiometabolic risk markers and cognitive function of dietary supplementation with berries is still scarce.</p><p>The present study aimed to investigate effects of a mixture of berries (blueberries, elderberries, strawberries, blackcurrants, lingonberries, and tomatoes) on cognitive functions (working memory, selective attention and psychomotor reaction time) and on cardio-metabolic risk markers in healthy humans. Furthermore, an important part of this study implicated determinations of bioactive components and properties in the test products with respect to contents of polyphenols and antioxidant capacity, and with respect to the content of DF. The cardiometabolic test variables measured were; fasting concentrations of glucose and insulin, blood lipids (free fatty acids (FFA), triacylglycerol, total cholesterol (total-C), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C)), inflammatory markers (interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 18 (IL-18)), markers of oxidative stress (oxidized LDL-C (ox-LDL) and malondialdehyde (MDA)), and blood pressure. Forty healthy subjects between 50&#x02013;70 years old and with BMI &#x02264; 28kg/m<sup>2</sup> were provided the berry mixture daily for 5 wk in form of a beverage. In a randomized crossover study design the effects were compared to the effects of 5 wk intake of a control beverage, matched with respect to carbohydrate, pH, and volume.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethical statement and trial registration</title><p>This study was conducted in compliance with the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki (ethical principles for research involving human subjects). Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. All procedures involving human subjects were approved (September 9, 2011) by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Lund, Sweden (Dnr 2010/457 and 2011/510). The study started in September 2011. The recruitment was finished August 2012, and the study was completed January 2013. The study was registered Mars 15, 2012 at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01562392. The delay in the registration of the study was due to an administrative error due to the human factor. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered.

Of the 40 subjects that were included in the statistical evaluation, twenty subjects started with five wk daily consumption of the berry beverage and consumed the control beverage in a second five wk intervention period (BC group), and 20 subjects started with five wk consumption of the control and had the berry beverage in the last five wk period (CB group). The intervention periods were separated by a five wk washout period. The subjects were instructed to avoid dark and colorful berries and berry products during the interventions, and to avoid alcohol, food rich in DF, and excessive physical exercise the day prior to the experimental days. No antibiotics or probiotics were allowed within two weeks before or during the study period.</p><p>All subjects participated at four experimental days, these were: the day prior to the start of each intervention period (i.e. the day before the start of the control intervention (C<sub>0</sub>) and the day before the start of the berry intervention (B<sub>0</sub>)), and the day after the completion of each intervention period (i.e. the day after 5 wk consumption of berry beverage (B<sub>5wk</sub>) and the day after 5 wk consumption of control beverage (C<sub>5wk</sub>). The experiments were executed at the Food for Health Science Center at Lund University, Sweden. The evening prior to attendance, at 9.00 pm. the test subjects consumed a standardized meal consisting of white wheat bread with optional spread, and had coffee, tea or water to drink. When an experimental day was preceded by an intervention period (test occasion 2 and 4), a last portion (200 ml) of the test- or control product was consumed together with the late evening meal at 9.00 pm. After the evening meal the subjects were fasting until the arrival at the research unit the following morning (07.30 am). After arrival, the test subjects were weighed and seated to rest for a minimum of 10 minutes before registering the blood pressure and withdrawing fasting blood tests for determination of physiological test parameters (see below). Thereafter a standardized breakfast was provided, consisting of 87 g white wheat bread (Hennings storfranska, 600 g, Fazer Bakery inc.), 25 g apricot marmalade (ICA, Sweden), 23 g cheese (Gouda cheese, ICA Basic 400g, ICA, Sweden), 150 ml decaffeinated coffee or tea (individual standardized) without sugar and milk, and 100 ml water. The standardized breakfast provided in total 50 g available carbohydrates. The breakfast was consumed within 15 min. Cognitive tests (see below) were performed repeatedly in the postprandial period at test occasions 2 and 4, i.e. after each intervention period. At test occasions 1 and 3, i.e. at start of the intervention periods, the subjects performed pilot versions of the cognitive tests to reduce learning effects and stress at the cognitive test days. The test subjects were told to maintain a low physical activity during the 3 hours of repeated sampling of test variables.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Test- and control products</title><p>Test product: The test product was consumed in the form of a beverage produced specific for this study (by Orkla Foods Sverige AB, Malm&#x000f6;, Sweden) and based on a mixture of Swedish berries, selected on the basis of being known to be rich in polyphenols or carotenoids. The daily portion berry mixture was based on 150 g blueberry, 50 g elderberry, 50 g lingonberry, 50 g strawberry, 50 g blackcurrant, and an amount of tomato powder (6g) corresponding to approximately 100 g fresh tomatoes. The frozen and then thawed mix of berries was diluted with water, 40%, and pressed through a 2 mm filter. A small amount (1%) sugar was added to the beverage.

The FC assay is one of the oldest methods developed to determine the content of phenols [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

However the tests employed in the present study represent an extension of the methodology, developed by Radeborg et al. [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. WM can be defined as a system responsible for simultaneous temporary short term storing and processing of information, and is involved in many everyday activities; such as mathematical problem solving or reasoning where one often has to remember one part while performing further operations. WM represent a fundamental ability for higher-level cognitive processes. Some authors [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188173.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] even claim that WM and general problem solving ability or intelligence, as measured by e.g. Raven&#x000b4;s Matrices, reflect nearly identical constructs. However, whereas intelligence tests generally only can be administered once due to risk of considerable learning effects, WM can be measured repeatedly. The tests consisted of 12 sets of 3&#x02013;5 short declarative sentences that could be either semantically meaningful of the type &#x02018;the boy brushed his teeth&#x02019;, or nonsensical, such as &#x02018;the rabbit struck the idea&#x02019;. Each test has equal number of sets with 3, 4, and 5 sentences (4 of each). The sentences were read one by one to the subjects, and immediately after each sentence the subject had to indicate if the sentence was semantically meaningful or not. The subjects were blind to the number of sentences in each set. After each set of sentences, the subjects had to repeat, in any order, the first noun in each of the sentences. Six different but comparable WM-tests were included in the study, and three tests were performed at each cognitive test day, executed at 30, 90, and 150 min after commencing the standardized breakfast. The first WM-test at a test day took approximately 10 min to perform, included short information and training session, and the second and third test occasions took approximately 6 min each to perform. One test could at maximum generate 48 credits. The tests consisted of equal number of sentences that were semantically meaningful (24 credits) and nonsensical (24 credits).</p><p><bold>Selective attention (SA) test:</bold> The test was based on spatial perception and primarily measured the ability to sustain a prolonged attention, and to control and split the attention to the entire picture on a computer screen. Like the WM-test, the test also dealt with simultaneous temporary storing and processing of information (WM capacity). The storing time required was however shorter compared with the WM-test, whereas the time pressure was higher. In addition, the test measured psychomotor speed. The SA was measured using a computerized test made up of 96 pictures, each shown for two seconds on the computer screen. The pictures consisted of a square on a white background, divided into four equally sized smaller squares. One of the smaller squares was red, one square was green, and two squares were uncolored (white), resulting in a total of 12 unique picture combinations. The subjects had to remember the positions of the colored squares, and to compare each new picture that emerged on the screen with the preceding one. Each time a new picture emerged, either the green, the red, or none of the colored squares were in the same position compared with the previous picture. Within the two seconds each picture was shown, the subjects were supposed to as fast as possible indicate by pressing one of three different keys on the keyboard, which of the three possible alternatives that occurred for each new picture. The test began with a short training session, and took approximately 8 min to perform. The test was scored with the number of correct responses (CR, total 95 credits) and for the reaction time (RT) needed to give the answer (i.e. press one of the keys). Two SA tests were included at each cognitive experimental day, performed at 60 and 120 min after commencing the standardized breakfast.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Physiological test variables</title><p>Physiological test variables were determined at fasting at all four visits, i.e. prior to and after completing each intervention period.

The chromatograms obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188173.g002">Fig 2</xref>) clearly demonstrated that several phenolic compounds could be separated in less than 30 min. The analysis of the separated compounds, using the information provided by the DAD, allowed the identification of the phenolic compound for family groups. For instance, the selected wavelengths of 280, 350 and 520 nm made possible the identification of phenolic compounds, flavonols and anthocyanins, respectively. Fifteen anthocyanins, 14 flavonols and 14 phenolic compounds (phenolic acids and flavanols among others) were found in the berry beverage. The control beverage did not present phenolic compounds. CAD detector was used to carry out the quantification of the phenolic compounds found in berry beverage.

The effects were compared with the effects of a control beverage matched with respect to monosaccharide content and distribution, pH, and volume. The berry beverage resulted in a modest (~5%) but significant improvement in the WM test in comparison with the control beverage at the test point 30 min. In addition, the berry beverage significantly reduced the concentrations of total-C and LDL-C. No significant effects were detected following 5 wk berry intervention on fasting glucose- or insulin concentrations. On the contrary, the control beverage resulted in significantly increased fasting glucose concentrations from baseline. Further, there was a strong tendency towards an increase (~13%) also in fasting insulin concentrations from baseline after the control beverage, which resulted in a significantly increase in fasting insulin concentrations post the control intervention in comparison to the berry intervention (~19% differences in effects between berry- compared with control intervention). An increased insulin resistant after the control treatment compared with the berry treatment was supported by a significantly increased insulin resistant, as determined with HOMA-IR.</p><p>Berries are commonly known to contain high levels of a range of phenolic compounds, including a variety of anthocyanins, flavonols, flavanols, proanthocyanidins, ellagitannins, and phenolic acids. The choice of berries included in the berry beverage in the present study was based on literature data indicating high amounts of these compounds [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Considerable amounts of polyphenols in the berry beverage was confirmed by the analysis of the test- and control products. Anthocyanins are widely distributed in berries and constitute the strong pigments responsible for the red, blue or purple color of some berries, and additionally act as powerful antioxidants [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Anthocyanins were also one of the phenolic groups found in high concentration in the berry beverage (414.2 mg/l). The concentration of anthocyanins was similar to what previously has been observed in blackcurrant juice (435.6&#x02013;512.7 mg /l) [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], but higher in comparison to what has been found in black grape- or sour cherry juices (92.4&#x02013;105.5 and 235.1&#x02013;274.5 mg/l, respectively) [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Other groups of phenolic compounds found in considerable concentration in the berry beverage were the flavonols (155.9 mg of flavonols/l).</p><p>The antioxidant capacity of the berry beverage as determined by the TEAC method in this study was high (20.3 mmol Trolox/l). For instance, reported TEAC values for other berry beverages such as Cannonau wine, Myrtle liqueur and strawberry-tree honey were lower compared to the currently studied berry mix (9.3, 11.5 and 5.9 mmol Trolox/l, respectively) [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and lower also in orange juice (5.4 mmol Trolox/l) [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Also blueberry, cranberry, goji, a&#x000e7;ai and pomegranate juices presented lower values of TEAC compared to the berry beverage in this study, being 15.1, 11.5, 7.7, 9.3 and 4.1 mmol Trolox/l, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Furthermore, the FC values of the berry wines were in the same range as for the presently described berry beverage (805.7 mg GAE/l), being for blackcurrant wine from 520 to 1820 mg GAE/l, blackcurrant and strawberry wine from 655 to 950 mg GAE/l, black and red currant wine from 515 to 1270 mg GAE/l, and black and red currant and strawberry wine from 720 mg GAE/l [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Metabolic effects of berries, berry extracts, polyphenols and carotenoids, have mostly been evaluated in animal models, e.g. rat and/or mice models. In such studies, the berries included in the presently described study have individually shown benefits on several of the risk markers determined in the present study, e.g. blood pressure, lipid profile, inflammation, and oxidative stress (see e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]). The beneficial effects were to a major part attributed to the polyphenols present. In humans, CVD [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and T2DM [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] protective effects of berries are supported by prospective studies. Less information is available concerning cardiometabolic effects in controlled berry interventions in humans, especially in healthy people, and results from available studies show conflicting results. However, accumulating evidence indicate improvements of risk factors for T2DM and CVD. For example, a meta-analysis [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] including 22 RCTs (intervention periods between 2&#x02013;24 wk) investigating effects of different berries (including also the berries studied in the present study) in both healthy and subjects with CVD, showed that berries have the potential to improve cholesterol profile, blood pressure, fasting glucose, BMI, HbA1c, and inflammatory markers. Furthermore, in an acute study setting a strawberry load reduced postprandial insulin concentrations in overweight adults [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and in normal- or overweight healthy subjects, a load of blackcurrant and lingonberries [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], or a pur&#x000e9;e with a mixture of berries (bilberries, blackcurrants, cranberries, and strawberries), lowered the postprandial blood glucose response to a sucrose challenge [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In the case of tomatoes, except for containing polyphenols, tomatoes contain considerable amounts of carotenoids, especially in the form of lycopene, a bioactive compound with a potent antioxidant capacity. Several studies are in support of lycopene in prevention of CVD, and e.g. reduce levels of ox-LDL, total-C, and blood pressure (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]).</p><p>Fasting glucose- and insulin concentrations are less prone to be affected by diet interventions, especially in healthy subjects, and previous studies have shown inconsistent results. Thus, a meta-analysis of 12 RCT (7 interventions in subjects with normal fasting values and 5 in hyperglycaemic subjects) did not show effects of fruit- or berry juices on glucose- and insulin concentrations at fasting in the total group or divided in subgroups of normo- or hyperglycaemic subjects. Neither were there any effects on fasting glucose- or insulin concentrations in subgroups of type of juice (berries, grapes, pomegranate, and orange) [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The lack of significant effects is in accordance with the results of the berry beverage on fasting glucose- and insulin concentrations obtained in the presently describe study. However components in the berry beverage matrix seem to have the potential to inhibit an adverse effect of a daily intake of the monosaccharides included in the berry beverage. The daily portions of berry beverage were based on 350 g frozen berries of which blueberry was included in highest amounts (150 g blueberry, 50 g elderberry, 50 g lingonberry, 50 g strawberry, 50 g black currant, and tomatoes (tomato powder, corresponding to 100 g fresh tomatoes)). The control beverage was mainly composed of water and monosaccharides (glucose and fructose). Even though berries in general are considered to be of benefits to health, this amount of berries on a daily basis for 5 wk probably adds to the habitual intake of low molecular weight carbohydrates. The berry- and the control beverages contained equal amounts and type of available carbohydrates (approximately 13g glucose and 20g fructose each day). It can be suggested that the daily amount of monosaccharides in the control beverage may have had an adverse effect on insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation, and, since no such negative effects were observed of the berry beverage, it can be put forward that the berries had the potential to blunt an adverse effects of the daily monosaccharide intake. Further; it can be speculated that the presence of polyphenols (potential effects summarized in ref [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]) in the berry mixture might have been involved in the control of glucose homeostasis, thus counteract negative effects. In this context it should be noted that in addition to polyphenols, berries are a source of other bioactive compounds with potential cardiometabolic benefits. For example, berries are rich in DF, both soluble and insoluble, and accumulating evidence from both epidemiological studies [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and clinical interventions [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188173.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] are at hand proposing beneficial effects of DF on cardiometabolic risk, e.g. with respect to glucose homeostasis. The beneficial effects of DF are to largely suggested to emanate from events related to colonic fermentation [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188173.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The daily portion of DF from the berry beverage in the current study was approximately 11g.</p><p>In respect to cognitive functions, prospective studies indicate that higher intake of blueberries, strawberries [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and carotenoids (lycopene) [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] is associated with slower rates of cognitive decline in elderly subjects. Beneficial cognitive effects of berries are also supported from intervention studies. Consequently, 12 wk intervention with concord grape juice [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] or blueberry juice [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] demonstrated enhanced cognitive functions (wordlist recall respective wordlist recall and paired associate learning) in elderly subjects with mild cognitive impairment. Lycopene showed to improve cognitive functions in rat models of insulin resistance, in parallel with improvement of insulin signaling deficits, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Insulin and insulin receptors within the brain are important for learning and memory. Insulin resistance may occur also in the brain and results in reduced central insulin signaling, altering a variety of insulin mediated events of importance for memory functions [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It can be speculated that the improved performance in the WM test after the berry beverage compared to the control beverage, at least partly, may be a consequence of a superior insulin sensitivity and/or insulin receptor signaling in the brain.</p><p>After ingestion, polyphenols are present in the circulation mainly as polyphenol metabolites. In human blood brain barrier models [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], both anthocyanins and flavonols, and their metabolites, have been shown to cross the blood brain barrier and can be found in various brain regions important for learning and memory. The mechanisms behind beneficial effects of polyphenols and/or lycopene on cognitive functions and on cardiometabolic risk are not fully elucidated. Further, in the light of the molecular diversity of dietary polyphenols and their metabolites, the possible cellular signaling pathways and mechanisms of action are probably multiple. In addition, substantial parts of the ingested polyphenols are not absorbed into the circulation but instead, like DF, pass to the colon. In the colon, polyphenols are metabolized to other compounds, such as phenolic acids, and the metabolites may be absorbed into the circulation, and may enter the brain. Further, polyphenols and/or their metabolites have been shown to interfere with the gut microbiota composition and metabolism, and may modulate release of bacterial metabolites, such as short chain fatty acids (SCFA) [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Consequently, polyphenols entering the gut can be suggested to promote benefits on metabolism and brain functions through promoting a more favorable gut flora and/or release of bacterial metabolites, e.g. SCFA. It has been demonstrated that SCFA in the gut stimulate the release of gut hormones, e.g. GLP-1 [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], an incretin and a neuropeptide with neuroprotective effects, and with beneficial effects on cognitive functions, e.g. learning and memory [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], suggesting possible additional mechanisms regarding cognitive benefits related to colonic fermentation events.</p><p>Thus, it can be expected that there are several underlying mechanisms whereby berries potentially may elicit metabolic- and cognitive health effects. However, with respect to polyphenols and lycopene, several effects of importance are proposed to derive from the well-described anti-inflammatory [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and/or anti-oxidative [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] properties. Low-grade chronic inflammation and oxidative stress has been advocated as important factors behind lifestyle related disorders and diseases, such as obesity, the metabolic syndrome, T2DM, and CVD [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188173.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]; risk factors which increasingly are associated with neurodegenerative disorders and cognitive decline [<xref rid="pone.0188173.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The brain is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress and inflammation. The susceptibility to oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation further increases with age. With age, there is a decrease in the endogenous antioxidant defense, and at the same time there is an increase in inflammatory mediators. However, despite considerable amounts of polyphenols on a daily basis during 5 wk, markers of inflammation or oxidative stress following the berry beverage in this study did not decrease significantly as judged from analysis of IL-6 (-5.8%) and IL-18 (-3.6%), respective ox-LDL (-1.2%) and MDA (+1.5%).</p><p>This study involves some potential study limitations. An evident constraint is the unbalanced gender participation, since 75% of the volunteers were women. Another potential limitation is that the subjects ingested the intervention products at home, not allowing control of compliance. In addition it was not possible to blind the products to the test subjects due to the obvious differences. In this respect it must be noted that it is a common limitation when &#x0201c;real&#x0201d; foods are included in interventions; it is often a challenger (or impossible) to blind the products to the subjects. It is difficult to include &#x0201c;inert&#x0201d; control products without possibly metabolic benefits. Carotenoids were not analyzed in the present study, which can be considered to be an additional potential study limitation. Moreover, the test product included a mix of berries which rule out possibilities to make any conclusions regarding individual berries.</p><p><italic>In conclusion</italic>, 5 wk consumption of a mix of blueberries, strawberries, blackcurrant, elderberries, lingonberries, and tomatoes reduced total-C and LDL-C and prevented an adverse effect of monosaccharides on glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance, in parallel to eliciting an enhanced effect on working memory capacity. The results thus support previous observations regarding health benefits of berries, and propose a preventive potential with respect to the MetS related diseases. The results are also in support of data indicating that diets with benefits on cardiometabolic risk markers in parallel are beneficial to cognitive functions. The beneficial effects of berries are probably related to the bioactive compounds included, such as polyphenols/carotenoids and/or DF. Further studies are needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188173.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>The supporting CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0188173.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188173.s002"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Study protocol (ethical application, the original Swedish version).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0188173.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188173.s003"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>Study protocol (ethical application, google transalated from Swedish to English).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0188173.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188173.s004"><label>S3 Text</label><caption><title>Study protocol to experts in the ethical committee (both in Swedish and google translated into English).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0188173.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge biomedical scientist Lisbeth Persson at Food for Health Science Centre, Lund University, Sweden, for skillful technical assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0188173.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>. <article-title>An Update on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus as a Risk Factor for Dementia</article-title>. <source>J Alzheimers Dis</source>. <year>2016</year>;<volume>53</volume>(<issue>2</issue>):<fpage>393</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>402</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-160114">10.3233/JAD-160114</ext-link></comment>
