Dementia is the greatest cause of disability and associated with significant decline in quality of life. Dementia was recently highlighted as a major societal issue due to the absence of effective disease-modifying medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Strategies for prevention in people at high risk are therefore important in reducing the current and future burden of dementia on the individual and the health-care system.</p><p id="Par7">Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is regarded as one of the most important modifiable risk factors for dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. T2D is associated with a nearly two-fold increase in the risk of incident dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and with accelerated rates of cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The predominate cognitive domains affected include executive function and processing speed, and to a lesser degree verbal and visual memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The pathways leading to cognitive decline in T2D appear to be mixed with both neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and cerebrovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] playing roles. Given the presence of multiple risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms (dysglycaemia, insulin resistance, obesity, hypertension, physical inactivity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] contributing to T2D related dementia, therapeutic approaches that can address multiple risk factors simultaneously are likely to provide the greatest benefits.</p><p id="Par8">Structured exercise training for at least 3 to 6&#x000a0;months has been demonstrated to improve glycaemic, metabolic, inflammatory and vascular profiles in people with T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Exercise for animals has also been shown to improve angiogenesis, synaptogenesis and neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although there is persuasive evidence from observational studies regarding the benefits of exercise for cognitive health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], results from human randomised controlled trials (RCT) have been inconsistent in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis of studies of exercise intervention trials in older adults suggests benefits for cognition, for both aerobic and resistance training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, a Cochrane review and a recent RCT found no benefit for exercise in cognitively healthy older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Those with T2D represent a distinct high-risk group who have a cluster of biological risk factors for cognitive decline. They may therefore respond favourably to risk factor optimization via a multi-modal exercise program, but the relevant data are limited. A small study of people with pre-diabetes or recently diagnosed diabetes (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;28) found that 6&#x000a0;months of aerobic training improved executive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In an exploratory post-hoc analysis from the Lifestyle interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) RCT (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;415), a 24&#x000a0;month exercise intervention resulted in better scores in global cognitive function and delayed recall only in people with T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. To date, there has been no adequately powered trial that has demonstrated the efficacy of exercise on cognitive function and other measures of brain health in people with T2D.</p><p id="Par9">Prior to embarking on such a large scale trial, we conducted a pilot RCT in people with T2D to: 1) determine the feasibility (design, recruitment, screening, randomisation, adherence, safety and retention) of a 6-month multi-modal exercise training program compared with control to preserve or improve cognition and brain structure, and 2) provide an estimate of the effects of the intervention on outcomes and MRI brain structure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par10">Cognition and Diabetes in Older Tasmanians &#x02013; A pilot RCT of exercise (CDOT-X) was a 6-month single blind parallel RCT incorporating a supervised and progressive multi-modal exercise program with blinded outcome assessments. Participants with previously diagnosed T2D were randomised to either: 1) a multi-modal aerobic and resistance training (ART) program, or 2) a stretching/gentle movement control group. Participants were randomised by a central automated allocation procedure (parallel groups stratified within two age strata of 50&#x02013;64 and 65&#x02013;75&#x000a0;years) after baseline assessment, based on computer-generated random numbers ensuring allocation concealment. Assessment staff were blinded to randomisation group. Participants were informed that the study was designed to examine the difference between two different types of exercise, but were unaware of the nature of the alternative exercise program. All assessments and exercise classes (the two study groups trained at separate times) occurred at the Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania. Brain MRI scans were performed at the Royal Hobart Hospital, Tasmania, Australia. The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN: 12,614,000,222,640 and was performed according to the CONSORT 2010 extension to randomised pilot and feasibility trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

Eligibility was initially determined by a telephone screening interview (for the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below). This was followed on a separate day by a medical assessment (including medical history, medication use and an ECG) by a doctor and an exercise stress test at the Menzies Institute for Medical Research. During the test VO2max was collected using the Bruce protocol and an exercise ECG and echocardiogram were performed. If the doctor had any concerns about the participants results they were referred for a cardiology review.

It was implemented by accredited exercise physiologists (AEP) or physiotherapists, who supervised small groups (6&#x02013;8 people) undertaking two one-hours supervised sessions per week on non-consecutive days, supplemented by a further one-hour per week unsupervised session at the participant&#x02019;s home or in the community with prescribed aerobic exercise. Intensity of training relied on the Borg Scale rating of perceived exertion (RPE; range 6 to 20) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Each supervised session consisted of approximately 30&#x000a0;min of moderate- to high-intensity PRT (3 sets of 8&#x02013;12 reps at 14&#x02013;17 &#x02018;hard to very hard&#x02019; on the 20 point RPE scale) of the upper and lower extremity exercises using body weight, machine or free weights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par34">The present pilot study has demonstrated feasibility (in study design, recruitment, screening, randomisation, adherence, safety reporting and retention, and effect size estimates) for a subsequent definitive RCT to test whether a multi-modal exercise program incorporating aerobic plus resistance training can provide benefits to cognition and brain structure in people with T2D. Recruitment procedures resulted in 114 people fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria volunteering over 8&#x000a0;months (approximately 14 participants per month). A telephone screening procedure was successful in determining eligibility and availability including identifying those who were too busy, lived too far away or who were unable to participate for other health reasons. The face-to-face medical assessment and exercise stress test were useful in excluding a further seven people due to high cardiovascular risk. The rate of recruitment was also perceived by trainers as optimal in order to allocate sufficient time for orientating new participants to exercises. Taking into account the relatively small sample size, baseline characteristics appeared balanced between groups except for sex and prior myocardial infarction. It is likely that a larger sample size would further improve the comparability of the intervention and control groups.</p><p id="Par35">The intervention group combined aerobic and resistance training, which is based on superior outcomes previously observed with cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and T2D markers such as blood glucose control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], as well as potentially benefiting brain health through different signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The control group carried out stretches and gentle movements designed to provide the same amount of socialization as the intervention group. The adherence for the two centre-based sessions was similar (79% in the intervention and 75% for the control group), which suggests that participants accepted the outcome of randomisation. The retention rate (94%) was comparable or better than prior studies described in a meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] with only three people not returning for follow-up. We established the need for small exercise groups to ensure the program was tailored according to each individual, with close supervision by a trainer to enhance motivation, ensure correct exercise technique and appropriate blood glucose monitoring. Six serious adverse events (all in different participants) were deemed not or unlikely due to the intervention. Of other adverse events, there was one fall without injury that occurred in the control group. Five participants also reported musculoskeletal pain in the intervention group and one in the control group, all of which were pre-existing or resolved with expectant management. It is difficult to compare these figures to other trials as a prior report of adverse events in 121 exercise RCT found that in general, adverse events are poorly reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In order of prevalence, musculoskeletal complaints, falls and cardiovascular events were most common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Older people and those with T2D are more likely to have conditions such as arthritis and cardiovascular disease. In light of this, we took precautions by performing a medical screen and exercise stress test before randomisation, providing participants with a booklet of the training program and exercise precautions, as well as having a 4&#x000a0;week light intensity preparatory training phase at the start of the program, and one easier week in every 4&#x000a0;week cycle. However, a further individualized initial orientation and assessment at the beginning of the program with the trainer may also be worthwhile.</p><p id="Par36">As this was a pilot study, no a priori power estimations were performed, and no tests of efficacy or statistical significance are provided for the between group differences or change over time in brain or cognitive measures as false positives and false negatives are likely. However, 95% confidence interval were provided to give information about the magnitude and direction of an effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Nevertheless, our between-group difference for the change over time in the global cognitive score was similar to the change (mean decrease 0.18 SD) observed over 5-years in a previous observational study in people with T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These data suggest that a global composite score can be a sensitive primary outcome measure in a larger definitive exercise trial, avoiding issues related to multiple primary outcome measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Of the individual cognitive scores, all but the Rey Complex Figure delay, Digit span, Hopkins Delay and the COWAT Categories tests favored the intervention group. We included structural brain and cognitive measures that have previously been shown to be sensitive to T2D related cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Few prior RCT have included brain MRI as well as measurements to study underlying pathways influenced by exercise. In the few brain imaging studies of people without T2D, as little as 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;months of exercise has been shown to lead to measurable increases volume of the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Our pilot data are broadly consistent with these findings and suggest that total, white matter and hippocampal volume, as well as white matter integrity might benefit from an ART program. This needs to be confirmed in a larger trial.</p><p id="Par37">Although we foresee no major changes to the protocol in a larger study, there are a number of considerations in the design and conduct of future such trials. Firstly, 12 participants did not complete the VO<sub>2max</sub> test at follow-up. Although we did not record the reason for this, wearing a mask for this test and exercising to maximum levels may have caused discomfort to some participants. Sub-maximal tests that reliably estimate VO<sub>2max</sub> may be easier to complete in future trials. Secondly, although there was no indication that assessment staff were aware of group allocation, we did not formally evaluate blinding such as by asking blinded study staff which group that thought participants were in. Thirdly, exercise trainers indicated that heart rate monitoring would assist in assessing intensity of aerobic exercise training over and above the RPE scale. Fourthly, the treatment period was relatively short. The optimum length of the intervention that is required to prevent long-term cognitive decline is unknown. Prior studies have reported benefits of both kinds of exercise (aerobic and resistance) on blood pressure, glycaemic control, insulin sensitivity, and fat mass within 3&#x02013;6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A meta-analysis of exercise for cognitive function in older adults found the largest benefits with 3&#x02013;12&#x000a0;months following aerobic plus resistance training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, many of the benefits of exercise may disappear after a program is stopped. Encouragingly, one study reported that a 24-week walking program was efficacious in improving cognition in older people with MCI one-year post intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This suggests that a short-term (6-months) program may boost cognitive reserve over the longer term. A larger definitive study based on this pilot is planned to incorporate and evaluate a 12-month phase designed to assist participants incorporate the program into real world home or community exercise programs. Finally it is possible that some medications such as insulin therapy and the number of adverse events may influence results. These should be considered in the statistical plan and power calculations of a future study.</p><p id="Par38">In addition to the above considerations there are other limitations to the design of our study. The large number of cognitive tests may have led to fatigue and a decline in performance. However the order of tests was similar for all participants. The lack of follow-up over longer periods means that we were unable to determine longer term dropout rates, effects on cognition or conversion to dementia. It is possible that some participants in the control group may have started to exercise, but it is unlikely that they took up training at the intensity performed by the intervention group. They also attended the control classes twice a week which would have left less time to take up another new exercise program. It is possible that the control class may also have provided cognitive benefits, reducing the differences between groups. Although the combination of aerobic and resistance training may provide additional benefit, a four armed study (aerobic, resistance, aerobic and resistance, control) would be required to tease out their individual effects. Finally, some participants were from the longitudinal CDOT study which may limit generalizability. However, these people are well characterized and were also recruited from the Australian National Diabetes Service Scheme.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par39">In conclusion, the present pilot study demonstrates strong feasibility in terms of design, recruitment, screening, adherence, safety and retention to a multi-modal exercise program. A larger definitive trial to determine if exercise can delay or prevent cognitive decline in this high-risk group is now required. A delay in just 1&#x000a0;year of the onset of dementia may result in 9.2 million fewer cases globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par40">Alzheimers Australia Research Foundation Grant No. CF13/3559.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par41">The datasets used and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>1.
