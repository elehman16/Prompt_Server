In cases of CKD, reduction in the excretory function of the kidney can lead to an increase in plasma phosphate concentrations unless oral intake of phosphate is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Elevated plasma phosphate concentrations correlate with a poor prognosis in cats with CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and therefore treatment guidelines for CKD in cats recommend monitoring of plasma phosphate concentrations and, where appropriate, restriction of oral phosphate intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Restriction of oral intake of phosphate in cats is achieved most commonly via the feeding of diets containing low amounts of phosphorus (hereafter referred to as &#x0201c;renal diet&#x0201d;). Benefits of renal diets in cats have been reported in experimental models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], prospective field studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and a retrospective field study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However renal diets may not be effective alone in maintaining plasma phosphate concentrations in the recommended target ranges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and many renal diets have relatively low palatability in cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Phosphate binders, which reduce the oral absorption of dietary phosphate, are therefore useful agents in the management of hyperphosphataemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>A number of phosphate binders are used in cats including Ipakitine&#x000ae; (calcium carbonate), Lantharenol&#x000ae; or Renalzin&#x000ae; (lanthanum carbonate octahydrate) and various products registered for use in humans containing aluminium or calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, none of the available phosphate binders are ideal for use in cats due to low palatability and/or safety issues related to the oral absorption of aluminium, calcium or lanthanum.</p><p>Lenziaren&#x000ae; (SBR759) is a new oral phosphate binder which consists of an insoluble complex of iron (III) oxide/hydroxide with starch and sucrose. Lenziaren&#x000ae; does not contain aluminium, calcium or lanthanum, and therefore may have safety advantages over phosphate binders containing those cations. The efficacy of SBR759 in reducing serum phosphate concentrations has been demonstrated in humans undergoing haemodialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In healthy cats fed with a renal diet, Lenziaren&#x000ae; was effective in reducing plasma and urine phosphate concentrations over the dose range 0.25-1.0&#x000a0;g/cat per day and had good acceptability and tolerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The efficacy and tolerability of Lenziaren&#x000ae; in cats with CKD and hyperphosphataemia and safety in healthy cats have been reported as abstracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Since not all cats will eat sufficient quantities of renal diets, it is important to determine the efficacy of phosphate binders in cats fed with a &#x0201c;standard&#x0201d; diet. Higher doses of phosphate binders are anticipated to be needed with standard diets due to their higher content of phosphorus compared to renal diets.</p><p>The objective of this study was therefore to evaluate the efficacy, dose-effect relation, acceptability and tolerability of Lenziaren&#x000ae; in healthy cats fed a commercial standard diet containing 0.2% phosphorus. The study was a prospective, randomized, masked, parallel-group comparison of six groups. Five groups received four different dosages of Lenziaren&#x000ae; or no treatment (control) plus standard diet. The sixth group was fed with a prescription renal diet containing 0.12% phosphorus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study animals and approvals</title><p>A total of 36 healthy domestic cross-bred cats (18 female and 18 male) were used. Since one group of cats was fed a renal diet with restricted phosphate for a total of up to 9&#x000a0;weeks, and phosphate is necessary for growth of young animals, the minimum age at study start was 12&#x000a0;months. Each cat was identified via a unique subcutaneous transponder.</p><p>The study was conducted at Clinvet International Ltd (Bloemfontein, Republic of South Africa) in compliance with the OECD principles of Good Laboratory Practice, and after approval from the Clinvet Animal Ethics Committee and Novartis Animal Heath Animal Welfare Committee. The study was conducted with reference to the following additional guidelines: VICH guideline GL 43 on target animal safety for pharmaceuticals (EMEA/CVMP/VICH/393388/2006) and The South African National Standard SANS 10386:2008 &#x0201c;The care and use of animals for scientific purposes.&#x0201d; There were no suitable non-animal models and therefore <italic>in vivo</italic> studies were required to quantify the effect of Lenziaren&#x000ae; on phosphate balance in cats. The study did not induce pain or distress in the cats, which were purpose-bred for laboratory studies. Since faeces and urine had to be collected individually from each animal, the cats were housed for the duration of the 9&#x000a0;week study individually in stainless steel cages in an indoor animal unit. Each cage was fitted with a rest bench and scratch block, and cats were interacted with socially at least once per day. The temperature was 20 (&#x000b1;4) &#x000b0;C with a 12:12&#x000a0;hour light:dark cycle.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study schedule</title><p>The study schedule is shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

Lenziaren&#x000ae; is a powder and was sprinkled onto the food which was stirred gently for at least 30&#x000a0;seconds to allow the powder to stick to food in a homogeneous manner.</p><p>No placebo was used in this study. Since the iron content of Lenziaren&#x000ae; adds colour and is responsible for its efficacy, no suitable placebo was available. Since diets in groups A-E were different versus group F, assessments of the important endpoints of the study were kept masked by use of different personnel. Persons not otherwise involved in the study prepared the diet and test items in sachets and assigned codes (A-F) to the study groups, and were not blinded. The people who administered the test items to the cats, and assessed the feed consumption and acceptability of the test items, could only identify the groups by their codes. The investigators responsible for clinical examinations were fully blinded since they had no access to the study codes and were kept out of sight of the food. At no stage in the study was it necessary to reveal the blinding code to blinded personnel. The blinding code was revealed only after the data base had been locked.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Diets</title><p>The cats were fed one of two wet diets.

The time during which the food was consumed was recorded, to the nearest one hour, hourly for the first six hours, and then at approximately 23&#x000a0;hours. If there was still food remaining at 23&#x000a0;hours, the time during which the food was consumed was assumed to be 24&#x000a0;hours.</p><p>Blood specimens were collected under sedation (xylazine and atipamezole) on days &#x02212;30, &#x02212;14, 7, 14, 21 and 28 without coagulant for serum chemistry and into EDTA for haematology. Food was removed approximately 8&#x02013;10 hours prior to blood collection and weighing. Serum chemistry variables included alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total calcium, creatinine, iron, phosphorus (serum inorganic phosphate) and urea. Haematology variables included red cell count, haematocrit, haemoglobin, total and differential white cell count, platelet count, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time.</p><p>Specimens of faeces and urine were collected separately on days &#x02212;14 to &#x02212;12, 6 to 9, 13 to 16, 20 to 23, and 27 to 30. For each collection session, litter trays containing Katkor&#x000ae; (Rein Vet Products, The Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]) were placed in the cages during the afternoon and removed in the morning 3 to 4&#x000a0;days later. This ensured the collection of urine (and faeces) during at least 72&#x000a0;hours.</p><p>Faeces were collected at least twice a day during each 72&#x000a0;hour collection session. Pieces of Katkor&#x000ae; that had adhered to faeces were removed. Faeces were then pooled, frozen and weighed before being freeze dried and milled to create a fine powder to ensure homogeneity. The faecal samples were then analyzed in one run for phosphorus content using method KJ4 (Association of Official Analytical Chemists Inc, 1984, Official Methods of Analysis, 14th Ed).</p><p>Urine specimens (&#x02265; 500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L) were collected at least twice a day from the trays containing Katkor&#x000ae;. Alternative methods (e.g. catheter, cystocentesis or manual expulsion) were not needed. Because urine concentration in cats is not constant, a 72&#x000a0;hour pooled specimen was collected at each collection session. Urine from each 72&#x000a0;hour collection session in each cat was pooled in two separate containers, weighed and refrigerated. One container contained 6&#x000a0;N hydrochloric acid to create a pH of &#x02264; 3-3.5 in order to stabilize the phosphorus and the other container contained no additives. The variables measured were creatinine, phosphate and specific gravity.</p><p>Faecal phosphorus excretion was calculated by multiplying the weight of the faeces by the concentration of phosphorus in the faeces.</p><p>Urinary phosphate excretion was calculated by multiplying the urine volume (mL) by the concentration of phosphate in the urine. In all samples the urine was weighed (g) and the volume calculated from the measured urine specific gravity. The concentration of phosphate in urine was reported as mmol/L, and was transformed to concentration of phosphorus (g/L) by multiplying by a factor of 0.03097.</p><p>The total phosphorus excretion was calculated by adding the urinary phosphorus values to the faecal phosphorus values.</p><p>The phosphorus balance was calculated by:<disp-formula id="Equb"><alternatives><tex-math id="M3">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The cats were aged 12&#x02013;84 months at study day &#x02212;30, and weighed 2.42-3.61&#x000a0;kg (females) and 3.03-4.98&#x000a0;kg (males). With the exception of some minor clinical signs which were judged to be unrelated to the test item, e.g. conjunctivitis, loose faeces or otitis externa, all cats remained in good health throughout the study. No adverse events judged related to Lenziaren&#x000ae; were observed. As defined in the protocol, darkening of the faeces is an expected effect of Lenziaren&#x000ae; due its iron content and has no adverse consequences, and therefore was not reported as an adverse event.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Test item</title><p>The dose of Lenziaren&#x000ae; consumed was estimated from the percentage amount of food consumed, which for days 1&#x02013;28 was 94.5% for the control group E, 99.0%, 94.2%, 98.2% and 90.6% respectively for Lenziaren&#x000ae; groups A-D, and 96.8% for the renal diet group (F). The estimated daily doses of Lenziaren&#x000ae; were therefore respectively 0.244, 0.465, 0.986 and 1.83&#x000a0;g/day versus the nominal doses of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0&#x000a0;g/day.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Efficacy endpoints</title><p>Summary results for the efficacy endpoints are shown in Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>.

In the primary statistical analysis, the effects tested were treatment, day and treatment x day interaction, with or without baseline as covariate. It was planned in the protocol to include baseline as a covariate for all variables in the analyses. However, group F (fed with renal diet) lost body weight during the study, including during the day &#x02212;30 to day &#x02212;1 acclimatization period.

This objective was fulfilled by the comparison of four dosages of Lenziaren&#x000ae; (0.25-2.0&#x000a0;g/day) to the control group. The results demonstrate that Lenziaren&#x000ae; effectively bound phosphate present in the diet, as evidenced by the significantly lower urine phosphate concentrations, urine phosphorus excretion and fractional urinary phosphate excretion. These effects occurred in spite of higher food consumption and therefore higher phosphorus intake with Lenziaren&#x000ae; compared to the control group. The efficacy of Lenziaren&#x000ae; was dose-dependent over the tested dosage range of 0.25&#x02013;2.0&#x000a0;g/day, with significant effects versus the control at 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0&#x000a0;g/day on fractional urinary phosphate excretion, 1.0 and 2.0&#x000a0;g/day on urine phosphate concentration and 2.0&#x000a0;g/day on urine phosphorus excretion. The results indicate that a higher dose of Lenziaren&#x000ae;, approximately two times higher, was required to reduce urine phosphate concentrations by an equivalent amount when administered with standard diet in this study compared to a renal diet in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This is an expected result due to the higher content of phosphorus in the standard diet (0.2%) compared to the renal diet (0.12%) tested. Therefore we can recommend that Lenziaren&#x000ae; be administered at a starting dose of 0.25&#x000a0;g/day, with an increase up to 1.0&#x000a0;g/day as needed, in cats fed with a renal diet. However a starting dose of 0.5&#x000a0;g/day with increase up to 1.0&#x000a0;g/day as needed may be a better recommendation in cats fed with a standard diet. These predictions require testing in field studies with cats with clinical hyperphosphataemia.</p><p>The results, showing that Lenziaren&#x000ae; is an effective oral phosphate binder over the dose range 0.5&#x02013;2.0&#x000a0;g/day, are consistent with results from previous studies. In healthy cats fed with a renal diet, Lenziaren&#x000ae; significantly reduced serum and urine phosphate concentrations over the dose range 0.25-1.0&#x000a0;g/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In cats with hyperphosphataemia and CKD, Lenziaren&#x000ae; reduced serum phosphate concentrations over the dose range 0.25-1.0&#x000a0;g/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The efficacy of SBR759 in human patients with hyperphosphataemia undergoing dialysis has also been reported over the dose range 3.75-22.5&#x000a0;g/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The tolerability of Lenziaren&#x000ae; in this study was good, as assessed from the lack of reported adverse effects attributed to the test item. Lenziaren&#x000ae; had no detected negative impact on acceptability or intake of the food (standard diet), and in fact food consumption and bodyweight gain were higher with Lenziaren&#x000ae; compared to the control and renal diet groups.</p><p>Significantly higher serum creatinine, iron and phosphate concentrations and significantly lower ALP and ALT activities were observed with higher doses of Lenziaren&#x000ae;. An oral phosphate binder would be expected to decrease serum phosphate concentrations, however homeostatic mechanisms in healthy cats could have maintained serum concentrations during the relatively short duration (30&#x000a0;days) of administration of Lenaziaren&#x000ae;. It is not clear why the serum phosphate concentrations showed a positive trend with dose in this study. It is a fact that the Lenziaren&#x000ae; treated cats consumed higher quantities of phosphate as a result of higher food consumption, but the urine phosphate results suggest that absorption of phosphate was effectively decreased by Lenziaren&#x000ae;. Significant reductions in serum phosphate concentrations by Lenziaren&#x000ae;, as one would expect for a phosphate binder, were reported in previous studies in healthy cats fed a renal diet for 28&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and in cats with CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The higher serum creatinine concentrations in this study might be related to the maintenance of body weight with Lenziaren&#x000ae; compared to the control group, but we have no explanation for the dose-related lower ALP and ALT activities with Lenziaren&#x000ae;. Similar effects of Lenziaren&#x000ae; on ALP, ALT and creatinine were not observed in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Although mean serum iron concentrations in the Lenziaren&#x000ae; groups (range 16.0-22.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L) remained within the reference range of cats at the study site, concentrations were significantly higher in the Lenziaren&#x000ae; groups compared to the control group, and increased in a dose-dependent manner. This result is logical since Lenziaren&#x000ae; is a complex of iron with starch and sucrose, designed to increase the binding potency to phosphate and to limit systemic absorption of iron. Nevertheless small amounts of iron can be absorbed. There were slight increases from baseline in mean iron concentrations (+2.0 to +5.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L) in the cats receiving Lenziaren&#x000ae;, whereas both the control (&#x02212;1.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L) and renal diet (&#x02212;3.8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L) groups showed decreases in iron concentrations. One explanation for these findings is that the blood sampling schedule, although it represented only a total of 63&#x02013;72&#x000a0;mL of blood over a 9&#x000a0;week period, may have led to decreases in iron concentrations in the control and renal diet groups and this effect was prevented by the administration of Lenziaren&#x000ae;. Dose-related increases in plasma iron concentrations were observed also in cats with hyperphosphataemia and CKD dosed with 0.125-1.5&#x000a0;g/day Lenziaren&#x000ae; and fed with renal or standard diet [17 and Novartis data on file]. The magnitude of change from baseline in iron concentrations was similar in the CKD cats (+3.7&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L) as in this study (+2.0 to +5.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L). Therefore the release of iron from the Lenziaren&#x000ae; complex and absorption from the gastrointestinal tract was approximately similar in cats with CKD and in healthy animals. In contrast, absorption of iron from the iron-based phosphate binder PA21 was higher in healthy human subjects compared to patients undergoing dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. That result was attributed to the effect that oral absorption of iron is reduced by the presence of uraemia (in humans). No changes in plasma iron concentrations were observed in humans with hyperphosphataemia undergoing dialysis receiving SBR759 at 3.75-22.5&#x000a0;g/day with treatment for 4&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] or at a mean dose of 6.2&#x000a0;g/day for 12&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Higher plasma iron concentrations might be relevant clinically in cats with CKD. Although excessively high plasma iron concentrations are associated with toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], moderately increased iron concentrations are unlikely to be detrimental since anaemia occurs commonly in cats with CKD and is a risk factor for mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Field studies are required to examine further this topic. No adverse effects of absorption of iron with Lenziaren&#x000ae; were detected in this or previous studies in cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>A secondary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of a renal diet with the other groups (standard diet with and without Lenziaren&#x000ae;). As compared to the control group (standard diet without Lenziaren&#x000ae;), the renal diet was associated with significant loss of body weight (0.42&#x000a0;kg, 12.4%) during the 60&#x000a0;day study. The feed consumption was 7.3% lower with the renal diet compared to the standard diet, but differences were not statistically significant. Poor compliance of cats to renal diets due to low palatability has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Cats fed with the renal diet had significantly lower urine phosphate concentrations and total amount of phosphorus excreted in the urine, in addition to lower faecal and total excretion of phosphorus, compared with the standard diet. These results can be explained by the effect of the renal diet in reducing total intake of phosphorus. The fractional urinary phosphate excretion was not changed significantly by the renal diet, as expected, indicating that faecal and urinary phosphorus excretions were reduced equally. The amount of phosphorus consumed by the cats receiving the renal diet was 53.6% of the standard diet. This can be accounted for mainly by the lower phosphorus content (60%) of the renal diet with a smaller contribution from the lower food consumption (93%). In a previous study in the same laboratory, growing cats fed the same renal diet for approximately two months showed a small (+0.23&#x000a0;kg) gain in body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] compared to the loss noted in this study. One possible reason for this discrepancy is that the cats in the previous study received a placebo to SBR759 containing caramel to provide a similar colour to Lenziaren&#x000ae; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As noted in the conclusions of that study, it is possible that the caramel increased the acceptability of the renal diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In spite of the loss of body weight of the cats receiving the renal diet in this study, the cats were judged to be in good health in the clinical examinations and consumed their feed faster than the control group. No significant changes in haematology or serum chemistry variables were observed that could be attributed to the renal diet.</p><p>The main limitations of the study are discussed below. First, complete blinding of the study was not possible since two different diets were tested and no suitable placebo was available for the control group. In a previous study in cats, a placebo was used with a similar starch and sucrose complex as SBR759 (without iron) plus caramel to give a similar colour to Lenziaren&#x000ae;. This placebo was no longer available for this study. In addition the placebo was of only limited value as, although its physical appearance was similar, it did not result in darkening of the faeces as occurs with Lenziaren&#x000ae; as a consequence of its iron content. Since complete blinding was not possible, the study was masked by separation of functions so that personnel responsible for clinical examinations did not know the treatment groups. In addition, personnel making the laboratory analyses, which were the most important endpoints, were blinded to the treatment groups.</p><p>Second, blood samples from the cats were collected after sedation with xylazine and atipamezole, which might have affected blood variables, appetite or gastrointestinal motility. However any effects should have been the same in all groups.</p><p>Third, the choice of baseline in the statistical analyses including group F (renal diet) was challenging due to the unexpected loss of body weight in the renal diet group, which was most pronounced in the acclimatization period. The plan for the study was to acclimatize all cats to their diets prior to day 0. In a previous study in the same laboratory, a 28&#x000a0;day acclimatization period to the renal diet was sufficient and the cats had no significant changes in feed consumption or body weight during the acclimatization period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The unexpected loss of body weight in the renal diet group in the acclimatization period resulted in the baseline values between days &#x02212;28 and day &#x02212;1 being unreliable for the renal diet group (F). For two important variables, body weight and serum phosphate concentration, baseline values at day &#x02212;30 were available and permitted reliable analyses with RMANCOVA including baseline. For all other variables, no baseline was included in the RMANOVA model. In view of these limitations, the results from the renal diet group should be treated as exploratory only and additional studies are recommended. The primary objective of the study was unaffected by this issue, and the Lenziaren&#x000ae; and control group were compared for all variables using RMANCOVA using the baseline values recorded on day &#x02212;14 or &#x02212;30. This was valid since the management of those cats was the same prior to day 0.</p><p>Fourth, parametric methods (ANCOVA or RMANCOVA) were used since these are more powerful than non-parametric methods especially for repeated measures designs as used in this study. The data were log transformed in many cases, but nevertheless in 50% of analyses the data in the models deviated significantly from a normal distribution. However it was judged that the distributions were satisfactory, and it has been shown that ANOVA models are relatively robust even when the distribution deviates from normality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Therefore we conclude that the statistical analyses were appropriate for the conclusions reached.</p><p>Fifth, the results obtained with the diets tested (Hill&#x02019;s Science Plan Adult 1&#x02013;6 Optimal Care Chicken for the standard diet, Hill&#x02019;s Prescription Diet k/d Feline Renal Heath with Chicken for the renal diet) may not necessarily be extrapolated to other diets.</p><p>Lastly, the study was conducted in healthy cats and therefore the results cannot be simply extrapolated to clinical cases of hyperphosphataemia in cats. However efficacy of SBR759 over the dose range 0.25-1.0&#x000a0;g/day was reported in an abstract of a field study in cats with hyperphosphataemia secondary to CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In healthy cats fed a standard diet, Lenziaren&#x000ae; at doses of 0.25-2.0&#x000a0;g/cat per day effectively bound oral phosphate as evidenced by a dose-related reduction in urine phosphate concentrations.
