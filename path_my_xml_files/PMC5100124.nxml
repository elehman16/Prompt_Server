Even though they share same <italic>in vitro</italic> properties, they differ by virtue of their chemical structure, spectrum of receptor binding affinities, neuropharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and <italic>in vivo</italic> neuroimaging profile.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Risperidone is principally a dopamine-2 (D<sub>2</sub>) and serotonin-2 (5-HT<sub>2</sub>) receptor antagonist.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In addition to potent 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor antagonism, olanzapine further exhibits affinity for dopamine D<sub>1</sub>D<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>4</sub> receptors and selective muscarinic-binding sites.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In clinical practice, the choice of an atypical antipsychotic hinges mostly on the potential side effect profile of the drug rather than on differential therapeutic characteristics. To an extent, this was backed by a number of studies which showed that there is no definitive therapeutic superiority of either risperidone or olanzapine over the other.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, some authors have pointed out that the lack of differences in efficacy may be due to limitations of the evidence base.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>In recent years, a number of studies have contested the idea that risperidone and olanzapine have identical clinical efficacy profile. Some studies do suggest that patients on olanzapine sustain a better treatment response in comparison to risperidone.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] A meta-analysis of 212 randomized controlled trials to compare 15 antipsychotic drugs and placebo in the acute treatment of schizophrenia found that efficacy of olanzapine is marginally superior to that of risperidone.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In a 1 year naturalistic study, a significant number of patients who switched from risperidone to olanzapine experienced significant improvement in clinical and functional outcomes.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] A Cochrane review concluded that olanzapine improved the general mental state (total positive and negative syndrome scale [PANSS] score) better than risperidone.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>At the same time, there are studies with contradictory results of clinical advantage with risperidone with greater reduction of positive and affective symptoms in comparison to olanzapine.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, studies from India comparing olanzapine and risperidone have typically focused on the tolerability and side effect profile, especially the metabolic side effects rather than on comparison of clinical efficacy.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] We believe that the question of differential therapeutic characteristics of olanzapine and risperidone in schizophrenia is important as they are the most widely used atypical antipsychotics in India. Further information about the nature and magnitude of clinical improvement with these drugs would help in tailoring the treatment with the clinical profile of the patient.</p><p>The hypothesis of this study was that both olanzapine and risperidone are equally effective in the treatment of schizophrenia with similar side effect profile.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims</title><p>

Patients with any other DSM-IV axis I diagnosis or a retrospective DSM-IV diagnosis of substance abuse in the 3 months before selection were excluded. Documented disease of the central nervous system, use of concomitant therapy such as mood stabilizers or antidepressants, prior exposure to olanzapine or risperidone were other reasons for exclusion.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was started after obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee. Informed consent was taken from the patient's relative in cases where the patient was not fit for giving consent. The screening evaluation included a diagnostic interview using Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Patients in maintenance phase were recruited for the study. During the week before the subject's assignment to one of the two treatment groups, all oral antipsychotics and anticholinergic medications currently taken by the subjects were gradually discontinued. Any depot antipsychotics were discontinued for at least one treatment cycle before the subject was assigned to a study group.</p><p>The 71 participants were then randomly assigned to receive risperidone (2&#x02013;8 mg/day) or olanzapine (5&#x02013;20 mg/day) for 48 weeks.</p><p>The investigators and the patients were blind to the medication. Olanzapine tablets were available in the dose ranges of 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 mg tablets (A1, A2, A3, and A4) and risperidone tablets were available in the dose ranges of 1, 2, 3, and 4 mg (B1, B2, B3, and B4). Both these tablets were identical in size, shape, and color. This was achieved by embedding the tablets in identical empty capsules.</p><p>The dose of these drugs was increased in identical fashion depending on the clinical response as well as side effects such as A1 bid for few days, then A2 bid for few days, A3 bid for few days, and A4 bid for few days, which was the maximum dose range.</p><p>The concomitant medications allowed were trihexyphenidyl, propranolol, and lorazepam. The number of pills taken was determined by pill counts, and use of concomitant or adjunctive medication was recorded at each study visit. The modal dose for each patient within a treatment group was the dose prescribed for that patient on the maximum number of days during the trial.</p><p>Study sample was recruited from patients on maintenance phase only for homogeneity. Only a small proportion of approached patients refused to give consent for the study. Both patients and investigators were blind to the medication allocation during assessments. Efforts were made to control for confounding variables such as adjunctive medications.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Assessment tools</title><p>

Both the groups were comparable in terms of socio-demographic characteristics, mean duration of illness, and treatment. In addition, dropouts were comparable in both the groups.</p><p>The mean modal doses of risperidone (5.8 mg/day) and olanzapine (14.4 mg/day) received by the participants in this study are similar to those used in current clinical practice (4.5 mg/day of risperidone and 12.7 mg/day of olanzapine) (National dosing data for schizophrenia).[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Optimal dosing is important to study interpretation. In addition to reducing tolerability, excessive doses may actually reduce efficacy, perhaps because of the loss of an optimal receptor occupancy (e.g., D<sub>2</sub>) range, or because of an optimal binding pattern across different receptors (e.g., across 5-HT, D<sub>2</sub>, and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>).[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>With respect to efficacy, mean change in PANSS negative symptoms and overall severity of illness showed significantly higher improvement in the olanzapine group at 3<sup>rd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup>, months of assessment. This suggests that olanzapine offers specific advantage with respect to negative symptoms compared to risperidone while efficacy is comparable in positive symptoms. The clinical superiority of olanzapine over risperidone in negative symptoms has been noted by Tran <italic>et al</italic>. in a 28-week prospective study.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] An analysis of data from 12 randomized controlled trials studying the effects of atypical antipsychotics and haloperidol on various PANSS subscales using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling revealed that olanzapine is more efficacious than other drugs in treating negative symptoms.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In a meta-analysis studying the effect of various antipsychotics on negative symptoms, the effect size of olanzapine is larger than risperidone.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>The clinical advantage of olanzapine in negative symptoms and overall improvement persisted till the end of 1 year of the duration of the study. This suggests that starting a patient on schizophrenia with prominent negative symptoms on olanzapine in comparison to risperidone may offer an advantage that could persist beyond 1 year. Moreover, this benefit is visible within 3 months of initiating medications.</p><p>This is an important finding. As negative symptoms are closely associated with functional impairment, using olanzapine may be advantageous in shortening the socio-occupational dysfunction in comparison to risperidone. This finding may be particularly important in a low-middle income country such as India where even short duration of unemployment may have dire consequences for the family in the absence of the social security net. Because of the associated sedation, there is often reluctance from the clinicians to use olanzapine in situations where early improvement in functioning is highly desirable. Current findings suggest that there could be a clinical advantage with olanzapine which offsets the effects of sedation.</p><p>None of the participants experienced serious adverse events. Moreover, severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was significantly less over the course of the study in both groups. Both groups showed consistent weight gain after 3 months. The differences were not significant between the groups. Substantial health risks are associated with weight gain, a factor deserving careful consideration in long-term therapy.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In the present study, there were no significant differences in the changes in blood sugar levels between the olanzapine and risperidone groups. The rise in prolactin levels were significantly more in the risperidone group compared to olanzapine group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03). This is consistent with previous studies.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Both risperidone and olanzapine were generally well-tolerated and efficacious in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia.
