Despite intensive research, the regulation and function of the pancreatic &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-cells in health and disease remain enigmatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). During the past 30 years, the involvement of several gut-derived peptides in the regulation of pancreatic islet secretion has been progressively uncovered. One such gut-derived factor is glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), a polypeptide hormone secreted from the small-intestinal K cells in response to nutrient intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). GIP is well founded as an incretin hormone potentiating insulin release from &#x003b2;-cells in healthy humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In addition to insulinotropic effects, early studies also delineated the glucagon-releasing properties of GIP by demonstrating that GIP stimulates glucagon secretion from &#x003b1;-cells in the perfused rat pancreas at glucose concentrations &#x0003c;5.5 mmol/L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). However, a subsequent study was not able to reproduce the glucagon-releasing properties in humans during fasting and hyperglycemic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Thus, additional investigations of the potential glucagonotropic effect of GIP was not pursued for nearly 25 years, until Meier et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) used an improved immunoassay and demonstrated that GIP has dose-dependent glucagon-releasing properties when administered as bolus injections to healthy humans during euglycemia (plasma glucose [PG] 5.7 mmol/L). In contrast, using the same immunoassay, Vilsb&#x000f8;ll et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) reported GIP to be without glucagon-releasing properties when administered as a physiological infusion (1.5 pmol/kg/min for 30 min) in healthy humans clamped at euglycemia (5.1 mmol/L) as well as slightly elevated glucose levels (6 and 7 mmol/L, respectively). During overt hyperglycemic conditions, several studies have shown that GIP infusion does not have a glucagonotropic effect in healthy subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Consequently, although the relevance of GIP as an insulinotropic hormone in healthy individuals seems unquestionable, controversy exists regarding the glucagonotropic effects of GIP. We hypothesized that the glucagonotropic effects of GIP, such as its insulinotropic effects, are glucose dependent. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate, in the same individuals, the effects of GIP on plasma concentrations of glucagon and insulin at three distinct glycemic levels: hypoglycemia, euglycemia, and hyperglycemia.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s6"><title>Study protocol.</title><p>The study was approved by the scientific-ethical committee of the capital region of Denmark (reg. no.

Thus, for each subject, GIP or placebo (saline) was infused on 2 days during euglycemic clamps, on 2 days during 12 mmol/L hyperglycemic clamps, and on 2 days during hypoglycemic clamps, aiming at a PG level of 2.5 mmol/L. Subjects were instructed to maintain a carbohydrate-rich diet (at least 250 g of carbohydrate daily) and avoid alcohol and excessive eating for 3 days before each experimental day. In the morning of each experimental day, GIP or placebo (saline) was prepared (by M.C.) for infusion by mixing it with 1% human albumin in 0.9% saline. Subjects arrived at the laboratory after an overnight (10-h) fast having avoided strenuous physical activity the day before. Subjects were placed in a recumbent position and had a cannula inserted into a dorsal hand vein. The hand was placed in a heating box (55&#x000b0;C) throughout the experiment for the collection of arterialized blood samples. Another cannula was inserted into a contralateral cubital vein for glucose and hormone infusions through separate infusion lines. At time 0 min, a continuous intravenous infusion of either GIP (4 pmol/kg/min) or placebo (saline) was initiated. At time 15 min, the infusion rate was halved, and at time 60 min, the infusion was stopped. The variation in infusion rate was done with the intention to reproduce physiological concentrations of GIP normally observed after the ingestion of a mixed meal. The bolus in mL 50% glucose (wt/vol) administered at time 0 of the hyperglycemic clamp to elevate PG to 12 mmol/L was calculated as follows: (12 mmol/L &#x02212; fasting plasma glucose) &#x000d7; 35 mg glucose &#x000d7; body weight (in kilograms). During the hypoglycemic clamp, insulin (Actrapid; Novo Nordisk, Bagsv&#x000e6;rd, Denmark) mixed with 1% human albumin was infused at a rate of 1.5 mU/kg/min for the entire study period (90 min). PG was measured bedside every 5 min, allowing the PG level to be clamped by an adjustable continuous infusion of 20% glucose (wt/vol).</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Peptides.</title><p>Synthetic GIP (PolyPeptide Laboratories, Wolfenb&#x000fc;ttel, Germany) was prepared for infusion in humans by the independent capital region pharmacy in Denmark.

Statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism version 5.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Repeated-measures ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni posttests, were applied to test for differences in repeatedly measured values between days (i.e., absolute PG and hormone concentrations).

For paired comparisons between single values (e.g., between AUC values and baseline values, respectively), we used paired <italic>t</italic> tests or one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni posttests, if applicable. The insulin secretion rate (ISR) values were calculated by deconvolution of measured C-peptide concentrations and the application of population-based parameters for C-peptide kinetics, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).

Thus, GIP exhibits glucagonotropic effects during fasting and hypoglycemic conditions when little or no effect on insulin secretion is exerted by the hormone. In contrast, GIP has no effect on glucagon secretion during hyperglycemia, when it robustly potentiates glucose-induced insulin secretion. These findings help to explain most of the controversies, which exist in the literature, regarding the glucagonotropic effect of GIP. First, many of the negative results in healthy subjects could be related to the elevated glucose levels in studies using hyperglycemic clamping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Second, the low sensitivity of earlier glucagon assays could explain the negative glucagon responses seen in the earliest study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) revealed that short-duration GIP infusions (30 min) at a glycemic level of 5 mmol/L actually gave rise to significant glucagon responses compared with saline, but when the glucose levels were increased stepwise, first to 6 mmol/L and later to 7 mmol/L, the glucagon response was increasingly suppressed, resulting in the nonsignificant differences in total glucagon responses (GIP versus saline) reported in the original publication. Thus, on the basis of the collective human data, a glycemic threshold of ~5.5&#x02013;6 mmol/L could exist, below which GIP mainly exerts glucagonotropic actions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> illustrates that the bifunctional glucose-dependent role of GIP in vivo (in humans) at the physiological PG interval between 3 and 12 mmol/L bears resemblance to the results from perfused rat pancreas reported by Pederson and Brown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) more than 30 years ago.</p><fig id="F4" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>FIG. 4.</label><caption><p>Glucagon and C-peptide.

Several aspects of GIP physiology are interesting in this respect. Of note, GIP release is stimulated dose dependently not only by glucose but also by protein and fat ingestion and is, under physiological (postprandial) circumstances, always present alongside the coincretin, glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Of interest, despite the glucose-dependent insulinotropic effects of both hormones, GLP-1, in contrast to GIP, has well-established suppressive effects on glucagon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and seemingly also the capability to induce hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Another discerning factor is that GIP signaling robustly has been demonstrated to be involved in fat metabolism in rodents and canine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Yet, although secretion of GIP is elevated in obese subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) and enhanced by high-fat diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), the relevance of GIP in human fat metabolism remains more elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). As central nervous tissue rely on stable blood glucose levels, we hypothesize that a role of GIP could be, through its glucagonotropic effect, to provide buffering against reactive hypoglycemia, especially after meals with high protein and fat content. A buffering effect on blood glucose levels is also highly compatible with a role for GIP as an anabolic hormone for adipose tissue and bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>With regard to the regulation of pancreatic islet hormone secretion, it is interesting that GIP during euglycemia causes significant glucagon responses with concurrent insulin responses. In addition, during hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, glucagon levels were higher during the first 30 min with elevated levels of GIP, despite concomitant higher peripheral and presumably pancreatic intraislet insulin levels. Insulin is a well-known inhibitor of &#x003b1;-cell secretion, but the mechanism by which this inhibition occurs is not well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). A proposed mechanism is changes in paracrine &#x003b2;-cell secretion (i.e., insulin, amylin, &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid, zinc ions, etc.) as a director of glucagon secretion commonly referred to as the intraislet hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Thus, the current results demonstrate a dominant effect of GIP stimulation on glucagon release (presumably from pancreatic &#x003b1;-cells) over the proposed negative impact of insulin (and other products) secreted from neighboring &#x003b2;-cells at euglycemia and hypoglycemia. This is in line with previous results from our group demonstrating that the suppression of glucagon responses during GIP infusions at hyperglycemia does not depend on the concurrent rise in insulin responses, a conclusion drawn from studies in patients with type 1 diabetes who tested negative for C-peptide after an intravenous arginine test (i.e., without paracrine intraislet influence of insulin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Therefore, the prevailing glycemia, seems to be of greater importance in the regulation of glucagon secretion. The consequences of these parallel insulin and glucagon responses at euglycemic levels were a slight lowering effect on PG. This is a probable consequence of the peripheral (i.e., nonhepatic) influence of insulin during these circumstances but certainly does not exclude some buffering effect of glucagon through hepatic glucose production. The influence of insulin on peripheral tissues was further demonstrated during the excursion toward hypoglycemia, where PG levels were almost completely superimposed on days with GIP and saline. Hence, in the presence of the rather nonphysiological hyperinsulinemia inherent to the clamp in these healthy individuals, the stimulated glucagon levels for the first 30 min were not sufficient to modify the course of the downward-sloping PG curve. During the hyperinsulinemic clamp, the glucagon levels were increased by concomitant GIP infusion only in the physiological range of PG (i.e., in the range of 3.0&#x02013;5.5 mmol/L), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>. The maximal glucagon levels reached (at the lowest PG levels) were similar on days with GIP and saline, probably as a result of maximal stimulation of glucagon secretion induced by hypoglycemia and activity in the autonomic nervous system (observed clinically in most of the subjects by sweating).</p><p>The glucagonotropic effects of GIP could have pathophysiological consequences. It is well established that excess secretion of glucagon (weighed against a relative lack of insulin) in the postprandial and fasting state is a major determinant of diabetic hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Furthermore, it is evident that the hyperglucagonemia in type 2 diabetes cannot solely be explained by a lack of insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Intriguingly, in patients with type 2 diabetes the insulinotropic effect of GIP is severely deficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Therefore, in these patients a glucagonotropic effect of GIP could be a factor adding to the mismatched insulin-to-glucagon ratio. The maximal difference in glucagon levels between GIP and saline on the days of euglycemia in the current study amounts to ~4 pmol/L, a difference that could be of clinical relevance in type 2 diabetic patients with insufficient opposing insulin secretion. This is supported by the observation that there is a similar difference (i.e., ~4 pmol/L) in fasting glucagon concentrations between individuals with type 2 diabetes and healthy control subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In further support of this notion, recent studies have shown that GIP infused in supraphysiological doses worsens postprandial hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) and antagonizes the glucagon-suppressive effects of GLP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) in patients with type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, enhanced GIP action in type 2 diabetes could explain the improved glucagon response to hypoglycemia observed during treatment with the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, vildagliptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). The proposed role of GIP as a safeguard against hypoglycemia and its potential pathophysiological implications in type 2 diabetes could benefit from further exploration.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated glucose-dependent glucagonotropic effects of GIP in healthy humans. GIP has no effect on glucagon responses during hyperglycemia when it potentiates insulin secretion. In contrast, GIP increases glucagon levels during fasting and hypoglycemic conditions. Thus, GIP seems to be a physiological pancreatic islet regulator with diverging effects on the two main pancreatic glucoregulatory hormones insulin and glucagon.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
