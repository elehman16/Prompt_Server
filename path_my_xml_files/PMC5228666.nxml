Cap has a different mechanism of action than Gem with no overlapping toxicities. In addition, orally administered Cap chemotherapy is more convenient than intravenously administered 5-FU. The improved tolerability and similar efficacy of Cap compared with intravenous FU, and the convenience of oral administration make Cap an attractive treatment option in various other cancers.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup></p><p>Recent advances in the management of advanced pancreatic cancer include 2 randomized phase III clinical trials indicating a response benefit associated with GemCap combination chemotherapy compared with Gem monotherapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Cunningham et al<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> reported that GemCap chemotherapy significantly improved the objective response rate (ORR) and was associated with a trend toward improved OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.08) as compared with treatment by Gem alone.

Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), ORR, disease control rate, and toxicity. We randomly assigned eligible patients to each treatment arm on a 1:1 basis according to a computer-generated variable-size blocked randomization method. Randomization was stratified by extent of disease (locally advanced stage vs metastatic stage). GemCap arm received oral capecitabine 1660&#x0200a;mg/m<sup>2</sup> daily for 3 weeks followed by a 1-week break plus Gem 1000&#x0200a;mg/m<sup>2</sup> by 30-minute intravenous infusion weekly for 3 weeks every 4 weeks. Gem arm received 30-minute intravenous infusion weekly for 3 weeks every 4 weeks. The body surface area (BSA) was recalculated and the dose levels of GemCap were adjusted based on the recalculated BSA prior to each cycle.

The objective tumor response was evaluated according to the RECIST criteria (version 1.1). The levels of carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 and chorioembryonic antigen (CEA) were measured at the end of every 2 cycles.

Among them, GemCap was identified as an alternative combination therapy for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> In a randomized phase III trial, Cunningham et al<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> showed a significant improvement in the PFS (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66&#x02013;0.93; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.004) and a trend towards improved OS (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72&#x02013;1.02; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.08) in patients receiving GemCap therapy compared with those receiving Gem monotherapy. In the study, Cunningham et al used intensive dose-combination regimen compared with another phase III trial (oral capecitabine 1660 vs 650&#x0200a;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day; gemcitabine infusion on days 1, 8, and 15, every 4 weeks vs 1 and 8, every 3 weeks) and intensive dose-combination showed more effective results than another regimen.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Using high dose of chemotherapy regimens, the present study of GemCap combination therapy produced significantly improved ORR of 43.7% and a median PFS of 6.2 months, respectively. These results were similar to previous phase II studies conducted in South Korea.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup></p><p>To our knowledge, this study investigating the use of GemCap combination therapy for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer was a first in Asia. In this study, a longer OS of 10.3 months compared with previous phase III studies is reported. This is associated with the recent improvements in cancer supportive care such as pain control, complication control, and nutritional support. This data was also in agreement with previous phase II study data (10.3 months vs 10 months, respectively).<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup></p><p>There are some limitations in the study. We failed to show the significant difference in overall survival between GemCap and Gem due to an insufficient number of enrolled patients differing from the initially planned number. South Korea has universal health insurance system that covers almost the entire population. The medical insurance system of government did not cover the use of gemcitabine plus capecitabine on pancreatic cancer during the present study period. We could not prescribe additive gemcitabine plus capecitabine chemotherapy in patients with pancreatic cancer. And as a result, we did not enroll the sufficient number of patients during the study period. However, we showed a trend towards improved OS in patients who received GemCap although this was not statistically significant. Furthermore, response rates were significantly higher in GemCap patients compared with Gem (43.7% vs 17.6%, respectively). Second, the results from the new trials such as Von Hoff et al<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> about the increased survival in pancreatic cancer were published in 2013. Unfortunately, it decreases the value and novelty of the results from the current study. However, there was no phase III study that has been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of GemCap chemotherapy in an Asian patient population until now.</p><p>Recently, many novel biological agents targeting pancreatic cancer and its microenvironment have been reported to be promising in preclinical investigations and phase I/II clinical studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> However, an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of pancreatic cancer does not exist presently. Depending on patients&#x02019; health conditions, conventional chemotherapeutic agents are still administered.</p><p>In conclusion, this study was the first phase III study conducted in Asian patients using GemCap combination therapy. GemCap combination did not show statistically significant survival benefit compared with Gem treatment. There was a trend toward improved OS and better response in pancreatic cancer patients treated with GemCap.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to Department of Research Affairs, Biostatistics Collaboration Unit, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea for the help with the Statistical Analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental Digital Content</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="medi-96-e5702-s001.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e860" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: BSA = body surface area, CA 19-9 = carbohydrate antigen 19-9, Cap = capecitabine, CEA = chorioembryonic antigen, CR = complete responses, CT = computed tomography, ECOG = Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, FOLFIRINOX = fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and leucovorin, FU = fluorouracil, Gem = gemcitabine, GemCap = gemcitabine plus capecitabine, HR = hazard ratio, MRI = magnetic resonance imaging, ORR = objective response rate, OS = overall survival, PET = positron emission tomography, PFS = progression-free survival, PR = partial responses, RECIST = response evaluation criteria in solid tumors.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Supplemental Digital Content is available for this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Siegel</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>KD</given-names></name><name><surname>Jemal</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group>
