This figure is likely to be more than double to 366 million (76.4 million in India) by 2030.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Oral antihyperglycemic agents are prescribed if lifestyle measures alone fail to control disease progression. Metformin is the most commonly prescribed first-line antidiabetic drug worldwide. Combination therapy usually becomes necessary in diabetes treatment due to the progressive worsening of blood glucose control with disease advancement.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Pioglitazone is commonly prescribed in combination with metformin when the latter fails to control blood glucose alone. The efficacy of pioglitazone plus metformin combination therapy has been proven in such patients in several randomized, placebo or active comparator-controlled trials of up to 3.5 years duration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] However, Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have been found to be associated with a number of adverse events including edema, weight gain and osteoporosis. In addition, rosiglitazone has fallen into disrepute recently for being associated with deranged lipid profile and myocardial infarction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p> Sitagliptin is an orally administered once-daily, potent and highly selective dipeptidy1 peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. DPP-4 inhibitors enhance the levels of active incretin hormones, glucagon-like petide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), gut-derived peptides that are released into the circulation after ingestion of meals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] In the presence of elevated glucose concentrations, GLP-1 lowers glucagon secretion, thereby decreasing the postprandial rise in glucose concentration and reducing fasting glucose concentrations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Sitagliptin has been approved both as monotherapy and as add-on to existing first-line antidiabetic agents like metformin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p> There have been very few studies that have compared DPP-4 inhibitors in combination with metformin against existing established combination therapies for diabetes mellitus. Also, there is paucity of data regarding the effect of DPP-4 inhibitors on treatment satisfaction and lipid profile.</p><p>The present study was a randomized, parallel group study of 16 weeks, designed to compare sitagliptin versus pioglitazone as add-on therapy in patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on metformin alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was conducted in the Diabetes Clinic of Lok Nayak Hospital, jointly by the Departments of Pharmacology and Internal Medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College &#x00026; Associated Hospitals, New Delhi.

(HbA1c reduction 0.65% in sitagliptin + metformin after 24 weeks). However, similar studies by Hermansen <italic>et al</italic>., Scott <italic>et al</italic>. and Ludvik <italic>et al</italic>. reported a greater decrease in the HbA1c level in the sitagliptin + metformin group, i.e. 0.74% reduction after 24 weeks, 0.73% reduction after 18 weeks and 1.13% reduction after 24 weeks, respectively.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Hermansen <italic>et al</italic>. followed a washout period of antidiabetic drugs that would have resulted in a significant rise in HbA1c values before initiation of combination therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p> A recent 18-week study by Reasner <italic>et al</italic>. reported mean change from baseline HbA1c -2.4% in the sitagliptin + metformin FDC group compared with -1.8% reductions in the metformin monotherapy group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] This greater decrease in HbA1c may be attributed to the fact that patients enrolled in the study were treatment na&#x000ef;ve (mean baseline HbA1c 9.9%), whereas our study population was treatment experienced (mean baseline HbA1c 8.076%).</p><p>The mean decrease in HbA1c in the pioglitazone-treated group of our study was 0.75%. Similar studies by Einhorn <italic>et al</italic>., Bolli <italic>et al</italic>. and Matthews <italic>et al</italic>. reported a greater decrease in the HbA1c level in the pioglitazone + metformin group; 1.36% reduction after 72 weeks, 0.9% reduction after 24 weeks and 1% reduction after 52 weeks, respectively.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] This difference may be ascribed to the longer duration of drug treatment in these studies.</p><p>In our study, 24% of the patients in the sitagliptin-treated group achieved the goal of &#x0003c; 7% HbA1c level. A similar 18-week study of sitagliptin as an add-on to metformin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by Raz <italic>et al</italic>. reported 22% patients reaching the goal of &#x0003c; 7% HbA1c.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] However, some other previous studies showed a larger proportion of patients achieving the goal of HbA1c with sitagliptin (55% Scott <italic>et al</italic>., 63% Nauck <italic>et al</italic>.).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] The difference with Scott <italic>et al</italic>. can be explained by the fact that baseline mean HbA1c was higher in our study (Scott <italic>et al</italic>. 7.7% vs. 8.076% our study). Nauck <italic>et al</italic>. reported the proportion of patients reaching the goal of &#x0003c; 7% HbA1c level after 52 weeks whereas we reported this after 16 weeks.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p> The reduction in FPG obtained with sitagliptin (19.58 mg/dL after 16 weeks) in this study was consistent with those observed by Hermansen <italic>et al</italic>.

Einhorn <italic>et al</italic>. reported a greater decrease in FPG in the pioglitazone + metformin group (63 mg/dL after 72 weeks), which may be attributed to the longer duration of the study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p> The pioglitazone group in our study reported an increase in the mean body weight (0.9 kg after 16 weeks). This was less than that in previous studies by Bolli <italic>et al</italic>. (1.9 kg after 24 weeks) and Umpierrez <italic>et al</italic>. (1.74 kg after 26 weeks).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] A possible explanation could be greater adherence to dietary advice and smaller duration of study.</p><p>On the other hand, weight decreased in the sitagliptin group during the first 4 weeks of treatment, and then remained almost stable. Similar to changes in weight, BMI also increased in the pioglitazone group, while they decreased in the sitagliptin group. Based on the results from other studies in combination with metformin, sitagliptin appears to be largely weight-neutral, with results varying from weight gain observed by Hermansen <italic>et al</italic>. (24 weeks + 0.8 kg), no effect on body weight as seen by Raz <italic>et al</italic>. (30 weeks, no effect) to body weight reduction studied by Scott <italic>et al</italic>.

Thus, the weight neutrality of DPP-4 inhibitors may offer a great therapeutic advantage in diabetes management.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p> Regarding fasting lipid levels, both sitagliptine and pioglitazone had a similar impact on each of the parameters, with an increase in HDL-C and a decrease in the triglyceride levels. However, the extent to which HDL-C levels and triglyceride levels were affected favorably with pioglitazone was greater than that with sitagliptin (difference between groups each <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). There is paucity of data in the literature regarding the effect of sitagliptine on lipid profile. A study done by Tremblay has shown similar effects on lipid profile as our study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p> A previous study has demonstrated the favorable effect of pioglitazone on TG and HDL.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] In patients with type 2 diabetes, there is a strong association between high triglyceride and low HDL cholesterol levels and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] There have been concerns over liver toxicity with TZDs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] In our study, both sitagliptin and pioglitazone caused slight, nonsignificant elevation in mean levels of hepatic enzymes.</p><p>The most common adverse effect noted to occur in clinical trials with DPP-4 inhibitors are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory infection and headache.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Recently, the USFDA has issued a safety alert for sitagliptin regarding acute pancreatitis due to several postmarketing cases reported to the agency (88 reports of acute pancreatitis between October 2006 and February 2009).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] In our study, the most frequent side-effects reported with sitagliptin were headache, diarrhea and nausea. Diarrhea and vomiting could be attributable to metformin also as it is known to cause gastrointestinal side-effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] Edema and weight gain were the most common adverse events reported in the pioglitazone group, and these have also been corroborated previously with pioglitazine as combination with metformin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p> Patient's satisfaction with the ongoing treatment is an important indicator of good compliance, which eventually leads to the success of treatment. Treatment satisfaction scores from the DISQs and DTSQc, filled pre- and posttreatment revealed that the treatment satisfaction for both the treatment groups using sitagliptin or pioglitazone in combination with metformin was significantly higher. There was no significant difference in the improvement in treatment satisfaction produced in the two groups, although this was higher with sitagliptin.</p><p>Because diabetes is a chronic disease, with patients often having the need of lifelong therapy, cost becomes an important factor in choosing antidiabetic medication. Cost analysis was not in the scope of the present study. More pharmacoeconomic studies on Indian patients are required before coming to a conclusive evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of sitagliptin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Sitagliptin as an add-on to metformin is as effective and well tolerated as pioglitazone, but does not cause edema or weight gain. In view of its efficacy and good tolerability profile, sitagliptin may be a useful addition to the existing therapeutic armamentarium for treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
