However, serious infectious complications frequently occur after treatment. The reason for increased infections postalemtuzumab treatment is unknown at this stage. We explore the effect of alemtuzumab on intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and intestinal barrier function in cynomolgus model to explain the reason of infection following alemtuzumab treatment.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Twelve male cynomolguses were randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group. The treatment group received alemtuzumab (3 mg/kg, intravenous injection) while the control group received the same volume of physiological saline. Intestinal IELs were isolated from the control group and the treatment group (on day 9, 35, and 70 after treatment) for counting and flow cytometric analysis. Moreover, intestinal permeability was monitored by enzymatic spectrophotometric technique and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The numbers of IELs were decreased significantly on day 9 after treatment compared with the control group (0.35 &#x000b1; 0.07 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> and 1.35 &#x000b1; 0.09 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup>, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and were not fully restored until day 70 after treatment. There were significant differences among four groups considering IELs subtypes. In addition, the proportion of apoptotic IELs after alemtuzumab treatment was significantly higher than in the control group (22.01 &#x000b1; 3.67 and 6.01 &#x000b1; 1.42, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Moreover, the concentration of D-lactate and endotoxin was also increased significantly on day 9 after treatment.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Alemtuzumab treatment depletes lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and intestine of cynomolgus model. The induction of apoptosis is an important mechanism of lymphocyte depletion after alemtuzumab treatment.

Our previous studies have indicated that anti-mouse CD52 mAbs could induce IELs to apoptosis and result in depletion of IELs.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] However, there are differences in CD52 peptide sequences between mice and humans.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Notably, it was reported that human epitopes were well-conserved in apes, mostly conserved in old world monkeys, but only sometimes conserved in new world monkeys.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Therefore, the cynomolgus is the ideal animal model for the alemtuzumab studies.</p><p>In this study, we originally report the effect of alemtuzumab on cynomolgus&#x02019; IELs and intestinal barrier function with the aim of helping to eliminate infection complicatious postalemtuzumab treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Animals and experimental design</title><p>Juvenile outbred male cynomolgus monkeys, seronegative for simian immunodeficiency virus and herpes B virus, were obtained from the Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS, Beijing, China) and kept in the individual primate facility. These monkeys were aged between 3 and 5 years old with a weight of 3&#x02013;7 kg. The monkeys were given water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Biscuits were given twice daily and supplemented with fruit, vegetables, and compound high-nutrition monkey food. The animals received humane care according to the principles set forth in the &#x02018;Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals&#x02019; from AMMS, the Principles of laboratory animal care (NIH publication No. 86-23, revised 1985) and the American Society of Primatologists Principles for the Ethical Treatment of Nonhuman Primates. No animals were sacrificed in this study.</p><p>According to the alemtuzumab product data sheet, a marked reduction in lymphocyte count should occur when animals receive doses of 1 mg/kg mAb or higher. Moreover, it was reported that at a 3 mg/kg dose, there were no major effects on the cardiovascular or respiratory systems. Therefore, all cynomolgus were administered alemtuzumab (MabCampath, Bayer-Schering, Berlin, Germany), at a dose of 3 mg/kg by intravenous injection.</p><p>Body weights were determined prior to alemtuzumab administration and after treatment every day for the duration of the study. To mimic the clinical setting and better observe the monkeys for adverse drug effects, blood sampling was conducted on nonanesthetized animals. Before the operation, the cynomolgus were transferred to a sterile operating room. The surgical area was shaved and prepped in an aseptic fashion, usually with iodine solution. The blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, and temperature of cynomolgus were directly monitored with a multi-parameter monitor in real time. After being anesthetized with ketamine (5 mg/kg) and xylidinothiazoline (1 mg/kg), sections of small intestine and colon were obtained by enterectomy from the control group and treatment group on day 9, 35, and 70 after treatment. All surgical incisions were sutured closed, bandaged, and dressings changed on alternate days until the wounds healed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Animal screening test and immunotherapy</title><p>A single autosomal dominant gene is responsible for heterogeneous expression. It means that erythrocytes in cynomolgus are either all CD52 positive or all CD52 negative. Therefore, to avoid hemolysis after mAb treatment, only the cynomolgus whose erythrocytes did not express the CD52 antigen were selected for the trial.</p><p>Briefly, 2 ml peripheral blood was obtained by venipuncture from the saphenous vein of 30 healthy cynomolgus and overlaid on 2 ml Ficoll-Hypaque. The gradients were centrifuged at 400 &#x000d7;g for 20 min.

The external vasculature and Peyer's patches were removed from the intestinal segments. The intestines were opened longitudinally, cut into 5-mm<sup>2</sup> fragments and transferred to 50-ml plastic conical centrifuge tube. After tissue pieces had settled, the medium was removed by suctioning and replaced with 20 ml PBS, followed by 30 ml Hanks&#x02019; balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 0.75 mmol/L ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA), 100 U/ml penicillin 100 mg/ml gentamicin, 25 mmol/L HEPES buffer, and 5% FCS. The tissue suspension was transferred to a 150-ml flask and shaken rapidly 300 r/min for 30 min. The cell suspension was washed twice in complete RPMI with 5% FCS and stored on ice. Fresh HBSS&#x02013;EDTA was added, and the process repeated. The harvested tissue slurries were pooled and passed through 80- and 400-screen mesh trap valve in turn to prepare a single-cell suspension.

Unfortunately, the mechanism of infection complications remains unclear. Our study originally investigated the effect of alemtuzumab on IELs and intestinal barrier function in a cynomolgus model in order to elucidate the mechanism of infectious complications after alemtuzumab treatment.</p><p>Intraepithelial lymphocytes constitute a unique population of lymphoid cells residing as single cells between intestinal epithelial cells.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] They are active as the first line of specific defense to encounter invading infectious agents that have entered the body via the local epithelial surface. IELs play an important role in the maintenance of mucosal homeostasis and the integrity of epithelial tissues.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The IELs are mainly comprised of T-cell and can be divided into two groups according to the TCR phenotype, namely TCR &#x003b1;&#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> and TCR &#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>+</sup> cells. In this study, we examined the effect of alemtuzumab on the number and phenotype of IELs <italic>in vivo</italic>. Compared with the limited depletion of anti-CD52 mAb on IELs in a mouse model,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] more powerful clearance of IELs caused by alemtuzumab was observed in this study. It was found that IELs decreased significantly after treatment, accompanied by the decline of lymphocytes in the blood. Induction of apoptosis, antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, and complement-mediated cell death (CDC) is the proposed mechanism of action of alemtuzumab.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In our study, we found that the percentage of apoptotic IELs increased significantly after alemtuzumab treatment. Therefore, it can be inferred that induction of apoptosis played an important role in the mechanism of IELs depletion caused by alemtuzumab. We subsequently examined the phenotypes of IELs after alemtuzumab treatment. The percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> IELs were not changed on day 9 after treatment while the percentage of CD8<sup>+</sup> IELs increased significantly on day 35 after treatment. A possible explanation may be that alemtuzumab induces equal depletion of the CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> IELs by the populations recovered differently. The decrease of CD20<sup>+</sup> IELs signifies that the alemtuzumab could also induce the depletion of B-cell. Moreover, it was also noted that TCR &#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>+</sup> IELs decreased significantly after alemtuzumab treatment. Recent studies have shown that TCR &#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>+</sup> IELs could regulate the generation and differentiation of EC. Abnormal EC turnover and function was found in mice lacking TCR &#x003b3;&#x003b4; IELs.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Therefore, we put forward the hypothesis that the intestinal barrier function is disrupted after alemtuzumab treatment because of the depletion of IELs.</p><p>It was reported that diarrhea and infection are potential complications after alemtuzumab therapy.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] When patients suffering from lymphoma were treated with alemtuzumab, abnormal, disarrayed epithelium was found after histological examination of the colon, with bacilli attaching to the surfaces of damaged epithelial cells.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Our study showed that in addition to the depletion of IELs, intestinal walls became fairly notably, and atrophica ileum and colon epithelium were observed on day 9 after treatment. Moreover, the brush border of colon villi became discontinuous. This suggests that the treatment with alemtuzumab may cause a profound depletion of intestinal IELs that predisposes the intestinal mucosa to disruption.</p><p>D-lactate is a specific by-product of bacterial metabolism; it is neither produced nor metabolized by mammalian cells. When the mucosal barrier of the gut begins to break down, D-lactate crosses the mucosal barrier in large quantities, and the concentration of D-lactate becomes elevated in peripheral blood serum.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In our study, we found that the D-lactate concentrations and levels of endotoxin were increased significantly on day 9 after alemtuzumab treatment and gradually decreased to the normal level by day 70.</p><p>Our present findings originally demonstrated that the changes of TJ ultrastructure and protein expression. After alemtuzumab treatment, the ultrastructure of TJ was not intact, and the electron&#x02013;dense materials diminished. Until 70 days after treatment, the morphology of TJ recovered and the electron&#x02013;dense material reoccurred. It means that the intestine barrier function was destroyed following alemtuzumab treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the alemtuzumab induces IELs apoptosis and leads to IELs depletion. The different subtypes of IELs were also all affected after treatment. The reduction of IELs may result in disruption of the intestine barrier, which could explain why bacterial complications frequently occur after alemtuzumab therapy. Therefore, to improve patient outcomes, more attention should be paid by clinicians to protection of intestinal barrier function. However, the precise mechanism by which alemtuzumab disrupts the intestinal barrier requires further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="edited-by"><p><bold>Edited by:</bold> Yuan-Yuan Ji</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> This work was supported by grants from the National Basic Research Program (973 Program) in China (No. 2007CB513005 and 2009CB522405), Shangdong Province Young and Middle-Aged Scientists Research Awards Fund (No. BS2011YY004), the Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation in China (No. 30830098), National Key Project of Scientific and Technical Supporting Programs Funded by Ministry of Science and Technology of China (No. 2008BAI60B06), the National Natural Science Foundation in China (No. 30672061), the Military Scientific Research Fund (No. 0603AM117) and the Gut Barrier Foundation of Jie-Shou Li Academician.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Demko</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Summers</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Keegan</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Pazdur</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>FDA drug approval summary: Alemtuzumab as single-agent treatment for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia</article-title><source>Oncologist</source><year>2008</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>167</fpage><lpage>74</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18305062</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>VT</given-names></name><name><surname>Cutler</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Current and novel therapies in acute GVHD</article-title><source>Best Pract Res Clin Haematol</source><year>2008</year><volume>21</volume><fpage>223</fpage><lpage>37</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18503988</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rowan</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Tite</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Topley</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Brett</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cross-linking of the CAMPATH-1 antigen (CD52) mediates growth inhibition in human B- and T-lymphoma cell lines, and subsequent emergence of CD52-deficient cells</article-title><source>Immunology</source><year>1998</year><volume>95</volume><fpage>427</fpage><lpage>36</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9824507</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Villamor</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Montserrat</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Colomer</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mechanism of action and resistance to monoclonal antibody therapy</article-title><source>Semin Oncol</source><year>2003</year><volume>30</volume><fpage>424</fpage><lpage>33</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12939711</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fraser</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Imrie</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hematology Disease Site Group of Cancer Care Ontario's Program in Evidence-based Care.
