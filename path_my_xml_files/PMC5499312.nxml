The WHO rates depression as the leading cause of disability worldwide and as a major contributor to the global burden of disease [<xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Depression is also a health problem that can exacerbate the condition of patients with comorbidity, such as diabetes and other illnesses where lifestyle behaviors have a large impact. Furthermore, depression is also a common and frequent reason for reduced work ability and sick leave, as depression is likely to contribute to functional impairment of varying severity [<xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In Sweden, as in the majority of Western countries, most patients with depression are treated in primary care. Psychological treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is currently recommended as the first choice for treating mild depression and one of the first choices for treating moderate depression [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) treatment has been evaluated in a number of comparative studies [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and is currently proposed as a treatment alternative to face-to-face CBT also in primary care [<xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. ICBT allows greater access, and possibly more effective health care (e.g. shorter therapist time spent per patient), but more research is needed to evaluate ICBT in primary care settings [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Several studies show that ICBT reduces symptoms of depression, and the effect is persistent in long-term follow-up [<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, patients have mostly been recruited through advertisements or specialized clinics, and only few ICBT studies have been conducted in ordinary primary care [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In addition, in ICBT research, performed interventions are often diverse; including various types of software programs, computerized CBT on site at clinics, live-CBT online and unsupported ICBT, which complicates comparisons [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The effectiveness of ICBT in primary care cannot be evaluated based on studies with patients via advertisement recruitment or from specialized clinics [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. More extensive and longer follow-ups are also needed [<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The overall aim of the PRIM-NET study was to evaluate whether ICBT can improve treatment of mild/moderate depression in the primary care setting, with emphasis on long-term (6 months and 12 months) effects on depressive symptoms, as well as on quality of life, psychological distress, medication and sick leave. The specific hypothesis was that ICBT is at least equally effective, or non-inferior, compared to treatment as usual (TAU) for reduction of depressive symptoms in a long-term perspective in a primary care context. The primary outcome measure was reduction of depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes were improvement in quality of life and reduction of psychological distress, sustained effect on depressive symptoms (6 and 12 months), and whether the need of medication and sick leave differed between treatment groups. All outcome measures are both in a short- and long-term perspective. Short-term results (3-month follow-up) concerning outcomes of depressive symptoms have been reported earlier [<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s0003"><title>Material and methods</title><p>The PRIM-NET project was designed as a randomized controlled trial in primary care. A total of 90 patients were enrolled between March 2010 and March 2013 at 16 primary care centers (PCCs) located in the south-west region of Sweden. All patients were assessed by a psychologist/psychotherapist (therapist) and randomized to either ICBT or TAU. The ICBT in PRIM-NET included a commercially available ICBT program, together with weekly therapist e-mail or telephone support from the same therapist who had performed the initial assessment. The therapist followed the patient&#x02019;s progress actively, communicated with the patient every week via a secure e-mail and encouraged the patient to provide feedback about experienced progress. The study protocol has been described in detail previously [<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><sec id="s0004"><title>PCCs</title><p>All PCCs in the study area with primary care therapists with CBT training were invited to participate in the study. Each participating PCC assigned a study nurse who was responsible for the collection of research data. PRIM-NET employed therapists with CBT training to work with PRIM-NET at two PCCs. Participating nurses, GPs and therapists were specially trained in the PRIM-NET project to perform all required activities according to a structured study protocol concerning routines for recruitment, assessment and treatment. Few of the PCCs offered ICBT for depression before the trial. The PCCs remained responsible for the patients&#x02019; treatment during the entire study period. Seven of the 16 participating PCCs were connected to a centralized primary care ICBT unit, which was set up and operated by PRIM-NET to enhance the enrolment after the first year. The ICBT unit served the seven PCCs with all parts of the study protocol after the GP consultation, except TAU, which the patients received at their PCC. All included patients randomized to TAU at the centralized unit (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) were offered ICBT after the treatment period (of 3 months) for recruitment reasons (referral reinforcement). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref> presents a flowchart of the recruitment of patients and dropouts.</p><fig id="F0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Flowchart showing recruitment and dropouts in the PRIM-NET study.

Patients positive to ICBT as a treatment option, who had not recently (last month) started or changed possible antidepressant medication were asked about their willingness to participate in the study. Before inclusion, the patients were invited to a therapist for a 1-h interview including a diagnostic process assessing whether the patients actually met the inclusion criteria. The diagnostic process was conducted using structured assessment interviews and validated instruments and scales, i.e. the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) version 6, MINI plus with additions from the sections concerning depression and dysthymia [<xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) [<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and the Montgomery&#x02013;&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale &#x02013; self rating version (MADRS-S) [<xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>To be included, patients had to meet diagnostic criteria for depression according to DSM-IV (assessed via MINI), have a MADRS-S score below 35, and have access to a computer with speakers or headphones. Patients were excluded if they had severe depression (according to a MADRS-S score &#x02265;35), a principal diagnosis of anxiety (assessed by the therapist), psychosis, bipolar disorder or hypomanic episode, antisocial personality disorder, substance dependence or alcohol abuse (all of the above assessed by therapists using MINI), medium or high suicide risk (defined as MADRS-S question 9&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;3p and/or MINI Part B &#x02013; Suicide &#x0003e;9p, or previous suicide attempt). Patients with other severe mental disorder, cognitive disability or communication difficulties that would prevent participation in the ICBT program (only available in Swedish) were also excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s0007"><title>Randomization</title><p>Randomization took place after the diagnostic interview, when the study nurse also administered questionnaires, including background data. The patients were consecutively randomized to either ICBT or TAU by an independent research unit at the University of Gothenburg/Sahlgrenska University Hospital. The randomization process was performed with all study patients as one group, which concealed the allocation to be from both the PCC personnel and the researchers.</p><p>After the treatment period, all patients met the study nurse at the PCC for a 3-month follow-up. Evaluation with the same instruments was done after 6 and 12 months by sending the questionnaires by e-mail.</p><p>Eight participants, initially randomized to TAU, were included in the intervention arm after 3 months as TAU patients. They then received ICBT intervention and were followed up 0&#x02013;12 months as ICBT patients for recruitment reasons. In the present long-term follow-up study, they were consequently regarded as ICBT patients.</p></sec><sec id="s0008"><title>Power calculation</title><p>The study was designed for detecting a possible significant difference in effect size in the summation of scores employed in the completed instruments of approximately 10% between the ICBT group and the TAU group, with significance level set at 0.05 and power estimate of 0.80, which required 71 participants in each group. The effect size was chosen based on findings reported in a study by Proudfoot et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and on the study group&#x02019;s empirical expectations.</p></sec><sec id="s0009"><title>Therapists</title><p>In total, 14 therapists were involved in the study. They were all licensed psychologists or licensed psychotherapists, except for two psychologists under supervision to be licensed. They all had training in CBT and had qualified knowledge and previous experience of treatment of depression. The therapists were introduced to the aim, design and procedures of the project, and the two study psychologists supervised them regularly. The study psychologists were supervised by a psychologist and instructor in CBT at the Department of Psychology at the University of Gothenburg. In all, 13 therapists performed the initial assessment. Ten therapists were engaged in the support of patients randomized to the ICBT treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="s0011"><title>ICBT</title><p>Patients randomized to ICBT received a personal login code, a printed workbook and printed guidance on how to access the treatment and the secure e-mail service from the study nurse. The ICBT program Depressionshj&#x000e4;lpen<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> [<xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] was based on a structured CBT approach, with strong emphasis on behavioral activation [<xref rid="C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and components of acceptance and commitment therapy [<xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The program consisted of seven modules, which the patients could access from a webpage using their unique personal code. The therapists could actively follow the patients&#x02019; work and progress in the program every week in a secure e-mail system called &#x02018;Mina v&#x000e5;rdkontakter&#x02019; (My Healthcare Contacts) (MVK), already in use within Swedish primary care. Thus, patients received support from the same therapist who had performed the initial assessment at the PCC. Contact was also made by three telephone calls during the treatment period of 8&#x02013;12 weeks, plus additional contact via e-mail or telephone when needed (although rarely asked for). Manuals for the therapists were developed by PRIM-NET.</p></sec><sec id="s0012"><title>TAU</title><p>Participants randomized to TAU received the treatment typically provided for depression at the participating PCCs. This could include scheduled contacts with GPs, nurses and other personnel at the PCC, face-to-face-psychotherapy, antidepressants, sick leave certification and combinations of these treatments depending on the practices and available resources at the specific PCC. However, patients randomized to TAU did not receive ICBT, and ICBT was the only type of psychotherapy delivered to patients randomized to ICBT. Because of the fact that the study was designed as an effectiveness study, there were no other restrictions in additional care offered to patients by the PCCs after inclusion. All patients in the study could receive usual care both before and after the 3-month intervention period, all along special care demands of the individual patient.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0013"><title>Instruments</title><sec id="s0014"><title>Diagnostic procedure and patient characteristics</title><p>For the diagnostic procedure, we used the following validated instruments: the MINI version 6 and MINI plus, with additions from the sections concerning depression and dysthymia [<xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and BDI-II [<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The MADRS-S [<xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] was used to exclude patients with severe depression. Questionnaires were used to collect information concerning patient characteristics. The patients answered BDI in conjunction with the assessment, and the rest of the questionnaires at the visit to the research nurse. At 3-month follow-up, the questionnaires were answered at the research nurse visit, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up the questionnaires were sent to the patients.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><title>Primary outcome measures</title><p>Depressive symptoms were measured by the validated BDI-II [<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], based on the total score in the 0&#x02013;63 point scale; missing items were not accepted in the analysis. A higher score indicated more depressive symptoms. Severity of depressive symptoms was defined according to the manual [<xref rid="C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The cut-off indication of major depression was&#x02009;&#x02265;14p in BDI-II. In addition, a diagnosis of depression also required a confirmation in the clinical therapist assessment.</p></sec><sec id="s0016"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>Quality of life was measured by the validated Quality of Life instrument EQ-5D with British tariff [<xref rid="C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and calculated according to Dolan [<xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A higher score indicated a better condition. Psychological distress was measured by the validated 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) [<xref rid="C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], calculated with Likert scoring (0, 1, 2, 3) [<xref rid="C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A higher score indicated more psychological distress. Information on use of antidepressants (yes/no), sedatives (yes/no), sick leave (yes/no) and number of days of sick leave during 0&#x02013;3, 4&#x02013;6 and 7&#x02013;12 months was collected by questionnaires. The study nurse registered patients&#x02019; PCC visits to GPs, therapists and nurses. Visits to GPs and nurses were also collected from electronic patient records (EPR) after the study. Data obtained from the study protocol regarding visits to therapists and nurses and data obtained from EPR regarding GP visits were used in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0017"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The statistical analyses were made using SPSS for Mac, version 20.0.

When the 7 TAU&#x02009;+&#x02009;ICBT patients were excluded, the significant difference between the groups for EQ5D in the 0- to 6-month period disappeared, but on the other hand there was a significant difference in mean intra individual change scores for EQ5-D for 0&#x02013;12 months (ICBT 11.3, TAU 7.3, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02). When the 7 TAU&#x02009;+&#x02009;ICBT patients were included as TAU only (for 3 months), there were no differences in the results compared to the presented main results except that there was no significant difference concerning EQ-5D.</p><p>The 7 TAU&#x02009;+&#x02009;ICBT patients entered the ICBT treatment with a mean BDI-II score of 19.5 (range&#x02009;=&#x02009;14&#x02013;30) compared to 26.7 (range&#x02009;=&#x02009;8&#x02013;45) for the patients receiving ICBT or TAU. The patients receiving ICBT after TAU had a intra-individual mean change score for depressive symptoms of &#x02212;6.2 (SD 7.7) during ICBT treatment period, compared to &#x02212;12.7 (SD 10.7) for the patients receiving ICBT or TAU.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0024"><title>Discussion</title><p>The main results in this randomized controlled study with follow-ups until 1 year after treatment start were that no significant differences in reduction of self-reported depressive symptoms were found between ICBT and TAU, either not directly after treatment or at the 1-year follow-up. Furthermore, there were no differences concerning perception of psychological distress, sick leave frequency or total days of sick leave during the 12-month study period. There was a significant difference concerning antidepressant medication; ICBT patients dropped the medication during the 3-month treatment period, but resumed medication during the following months, and the use of antidepressants was almost the same in both groups at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups. No remarkable differences concerning perception of quality of life could be seen during the 12-month period. Therapist contacts were, as expected, significantly more in the TAU group, but there was no increase in other care contacts with the PCCs during the 3-month treatment period. These findings provide support for ICBT as an equally effective treatment as TAU also in the primary care context for patients accepting ICBT treatment.</p><sec id="s0025"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The PRIM-NET project was designed as an RCT, targeting depressed patients treated by primary care personnel at PCCs. We employed a rigorous protocol, including diagnostic assessment by trained therapists, an ICBT intervention administered by therapists with CBT training and with experience of working with CBT. Follow-up data were also collected after 6 months and 1 year. We did not exclude any somatic comorbidity. The included patients would therefore represent the typical primary care patients with often several other health problems. We included 90 patients, which is a fairly high number of patients for this type of intervention trial in primary care. The design of the PRIM-NET study enabled assessment of potential treatment outcome differences between ICBT and TAU, and whether ICBT is effective in primary care [<xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Not only depressive symptoms, but other long-term outcomes, important for primary care patients, such as quality of life, medication and sick leave requirements, were included.</p><p>The study has a number of limitations. First, despite a prolonged inclusion period and efforts to enhance the enrolment rate, we were not able to include more than 90 patients, which is on the low side of the initial power calculation. The numbers we have for assessed and excluded patients are uncertain. Depression is common in primary care, and we have reason to believe that some patients were deemed not be suitable and never asked about study participation. There is still a risk that there was an outcome difference between TAU and ICBT. However, on the basis of the actual outcomes, with very similar means and variation measures shown in the two groups, the probability of a divergent result when including a 35% higher number of participants is low. The difficulty of meeting estimated inclusion rates in primary care research has been discussed previously [<xref rid="C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The PCCs in this study were facing several challenges during the time period for the PRIM-NET project. There were large-scale organizational changes and a nation-wide on-going vaccination campaign, to mention a few circumstances that interfered with the research project. The mean age of included patients was 36 years, which is younger than the assumed mean age of all the patients of a typical PCC. Second, trials in primary care often face challenges setting up RCTs with stringency, as it is not possible to set up a blinded trial with a sham group or an untreated control group [<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In PRIM-NET, our solution was to compare ICBT with TAU. After the first year of a low inclusion rate, despite a large number of patients with depression at the PCCs, an alternative design was set up. To increase the inclusion rate, a centralized unit was formed where all recruited patients were offered ICBT, although for patients randomized to TAU, only after 12 weeks of TAU. In this way, we did not fully follow the randomization scheme, but included 8 &#x02018;extra&#x02019; recruited patients to ICBT group who were not included in the present 12-month follow-up study until after being on waiting list for 3 months. Similar procedures have sometimes been applied in long-term ICBT RCTs [<xref rid="C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Waiting for treatment has its obvious drawbacks, but for practical reasons may sometimes be the next best alternative. The request for psychological treatment often exceeds the actual resources at PCCs, and waiting for psychological treatment is common practice. We have performed all calculations with and without the patients receiving ICBT after 12 weeks of TAU, which shows that the main results remain robust.</p><p>Third, regarding diagnosis of depression, there was no therapist assessment after the treatment period, only self-administered protocols. However, many studies on ICBT have used questionnaires of self-rated symptoms of different types, and when diagnostic assessments by trained therapists has been performed it has mostly been only pre-treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s0026"><title>Results in relation to other studies</title><p>In this study, ICBT was equally effective as TAU. We found no evidence for ICBT being more effective than TAU as found in the trial by Proudfoot et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The treatment outcomes in the TAU group in this study were more positive compared to those of the TAU group in Proudfoot et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In PRIM-NET, both the ICBT and the TAU groups had a BDI-II score indicating remission of depression (&#x0003c;14p) after treatment. In the Proudfoot et&#x000a0;al.&#x02019;s study [<xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], only the patients in the intervention group reached a similar reduction in depressive symptomatology. The different outcomes could partially be explained by differences in design. Proudfoot et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] had a study population of patients with depression, anxiety (including phobias and panic) or mixed anxiety and depression, and the computerized CBT was conducted on site at the general practices and with assistance from a nurse. A recent meta-analysis has also shown somewhat reduced effect sizes of CBT in studies over time [<xref rid="C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The PRIM-NET study was designed to evaluate mild/moderate depression, according to MADRS-S. However, in PRIM-NET, we ended up including also patients with severe depression according to BDI-II. Our results indicated equally good results among severely depressed patients as for those with mild/moderate depression, shown by substantial effect sizes within both the ICBT and the TAU groups in line with the review by Hoifodt et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, there are few RCT trials on depression treatment in primary care settings similar to Scandinavian conditions for comparison with our results. Recently, a pragmatic, multicenter RCT study performed in British primary care to assess effectiveness of supported ICBT as an adjunct to usual primary care for adults with depression showed comparable long-term outcomes [<xref rid="C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our finding that the reduction of depressive symptoms remained at follow-up is in line also with 8-month follow-up results from a study conducted at general practices in the UK delivering online (synchronous) therapy for depression [<xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], one study assessing effectiveness of supported ICBT as an adjunct to usual primary care for adults with depression [<xref rid="C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], as well as a 3.5-year follow-up study of depressed patients from the general population recruited by advertisement, where 1/3 of the patients initially on waiting list were collapsed into one of the intervention groups (guided self-help ICBT vs. e-mail CBT) [<xref rid="C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s0027"><title>Significance of the study findings</title><p>The results of this trial suggests that ICBT with weekly minimal therapist support is non-inferior to the usual treatments in primary care and a treatment alternative also in the long-term perspective for patients with depression in primary care. This knowledge is important for the primary care personnel and the primary care organization, as a majority of patients with depression are treated in primary care.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from REHSAM (Swedish Social Insurance Agency) and Region V&#x000e4;stra G&#x000f6;taland.
