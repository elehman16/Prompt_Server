Much better long-term survival has been reported in retrospective/non-randomized studies with D <sub>2</sub> resections that involve a radical extended regional lymphadenectomy than with the standard D <sub>1</sub> resections. In this paper we report the long-term survival of patients entered into a randomized study, with follow-up to death or 3 years in 96&#x00025; of patients and a median follow-up of 6.5 years. In this prospective trial D <sub>1</sub> resection (removal of regional perigastric nodes) was compared with D <sub>2</sub> resection (extended lymphadenectomy to include level 1 and 2 regional nodes). Central randomization followed a staging laparotomy.</p><p>Out of 737 patients with histologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma registered, 337 patients were ineligible by staging laparotomy because of advanced disease and 400 were randomized. The 5-year survival rates were 35&#x00025; for D <sub>1</sub> resection and 33&#x00025; for D <sub>2</sub> resection (difference &#x02013;2&#x00025;, 95&#x00025; CI = &#x02013;12&#x00025;&#x02013;8&#x00025;). There was no difference in the overall 5-year survival between the two arms (HR = 1.10, 95&#x00025; CI 0.87&#x02013;1.39, where HR &#x0003e; 1 implies a survival benefit to D <sub>1</sub> surgery). Survival based on death from gastric cancer as the event was similar in the D <sub>1</sub> and D <sub>2</sub> groups (HR = 1.05, 95&#x00025; CI 0.79&#x02013;1.39) as was recurrence-free survival (HR = 1.03, 95&#x00025; CI 0.82&#x02013;1.29). In a multivariate analysis, clinical stages II and III, old age, male sex and removal of spleen and pancreas were independently associated with poor survival. These findings indicate that the classical Japanese D <sub>2</sub> resection offers no survival advantage over D <sub>1</sub> surgery. However, the possibility that D <sub>2</sub> resection without pancreatico-splenectomy may be better than standard D <sub>1</sub> resection cannot be dismissed by the results of this trial. &#x000a9; 1999 Cancer Research Campaign</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>gastric cancer</kwd><kwd>D <sub>1</sub> resection</kwd><kwd>D <sub>2</sub> resection</kwd><kwd>long-term survival</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
