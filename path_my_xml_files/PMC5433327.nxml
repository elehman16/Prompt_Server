Study participants were recruited from an MS specialty clinic located at KUMC, advertisement through the Mid America Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), and personal referral from consented individuals, area physicians, or study personnel. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants prior to enrollment. To be included in the study, participants had to be: (1) 18 years or older, (2) have relapsing&#x02013;remitting or secondary progressive MS, (3) be able to ambulate independently with or without an assistive device, and (3) score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;24 on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> for individuals to complete informed consent. The exclusion criteria included: (1) history of alcohol/drug abuse or nervous system disorder other than MS, (2) severe physical, neurological, or sensory impairments that would prevent individuals from being able to complete testing or conduct the interventions, (3) developmental history of learning disability or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, (4) relapse and/or corticosteroid use within four weeks of assessment, (5) unable to give consent, (6) uncorrected vision loss that would interfere significantly with testing, (7) untreated known sleep disorder (such as sleep apnea), (8) acute ischemic cardiovascular event or coronary artery bypass surgery less than three months ago; (9) either unable to physically perform the exercise test using the recumbent stepper or demonstrate absolute indications for terminating exercise that follows the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines; or (10) uncontrolled blood pressure with medication (BP&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;190/110 mmHg).</p><p>After obtaining written informed consent, each participant was scheduled for baseline assessment. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> was used to assess sleep quality, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> to assess daytime sleepiness. The PSQI is a well-validated and reliable measure of sleep quality that consists of 19 self-rated questions. These 19 questions form seven component scores, each of which is rated on a scale of 0 to 3 with 0 indicating no sleep difficulty and 3 indicating severe sleep difficulties. The seven component scores are summed to form a global score ranging from 0 to 21. On the ESS, participants used a four-point Likert scale to rate how likely they would be to fall asleep in eight different scenarios of daily activities. A higher score indicates higher daytime sleepiness.</p><p>Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using the Total Body Recumbent Stepper (TBRS) submaximal exercise test and the TBRS peak VO<sub>2</sub> prediction equation.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Heart rate (HR) and BP were assessed prior to testing. Participants were fitted with a Polar HR monitor (Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Oulu, Finland) for continuous measurement. Using the seated recumbent stepper (NuStep T5XR, NuStep, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), the participants were asked to move their arms and legs in an alternating pattern at a constant speed of 100 steps per minute. All participants began the TBRS submaximal exercise test at 30 watts and per protocol, the resistance was increased every three minutes until test termination criteria were met: (1) participants reached 85% of age-predicted maximum HR, (2) the participant asked to stop the test, or (3) exercise test completion.</p><p>Other secondary measures that were collected included depression, which was assessed using the Beck Depression Index-Fast Screen (BDI),<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> fatigue assessed using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS),<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and disease severity using the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC).<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Medical history, medication list, and demographics were collected.</p><p>Following baseline assessment, participants were randomized into either the moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (AE) program or the low-intensity walking and stretching (WS) program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2055217316680639">Figure 1</xref>). Each exercise program consisted of 12 weeks of exercise, three times a week, for a total of 36 exercise sessions. Block randomization with two conditions (disease type and sex) per block was used to ensure an equivalent number of participants in the treatment groups.

Each session began with 10&#x02013;15 minutes of upper and lower body stretching exercises followed by a five-minute warm-up period on the recumbent stepper machine. During the warm-up period, the participants exercised at a low intensity of 25 watts. After the warm-up period, the examiner increased the watts until the target heart rate (THR) was reached. The THR range was calculated using the Karvonen equation.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The exercise intensity was set at 50%&#x02013;59% of the HR reserve for the first six weeks and then increased to 60%&#x02013;69% of HR reserve for the remaining six weeks. Exercise intensity was monitored throughout the 30 minutes of AE to maintain the participant&#x02019;s HR within the targeted range. HR was monitored throughout the session using the Polar HR monitors. After 30 minutes, the wattage was decreased to 25 for a five-minute cool-down period. The participant then repeated the stretching exercises for 10&#x02013;15 minutes. Vital signs and compliance with exercise sessions were recorded in weekly exercise logs for each participant.</p><p>The walking and stretching (WS) program consisted of an unsupervised, low-intensity program. Each participant in this group was instructed to perform stretching exercises for 10&#x02013;15 minutes before and after walking for 30 minutes at a low-intensity of below 40% of their HR reserve. An HR monitor watch (OMRON&#x000ae; HR-210) was given to all participants to monitor their HR during the 30 minutes of walking, and written instructions were provided to ensure compliance with the low-intensity program. Compliance with the WS program was assessed using weekly exercise logs.</p><p>Twenty-eight participants completed baseline and were randomized into each intervention groups (14 in each group; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2055217316680639">Figure 1</xref>). During the three-month intervention, six individuals withdrew from AE intervention (five because of a change in their work or travel schedule and one because of exacerbation of a prior knee injury that was unrelated to the exercise intervention). The individuals who withdrew from the study were replaced with individuals with same disease type and sex. In addition, only participants who were&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;70% compliant with the intervention programs were included in the data analysis (two were removed from the AE group and four were removed from the WS group).

Considering exercise is low cost, widely available, and has minimal side effects when conducted appropriately, exercise should be considered an alternative or adjunctive therapy to address poor sleep quality in individuals with MS.</p><p>Individuals were excluded from participating in the study if they had a known untreated sleep disorder. A large national study found that more than 70% of individuals with MS screened positive for one or more sleep disorders,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> indicating that many individuals in the current study likely had unrecognized and undiagnosed sleep disorders. This assumption further supports the strength of this study that exercise, regardless of mode or intensity, produced improvements in sleep quality of the participants despite the likelihood that many of them had an undiagnosed sleep disorder. Future studies should consider screening individuals for common sleep disorders (insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless leg syndrome<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>) to determine the impact of exercise combined with standard treatment of the sleep disorder.</p><p>The mechanism for sleep quality improvement for both groups and improvement in daytime sleepiness for the AE group remains unclear and should be interpreted with caution because of the lack of a control group. Hyperarousal of the nervous system and a heightened stress response are thought to contribute to anxiety<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and symptoms of insomnia.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Perhaps improvements in anxiety and/or stress are underlying the change in sleep quality. The significant reduction in fatigue that both groups exhibited may also have contributed to the improvement in sleep quality as sleep and fatigue have been strongly associated;<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> however, there was no association between change in sleep quality and change in fatigue for either group. Future studies are needed to determine the mechanism or mechanisms contributing to the improvement in sleep quality and daytime sleepiness.</p><p>The improvement in daytime sleepiness for the AE group but not the WS group may be due to a large effect (although nonsignificant) of the AE program on improving cardiorespiratory fitness compared to the WS program. A study by Reid et&#x000a0;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> found a near significant relationship (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.058) between improvement in sleep quality and improvement in fitness level determined by maximum HR for a group of older adults with insomnia who participated in a 16-week aerobic exercise program. Although Reid et&#x000a0;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> report the aerobic group experienced a significant reduction in daytime sleepiness, they unfortunately did not report the correlation between change in daytime sleepiness and improvement in fitness level. None of the six studies included in a systematic review<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> on the impact of exercise on sleep quality in middle-aged and older adults included the ESS as an outcome measure. Our study did not find an association between change in cardiorespiratory fitness level with change in sleep quality or change in daytime sleepiness. This seems to support the assertion by Reid et&#x000a0;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> that the effect of exercise on sleep quality and daytime sleepiness is likely mediated by another mechanism other than cardiorespiratory fitness.</p><p>It is possible that the interaction that occurred with the research personnel and the other participants during the supervision of the aerobic exercise program contributed to the results. In general, supervision and the interpersonal interactions that occur during supervision have a positive effect on the outcomes regardless of the intervention itself.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Studies from the different patient populations have demonstrated that supervised exercise interventions lead to better patient-centered outcomes compared to nonsupervised interventions.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> The effect of supervision on the outcomes depends on several factors such as the supervisor&#x02019;s behavior, interpersonal skills, attitude toward the patient, ability to apply a particular treatment, and their skill to show empathy.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Future studies should balance the interpersonal contact between the groups to reduce that confounding effect.</p><p>Another explanation for the improvement in daytime sleepiness for the AE group could be that being on a schedule for attending the exercise may have served as a zeitgeber for this group and may have contributed to regulating their circadian rhythm and internal clock. Retirement or lack of employment, reduced mobility, and reduced interactions have all be shown to contribute to sleep disruptions in older adults,<sup><xref rid="bibr31-2055217316680639" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and these similar lifestyle changes are also common in individuals with MS. Because the WS group was less constrained by scheduling exercise sessions when the equipment and personnel were available, there may have been less benefit of a schedule on their daytime sleepiness.</p><p>One of the major limitations of this study is the small sample size, which limits the interpretation of the results but sets the basis for future studies in this area. The lack of a control group is another limitation and makes interpretation of the results less clear. Future studies investigating the impact of exercise on sleep quality should consider a delayed treatment design. Another limitation is the lack of detailed information on the medication lists provided by many of the participants. This made analysis of the influence of medication on change in sleep quality and daytime sleepiness difficult. Future studies should assess whether medication influenced or mediates the benefit of sleep on sleep quality and daytime sleepiness as well as determine if exercise changes the need to take medication or the dose of medication.</p><p>In conclusion, individuals with MS who participated in either a supervised moderate-intensity or unsupervised low-intensity exercise program demonstrated moderate improvements in sleep quality. Only the supervised moderate-intensity participants improved daytime sleepiness. The mechanism for these improvements warrants further investigation, but may be due to the introduction of zeitgebers to improve circadian rhythm.
