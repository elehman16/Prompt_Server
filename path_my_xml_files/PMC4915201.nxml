While the majority of patients achieve a clinical remission from this initial therapy, more than 70&#x000a0;% will subsequently develop recurrent disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Immunotherapeutic approaches to cancer rely on stimulation of the immune system to specifically target and destroy tumors. Mucin proteins are promising targets for immunotherapy; in particular, the epithelial mucin surface antigen 1 is overexpressed in adenocarcinomas in an aberrant form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Prior literature have described high levels of MUC1 expression (100&#x000a0;%) in ovarian adenocarcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and in late-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), tumor cells will significantly overexpress mucin 1 showing a significant association between mucin 1 over-expression, histological grade and clinical stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, mucin 1 is a specific and appropriate target as an immunotherapy for EOC, whereby the immune system is stimulated to target and destroy tumor cells.</p><p>A dendritic cell vaccine targeting the MUC-1 glycoprotein was developed (termed CVac). Prior to the current trial, two clinical trials were conducted with CVac. In the phase I trial, 17 subjects (three healthy volunteers and 14 advanced solid tumor patients) were enrolled, the purpose of which was to establish safety and to observe host immunologic responses. Two of these patients had ovarian cancer, with one patient surviving beyond 12&#x000a0;months post-therapy despite advanced disease. Regarding safety, no anaphylactic reactions were observed and all patients measured a CVac-specific T cell response as measured by ELISpot. No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) attributable to CVac were reported in the Phase I study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Subsequently, a phase 2a trial administered CVac to advanced EOC patients who were experiencing progression of disease and for whom standard therapy was no longer available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. All 28 patients recruited were evaluable for safety and 26 for efficacy. All had undergone surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, and 57&#x000a0;% of patients received&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;3 chemotherapy regimens. There were no Grade 3 or 4 toxicities considered related to CVac. Despite heavy pre-treatment, four patients showed CA-125 response or stabilization; two patients with major responses defined as&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;% reduction in CA-125, that were sustained for 10&#x000a0;weeks and 42&#x000a0;weeks, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The median duration was 10.3&#x000a0;months (5.3&#x02013;16.3&#x000a0;months).</p><p>Given the promising results from these trials, a clinical trial with ovarian cancer patients with a low tumor burden following chemotherapy were considered for CVac as a maintenance strategy. Subsequently, the trial CAN-003 was designed as a randomized, multi-center international trial with global manufacturing to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CVac in EOC patients in first (CR1) or second clinical remission (CR2) as a maintenance therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients enrolled into the trial were female&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years old with histologically confirmed Stage III or IV epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who had previously underwent surgical cytoreduction, received first- or second-line conventional chemotherapy, and were in complete remission (CR).

Eligible patients had achieved CR following conventional chemotherapy and were enrolled after signing informed consents. Ethics and Review board details are at the end of the manuscript.</p><p>Manufacturing was transferred from Australia to the US, and as a quality measure, an initial cohort of seven patients who met the study eligibility criteria were not randomized but given one CVac treatment of a total of 6 to 8 injections at four anatomical sites and followed for at least 28&#x000a0;days. This was called the non-randomized CVac cohort (NR-CVac) and they were not included in the efficacy outcome analysis. After the manufacturing characteristics were confirmed to be consistent between facilities, each NR-CVac patient completed one treatment. After 30&#x000a0;days, no serious or treatment-related Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (TEAEs) were reported, patients (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;56) were then enrolled to randomization between standard of care observation versus CVac. All patients who were assigned to receive CVac underwent leukapheresis to collect mononuclear cells (MNCs). Approximately 500 to 800&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10^6 blood monocytes were collected, and if insufficient cells were obtained, additional leukapheresis procedures were performed. The leukapheresis product was shipped to the manufacturer, and each patient&#x02019;s MNCs were enriched using cell separation techniques.</p><p>For CVac manufacturing, the drug substance, DC-M-FP, was composed of three starting materials: the patient&#x02019;s autologous dendritic cells (DCs), Mannan (M) and Fusion Protein (FP) to create DC-M-FP. The structural features of each component were: DCs were differentiated from a patient&#x02019;s peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC or MNC), also referred to as the Mononuclear Cell Product (MNC Product). The MNCs were collected by leukapheresis in certified, inspected and approved leukapheresis units and manufactured under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) conditions associated with cells being fractionated and cultured in the presence of cytokines (GM-CSF and IL-4) to promote the differentiation of MNC to DCs. M-FP was the antigen obtained when mannan was oxidized, to form aldehyde groups, and coupled to the FP. M-FP was composed of two parts; (1) mannan, a polymannose with molecular weight of approximately 60&#x000a0;kDa and (2) FP, a recombinant human fusion protein (mucin 1-glutathione S-transferase) with a molecular weight of approximately 38&#x000a0;kDa which was composed of two distinct moieties of a 110 amino acid fragment (12&#x000a0;kDa) of the mucin 1 protein, which was derived from the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) region of the mucin 1 protein; and a glutathione S-transferase, a 26&#x000a0;kDa protein.</p><p>The patient&#x02019;s cells were cultured for 5&#x000a0;days with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 to cultivate the maturation of MNCs to DCs. The culture was treated overnight with the antigen, M-FP, to arm the DCs to the specific mucin 1 antigen creating the DC-M-FP. After washing and formulating in HSA and DMSO at an approximate concentration of 60&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10^6 DCs/mL, the vials then contained CVac. CVac was cryopreserved and stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen at the manufacturing facility until required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Patients were given 10 doses of CVac, with the first 7 doses administered every 4&#x000a0;weeks and then the last 3 doses administered every 8&#x000a0;weeks. Patients in the SOC group did not undergo leukapheresis nor interventional treatment, but attended the same visit schedule as treated patients.</p><p>Patients who completed the first 56&#x000a0;weeks of the study (10 doses of CVac) without disease progression continued to be followed every 12&#x000a0;weeks for an additional 48&#x000a0;weeks until an end-of-study (EOS) PFS visit. All patients were followed for survival until the study closed.</p><p>A total of 60 patients were originally planned for recruitment for this study.

Some will argue that the availability of multiple lines of subsequent therapies and cross-over effect may account for this observation. The only randomized phase 3 trial to show an preliminary OS benefit to date with a multi-targeted anti-VEGF agent (cediranib) is ICON-6, in the recurrent platinum-sensitive setting. There are also phase 3 trials in the concurrent and/or switch-maintenance setting with poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) in the high-grade serous and endometriod histological sub-groups; these trials are ongoing or awaiting maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As we move into the era of immuno-oncology we are hopeful that a clearly demonstrable OS benefit is finally within grasp in the near future.</p><p>This trial evaluated CVac, a DC immunotherapeutic approach targeting mucin 1 in EOC. EOC patients in first and second clinical remission had immune systems that elicited a cellular, mucin 1 specific T cell response and not a humoral response to treatment. CVac was well tolerated and safe with the majority of TEAE as grade 1&#x02013;2 with similar distribution in both groups (fatigue, abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea).</p><p>Although this study was designed as an exploratory phase 2 trial, overall we found patients treated with CVac compared to observation had no improvement in PFS or OS. However, in the sub-group analysis, patients in CR2 treated with the dendritic cell vaccine, CVac, showed an improvement in both PFS and OS. Additionally, we observed the PFS curves in CR2 patients to have a typical shape in cancer immunotherapy. First, there was the classic delayed effect with no difference between treatment arms during the first 4&#x02013;5 months of the study. Then, we observed a significant &#x0201c;long tail&#x0201d; indicating that the CVac patients who may have responded stayed in remission for an extended time. Notably, this study was small, with inherent biases of a randomized phase 2 trial; therefore a larger phase 3 trial is required to be more definitive.</p><p>To explain the survival differences observed between CR1 and CR2 patients with maintenance CVac, we hypothesized that the CR2 group of patients was a much more homogenous group, and all likely primary platinum sensitive. We noted a 22&#x000a0;% primary platinum resistance in the CR1 patients. CR2 patients may have represented a better prognostic group overall and perhaps responded more likely to immunotherapy as a maintenance strategy. Neither Provenge nor Yervoy (two approved immunotherapeutics for metastatic prostate cancer and melanoma, respectively) demonstrated a difference in PFS as compared to the control arm in their phase 3 trials; both demonstrated clinically significant and statistically significant differences in OS.</p><p>Several recently presented phase 3 trials with immune check-point inhibitors (largely with anti-PD1 antibodies, nivolumab or pembrolizumab); have shown a significant prolongation in OS in metastatic melanoma, clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (2<sup>nd</sup>-line) and non-small cell lung cancer, further supporting the role of immunotherapeutics in solid tumors. Immunotherapies have become an important part of treating several types of cancer; the indication for which is growing. The safety profile shown with CVac, and the improved outcomes of PFS and OS were encouraging and worthy of further study.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviation</title><def-list><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CR1</term><def><p>first clinical remission</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CR2</term><def><p>second clinical remission</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVac</term><def><p>DCs treated with a mannosylated recombinant human fusion protein comprised of mucin 1- glutathione S-transferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DC</term><def><p>dendritic cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EOC</term><def><p>epithelial ovarian cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HR</term><def><p>hazard ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICS</term><def><p>intracellular cytokine staining</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IFN&#x003b3;</term><def><p>interferon gamma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL</term><def><p>interleukin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>M-FP</term><def><p>mannosylated recombinant human fusion protein comprised of mucin 1-glutathione S-transferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NR</term><def><p>non randomized</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OS</term><def><p>overall survival</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBMC</term><def><p>peripheral blood mononuclear cel</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PD</term><def><p>progressive disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PFS</term><def><p>progression-free survival</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOC</term><def><p>standard of care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TEAE</term><def><p>treatment emergent adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNF&#x003b1;</term><def><p>tumor necrosis factor alpha</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ULN</term><def><p>upper limit of normal</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the patients and clinical research staff who supported this trial.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors (except HK and SG) contributed with patient enrolment, as well as data collection, verification and analysis.
