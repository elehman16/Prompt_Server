Beginning in July 2008, 4747 HIV-1&#x02013;serodiscordant couples were enrolled and followed at 9 research sites in Kenya and Uganda. Eligible couples were sexually active and planned to remain in the relationship for the duration of the study. HIV-1&#x02013;uninfected participants had normal renal function and were not infected with Hepatitis B virus. HIV-1&#x02013;uninfected women were neither pregnant nor immediately planning pregnancy at the time of enrollment, counseled to delay pregnancy until the end of the study, and offered contraception, provided at no cost on-site. HIV-1&#x02013;infected partners were not receiving and did not meet Kenyan or Ugandan guidelines for initiation of ART at enrollment and were monitored and actively referred for ART initiation if they became eligible during study follow-up.

The trial protocol included counseling to avoid pregnancy, contraceptive counseling, and provision of free contraception, without a requirement for contraception. In these circumstances, just over half of women used effective contraception, and pregnancy incidence was 10% per year among HIV-1&#x02013;uninfected women with HIV-1&#x02013;infected partners. By multiple measures, adherence to study drug (blinded PrEP or placebo) was high among women experiencing pregnancy.</p><p>Medication adherence has been low in some studies of PrEP for women.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> However, in the Partners PrEP Study, adherence was high, by multiple measures.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In the present analysis, we found that women with and without pregnancies had high adherence to study drug, as measured both by pill counts and detection of tenofovir in plasma. Because women in PrEP trials have been encouraged to delay pregnancy and counseled about unclear safety data for tenofovir use in early pregnancy, we explored whether women with pregnancy were less likely to take study drug during the periconception period, but found no difference. These data suggest that women were willing to use PrEP around the time of conception, even in the absence of data regarding the safety and efficacy of PrEP for HIV-1 prevention.</p><p>In contrast to these results, among women with pregnancy in CAPRISA 004, a median of 50% of sex acts were protected according to the dosing schedule of 2 gel applications per sex act. Women with pregnancy were about half as likely to adhere to at least 80% of study gel doses compared with women without pregnancy.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Several differences in study populations may explain these differences. The CAPRISA 004 study required participants to start contraception at trial entry&#x02014;use was 100% at baseline and 97% at 18 months<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>; thus, women with pregnancies in that study may have been less likely to adhere to study gel because pregnancies also likely reflected nonadherence to contraception. In addition, CAPRISA 004 enrolled individual younger women (median age 22) at high risk for HIV-1 acquisition, whereas the Partners PrEP Study enrolled older women (median age, 33) in known HIV-1&#x02013;serodiscordant couples. Qualitative data suggest that higher medication adherence in the Partners PrEP Study may have been partially because of partner involvement.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In addition, although neither trial reported prospective pregnancy intention data, qualitative interviews with 36 couples experiencing pregnancy while enrolled in the Partners PrEP Study suggested that most intended to become pregnant or were pleased when they discovered they were pregnant.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Thus, it is possible that most of the pregnancies in the Partners PrEP Study were intended or planned.</p><p>HIV-1 prevention studies enrolling women from sub-Saharan Africa have reported pregnancy incidence ranging from 3.95/100 person-years in the CAPRISA 004 trial of tenofovir vaginal gel in South Africa<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> to 52/100 person-years in a phase 2 trial of oral tenofovir in West Africa.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> High pregnancy incidence in studies providing access to and counseling about contraception highlights the importance of HIV-1 prevention for women who may want to conceive with an infected or high-risk partner.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Factors associated with incident pregnancy in this study included younger age, unprotected sex, having an outside partner, and not being on effective contraception. These associations are intuitive and consistent with previous reports of pregnancy predictors among women enrolled in HIV-1 prevention trials.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Interestingly, our data did not show an association with partner CD4 cell count or ART use, suggesting that women were not making decisions to conceive based on markers of HIV-1 transmission risk from their partners. Our results do not point to a specific group to target in safer conception interventions but highlight that sexually active women of reproductive age who are not on contraception may benefit from routine discussions of fertility goals and counseling for the best HIV-1 risk-reduction strategies given her goals. Women who enroll in a clinical trial without plans for pregnancy merit ongoing counseling sensitive to the fact that her goals may change over time.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>Limitations to this study include interpreting pregnancy incidence without prospective data around fertility intention. Second, studying adherence to an intervention with unknown efficacy (at the time of the study) with blinded randomization to placebo makes both the measure of adherence and the significance of the findings an imperfect reflection of what delivery of effective PrEP might find. Although this analysis focuses on the periconception period, women having children within serodiscordant partnerships remain at risk after conception.
