Therefore, proteinuria requires immediate and thorough evaluation. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of pioglitazone on proteinuria in patients with non-diabetic renal disease.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>METHODS:</title><p>In this self-controlled clinical trial study, forty four non-diabetic patients aged 18 and more, who had renal disease and a stable proteinuria of over 0.5 g in 24 hour, were studied. All patients received 15 mg of daily pioglitazone for 4 months. Urine protein excretion was measured as a main end point prior to the study, at the end of the 2nd and 4th months of treatment, and 2 and 4 months after the cessation of the active drug. Other evaluated variables included systolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, urea, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), fasting blood sugar (FBS), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) levels.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Proteinuria (mean &#x000b1; SEM) prior to the study, at the 2nd and 4th months of the treatment, and 2 and 4 months after the cessation of pioglitazone were 1088.6 &#x000b1; 131.1, 699.9 &#x000b1; 118.3, 433.9 &#x000b1; 68.7, 416.1 &#x000b1; 54.9 and 646.9 &#x000b1; 89.1, respectively (p &#x0003c; 0.001).

Persistent proteinuria is a manifestation and maybe a cause of renal dysfunction which increases the risk for renal failure in the long term. Therefore, it requires immediate and thorough evaluation.

The only available study is an open-label randomized cross-over study performed by Kincaid-Smith et al. on 40 patients with chronic non-diabetic renal disease in 2003.

Huge costs of renal replacement therapy and its unavailability in much of the world increase the significance of any new treatment which reduces proteinuria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of pioglitazone on proteinuria among individuals with non-diabetic nephropathy.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a self-controlled clinical trial conducted in several private nephropathy clinics from September 2008 to June 2010 to assess the effect of pioglitazone on the rate of proteinuria in patients with existing non-diabetic renal disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> Before the study, ethical approval was obtained from the local research ethics committee at School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p><p>Patients aged 18 years or older were eligible for enrolment if they had a level of proteinuria more than 500 mg/day being stable over the past six months and body mass index (BMI) less than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters). The systolic blood pressure (BP) was required to be controlled (BP &#x02264; 130.85) and stable over the past six months and serum creatinine levels were required to be lower than 4 mg/dl. In addition, patients with diabetes mellitus, class III or IV advanced heart failure, or liver disease (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &#x0003e; 2.5 fold normal rang), as well as those using corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents at least 3 months before the admission date were not eligible for the trial. We excluded patients if they had changed their drug dosing of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), diltiazem, verapamil and statins, which could have altered urine protein levels. Patients with complication after using pioglitazone, including increased ALT levels three times more than the normal level or progression of heart failure to class III or IV advanced heart failure, were also excluded.</p><p>Forty four patients were eligible. After obtaining written informed consents, patients entered the trial and received pioglitazone 15 mg daily for 4 months. The patients were followed up for at least 4 months after completion of their 4-month course of treatment. The primary end point of the study was the reduction of 24-hour urine protein excretion measured prior to the study, at the end of second and fourth months of the treatment and 2 months after cessation of the active drug. The secondary end points included systolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), fasting blood sugar (FBS), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) levels. In this study, we used the Cockcroft-Gault equation as a reliable estimation of GFR. In order to assess their clinical status and monitor the adverse effects, the patients referred to the clinic every two months during the study.</p><p>The descriptive results are shown as mean &#x000b1; SEM (standard error of the mean) for continuous variables and frequency (percentage) for categorical variables. Comparison of various parameters between baseline and different intervals was performed by paired student t-test. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the changes of 24-hour urine protein excretion levels during the study. All analyses were carried out using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). The level of statistical significance was determined as p &#x0003c; 0.01.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the flow of the participants through the trial.

In the only available study, Kincaid-Smith et al. performed an open-label randomized cross-over study on 40 overweight patients with chronic non-diabetic renal disease. They assigned the patients into two groups and observed a drop of 0.24 g/day in urinary protein levels of patients who received rosiglitazone compared with the baseline.

In addition, it seems sensible to design new studies to assess the effects of pioglitazone with different doses in longer follow-up time after cessation of the drug. Therefore, more regard should be given to studies that use direct and indirect measures of variables, such as sex and age, as end points.</p><p>Although there have been no adverse events reported during the treatment, there have been concerns whether thiazolidinediones could precipitate congestive heart failure and active liver diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> We believe further studies need to be performed using adverse events as an end point.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study showed that regular use of 15 mg pioglitazone daily seems to be effective in the reduction of proteinuria in patients with existing non-diabetic renal disease.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>SSh, MM, SS, MA, and BP designed and conducted the study and prepared the manuscript.
