Despite the vast amount of research published in the field of PA interventions over the past decades, little attention has been focused on interventions aiming to increase PA among individuals with MD.

MD is strongly associated with reduced work ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and thus is a major public health concern. There are strong cross-sectional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and longitudinal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] dose-response associations between physical activity (PA) and work ability, as well as health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Despite the numerous known health benefits of PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], young adults with MD are less likely to engage in regular PA compared with their able-bodied peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Approximately 50% of adults with MD are physically inactive, reporting little or no time spent in moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) per day, compared to 26% of adults without MD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, inactive adults with a MD are 50% more likely to report one or more chronic diseases compared to those who are physically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Despite the vast amount of research published in the field of PA interventions over the past decades, little attention has been on interventions aiming to increase PA among individuals with MD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Interventions focusing on PA for those with MD may be particularly important, as there is some evidence that a physically active lifestyle can provide increased health benefits for people with MD compared with the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, currently, PA interventions targeting individuals with MD are limited to older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; therefore, there is a paucity of intervention research regarding the health benefits of PA for those with MD, especially for those who are of working age.</p><p id="Par14">The few existing studies on PA and MD suggest that motivation for PA is high among individuals with MD, and that barriers to PA engagement include accessibility to tailored PA facilities, and they also have a lack of knowledge on how to engage in PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, enjoyment appears to be a critical individual factor for engagement in PA among these individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A longitudinal study investigating motivation for PA, using self-determination theory, in young adults with MD indicates that autonomy, goal setting, surveillance, support and feedback are important factors for improving and maintaining healthy levels of PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, factors beyond health benefits should also be considered for helping those with a MD achieve greater levels of PA.</p><p id="Par15">A recent systematic review found modest evidence for the efficacy of application interventions, that is app-based interventions, to improve the levels of PA and dietary habits for non-communicable disease prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Given that many people have busy lifestyles, but still value access to health-behavior programs that provide advice, information, feedback and self-monitoring around the clock, app-based programs may be an important way to reach certain populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, there is an inconsistency in the academic literature on the effects from multi-component versus eHealth app interventions on health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This raises the question as to whether multi-component interventions deliver equal intervention effects compared with stand-alone app interventions.</p><p id="Par16">Thus, the aim of the current randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to compare the effects of delivering an eHealth program compared to delivering a supervised health program on levels of MVPA, as well as evaluate the health-related benefits and cost-effectiveness to each program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Intervention design</title><p id="Par17">The current intervention will use a RCT design with two treatment groups in a sample of young adults with newly acquired MD. In this study, newly acquired MD refers to individuals who have had MD for 3 or less years. The trial will examine the efficacy of an eHealth program compared to a supervised health program, lasting for 12&#x000a0;weeks, on the primary (MVPA) and secondary (HRQoL, work ability, symptoms of depression, pain, stress, exercise motivation, diet, fitness, body composition and genetic/epigenetic factors) outcomes at baseline (week 0), midpoint (week 6), at the end of the intervention (week 12) and at 12&#x000a0;months&#x02019; post intervention follow-up to examine maintenance effects. In addition, semi-structured interviews focusing on facilitating and hindering factors associated with intervention adherence will be conducted at week 12 and at 12&#x000a0;months&#x02019; follow-up in a subsample of individuals from both intervention groups (illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). All measurements, tests and information meetings will be held at a healthcare center (TWITCH Health Capital, Stockholm, Sweden). The trial will be reported according to Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines for reporting RCT designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).&#x000a0;For&#x000a0;Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 Checklist, see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.&#x000a0;<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic overview of the eHealth and the supervised health intervention groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2646_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Participant flow diagram (according to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2646_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par18">The two treatment arms are each designed to support participants to perform sustained changes in MVPA and health-related outcomes. The framework used in both intervention groups is based on the assumption that behavior-change interventions are more likely to be effective if they use intrinsic motivation strategies and are deep-rooted in health-behavior-change theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, a recent meta-analysis supports the use of behavior-change techniques, including goal setting, self-monitoring and strategies for intrinsic motivation change of behavior, to promote change in healthy PA and dietary behaviors and a person-centered and autonomy supportive counseling approach in order to maintain these behaviors over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The eHealth program</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Short description</title><p id="Par19">The eHealth program is a 12-week, standardized walking, exercise and food photography program, delivered via smartphone apps, with three face-to-face meetings with health educators (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;55).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Design</title><p id="Par20">The intervention framework is based on a recent systematic review concluding that multi-component application-based interventions to improve diet, PA and sedentary behaviors can be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], especially if the intervention entails app-embedded behavior-change techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In addition, individually tailored feedback, based on the participant&#x02019;s own characteristics, and advice is more likely to be effective compared with generic information about health benefits from PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The Acupedo walking app will be used in the current study. The app is the number-one-ranked pedometer app at the app/google app store and comprises several behavior-change techniques, which is important when promoting PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In addition, participants will be encouraged to use an individually tailored home-based training app (three times/week) developed by the Swedish Military. This app comprises a pre-defined 12-weeks exercise program with progressively increasing exercise intensity. Both apps contain several behavior-change techniques: for example, self-monitoring and specific goal setting. Furthermore, participants will use food photography, via an app, a methodology shown to assess food intake in different environments with acceptable accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Additionally, food photography holds promise as an intervention tool to change dietary decision-making and attitudes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">The intervention entails three face-to-face consultations, in groups of approximately 20 participants, held at the healthcare center. The first consultation, held at the start of the intervention (baseline), will focus on information on how to use the apps and improving motivation to increase walking and exercise, with additional discussions on goal setting and other techniques to support behavior change. The second PA consultation, held at week 6, will focus on semi-structured face-to-face interviews concentrating on facilitating and hindering factors associated with intervention adherence. Participants will review their progress towards achieving the goals set in the first meeting by discussing the information recorded on the walking app and the activity tracker. The final meeting at week 12 will focus on encouraging participants to maintain changes by reviewing goal attainment and discussing relapse prevention strategies to maintain healthy PA and other health habits. After 12&#x000a0;weeks, a purposive sample of participants are interviewed about their experiences of efficacy, implementation and outcomes of the app support and at 12&#x000a0;months with a focus on persistent changes of lifestyle.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>The supervised health program</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Short description</title><p id="Par22">The supervised health program is a 12-week standard care health program, delivered by health educators and personal trainers, including one weekly supervised exercise session (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;55).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Design</title><p id="Par23">The supervised exercise program is based on the trans-theoretical and socio-cognitive models of behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The meetings with health educators and personal trainers within the intervention group will have a semi-structured format and a person-centered approach to ensure individualization to meet the needs of the participants with MD. To reduce the complexity of the meetings, a behavior-change model with four core behavior-change techniques (mobilizing social support for change, developing self-efficacy, goal setting and self-monitoring), that are known to be effective in supporting individuals to improve healthy activity and dietary behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] will be used. Although the focus will be on these four components, health educators and personal trainers will tailor the meetings by adding additional behavior-change techniques, such as identifying and overcoming barriers to change, and using a motivational interviewing approach where relevant. The health educators and personal trainers are experienced at adapting interventions to make them accessible to adults with MD.</p><p id="Par24">Dietary advice given to the participants will follow the four-step Step-wise Weight-determined Accumulative change Plan (SWAP) model, which includes the following aspects: (1) limit sweets and snack intake to no more than 100&#x000a0;g/week, eaten during 1 day of the week, (2) substitute regular foods with low fat and low sugar alternatives, (3) gradually increase vegetable intake until vegetables cover half the plate at lunch and dinner and (4) reduce portion sizes by reducing equally from the carbohydrate and the fat content of the meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">In addition to the dietary advice, participants will use a food photography app as described for the eHealth group. However, participants in the supervised exercise program group will also use the social media function imbedded in the app (a &#x0201c;locked&#x0201d; function made available only for this group), which enables sharing and rating of meals; thus, providing participants with social support, which has been shown to be beneficial to making behavioral changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">The intervention will encompass both structured supervised and non-supervised PA including aerobic, strength, flexibility and balance training, and will be designed to be performed at fitness centers with personal trainers, one time per week with a total of 12 sessions during the intervention period. PA goals will be individualized based on each participant&#x02019;s level of physical fitness (VO<sub>2</sub>max), and will further be modified in response to illness, injury or physical symptoms. Participants will be further encouraged to have an active lifestyle with two more weekly un-supervised exercise sessions. Participants will further be encouraged to avoid prolonged periods of uninterrupted sitting and aim at a minimum of 30&#x000a0;min daily walking. The weekly personal trainer supervised exercise sessions, lasting 60&#x000a0;min each, will target compound movements, involving large muscle groups. The exercise sessions during the first 4 weeks will aim at for a minimum of 10&#x000a0;min of PA at a moderate to vigorous intensity (&#x0003e;&#x02009;60% VO<sub>2</sub>max). During the next 4 weeks, time in MVPA will progressively increase to 20&#x000a0;min per session and the last 4&#x000a0;weeks of the intervention will provide 30&#x000a0;min of MVPA per exercise session. Exercise sessions will be 60&#x000a0;min long throughout the intervention period. Thus, lower-intensity PA, such as balance and flexibility training, will be progressively replaced during the intervention period. The exercise sessions will be structured so that they can be generalized to the home environment; thus, possibly increasing post-intervention maintenance. Interviews with a purposive sample of participants will be performed at 12&#x000a0;weeks focusing on experiences of the efficacy, implementation and outcomes of the program and again at 12&#x000a0;months to explore persistent changes in lifestyle.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p id="Par27">Prior to this study, there were no objectively measured PA data from PA and exercise interventions for young adults with MD. A recent cross-sectional study with objectively measured MVPA showed an average of 11.6&#x000a0;min of MVPA per day (standard deviation 25.1) among individuals with MD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A target between group difference of 10&#x000a0;min of daily MVPA, which has been shown to be a clinically relevant increase in activity, was used for the sample size calculation. For 80% power at the 5% significance level, 40 participants per group is required. To allow for a dropout rate of 20%, approximately 50 participants in each group will be required. Therefore, adopting a conservative approach, the final target sample size will be 55 participants in each treatment arm.</p><p id="Par28">For the qualitative parts of this study, an estimated purposive sample is recruited.

Transcribed data is analyzed according to the steps of GT focusing on the efficacy, implementation and outcomes of the programs and participants&#x02019; experiences of persistent lifestyle changes. Also, situational analysis (SA) may be applied; a method evolving from traditional GT. This analysis mainly follows the steps of GT, but SA allows the researcher to identify variations between the discourses and illustrate the socially and time-bound constructions that these discourses are used within. By using SA, three approaches (situational, social world/arena and positional maps) may be applied separately or together so as to communicate the variations in discourses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par54">The overall aim of the current intervention is to examine the efficacy of an eHealth program compared to a standard care supervised health program to support adults with MD to increase levels of PA and improve health-related behaviors.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Significance</title><p id="Par55">There is a lack of RCTs investigating effective ways to increase levels of PA in young adults with MD. Increased levels of PA among this physically inactive population have the potential to substantially improve health-related outcomes, possibly more so than in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The few existing studies suggest that motivation for PA and sports participation is high among individuals with MD and that barriers to PA engagement include accessibility to tailored PA, and most importantly, a lack of knowledge on how to engage in PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The current project aims to fill this gap in knowledge by examining effective and feasible methods to adopt a healthy and active lifestyle for young adults with MD by combining quantitative and qualitative methods. App-based programs are low-cost compared to physical trainers/health coaches. Also, app-based programs can reach most people, as most people in Sweden have smartphones with app-based abilities, while many people may lack money and/or access to physical trainers/health coaches. If a low-cost app-based program can effectively increase short- and long-term levels of PA, then large-scale implementation using apps within rehabilitation and medical centers, as well as workplace settings, is possible within a few years; thus, fundamentally changing general PA counseling approaches for individuals with MD. Further, if this intervention is found to be effective, there are great possibilities to implement the eHealth program to many other groups of inactive people within the population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par56">Requiting participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec31"><p>
